14778,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artmarket-com-kept-promise-confirms-064500754.html,Artmarket.com has kept its promise and confirms the successful deployment of its new Artprice Artists Homepages  with already promising uptake stats and an excellent outlook for 2023 as we progress toward the grail of art valuation.,Our new version of 800 000 Artists' Homepages from the 4th century to the present day  bolsters the primary and preferred entry points to all of Artprice's...,"PARIS  Dec. 14  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Our new version of 800 000 Artists' Homepages from the 4th century to the present day  bolsters the primary and preferred entry points to all of Artprice's databases and services because artists indeed are the foundation on which the art market has been based since its origin.The new Artprice Artist Homepage: featuring Wassily KandinskyWith this new version ‚Äì the most successful since Artprice's creation ‚Äì Artprice by Artmarket has received enthusiastic feedback over the past two months from a selection of target users throughout the global art market's twelve principal countries. Our beta testing was accompanied by a methodical feedback retrieval based on rigorous specifications designed by the team of external consultants involved in the complete overhaul of Artprice.com over 18 months.First of all  on a short data sample  Artprice observed a very significant increase in visits to its site  as well as an extension of the average connexion time (ACT)  especially on its databases  all good signs for the future of Artmarket.com.Similarly  according to official Google stats for November 2022  Googlebots have indicated that its user-agents over one month indexed 28.8 million pages in the Artprice by Artmarket databases  i.e. 960 000 per day.As a result of this major deployment and the opening of Artprice databases to crawling Googlebots (exploration process)  the number of Artists' Homepages and their works (which are the heart of Artprice by Artmarket) crawled has risen from 0.96 to 2.5 million per day in evergreen content mode (Googlebot user-agent allowing it to execute javascript).A direct result of a well-considered business and legal decision to open its non-paying directories to indexing engines  this increase represents  in SEO terms  a major boost to our online indexation.The consequence will therefore be a very substantial contribution to turnover in 2023 because Artprice by Artmarket.com  as the world leader in Art Market information  has by far the largest number of artists and artworks in its databases  numbering in the tens of millions.Story continuesAccording to thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com:""Any major network deployment on our different sites/countries is never a foregone conclusion and it's always an adrenaline rush for our different teams (myself included) when we switch to such a substantially new version of Artmarket.com. Everything went remarkably well and this new version is now 100% operational.""See the new version of the Artist Homepage: https://www.artprice.com/artist/15079/wassily-kandinskyThus  Artprice customers and members will discover  from the Artists' Homepages  several centuries of knowledge that have been organized for 25 years by the historians and editors of Artprice by Artmarket. In a perfectly intuitive and natural way  they will now be able to immerse themselves in the exceptional and complex history of the Art Market  via a human and straightforward pedagogy that is specific to the identity of Artprice. This will give them a level of confidence  which is often lacking in the world of GAFAs.These Artists' Homepages will allow users access to very relevant and personalized recommendations to pursue their discovery of the Art Market and thus generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore more turnover for Artmarket.com.As previously announced  this change ‚Äì implemented after extensive UI/UX research ‚Äì comes ahead of a substantial price increase at the beginning of 2023 and is aimed at boosting Artmarket.com's revenue.Following a request for proposals with demanding and precise specifications at the end of 2019  Artprice by Artmarket selected a team of very high-level external consultants with references from major accounts with similar processes to those of Artprice. This team has played a key role in the audit and development of this major Artprice overhaul  using a solid UI/UX approach.The quality and efficiency of the work conducted by our consultants have prompted Artprice by Artmarket to extend the partnership to 2023  which will mark Artprice's 25th anniversary.As a result of the UI/UX approach  new users of Artprice by Artmarket will be able to explore a vast educational resource quickly and intuitively via innovative ergonomics designed per the expectations and needs of users.The experience now involves ""Artprice tutorials"" that constantly guide navigation by providing information on the essential points to be discovered. These tutorials represent a highly sophisticated system of signposts that allow the user the best possible navigation as quickly as possible.As a result  customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket will intuitively dive into the heart of Art Market news and will feel like privileged players.We used User Experience (UX) design to enhance the experience of Artprice customers and members as much as possible; to make it as pleasant and intuitive as possible  whether on mobile  tablet  or PC/Mac.Thanks to UX Design  navigation on our site is now more fluid and more efficient. UX Design is particularly sensitive to eliminating the feeling of being lost  and this has involved a careful analysis of the irrational and emotive aspects of navigation within the Artprice universe.We used UI Design (User Interface design) to enhance users' interaction with Artprice databases and services. UI analysis has been involved in all stages of development up to final deployment and will continue to play a role in the permanent monitoring of the public operation phase.Unlike UX  UI is more focused on the visual aspect to attract the user's eye and to encourage Artprice users to remain on the various databases and services.The UI approach has facilitated navigation through all of Artprice's decision support tools. Its primary objective is to attract new prospects and customers  enthusiasts  collectors  and art market professionals. Thus  Artprice has modified its R&D policy by collaborating in a highly selective manner with the very best consultants in the field to acquire new market share.thierry Ehrmann: ""This new policy of collaborating with specialized consultants with fresh perspectives provides a definite gain in time and competitiveness for Artprice which  until recently  has always managed its new developments internally. In this digital century  you have to know how to adapt and change very quickly. Of course  Artprice's original computer programming is not subject to any outsourcing.""The new deployment implies a complete change in our economic model  notably by fully integrating paying advertisers into our databases and services.These are essentially the 6 500 auction houses around the world ‚Äì affiliated with Artprice for over two decades ‚Äì and which now spend 98% of their communication budgets (to announce upcoming sales) on Internet advertising.These 6 500 historical partner Auction Houses actively collaborated over the last 18 months development phase of this latest version of Artprice. They are of course aware that it is in their interest to collaborate with Artprice as it will draw attention with discreet and effective prestige to their future sales. This in turn will generate new recurring income for Artprice via its proprietary Intranet - a real reference tool for Auction Houses around the world for 25 years used to appraise  price and edit their digital and paper sales catalogs.They can now benefit by being featured on the Artists Homepage as a paying advertiser and with the aid of search criteria of 7.2 million Artprice clients and members  be able to promote their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  while being in perfect compliance with European and American regulations on confidentiality and the protection of personal data.Indeed  a 'public sale' is above all dependent on a very precise corpus of artists whose works 'ultimately' form the basis of the catalog of the public sale.On average over the past 50 years  auction houses have spent 34% of their overall costs on advertising future sales at public auctions  regardless of the country or the size of the auction business.As auctions are now advertised almost exclusively on the Internet  pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2022 to promote their future sales for a fee has found the best response with this successful new deployment of our Artists' Homepages.Indeed  the auction houses consider it perfectly logical to spend their future sales advertising budgets (amounting to 34% of the costs of the sale) on the Internet  rather than on expensive and non-computer-targeted newspaper advertising  as the former targets specifically the profiles of collectors who follow specific artists.Sellers of art are willing to invest 34% of their overall budgets on advertising because they want the works they offer for sale to fetch the best prices. Above all  they want to avoid unsold lots which can undermine the value of the works in future sales.In the past  Artprice considered online advertising (banners  etc.) as incompatible with its databases  in terms of readability and reputation. It was therefore a major challenge to respond to the demand from Auction Houses while maintaining Artprice's original DNA.In this new successful deployment  for the announcement of their future sales  the 6 500 Auction Houses will be able to integrate and merge into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket  via the new Artists Homepages and via the alerts sent to Artprice's 7.2 million customers and members (by SMS  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  my artists' page  etc.).It is now possible that future revenue generated from the promotion of upcoming sales by the 6 500 auction houses (advertisers affiliated with Artprice since 1997) will ultimately generate higher revenue than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice's revenue. Artprice by Artmarket.com's plan is clearly to double its revenue by responding to a long-standing demand from its partner auction houses.It should be noted that Artprice's economic outlook is primarily based on incoming requests from auction houses/auctioneers  and not outgoing in prospecting mode  which makes all the difference in terms of human resources and financial costs.The success of this major deployment will therefore substantially contribute to a smooth acceptance of the significant increase in prices of subscriptions and services at the beginning of January 2023.With this major revamp of our website and our economic model  Artprice also aims to reposition artists at the heart of the art market by introducing the production of Art NFTs  which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.This tremendous overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com will also highlight Artprice's proprietary archive of manuscripts and original printed auction catalogs (the largest in the world) dating back to 1700. This archive  in turn  legitimizes its digital standardization of the Art Market and bolsters its position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years.Since 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population to facilitate its development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable  and above all contextualized data.At the end of January 2023 when the redesigned homepage is online  Artprice customers and members will be able to virtually visit all of its ultra-secure document collections  manuscripts  and annotated catalogs. This section is currently being produced and filmed to showcase Artprice's multiple skills.In an all-digital era  this gives Artprice customers and members a unique layer of additional confidence. Artprice has been a Pure Internet Player since 1997 (with its parent company Serveur Groupe  which has been on the Internet since 1987)  whose knowledge and processes are based on a core of hundreds of thousands of manuscripts and original auction catalogs going back over 300 years (and valued in Artmarket.com's balance sheet at 16 million euros). These documents represent the entire History of the Art Market since its birth.Artprice's position as World Leader in Art Market Information has also been forged by our acquisition of a large number of well-known specialist art and art-price publishers  as well as numerous prestigious editorial archives in Europe and the USA during its first ten years of activity (see our Universal Registration Document (URD) filed each year with the AMF).Our new Artists Homepages highlight the wealth and high-added value of Artmarket.com's databases and services. The use of algorithmic AI (Artificial Intelligence) allows the 7.2 million customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket access to highly relevant and personalized recommendations  and it allows them to deepen their knowledge of the art market. It will therefore generate more sophisticated subscriptions and hence more revenue.Artprice by Artmarket in 2023: toward the Grail of Art Market expertiseOne of Artprice by Artmarket.com's objectives is to roll out  in 2023  a premium professional subscription above ‚Ç¨1 800. Artprice  with its globally unique editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity can use the repeat sales method to retrace the progression of a unique (and therefore homogeneous) work through the decades  centuries  countries  and current or past auction houses.In terms of art valuation  this service represents an absolute grail and it will be the basis for a premium subscription that only Artprice by Artmarket is capable of producing  based on its editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity  combined with its Big Data analysis capacity and its highly sophisticated proprietary econometric tools.Note that with just one single relevant request on Artprice  a subscriber can justify the price of an annual 'premium' subscription  which is not necessarily the case for all professional databases.In addition  our new Artists Homepages bring Artprice by Artmarket customers and members fully into the world of Web 3.0 and ‚Äì by extension ‚Äì into the domain of Art NFTs  thereby giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.With cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs  and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. These art enthusiasts and collectors have no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe  which is indisputably the future of the Internet.This overhaul includes  of course  the arrival of Art NFTs  the growth of which is exponential and constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's market-makers  and in particular the majority of its auction houses around the world  now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum/art galleries industry are starting to publish their own NFTs.With its globally unique specificities  Artprice now has ambitions to capture the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs via legitimate and fair market competition.In preparation for this major and successful revamp of our site and our model Artprice and its consultants had the opportunity to conduct a series of interviews and user tests (so-called 'UX/UI guerilla testing') with its historical clients and its new customers and members. This opportunity was provided by the Covid lockdowns since many of our customers found themselves with more time on their hands than usual.thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com  also emphasizes the eco-responsible aspect of Artprice's latest deployments: ""Since 2017 we have been developing processes to optimize the use of our servers by adapting the energy requirement and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers worldwide by 40% in 2022  and a target of a 50% reduction in 2023. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energies.Through its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies concerning new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ""formativity"" (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a 'climatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Groupe Serveur  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture  and the sentiments of our customers and shareholders.Artprice by Artmarket's offer will remain highly competitive even after the January 2023 price increase  with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most comprehensive in the world with nearly 800 000 artists referenced with their biographies  auction results  indices  decision-making help tools  signatures & monograms  and information about past and future sales. In total  this adds up to several tens of millions of inter-connected and high-value-added data logs  all protected by various intellectual property rights.Artmarket.com has been profitable for a decade  so the bulk of the additional revenue will translate into additional net income because under the French fiscal regime  we can generate up to 90 million euros p/a without incurring additional tax charges.Despite the substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best-placed compared with the slowly evolving offer from our competition which offers limited-search annual professional subscriptions (e.g. 150 queries for ‚Ç¨350/year  450 queries for ‚Ç¨975/year and  in the event of overrun  ‚Ç¨2.45 per search). (Information certified by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In the world of ""unlimited"" offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competition's offer is based on data regarding only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 800 000 artists and 6 400 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from ‚Ç¨265 to ‚Ç¨529/year including a range of indices  decision-making tools and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world.In short  Artprice's offer will remain highly competitive even after the fee increase and with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Going forward  our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997 should enable Artprice to generate additional income through annual price increases  justified as required  notably by the constant enrichment of its various databases with at least one million ultra-qualified data logs added every year for its customers. Because Artprice provides its customers with essential data that cannot be found anywhere else.The Art Market is displaying insolent health  with regular records hammered across all artistic periods during recent sales in 2022 and  very likely  in future sales during 2023.Somewhat counter-intuitively ‚Äì given the geopolitical and economic context ‚Äì the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods  regardless of the country  during recent sales sessions. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023 which are the main indicators of the Art Market.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100¬© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market.Artprice had already noted that during the main crises of the past (the Nasdaq crash in 2000  9/11 in 2001  the Afghan war in 2001  the Iraq war in 2003  the subprime and CDS crises in 2007  the negative rates crisis in 2011  the 2019 Covid crisis  etc.) the art market was less impacted than other markets and the economy.Christie's recent dispersal of the Paul Allen collection proves this point very firmly by turning a new page in the history of auctions. It was the first private collection to generate over one billion dollars at auction ($1.62 billion) with five works selling above the $100 million threshold.This new record follows one set by Christie's competitor Sotheby's when it took $922 million from the sale of the Macklowe Collection between autumn 2021 and spring 2022.Thanks to the dispersion of these exceptional American collections  the year 2022 has become an outstanding year in the history of public sales.As we approach the end of 2022  it is abundantly clear that the war on European soil and fears of a recession have not got the better of the Art Market.Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/12/tablette-page-artiste_en.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

14781,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/artmarketcom-has-kept-its-promise-and-confirms-the-successful-deployment-of-its-new-artprice-artists-homepages-with-already-promising-uptake-stats-and-an-excellent-outlook-for-2023-as-we-progress-toward-the-grail-of-art-valuatio-301702098.html,Artmarket.com has kept its promise and confirms the successful deployment of its new Artprice Artists Homepages  with already promising uptake stats and an excellent outlook for 2023 as we progress toward the grail of art valuation.,PARIS  Dec. 14  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Our new version of 800 000 Artists' Homepages from the 4th century to the present day  bolsters the primary and preferred entry points to all of Artprice's databases and services because artists indeed are the foundation o‚Ä¶,"PARIS  Dec. 14  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Our new version of 800 000 Artists' Homepages from the 4th century to the present day  bolsters the primary and preferred entry points to all of Artprice's databases and services because artists indeed are the foundation on which the art market has been based since its origin.The new Artprice Artist Homepage: featuring Wassily KandinskyWith this new version ‚Äì the most successful since Artprice's creation ‚Äì Artprice by Artmarket has received enthusiastic feedback over the past two months from a selection of target users throughout the global art market's twelve principal countries. Our beta testing was accompanied by a methodical feedback retrieval based on rigorous specifications designed by the team of external consultants involved in the complete overhaul of Artprice.com over 18 months.First of all  on a short data sample  Artprice observed a very significant increase in visits to its site  as well as an extension of the average connexion time (ACT)  especially on its databases  all good signs for the future of Artmarket.com.Similarly  according to official Google stats for November 2022  Googlebots have indicated that its user-agents over one month indexed 28.8 million pages in the Artprice by Artmarket databases  i.e. 960 000 per day.As a result of this major deployment and the opening of Artprice databases to crawling Googlebots (exploration process)  the number of Artists' Homepages and their works (which are the heart of Artprice by Artmarket) crawled has risen from 0.96 to 2.5 million per day in evergreen content mode (Googlebot user-agent allowing it to execute javascript).A direct result of a well-considered business and legal decision to open its non-paying directories to indexing engines  this increase represents  in SEO terms  a major boost to our online indexation.The consequence will therefore be a very substantial contribution to turnover in 2023 because Artprice by Artmarket.com  as the world leader in Art Market information  has by far the largest number of artists and artworks in its databases  numbering in the tens of millions.According to thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com:""Any major network deployment on our different sites/countries is never a foregone conclusion and it's always an adrenaline rush for our different teams (myself included) when we switch to such a substantially new version of Artmarket.com. Everything went remarkably well and this new version is now 100% operational.""See the new version of the Artist Homepage: https://www.artprice.com/artist/15079/wassily-kandinskyThus  Artprice customers and members will discover  from the Artists' Homepages  several centuries of knowledge that have been organized for 25 years by the historians and editors of Artprice by Artmarket. In a perfectly intuitive and natural way  they will now be able to immerse themselves in the exceptional and complex history of the Art Market  via a human and straightforward pedagogy that is specific to the identity of Artprice. This will give them a level of confidence  which is often lacking in the world of GAFAs.These Artists' Homepages will allow users access to very relevant and personalized recommendations to pursue their discovery of the Art Market and thus generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore more turnover for Artmarket.com.As previously announced  this change ‚Äì implemented after extensive UI/UX research ‚Äì comes ahead of a substantial price increase at the beginning of 2023 and is aimed at boosting Artmarket.com's revenue.Following a request for proposals with demanding and precise specifications at the end of 2019  Artprice by Artmarket selected a team of very high-level external consultants with references from major accounts with similar processes to those of Artprice. This team has played a key role in the audit and development of this major Artprice overhaul  using a solid UI/UX approach.The quality and efficiency of the work conducted by our consultants have prompted Artprice by Artmarket to extend the partnership to 2023  which will mark Artprice's 25th anniversary.As a result of the UI/UX approach  new users of Artprice by Artmarket will be able to explore a vast educational resource quickly and intuitively via innovative ergonomics designed per the expectations and needs of users.The experience now involves ""Artprice tutorials"" that constantly guide navigation by providing information on the essential points to be discovered. These tutorials represent a highly sophisticated system of signposts that allow the user the best possible navigation as quickly as possible.As a result  customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket will intuitively dive into the heart of Art Market news and will feel like privileged players.We used User Experience (UX) design to enhance the experience of Artprice customers and members as much as possible; to make it as pleasant and intuitive as possible  whether on mobile  tablet  or PC/Mac.Thanks to UX Design  navigation on our site is now more fluid and more efficient. UX Design is particularly sensitive to eliminating the feeling of being lost  and this has involved a careful analysis of the irrational and emotive aspects of navigation within the Artprice universe.We used UI Design (User Interface design) to enhance users' interaction with Artprice databases and services. UI analysis has been involved in all stages of development up to final deployment and will continue to play a role in the permanent monitoring of the public operation phase.Unlike UX  UI is more focused on the visual aspect to attract the user's eye and to encourage Artprice users to remain on the various databases and services.The UI approach has facilitated navigation through all of Artprice's decision support tools. Its primary objective is to attract new prospects and customers  enthusiasts  collectors  and art market professionals. Thus  Artprice has modified its R&D policy by collaborating in a highly selective manner with the very best consultants in the field to acquire new market share.thierry Ehrmann: ""This new policy of collaborating with specialized consultants with fresh perspectives provides a definite gain in time and competitiveness for Artprice which  until recently  has always managed its new developments internally. In this digital century  you have to know how to adapt and change very quickly. Of course  Artprice's original computer programming is not subject to any outsourcing.""The new deployment implies a complete change in our economic model  notably by fully integrating paying advertisers into our databases and services.These are essentially the 6 500 auction houses around the world ‚Äì affiliated with Artprice for over two decades ‚Äì and which now spend 98% of their communication budgets (to announce upcoming sales) on Internet advertising.These 6 500 historical partner Auction Houses actively collaborated over the last 18 months development phase of this latest version of Artprice. They are of course aware that it is in their interest to collaborate with Artprice as it will draw attention with discreet and effective prestige to their future sales. This in turn will generate new recurring income for Artprice via its proprietary Intranet - a real reference tool for Auction Houses around the world for 25 years used to appraise  price and edit their digital and paper sales catalogs.They can now benefit by being featured on the Artists Homepage as a paying advertiser and with the aid of search criteria of 7.2 million Artprice clients and members  be able to promote their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  while being in perfect compliance with European and American regulations on confidentiality and the protection of personal data.Indeed  a 'public sale' is above all dependent on a very precise corpus of artists whose works 'ultimately' form the basis of the catalog of the public sale.On average over the past 50 years  auction houses have spent 34% of their overall costs on advertising future sales at public auctions  regardless of the country or the size of the auction business.As auctions are now advertised almost exclusively on the Internet  pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2022 to promote their future sales for a fee has found the best response with this successful new deployment of our Artists' Homepages.Indeed  the auction houses consider it perfectly logical to spend their future sales advertising budgets (amounting to 34% of the costs of the sale) on the Internet  rather than on expensive and non-computer-targeted newspaper advertising  as the former targets specifically the profiles of collectors who follow specific artists.Sellers of art are willing to invest 34% of their overall budgets on advertising because they want the works they offer for sale to fetch the best prices. Above all  they want to avoid unsold lots which can undermine the value of the works in future sales.In the past  Artprice considered online advertising (banners  etc.) as incompatible with its databases  in terms of readability and reputation. It was therefore a major challenge to respond to the demand from Auction Houses while maintaining Artprice's original DNA.In this new successful deployment  for the announcement of their future sales  the 6 500 Auction Houses will be able to integrate and merge into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket  via the new Artists Homepages and via the alerts sent to Artprice's 7.2 million customers and members (by SMS  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  my artists' page  etc.).It is now possible that future revenue generated from the promotion of upcoming sales by the 6 500 auction houses (advertisers affiliated with Artprice since 1997) will ultimately generate higher revenue than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice's revenue. Artprice by Artmarket.com's plan is clearly to double its revenue by responding to a long-standing demand from its partner auction houses.It should be noted that Artprice's economic outlook is primarily based on incoming requests from auction houses/auctioneers  and not outgoing in prospecting mode  which makes all the difference in terms of human resources and financial costs.The success of this major deployment will therefore substantially contribute to a smooth acceptance of the significant increase in prices of subscriptions and services at the beginning of January 2023.With this major revamp of our website and our economic model  Artprice also aims to reposition artists at the heart of the art market by introducing the production of Art NFTs  which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.This tremendous overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com will also highlight Artprice's proprietary archive of manuscripts and original printed auction catalogs (the largest in the world) dating back to 1700. This archive  in turn  legitimizes its digital standardization of the Art Market and bolsters its position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years.Since 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population to facilitate its development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable  and above all contextualized data.At the end of January 2023 when the redesigned homepage is online  Artprice customers and members will be able to virtually visit all of its ultra-secure document collections  manuscripts  and annotated catalogs. This section is currently being produced and filmed to showcase Artprice's multiple skills.In an all-digital era  this gives Artprice customers and members a unique layer of additional confidence. Artprice has been a Pure Internet Player since 1997 (with its parent company Serveur Groupe  which has been on the Internet since 1987)  whose knowledge and processes are based on a core of hundreds of thousands of manuscripts and original auction catalogs going back over 300 years (and valued in Artmarket.com's balance sheet at 16 million euros). These documents represent the entire History of the Art Market since its birth.Artprice's position as World Leader in Art Market Information has also been forged by our acquisition of a large number of well-known specialist art and art-price publishers  as well as numerous prestigious editorial archives in Europe and the USA during its first ten years of activity (see our Universal Registration Document (URD) filed each year with the AMF).Our new Artists Homepages highlight the wealth and high-added value of Artmarket.com's databases and services. The use of algorithmic AI (Artificial Intelligence) allows the 7.2 million customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket access to highly relevant and personalized recommendations  and it allows them to deepen their knowledge of the art market. It will therefore generate more sophisticated subscriptions and hence more revenue.Artprice by Artmarket in 2023: toward the Grail of Art Market expertiseOne of Artprice by Artmarket.com's objectives is to roll out  in 2023  a premium professional subscription above ‚Ç¨1 800. Artprice  with its globally unique editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity can use the repeat sales method to retrace the progression of a unique (and therefore homogeneous) work through the decades  centuries  countries  and current or past auction houses.In terms of art valuation  this service represents an absolute grail and it will be the basis for a premium subscription that only Artprice by Artmarket is capable of producing  based on its editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity  combined with its Big Data analysis capacity and its highly sophisticated proprietary econometric tools.Note that with just one single relevant request on Artprice  a subscriber can justify the price of an annual 'premium' subscription  which is not necessarily the case for all professional databases.In addition  our new Artists Homepages bring Artprice by Artmarket customers and members fully into the world of Web 3.0 and ‚Äì by extension ‚Äì into the domain of Art NFTs  thereby giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.With cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs  and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. These art enthusiasts and collectors have no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe  which is indisputably the future of the Internet.This overhaul includes  of course  the arrival of Art NFTs  the growth of which is exponential and constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's market-makers  and in particular the majority of its auction houses around the world  now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum/art galleries industry are starting to publish their own NFTs.With its globally unique specificities  Artprice now has ambitions to capture the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs via legitimate and fair market competition.In preparation for this major and successful revamp of our site and our model Artprice and its consultants had the opportunity to conduct a series of interviews and user tests (so-called 'UX/UI guerilla testing') with its historical clients and its new customers and members. This opportunity was provided by the Covid lockdowns since many of our customers found themselves with more time on their hands than usual.thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com  also emphasizes the eco-responsible aspect of Artprice's latest deployments: ""Since 2017 we have been developing processes to optimize the use of our servers by adapting the energy requirement and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers worldwide by 40% in 2022  and a target of a 50% reduction in 2023. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energies.Through its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies concerning new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ""formativity"" (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a 'climatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Groupe Serveur  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture  and the sentiments of our customers and shareholders.Artprice by Artmarket's offer will remain highly competitive even after the January 2023 price increase  with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most comprehensive in the world with nearly 800 000 artists referenced with their biographies  auction results  indices  decision-making help tools  signatures & monograms  and information about past and future sales. In total  this adds up to several tens of millions of inter-connected and high-value-added data logs  all protected by various intellectual property rights.Artmarket.com has been profitable for a decade  so the bulk of the additional revenue will translate into additional net income because under the French fiscal regime  we can generate up to 90 million euros p/a without incurring additional tax charges.Despite the substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best-placed compared with the slowly evolving offer from our competition which offers limited-search annual professional subscriptions (e.g. 150 queries for ‚Ç¨350/year  450 queries for ‚Ç¨975/year and  in the event of overrun  ‚Ç¨2.45 per search). (Information certified by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In the world of ""unlimited"" offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competition's offer is based on data regarding only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 800 000 artists and 6 400 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from ‚Ç¨265 to ‚Ç¨529/year including a range of indices  decision-making tools and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world.In short  Artprice's offer will remain highly competitive even after the fee increase and with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Going forward  our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997 should enable Artprice to generate additional income through annual price increases  justified as required  notably by the constant enrichment of its various databases with at least one million ultra-qualified data logs added every year for its customers. Because Artprice provides its customers with essential data that cannot be found anywhere else.The Art Market is displaying insolent health  with regular records hammered across all artistic periods during recent sales in 2022 and  very likely  in future sales during 2023.Somewhat counter-intuitively ‚Äì given the geopolitical and economic context ‚Äì the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods  regardless of the country  during recent sales sessions. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023 which are the main indicators of the Art Market.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100¬© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market.Artprice had already noted that during the main crises of the past (the Nasdaq crash in 2000  9/11 in 2001  the Afghan war in 2001  the Iraq war in 2003  the subprime and CDS crises in 2007  the negative rates crisis in 2011  the 2019 Covid crisis  etc.) the art market was less impacted than other markets and the economy.Christie's recent dispersal of the Paul Allen collection proves this point very firmly by turning a new page in the history of auctions. It was the first private collection to generate over one billion dollars at auction ($1.62 billion) with five works selling above the $100 million threshold.This new record follows one set by Christie's competitor Sotheby's when it took $922 million from the sale of the Macklowe Collection between autumn 2021 and spring 2022.Thanks to the dispersion of these exceptional American collections  the year 2022 has become an outstanding year in the history of public sales.As we approach the end of 2022  it is abundantly clear that the war on European soil and fears of a recession have not got the better of the Art Market.Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/12/tablette-page-artiste_en.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comfor your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.com Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Our beta testing was accompanied by a methodical feedback retrieval based on rigorous specifications designed by the team of external consultants involved in the complete overhaul of Artprice.com over 18 months.First of all  on a short data sample  Artprice observed a very significant increase in visits to its site  as well as an extension of the average connexion time (ACT)  especially on its databases  all good signs for the future of Artmarket.com.Similarly  according to official Google stats for November 2022  Googlebots have indicated that its user-agents over one month indexed 28.8 million pages in the Artprice by Artmarket databases  i.e. 960 000 per day.As a result of this major deployment and the opening of Artprice databases to crawling Googlebots (exploration process)  the number of Artists' Homepages and their works (which are the heart of Artprice by Artmarket) crawled has risen from 0.96 to 2.5 million per day in evergreen content mode (Googlebot user-agent allowing it to execute javascript).A direct result of a well-considered business and legal decision to open its non-paying directories to indexing engines  this increase represents  in SEO terms  a major boost to our online indexation.The consequence will therefore be a very substantial contribution to turnover in 2023 because Artprice by Artmarket.com  as the world leader in Art Market information  has by far the largest number of artists and artworks in its databases  numbering in the tens of millions.According to thierry Ehrmann   Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com:‚ÄúAny major network deployment on our different sites/countries is never a foregone conclusion and it's always an adrenaline rush for our different teams (myself included) when we switch to such a substantially new version of Artmarket.com. Everything went remarkably well and this new version is now 100% operational.‚ÄùSee the new version of the Artist Homepage:https://www.artprice.com/artist/15079/wassily-kandinskyThus  Artprice customers and members will discover  from the Artists' Homepages  several centuries of knowledge that have been organized for 25 years by the historians and editors of Artprice by Artmarket. In a perfectly intuitive and natural way  they will now be able to immerse themselves in the exceptional and complex history of the Art Market  via a human and straightforward pedagogy that is specific to the identity of Artprice. This will give them a level of confidence  which is often lacking in the world of GAFAs.These Artists' Homepages will allow users access to very relevant and personalized recommendations to pursue their discovery of the Art Market and thus generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore more turnover for Artmarket.com.As previously announced  this change ‚Äì implemented after extensive UI/UX research ‚Äì comes ahead of a substantial price increase at the beginning of 2023 and is aimed at boosting Artmarket.com's revenue.Following a request for proposals with demanding and precise specifications at the end of 2019  Artprice by Artmarket selected a team of very high-level external consultants with references from major accounts with similar processes to those of Artprice. This team has played a key role in the audit and development of this major Artprice overhaul  using a solid UI/UX approach.The quality and efficiency of the work conducted by our consultants have prompted Artprice by Artmarket to extend the partnership to 2023  which will mark Artprice's 25th anniversary.As a result of the UI/UX approach  new users of Artprice by Artmarket will be able to explore a vast educational resource quickly and intuitively via innovative ergonomics designed per the expectations and needs of users.The experience now involves ‚ÄúArtprice tutorials‚Äù that constantly guide navigation by providing information on the essential points to be discovered. These tutorials represent a highly sophisticated system of signposts that allow the user the best possible navigation as quickly as possible.As a result  customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket will intuitively dive into the heart of Art Market news and will feel like privileged players.We used User Experience (UX) design to enhance the experience of Artprice customers and members as much as possible; to make it as pleasant and intuitive as possible  whether on mobile  tablet  or PC/Mac.Thanks to UX Design  navigation on our site is now more fluid and more efficient. UX Design is particularly sensitive to eliminating the feeling of being lost  and this has involved a careful analysis of the irrational and emotive aspects of navigation within the Artprice universe.We used UI Design (User Interface design) to enhance users' interaction with Artprice databases and services. UI analysis has been involved in all stages of development up to final deployment and will continue to play a role in the permanent monitoring of the public operation phase.Unlike UX  UI is more focused on the visual aspect to attract the user's eye and to encourage Artprice users to remain on the various databases and services.The UI approach has facilitated navigation through all of Artprice's decision support tools. Its primary objective is to attract new prospects and customers  enthusiasts  collectors  and art market professionals. Thus  Artprice has modified its R&D policy by collaborating in a highly selective manner with the very best consultants in the field to acquire new market share.thierry Ehrmann: ‚ÄúThis new policy of collaborating with specialized consultants with fresh perspectives provides a definite gain in time and competitiveness for Artprice which  until recently  has always managed its new developments internally. In this digital century  you have to know how to adapt and change very quickly. Of course  Artprice's original computer programming is not subject to any outsourcing.‚ÄùThe new deployment implies a complete change in our economic model  notably by fully integrating paying advertisers into our databases and services.These are essentially the 6 500 auction houses around the world ‚Äì affiliated with Artprice for over two decades ‚Äì and which now spend 98% of their communication budgets (to announce upcoming sales) on Internet advertising.These 6 500 historical partner Auction Houses actively collaborated over the last 18 months development phase of this latest version of Artprice. They are of course aware that it is in their interest to collaborate with Artprice as it will draw attention with discreet and effective prestige to their future sales. This in turn will generate new recurring income for Artprice via its proprietary Intranet - a real reference tool for Auction Houses around the world for 25 years used to appraise  price and edit their digital and paper sales catalogs.They can now benefit by being featured on the Artists Homepage as a paying advertiser and with the aid of search criteria of 7.2 million Artprice clients and members  be able to promote their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  while being in perfect compliance with European and American regulations on confidentiality and the protection of personal data.Indeed  a ‚Äòpublic sale' is above all dependent on a very precise corpus of artists whose works ‚Äòultimately' form the basis of the catalog of the public sale.On average over the past 50 years  auction houses have spent 34% of their overall costs on advertising future sales at public auctions  regardless of the country or the size of the auction business.As auctions are now advertised almost exclusively on the Internet  pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2022 to promote their future sales for a fee has found the best response with this successful new deployment of our Artists' Homepages.Indeed  the auction houses consider it perfectly logical to spend their future sales advertising budgets (amounting to 34% of the costs of the sale) on the Internet  rather than on expensive and non-computer-targeted newspaper advertising  as the former targets specifically the profiles of collectors who follow specific artists.Sellers of art are willing to invest 34% of their overall budgets on advertising because they want the works they offer for sale to fetch the best prices. Above all  they want to avoid unsold lots which can undermine the value of the works in future sales.In the past  Artprice considered online advertising (banners  etc.) as incompatible with its databases  in terms of readability and reputation. It was therefore a major challenge to respond to the demand from Auction Houses while maintaining Artprice's original DNA.In this new successful deployment  for the announcement of their future sales  the 6 500 Auction Houses will be able to integrate and merge into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket  via the new Artists Homepages and via the alerts sent to Artprice's 7.2 million customers and members (by SMS  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  my artists' page  etc.).It is now possible that future revenue generated from the promotion of upcoming sales by the 6 500 auction houses (advertisers affiliated with Artprice since 1997) will ultimately generate higher revenue than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice's revenue. Artprice by Artmarket.com's plan is clearly to double its revenue by responding to a long-standing demand from its partner auction houses.It should be noted that Artprice's economic outlook is primarily based on incoming requests from auction houses/auctioneers  and not outgoing in prospecting mode  which makes all the difference in terms of human resources and financial costs.The success of this major deployment will therefore substantially contribute to a smooth acceptance of the significant increase in prices of subscriptions and services at the beginning of January 2023.With this major revamp of our website and our economic model  Artprice also aims to reposition artists at the heart of the art market by introducing the production of Art NFTs  which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.This tremendous overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com will also highlight Artprice's proprietary archive of manuscripts and original printed auction catalogs (the largest in the world) dating back to 1700. This archive  in turn  legitimizes its digital standardization of the Art Market and bolsters its position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years.Since 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population to facilitate its development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable  and above all contextualized data.At the end of January 2023 when the redesigned homepage is online  Artprice customers and members will be able to virtually visit all of its ultra-secure document collections  manuscripts  and annotated catalogs. This section is currently being produced and filmed to showcase Artprice's multiple skills.In an all-digital era  this gives Artprice customers and members a unique layer of additional confidence. Artprice has been a Pure Internet Player since 1997 (with its parent company Serveur Groupe  which has been on the Internet since 1987)  whose knowledge and processes are based on a core of hundreds of thousands of manuscripts and original auction catalogs going back over 300 years (and valued in Artmarket.com's balance sheet at 16 million euros). These documents represent the entire History of the Art Market since its birth.Artprice's position as World Leader in Art Market Information has also been forged by our acquisition of a large number of well-known specialist art and art-price publishers  as well as numerous prestigious editorial archives in Europe and the USA during its first ten years of activity (see our Universal Registration Document (URD) filed each year with the AMF).Our new Artists Homepages highlight the wealth and high-added value of Artmarket.com's databases and services. The use of algorithmic AI (Artificial Intelligence) allows the 7.2 million customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket access to highly relevant and personalized recommendations  and it allows them to deepen their knowledge of the art market. It will therefore generate more sophisticated subscriptions and hence more revenue.Artprice by Artmarket in 2023: toward the Grail of Art Market expertiseOne of Artprice by Artmarket.com's objectives is to roll out  in 2023  a premium professional subscription above ‚Ç¨1 800. Artprice  with its globally unique editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity can use the repeat sales method to retrace the progression of a unique (and therefore homogeneous) work through the decades  centuries  countries  and current or past auction houses.In terms of art valuation  this service represents an absolute grail and it will be the basis for a premium subscription that only Artprice by Artmarket is capable of producing  based on its editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity  combined with its Big Data analysis capacity and its highly sophisticated proprietary econometric tools.Note that with just one single relevant request on Artprice  a subscriber can justify the price of an annual ‚Äòpremium' subscription  which is not necessarily the case for all professional databases.In addition  our new Artists Homepages bring Artprice by Artmarket customers and members fully into the world of Web 3.0 and ‚Äì by extension ‚Äì into the domain of Art NFTs  thereby giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.With cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs  and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. These art enthusiasts and collectors have no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe  which is indisputably the future of the Internet.This overhaul includes  of course  the arrival of Art NFTs  the growth of which is exponential and constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's market-makers  and in particular the majority of its auction houses around the world  now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum/art galleries industry are starting to publish their own NFTs.With its globally unique specificities  Artprice now has ambitions to capture the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs via legitimate and fair market competition.In preparation for this major and successful revamp of our site and our model Artprice and its consultants had the opportunity to conduct a series of interviews and user tests (so-called ‚ÄòUX/UI guerilla testing') with its historical clients and its new customers and members. This opportunity was provided by the Covid lockdowns since many of our customers found themselves with more time on their hands than usual.thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com  also emphasizes the eco-responsible aspect of Artprice's latest deployments: ""Since 2017 we have been developing processes to optimize the use of our servers by adapting the energy requirement and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers worldwide by 40% in 2022  and a target of a 50% reduction in 2023. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energies.Through its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies concerning new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ‚Äúformativity‚Äù (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a ‚Äòclimatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Groupe Serveur  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture  and the sentiments of our customers and shareholders.Artprice by Artmarket's offer will remain highly competitive even after the January 2023 price increase  with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most comprehensive in the world with nearly 800 000 artists referenced with their biographies  auction results  indices  decision-making help tools  signatures & monograms  and information about past and future sales. In total  this adds up to several tens of millions of inter-connected and high-value-added data logs  all protected by various intellectual property rights.Artmarket.com has been profitable for a decade  so the bulk of the additional revenue will translate into additional net income because under the French fiscal regime  we can generate up to 90 million euros p/a without incurring additional tax charges.Despite the substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best-placed compared with the slowly evolving offer from our competition which offers limited-search annual professional subscriptions (e.g. 150 queries for ‚Ç¨350/year  450 queries for ‚Ç¨975/year and  in the event of overrun  ‚Ç¨2.45 per search). (Information certified by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In the world of ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competition's offer is based on data regarding only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 800 000 artists and 6 400 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from ‚Ç¨265 to ‚Ç¨529/year including a range of indices  decision-making tools and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world.In short  Artprice's offer will remain highly competitive even after the fee increase and with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Going forward  our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997 should enable Artprice to generate additional income through annual price increases  justified as required  notably by the constant enrichment of its various databases with at least one million ultra-qualified data logs added every year for its customers. Because Artprice provides its customers with essential data that cannot be found anywhere else.The Art Market is displaying insolent health  with regular records hammered across all artistic periods during recent sales in 2022 and  very likely  in future sales during 2023.Somewhat counter-intuitively ‚Äì given the geopolitical and economic context ‚Äì the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods  regardless of the country  during recent sales sessions. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023 which are the main indicators of the Art Market.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100¬© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market.Artprice had already noted that during the main crises of the past (the Nasdaq crash in 2000  9/11 in 2001  the Afghan war in 2001  the Iraq war in 2003  the subprime and CDS crises in 2007  the negative rates crisis in 2011  the 2019 Covid crisis  etc.) the art market was less impacted than other markets and the economy.Christie's recent dispersal of the Paul Allen collection proves this point very firmly by turning a new page in the history of auctions. It was the first private collection to generate over one billion dollars at auction ($1.62 billion) with five works selling above the $100 million threshold.This new record follows one set by Christie's competitor Sotheby's when it took $922 million from the sale of the Macklowe Collection between autumn 2021 and spring 2022.Thanks to the dispersion of these exceptional American collections  the year 2022 has become an outstanding year in the history of public sales.As we approach the end of 2022  it is abundantly clear that the war on European soil and fears of a recession have not got the better of the Art Market.Image: [ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/12/tablette-page-artiste_en.png ]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Our beta testing was accompanied by a methodical feedback retrieval based on rigorous specifications designed by the team of external consultants involved in the complete overhaul of Artprice.com over 18 months.First of all  on a short data sample  Artprice observed a very significant increase in visits to its site  as well as an extension of the average connexion time (ACT)  especially on its databases  all good signs for the future of Artmarket.com.Similarly  according to official Google stats for November 2022  Googlebots have indicated that its user-agents over one month indexed 28.8 million pages in the Artprice by Artmarket databases  i.e. 960 000 per day.As a result of this major deployment and the opening of Artprice databases to crawling Googlebots (exploration process)  the number of Artists' Homepages and their works (which are the heart of Artprice by Artmarket) crawled has risen from 0.96 to 2.5 million per day in evergreen content mode (Googlebot user-agent allowing it to execute javascript).A direct result of a well-considered business and legal decision to open its non-paying directories to indexing engines  this increase represents  in SEO terms  a major boost to our online indexation.The consequence will therefore be a very substantial contribution to turnover in 2023 because Artprice by Artmarket.com  as the world leader in Art Market information  has by far the largest number of artists and artworks in its databases  numbering in the tens of millions.According to thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com:""Any major network deployment on our different sites/countries is never a foregone conclusion and it's always an adrenaline rush for our different teams (myself included) when we switch to such a substantially new version of Artmarket.com. Everything went remarkably well and this new version is now 100% operational.""See the new version of the Artist Homepage: https://www.artprice.com/artist/15079/wassily-kandinskyThus  Artprice customers and members will discover  from the Artists' Homepages  several centuries of knowledge that have been organized for 25 years by the historians and editors of Artprice by Artmarket. In a perfectly intuitive and natural way  they will now be able to immerse themselves in the exceptional and complex history of the Art Market  via a human and straightforward pedagogy that is specific to the identity of Artprice. This will give them a level of confidence  which is often lacking in the world of GAFAs.These Artists' Homepages will allow users access to very relevant and personalized recommendations to pursue their discovery of the Art Market and thus generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore more turnover for Artmarket.com.As previously announced  this change ‚Äì implemented after extensive UI/UX research ‚Äì comes ahead of a substantial price increase at the beginning of 2023 and is aimed at boosting Artmarket.com's revenue.Following a request for proposals with demanding and precise specifications at the end of 2019  Artprice by Artmarket selected a team of very high-level external consultants with references from major accounts with similar processes to those of Artprice. This team has played a key role in the audit and development of this major Artprice overhaul  using a solid UI/UX approach.The quality and efficiency of the work conducted by our consultants have prompted Artprice by Artmarket to extend the partnership to 2023  which will mark Artprice's 25th anniversary.As a result of the UI/UX approach  new users of Artprice by Artmarket will be able to explore a vast educational resource quickly and intuitively via innovative ergonomics designed per the expectations and needs of users.The experience now involves ""Artprice tutorials"" that constantly guide navigation by providing information on the essential points to be discovered. These tutorials represent a highly sophisticated system of signposts that allow the user the best possible navigation as quickly as possible.As a result  customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket will intuitively dive into the heart of Art Market news and will feel like privileged players.We used User Experience (UX) design to enhance the experience of Artprice customers and members as much as possible; to make it as pleasant and intuitive as possible  whether on mobile  tablet  or PC/Mac.Thanks to UX Design  navigation on our site is now more fluid and more efficient. UX Design is particularly sensitive to eliminating the feeling of being lost  and this has involved a careful analysis of the irrational and emotive aspects of navigation within the Artprice universe.We used UI Design (User Interface design) to enhance users' interaction with Artprice databases and services. UI analysis has been involved in all stages of development up to final deployment and will continue to play a role in the permanent monitoring of the public operation phase.Unlike UX  UI is more focused on the visual aspect to attract the user's eye and to encourage Artprice users to remain on the various databases and services.The UI approach has facilitated navigation through all of Artprice's decision support tools. Its primary objective is to attract new prospects and customers  enthusiasts  collectors  and art market professionals. Thus  Artprice has modified its R&D policy by collaborating in a highly selective manner with the very best consultants in the field to acquire new market share.thierry Ehrmann: ""This new policy of collaborating with specialized consultants with fresh perspectives provides a definite gain in time and competitiveness for Artprice which  until recently  has always managed its new developments internally. In this digital century  you have to know how to adapt and change very quickly. Of course  Artprice's original computer programming is not subject to any outsourcing.""The new deployment implies a complete change in our economic model  notably by fully integrating paying advertisers into our databases and services.These are essentially the 6 500 auction houses around the world ‚Äì affiliated with Artprice for over two decades ‚Äì and which now spend 98% of their communication budgets (to announce upcoming sales) on Internet advertising.These 6 500 historical partner Auction Houses actively collaborated over the last 18 months development phase of this latest version of Artprice. They are of course aware that it is in their interest to collaborate with Artprice as it will draw attention with discreet and effective prestige to their future sales. This in turn will generate new recurring income for Artprice via its proprietary Intranet - a real reference tool for Auction Houses around the world for 25 years used to appraise  price and edit their digital and paper sales catalogs.They can now benefit by being featured on the Artists Homepage as a paying advertiser and with the aid of search criteria of 7.2 million Artprice clients and members  be able to promote their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  while being in perfect compliance with European and American regulations on confidentiality and the protection of personal data.Indeed  a 'public sale' is above all dependent on a very precise corpus of artists whose works 'ultimately' form the basis of the catalog of the public sale.On average over the past 50 years  auction houses have spent 34% of their overall costs on advertising future sales at public auctions  regardless of the country or the size of the auction business.As auctions are now advertised almost exclusively on the Internet  pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2022 to promote their future sales for a fee has found the best response with this successful new deployment of our Artists' Homepages.Indeed  the auction houses consider it perfectly logical to spend their future sales advertising budgets (amounting to 34% of the costs of the sale) on the Internet  rather than on expensive and non-computer-targeted newspaper advertising  as the former targets specifically the profiles of collectors who follow specific artists.Sellers of art are willing to invest 34% of their overall budgets on advertising because they want the works they offer for sale to fetch the best prices. Above all  they want to avoid unsold lots which can undermine the value of the works in future sales.In the past  Artprice considered online advertising (banners  etc.) as incompatible with its databases  in terms of readability and reputation. It was therefore a major challenge to respond to the demand from Auction Houses while maintaining Artprice's original DNA.In this new successful deployment  for the announcement of their future sales  the 6 500 Auction Houses will be able to integrate and merge into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket  via the new Artists Homepages and via the alerts sent to Artprice's 7.2 million customers and members (by SMS  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  my artists' page  etc.).It is now possible that future revenue generated from the promotion of upcoming sales by the 6 500 auction houses (advertisers affiliated with Artprice since 1997) will ultimately generate higher revenue than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice's revenue. Artprice by Artmarket.com's plan is clearly to double its revenue by responding to a long-standing demand from its partner auction houses.It should be noted that Artprice's economic outlook is primarily based on incoming requests from auction houses/auctioneers  and not outgoing in prospecting mode  which makes all the difference in terms of human resources and financial costs.The success of this major deployment will therefore substantially contribute to a smooth acceptance of the significant increase in prices of subscriptions and services at the beginning of January 2023.With this major revamp of our website and our economic model  Artprice also aims to reposition artists at the heart of the art market by introducing the production of Art NFTs  which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.This tremendous overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com will also highlight Artprice's proprietary archive of manuscripts and original printed auction catalogs (the largest in the world) dating back to 1700. This archive  in turn  legitimizes its digital standardization of the Art Market and bolsters its position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years.Since 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population to facilitate its development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable  and above all contextualized data.At the end of January 2023 when the redesigned homepage is online  Artprice customers and members will be able to virtually visit all of its ultra-secure document collections  manuscripts  and annotated catalogs. This section is currently being produced and filmed to showcase Artprice's multiple skills.In an all-digital era  this gives Artprice customers and members a unique layer of additional confidence. Artprice has been a Pure Internet Player since 1997 (with its parent company Serveur Groupe  which has been on the Internet since 1987)  whose knowledge and processes are based on a core of hundreds of thousands of manuscripts and original auction catalogs going back over 300 years (and valued in Artmarket.com's balance sheet at 16 million euros). These documents represent the entire History of the Art Market since its birth.Artprice's position as World Leader in Art Market Information has also been forged by our acquisition of a large number of well-known specialist art and art-price publishers  as well as numerous prestigious editorial archives in Europe and the USA during its first ten years of activity (see our Universal Registration Document (URD) filed each year with the AMF).Our new Artists Homepages highlight the wealth and high-added value of Artmarket.com's databases and services. The use of algorithmic AI (Artificial Intelligence) allows the 7.2 million customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket access to highly relevant and personalized recommendations  and it allows them to deepen their knowledge of the art market. It will therefore generate more sophisticated subscriptions and hence more revenue.Artprice by Artmarket in 2023: toward the Grail of Art Market expertiseOne of Artprice by Artmarket.com's objectives is to roll out  in 2023  a premium professional subscription above ‚Ç¨1 800. Artprice  with its globally unique editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity can use the repeat sales method to retrace the progression of a unique (and therefore homogeneous) work through the decades  centuries  countries  and current or past auction houses.In terms of art valuation  this service represents an absolute grail and it will be the basis for a premium subscription that only Artprice by Artmarket is capable of producing  based on its editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity  combined with its Big Data analysis capacity and its highly sophisticated proprietary econometric tools.Note that with just one single relevant request on Artprice  a subscriber can justify the price of an annual 'premium' subscription  which is not necessarily the case for all professional databases.In addition  our new Artists Homepages bring Artprice by Artmarket customers and members fully into the world of Web 3.0 and ‚Äì by extension ‚Äì into the domain of Art NFTs  thereby giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.With cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs  and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. These art enthusiasts and collectors have no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe  which is indisputably the future of the Internet.This overhaul includes  of course  the arrival of Art NFTs  the growth of which is exponential and constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's market-makers  and in particular the majority of its auction houses around the world  now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum/art galleries industry are starting to publish their own NFTs.With its globally unique specificities  Artprice now has ambitions to capture the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs via legitimate and fair market competition.In preparation for this major and successful revamp of our site and our model Artprice and its consultants had the opportunity to conduct a series of interviews and user tests (so-called 'UX/UI guerilla testing') with its historical clients and its new customers and members. This opportunity was provided by the Covid lockdowns since many of our customers found themselves with more time on their hands than usual.thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com  also emphasizes the eco-responsible aspect of Artprice's latest deployments: ""Since 2017 we have been developing processes to optimize the use of our servers by adapting the energy requirement and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers worldwide by 40% in 2022  and a target of a 50% reduction in 2023. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energies.Through its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies concerning new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ""formativity"" (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a 'climatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Groupe Serveur  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture  and the sentiments of our customers and shareholders.Artprice by Artmarket's offer will remain highly competitive even after the January 2023 price increase  with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most comprehensive in the world with nearly 800 000 artists referenced with their biographies  auction results  indices  decision-making help tools  signatures & monograms  and information about past and future sales. In total  this adds up to several tens of millions of inter-connected and high-value-added data logs  all protected by various intellectual property rights.Artmarket.com has been profitable for a decade  so the bulk of the additional revenue will translate into additional net income because under the French fiscal regime  we can generate up to 90 million euros p/a without incurring additional tax charges.Despite the substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best-placed compared with the slowly evolving offer from our competition which offers limited-search annual professional subscriptions (e.g. 150 queries for ‚Ç¨350/year  450 queries for ‚Ç¨975/year and  in the event of overrun  ‚Ç¨2.45 per search). (Information certified by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In the world of ""unlimited"" offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competition's offer is based on data regarding only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 800 000 artists and 6 400 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from ‚Ç¨265 to ‚Ç¨529/year including a range of indices  decision-making tools and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world.In short  Artprice's offer will remain highly competitive even after the fee increase and with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Going forward  our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997 should enable Artprice to generate additional income through annual price increases  justified as required  notably by the constant enrichment of its various databases with at least one million ultra-qualified data logs added every year for its customers. Because Artprice provides its customers with essential data that cannot be found anywhere else.The Art Market is displaying insolent health  with regular records hammered across all artistic periods during recent sales in 2022 and  very likely  in future sales during 2023.Somewhat counter-intuitively ‚Äì given the geopolitical and economic context ‚Äì the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods  regardless of the country  during recent sales sessions. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023 which are the main indicators of the Art Market.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100¬© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market.Artprice had already noted that during the main crises of the past (the Nasdaq crash in 2000  9/11 in 2001  the Afghan war in 2001  the Iraq war in 2003  the subprime and CDS crises in 2007  the negative rates crisis in 2011  the 2019 Covid crisis  etc.) the art market was less impacted than other markets and the economy.Christie's recent dispersal of the Paul Allen collection proves this point very firmly by turning a new page in the history of auctions. It was the first private collection to generate over one billion dollars at auction ($1.62 billion) with five works selling above the $100 million threshold.This new record follows one set by Christie's competitor Sotheby's when it took $922 million from the sale of the Macklowe Collection between autumn 2021 and spring 2022.Thanks to the dispersion of these exceptional American collections  the year 2022 has become an outstanding year in the history of public sales.As we approach the end of 2022  it is abundantly clear that the war on European soil and fears of a recession have not got the better of the Art Market.Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/12/tablette-page-artiste_en.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services : https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

14785,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-magistrate-tackling-eu-qatar-european-parliament-corruption-eva-kaili-michel-claise-prosecutor-roberta-metsola/,The crime-writing Belgian ‚Äòsheriff‚Äô fighting EU corruption,Crooked eurocrats beware: Michel Claise is on your case.,Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.One thing European parliamentarians should know about the man driving allegations of Qatari cash and influence peddling at the heart of the EU: He won‚Äôt stop.Also  they might end up as characters in a crime thriller  written by the person who locked them up.Belgian investigative magistrate Michel Claise  whose role is similar to that of a U.S. public prosecutor  was there on Saturday night  alongside the President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola  when police raided the home of Belgian MEP Marc Tarabella. On Monday  as POLITICO reporters tried to find out which offices in the Parliament in Brussels were being raided in the escalating Qatari probe  security officers told them the ‚Äúmagistrate‚Äù was working inside.In a series of raids that continued Tuesday  Claise and his team has secured ‚Ç¨1.5 million in cash and arrested six people on preliminary charges of corruption  money laundering and criminal organization. One suspect is Eva Kaili  a Greek MEP who was one of the European Parliament‚Äôs vice presidents until she was stripped of that title Tuesday. The probe centers on a group who may have used their positions in parliament to promote Qatari interests. Kaili has said she is innocent and is due in court on Wednesday.If others are involved  they would do well to worry. In the endless corridors of the Palais de Justice in Brussels  Claise is known as ‚ÄúThe Sheriff‚Äù for his relentless pursuit of his targets. Perhaps most concerning for any MEPs and aides who may still be his crosshairs  is how much he appears to be enjoying himself. ‚ÄúBingo!‚Äù was his response to a successful raid on another case  he said in a recent interview: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lot of fun.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs this ‚Äúexuberance ‚Äù that makes Claise stand out  said John Crombez  who was Belgium‚Äôs Secretary of State for combating fraud between 2011 and 2014.‚ÄúLots of others in this field are quiet and modest  he is not. And he shouldn‚Äôt be  I‚Äôve never experienced that as grandstanding ‚Äù Crombez told POLITICO. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like an investigative judge entertainer. That‚Äôs fantastic. He just waltzes over everything  and it all comes out of these deeply rooted social concerns. That‚Äôs what makes him so exceptional.‚ÄùA revolutionary humanistClaise‚Äôs biography reads like a crime-fighting prosecutor from central casting. His youthful parents abandoned him as a baby in a basket at his grandparents‚Äô bakery in the Brussels suburb of Anderlecht  he told Le Soir in 2020. He grew up cutting bread before school and scrambling to read as many books as he could. His father never wanted to be part of his life and his relationship with his mother  who is now dead  was ‚Äúextremely hard.‚ÄùHe cites French revolutionary humanist values as his guiding principles. For him  financial crime has destroyed fundamental aspects of society. ‚ÄúWhite-collar crime is the cancer of democracy ‚Äù Claise wrote in one of his books  ‚ÄúLe Forain‚Äù (The Showman).At the fashionable bookshop Filigranes  which serves the EU‚Äôs intellectual elite  you can find Claise‚Äôs novelizations of his own crime-fighting. ‚ÄúHe has two parts to his life: personal and professional ‚Äù said the owner of the bookshop Marc Filipson  a friend. ‚ÄúWhen he is here  he has no phone  nothing.‚ÄùClaise‚Äôs charge sheet is a who‚Äôs who of Belgian white collar crime across the past two decades: it includes local banks Fortis and Belgolaise and insurance company AGF  but also multinational companies and Belgian nobility. In 2019  he forced the U.K. bank HSBC to pay a Belgian record penalty of ‚Ç¨295 million for tax evasion  money laundering and other assorted crimes. Another nickname for Claise is ‚ÄòMr. Hundred Millions ‚Äô because of all the cash he has hauled back for the state.‚ÄúHe did not care at all about the order of magnitude of his opponents ‚Äù said Crombez. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how he operates: he doesn‚Äôt get scared easily.‚ÄùOperation ZeroClaise is known in Belgium for following through on cases  even those that are highly sensitive. His pursuit against money laundering gangs in Belgian football clubs  dubbed ‚ÄúOperation Zero ‚Äù shook up the entire football world  which is deeply intertwined with Belgian business and politics. Touchy diplomacy hasn‚Äôt perturbed him either  like issuing an international arrest warrant for the head of the Libyan Investment Authority because of their alleged links with Euroclear  a financial institution headquartered in Brussels.One of his biggest operations was overseeing the dismantling of encrypted service SKY ECC  which led to the arrests of dozens of drug traffickers and suspected criminals. The bust was the largest-ever by police and prosecutors against drug cartels in the country  which is a key traffic point for cocaine in Europe.Claise‚Äôs dramatic intervention has left the European institutions headquartered in Brussels scrambling to explain why it took a Belgian official to uncover corruption at the core of European democracy. A fleet of investigations is being launched amid calls for institutional reforms  including by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.His character and his public touting of his achievements are very un-Belgian  as Belgians are generally taught to be humble about any individual achievements. As the EU‚Äôs host country  it sometimes feels like Belgium is the David fighting the giants of Russian or Chinese espionage  terrorism or corruption in the international institutions they host.Now  the notoriety attracted by the investigation is giving the Belgians something to be proud of in the eyes of the world. For days  Belgian media have been all over the case  feasting on minute details ‚Äî including how long it took to count the vast quantity of seized cash ‚Äî some of which look like they could be straight out of one of Claise‚Äôs own crime novels.‚ÄúBelgian justice is doing what at first sight the European Parliament hasn‚Äôt done ‚Äù the country‚Äôs Prime Minister Alexander De Croo told reporters in his first comments on the scandal on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThe European Parliament has a lot of means to regulate itself. It turns out that this is largely a system of self-regulation based on voluntary efforts  which has clearly not been sufficient.‚ÄùBut that peacocking would be ironic to Claise  who complained in October that Belgium‚Äôs police are under-resourced  fighting a war against modern  high-tech corruption using ‚Äúcatapults.‚Äù Earlier in the year  he said the Belgian government was ‚Äúon Xanax rather than Viagra.‚Äù Now it‚Äôs the European Parliament he has found dozing on the job.Clothilde Goujard  Pieter Haeck and Sarah-Ta√Øssir Bencharif contributed reporting.,negative,0.0,0.0,1.0,mixed,0.21,0.06,0.73,True,English,"['crime-writing Belgian ‚Äòsheriff', 'EU corruption', 'Belgian investigative magistrate Michel Claise', 'U.S. public prosecutor', 'French revolutionary humanist values', 'Belgian white collar crime', 'Belgian MEP Marc Tarabella', 'European Commission President Urs', 'investigative judge entertainer', 'U.K. bank', 'Belgian record penalty', 'Belgian football clubs', 'Palais de Justice', 'other assorted crimes', 'Mr. Hundred Millions', 'entire football world', 'international arrest warrant', 'Libyan Investment Authority', 'key traffic point', 'past two decades', 'money laundering gangs', 'escalating Qatari probe', 'Belgian nobility', 'Belgian business', 'Belgian official', 'Greek MEP', 'Marc Filipson', 'crime thriller', 'crime-fighting prosecutor', 'financial crime', 'White-collar crime', 'two parts', 'European parliamentarians', 'Qatari interests', 'European institutions', 'artificial intelligence', 'One thing', 'Saturday night', 'Roberta Metsola', 'security officers', 'six people', 'preliminary charges', 'criminal organization', 'One suspect', 'vice presidents', 'endless corridors', 'The Sheriff', 'successful raid', 'recent interview', 'social concerns', 'central casting', 'youthful parents', 'grandparents‚Äô bakery', 'Le Soir', 'guiding principles', 'fundamental aspects', 'The Showman', 'intellectual elite', 'charge sheet', 'local banks', 'insurance company', 'multinational companies', 'tax evasion', 'Operation Zero', 'Touchy diplomacy', 'alleged links', 'financial institution', 'biggest operations', 'encrypted service', 'SKY ECC', 'drug traffickers', 'drug cartels', 'dramatic intervention', 'institutional reforms', 'European democracy', 'Qatari cash', 'POLITICO reporters', 'Eva Kaili', 'relentless pursuit', 'many books', 'fashionable bookshop', 'John Crombez', 'Brussels suburb', 'Press', 'article', 'allegations', 'heart', 'characters', 'person', 'role', 'police', 'home', 'Monday', 'offices', 'series', 'raids', 'team', 'corruption', 'title', 'group', 'positions', 'court', 'Wednesday', 'others', 'targets', 'MEPs', 'aides', 'crosshairs', 'response', 'case', 'lot', 'exuberance', 'Belgium', 'Secretary', 'State', 'fraud', 'field', 'everything', 'biography', 'baby', 'basket', 'Anderlecht', 'bread', 'school', 'father', 'life', 'relationship', 'mother', 'society', 'cancer', 'Forain', 'Filigranes', 'novelizations', 'owner', 'friend', 'phone', 'Fortis', 'Belgolaise', 'AGF', 'HSBC', 'order', 'magnitude', 'opponents', 'politics', 'head', 'Euroclear', 'dismantling', 'arrests', 'dozens', 'criminals', 'bust', 'prosecutors', 'country', 'cocaine', 'core', 'fleet', 'investigations', 'calls']",2022-12-14,2022-12-15,politico.eu

Our beta testing was accompanied by a methodical feedback retrieval based on rigorous specifications designed by the team of external consultants involved in the complete overhaul of Artprice.com over 18 months.First of all  on a short data sample  Artprice observed a very significant increase in visits to its site  as well as an extension of the average connexion time (ACT)  especially on its databases  all good signs for the future of Artmarket.com.Similarly  according to official Google stats for November 2022   Googlebots have indicated that its user-agents over one month indexed 28.8 million pages in the Artprice by Artmarket databases  i.e. 960 000 per day.As a result of this major deployment and the opening of Artprice databases to crawling Googlebots (exploration process)  the number of Artists' Homepages and their works (which are the heart of Artprice by Artmarket) crawled has risen from 0.96 to 2.5 million per day in evergreen content mode (Googlebot user-agent allowing it to execute javascript).A direct result of a well-considered business and legal decision to open its non-paying directories to indexing engines  this increase represents  in SEO terms  a major boost to our online indexation.The consequence will therefore be a very substantial contribution to turnover in 2023 because Artprice by Artmarket.com  as the world leader in Art Market information  has by far the largest number of artists and artworks in its databases  numbering in the tens of millions.According to thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com:"" Any major network deployment on our different sites/countries is never a foregone conclusion and it's always an adrenaline rush for our different teams (myself included) when we switch to such a substantially new version of Artmarket.com. Everything went remarkably well and this new version is now 100% operational. ""See the new version of the Artist Homepage: https://www.artprice.com/artist/15079/wassily-kandinskyThus  Artprice customers and members will discover  from the Artists' Homepages  several centuries of knowledge that have been organized for 25 years by the historians and editors of Artprice by Artmarket. In a perfectly intuitive and natural way  they will now be able to immerse themselves in the exceptional and complex history of the Art Market  via a human and straightforward pedagogy that is specific to the identity of Artprice. This will give them a level of confidence  which is often lacking in the world of GAFAs.These Artists' Homepages will allow users access to very relevant and personalized recommendations to pursue their discovery of the Art Market and thus generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore more turnover for Artmarket.com.As previously announced  this change ‚Äì implemented after extensive UI/UX research ‚Äì comes ahead of a substantial price increase at the beginning of 2023 and is aimed at boosting Artmarket.com's revenue.Following a request for proposals with demanding and precise specifications at the end of 2019  Artprice by Artmarket selected a team of very high-level external consultants with references from major accounts with similar processes to those of Artprice. This team has played a key role in the audit and development of this major Artprice overhaul  using a solid UI/UX approach.The quality and efficiency of the work conducted by our consultants have prompted Artprice by Artmarket to extend the partnership to 2023  which will mark Artprice's 25th anniversary.As a result of the UI/UX approach  new users of Artprice by Artmarket will be able to explore a vast educational resource quickly and intuitively via innovative ergonomics designed per the expectations and needs of users.The experience now involves ""Artprice tutorials"" that constantly guide navigation by providing information on the essential points to be discovered. These tutorials represent a highly sophisticated system of signposts that allow the user the best possible navigation as quickly as possible.As a result  customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket will intuitively dive into the heart of Art Market news and will feel like privileged players.We used User Experience (UX) design to enhance the experience of Artprice customers and members as much as possible; to make it as pleasant and intuitive as possible  whether on mobile  tablet  or PC/Mac.Thanks to UX Design  navigation on our site is now more fluid and more efficient. UX Design is particularly sensitive to eliminating the feeling of being lost  and this has involved a careful analysis of the irrational and emotive aspects of navigation within the Artprice universe.We used UI Design (User Interface design) to enhance users' interaction with Artprice databases and services. UI analysis has been involved in all stages of development up to final deployment and will continue to play a role in the permanent monitoring of the public operation phase.Unlike UX  UI is more focused on the visual aspect to attract the user's eye and to encourage Artprice users to remain on the various databases and services.The UI approach has facilitated navigation through all of Artprice's decision support tools. Its primary objective is to attract new prospects and customers  enthusiasts  collectors  and art market professionals. Thus  Artprice has modified its R&D policy by collaborating in a highly selective manner with the very best consultants in the field to acquire new market share.thierry Ehrmann: ""This new policy of collaborating with specialized consultants with fresh perspectives provides a definite gain in time and competitiveness for Artprice which  until recently  has always managed its new developments internally. In this digital century  you have to know how to adapt and change very quickly. Of course  Artprice's original computer programming is not subject to any outsourcing.""The new deployment implies a complete change in our economic model  notably by fully integrating paying advertisers into our databases and services.These are essentially the 6 500 auction houses around the world ‚Äì affiliated with Artprice for over two decades ‚Äì and which now spend 98% of their communication budgets (to announce upcoming sales) on Internet advertising.These 6 500 historical partner Auction Houses actively collaborated over the last 18 months development phase of this latest version of Artprice. They are of course aware that it is in their interest to collaborate with Artprice as it will draw attention with discreet and effective prestige to their future sales. This in turn will generate new recurring income for Artprice via its proprietary Intranet - a real reference tool for Auction Houses around the world for 25 years used to appraise  price and edit their digital and paper sales catalogs.They can now benefit by being featured on the Artists Homepage as a paying advertiser and with the aid of search criteria of 7.2 million Artprice clients and members  be able to promote their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  while being in perfect compliance with European and American regulations on confidentiality and the protection of personal data.Indeed  a 'public sale' is above all dependent on a very precise corpus of artists whose works 'ultimately' form the basis of the catalog of the public sale.On average over the past 50 years  auction houses have spent 34% of their overall costs on advertising future sales at public auctions  regardless of the country or the size of the auction business.As auctions are now advertised almost exclusively on the Internet  pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2022 to promote their future sales for a fee has found the best response with this successful new deployment of our Artists' Homepages.Indeed  the auction houses consider it perfectly logical to spend their future sales advertising budgets (amounting to 34% of the costs of the sale) on the Internet  rather than on expensive and non-computer-targeted newspaper advertising  as the former targets specifically the profiles of collectors who follow specific artists.Sellers of art are willing to invest 34% of their overall budgets on advertising because they want the works they offer for sale to fetch the best prices. Above all  they want to avoid unsold lots which can undermine the value of the works in future sales.In the past  Artprice considered online advertising (banners  etc.) as incompatible with its databases  in terms of readability and reputation. It was therefore a major challenge to respond to the demand from Auction Houses while maintaining Artprice's original DNA.In this new successful deployment  for the announcement of their future sales  the 6 500 Auction Houses will be able to integrate and merge into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket  via the new Artists Homepages and via the alerts sent to Artprice's 7.2 million customers and members (by SMS  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  my artists' page  etc.).It is now possible that future revenue generated from the promotion of upcoming sales by the 6 500 auction houses (advertisers affiliated with Artprice since 1997) will ultimately generate higher revenue than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice's revenue. Artprice by Artmarket.com's plan is clearly to double its revenue by responding to a long-standing demand from its partner auction houses.It should be noted that Artprice's economic outlook is primarily based on incoming requests from auction houses/auctioneers  and not outgoing in prospecting mode  which makes all the difference in terms of human resources and financial costs.The success of this major deployment will therefore substantially contribute to a smooth acceptance of the significant increase in prices of subscriptions and services at the beginning of January 2023.With this major revamp of our website and our economic model  Artprice also aims to reposition artists at the heart of the art market by introducing the production of Art NFTs  which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.This tremendous overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com will also highlight Artprice's proprietary archive of manuscripts and original printed auction catalogs (the largest in the world) dating back to 1700. This archive  in turn  legitimizes its digital standardization of the Art Market and bolsters its position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years.Since 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population to facilitate its development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable  and above all contextualized data.At the end of January 2023 when the redesigned homepage is online  Artprice customers and members will be able to virtually visit all of its ultra-secure document collections  manuscripts  and annotated catalogs. This section is currently being produced and filmed to showcase Artprice's multiple skills.In an all-digital era  this gives Artprice customers and members a unique layer of additional confidence. Artprice has been a Pure Internet Player since 1997 (with its parent company Serveur Groupe  which has been on the Internet since 1987)  whose knowledge and processes are based on a core of hundreds of thousands of manuscripts and original auction catalogs going back over 300 years (and valued in Artmarket.com's balance sheet at 16 million euros ). These documents represent the entire History of the Art Market since its birth.Artprice's position as World Leader in Art Market Information has also been forged by our acquisition of a large number of well-known specialist art and art-price publishers  as well as numerous prestigious editorial archives in Europe and the USA during its first ten years of activity (see our Universal Registration Document (URD) filed each year with the AMF).Our new Artists Homepages highlight the wealth and high-added value of Artmarket.com's databases and services. The use of algorithmic AI (Artificial Intelligence) allows the 7.2 million customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket access to highly relevant and personalized recommendations  and it allows them to deepen their knowledge of the art market. It will therefore generate more sophisticated subscriptions and hence more revenue.Artprice by Artmarket in 2023: toward the Grail of Art Market expertiseOne of Artprice by Artmarket.com's objectives is to roll out  in 2023  a premium professional subscription above ‚Ç¨1 800. Artprice  with its globally unique editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity can use the repeat sales method to retrace the progression of a unique (and therefore homogeneous) work through the decades  centuries  countries  and current or past auction houses.In terms of art valuation  this service represents an absolute grail and it will be the basis for a premium subscription that only Artprice by Artmarket is capable of producing  based on its editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity  combined with its Big Data analysis capacity and its highly sophisticated proprietary econometric tools.Note that with just one single relevant request on Artprice  a subscriber can justify the price of an annual 'premium' subscription  which is not necessarily the case for all professional databases.In addition  our new Artists Homepages bring Artprice by Artmarket customers and members fully into the world of Web 3.0 and ‚Äì by extension ‚Äì into the domain of Art NFTs  thereby giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.With cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs  and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. These art enthusiasts and collectors have no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe  which is indisputably the future of the Internet.This overhaul includes  of course  the arrival of Art NFTs  the growth of which is exponential and constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's market-makers  and in particular the majority of its auction houses around the world  now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum/art galleries industry are starting to publish their own NFTs.With its globally unique specificities  Artprice now has ambitions to capture the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs via legitimate and fair market competition.In preparation for this major and successful revamp of our site and our model Artprice and its consultants had the opportunity to conduct a series of interviews and user tests (so-called 'UX/UI guerilla testing') with its historical clients and its new customers and members. This opportunity was provided by the Covid lockdowns since many of our customers found themselves with more time on their hands than usual.thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com  also emphasizes the eco-responsible aspect of Artprice's latest deployments: ""Since 2017 we have been developing processes to optimize the use of our servers by adapting the energy requirement and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers worldwide by 40% in 2022  and a target of a 50% reduction in 2023. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energies.Through its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies concerning new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ""formativity"" (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a 'climatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Groupe Serveur  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture  and the sentiments of our customers and shareholders.Artprice by Artmarket's offer will remain highly competitive even after the January 2023 price increase  with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most comprehensive in the world with nearly 800 000 artists referenced with their biographies  auction results  indices  decision-making help tools  signatures & monograms  and information about past and future sales. In total  this adds up to several tens of millions of inter-connected and high-value-added data logs  all protected by various intellectual property rights.Artmarket.com has been profitable for a decade  so the bulk of the additional revenue will translate into additional net income because under the French fiscal regime  we can generate up to 90 million euros p/a without incurring additional tax charges.Despite the substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best-placed compared with the slowly evolving offer from our competition which offers limited-search annual professional subscriptions (e.g. 150 queries for ‚Ç¨350/year  450 queries for ‚Ç¨975/year and  in the event of overrun  ‚Ç¨2.45 per search). (Information certified by Court Bailiff in November 2022 ).In the world of ""unlimited"" offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competition's offer is based on data regarding only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 800 000 artists and 6 400 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from ‚Ç¨265 to ‚Ç¨529/year including a range of indices  decision-making tools and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world.In short  Artprice's offer will remain highly competitive even after the fee increase and with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Going forward  our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997 should enable Artprice to generate additional income through annual price increases  justified as required  notably by the constant enrichment of its various databases with at least one million ultra-qualified data logs added every year for its customers. Because Artprice provides its customers with essential data that cannot be found anywhere else.The Art Market is displaying insolent health  with regular records hammered across all artistic periods during recent sales in 2022 and  very likely  in future sales during 2023.Somewhat counter-intuitively ‚Äì given the geopolitical and economic context ‚Äì the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods  regardless of the country  during recent sales sessions. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023 which are the main indicators of the Art Market.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100¬© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market.Artprice had already noted that during the main crises of the past (the Nasdaq crash in 2000  9/11 in 2001  the Afghan war in 2001  the Iraq war in 2003  the subprime and CDS crises in 2007  the negative rates crisis in 2011  the 2019 Covid crisis  etc.) the art market was less impacted than other markets and the economy.Christie's recent dispersal of the Paul Allen collection proves this point very firmly by turning a new page in the history of auctions. It was the first private collection to generate over one billion dollars at auction ( $1.62 billion ) with five works selling above the $100 million threshold.This new record follows one set by Christie's competitor Sotheby's when it took $922 million from the sale of the Macklowe Collection between autumn 2021 and spring 2022.Thanks to the dispersion of these exceptional American collections  the year 2022 has become an outstanding year in the history of public sales.As we approach the end of 2022  it is abundantly clear that the war on European soil and fears of a recession have not got the better of the Art Market.Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/12/tablette-page-artiste_en.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services : https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

14805,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oxurion-announces-continuation-kalahari-phase-070000370.html,Oxurion Announces the Continuation of KALAHARI Phase 2  Part B Study in Diabetic Macular Edema Following Interim Analysis,Trial Continues with Top-line Data Anticipated 2H 2023 Leuven  BELGIUM  Boston  MA  US ‚Äì December 14  2022 ‚Äì 8.00 AM CET ‚Äì Oxurion NV (Euronext Brussels...,Oxurion NVTrial Continues with Top-line Data Anticipated 2H 2023Leuven  BELGIUM  Boston  MA  US ‚Äì December 14  2022 ‚Äì 8.00 AM CET ‚Äì Oxurion NV (Euronext Brussels: OXUR) a biopharmaceutical company developing next generation standard of care ophthalmic therapies  with clinical stage assets in vascular retinal disorders  announced today that an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) completed its planned interim analysis of the KALAHARI Phase 2  Part B clinical trial evaluating Oxurion‚Äôs novel plasma kallikrein (PKal) candidate  THR-149  as a potential treatment for patients who respond suboptimally to anti-VEGF standard of care for treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME).The IDMC recommended continuation of the study based upon the outcome of the futility analysis. The IDMC assessment included an evaluation of interim efficacy and safety data from three-month data  with a total of 31 patients. Top-line data from the study is anticipated in the second half of 2023.‚ÄúWe are very pleased to continue the KALAHARI trial following the IDMC‚Äôs recommendation after their review of our interim data ‚Äù said Andy De Deene  MD  Chief Development Officer of Oxurion. ‚ÄúThis trial is evaluating THR-149 for the treatment of DME against the current standard of care anti-VEGF therapy. THR-149 could provide an important alternative for the up to 50% of patients with DME who respond suboptimally to anti-VEGF.‚ÄùOxurion‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer  Tom Graney  CFA  added that ‚ÄúContinuing this trial based on the results of the interim analysis is a critical milestone for patients with DME  which is the leading cause of blindness in working-age people. We look forward to completing this study  which  if positive  would enable Phase 3 development that could position THR-149 as an important second line therapy in the $5+ billion global DME market.‚ÄùDiabetic Macular Edema (DME)Approximately 22 million people worldwide have DME  with prevalence increasing due to the growing global diabetic epidemic. DME is the leading cause of vision loss in working-age people  and the market for treatments is currently estimated at $5+ billion.Story continuesPeople who suffer from DME have leaking vessels in the back of the eye. This leakage leads to a thickening of the retina and causes vision problems. DME may cause blurriness in the center of vision  the appearance of dark spots or patches in the field of vision  and colors to look dull. These symptoms may affect the ability to read  write  drive  and recognize faces ‚Äì presenting a significant patient and caregiver burden.Current treatments for DME include inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  steroids and laser therapy. However  while anti-VEGF is the mainstay of therapy  up to 50% of patients do not respond optimally. Moreover  the treatment regimen itself presents a high burden: patients must have intravitreal injections on a frequent basis (can be as often as monthly)  resulting in a lack of compliance and an increase in loss of vision.About THR-149THR-149 is a bicyclic peptide that selectively inhibits human plasma kallikrein (PKal) with an inhibition constant of 0.22 nM. Through the inhibition of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS)  THR-149 prevents the induction of retinal vascular permeability  neurodegeneration  and inflammation.THR-149 is currently being evaluated in the KALAHARI Phase 2  Part B clinical trial as a potential treatment for patients who respond suboptimally to anti-VEGF standard of care for treatment of DME.KALAHARI Phase 2  Part BPart B is the second part of the Phase 2 KALAHARI study  a two-part  randomized  prospective  multi-center study assessing multiple (3) injections of THR-149 in DME patients. Part B is double-masked and actively controlled  with the high dose of THR-149 selected from Part A of the trial being evaluated. Part B of the study is enrolling just over one hundred patients who have previously shown a suboptimal response to anti-VEGF therapy  and where THR-149 is being evaluated against aflibercept  the current standard of care  as the active comparator.KALAHARI Phase 2  Part APart A of the KALAHARI study demonstrated that all dose levels of THR-149 had a favorable safety profile. All adverse events in the study eye were mild to moderate in intensity and no severe ocular adverse events were reported and no inflammation observed. High-level data from Part A of the KALAHARI trial was first presented in October 2021  which demonstrated that the eight patients who received the highest dose of THR-149  achieved a mean BCVA gain of 6.1 letters at Month 3  the primary endpoint. A post-hoc analysis was performed by the masked central reading center in February 2022 based on an OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) biomarker assessment.The masked reading center identified two subjects with abnormalities at baseline  which could impact responsiveness to any medical treatment. Excluding these two subjects resulted in an improvement in mean BCVA of 9.3 letters at Month 3  which was sustained until Month 6  the end of the trial. The Month 6 data also demonstrated THR-149‚Äôs attractive safety profile and its ability to stabilize the Central Subfield Thickness (CST). The learnings from the Part A data were incorporated into Part B through an amended study design excluding patients that would not respond to any treatment.

This new WAGABOX¬Æ unit will supply over 3 000 households  and avoid the emission of 3 300 metric tons of CO2eq into the atmosphere each year[1].Waga Energy (EPA: WAGA)  a specialist in Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) production from landfills  has signed a contract with Veolia  a major player in the green transformation  to produce RNG at the Granges landfill (Burgundy  France). The contract provides for Waga Energy to build an upgrading unit on the site using its proprietary WAGABOX¬Æ technology to convert the gas naturally produced by the breakdown of organic matter into RNG. The RNG will be directly injected into the pipeline operated by the French grid operator GRDF via a 2.5-mile connection.Through this new facility  the Granges landfill will supply 60 000 MMBtu (20 GWh) of RNG per year  equivalent to the consumption of 3 000 local households. It will avoid the emission of 3 300 tons of CO2eq per year into the atmosphere by substituting fossil-based natural gas. The Granges landfill receives 130 000 tons of non-hazardous waste per year from businesses and households. Landfill gas is currently upgraded by two power engines.Sixth project for Waga Energy and VeoliaThe WAGABOX¬Æ unit will be commissioned in the second quarter of 2024  replacing one of the power engines. It will guarantee higher energy efficiency and will supply renewable energy that is capable of replacing fossil fuels (oil and natural gas) for transportation and heating needs  which account for a significant proportion of greenhouse gas emissions. The project will also help to improve the region‚Äôs energy independence amid tensions over natural gas imports into Europe.It is the sixth RNG production project undertaken by Waga Energy and Veolia in France. Three WAGABOX¬Æ units are currently in operation in Saint-Palais  Claye-Souilly and Le Ham  while two others are under construction. These six projects offer a combined installed capacity of 800 000 MMBtu (235 GWh) per year.Mathieu Lefebvre  CEO of Waga Energy: ‚ÄúThis sixth RNG project engaged with Veolia over the five past years proves our common commitment to the energy transition. We are very happy to be continuing this partnership with a world leader in waste management and recovery  which considers RNG a key part of its strategy.‚ÄùGuillaume Dury  Regional Director Bourgogne Auvergne Rh√¥ne Alpes: ‚ÄúConverting biogas captured at our landfills into RNG allows us to save natural resources and also provides a genuine alternative to importing fossil-based gas. As a green transformation player  Veolia seeks to develop practical regional solutions aimed at cutting carbon emissions and promoting sufficiency. The WAGABOX¬Æ technology is a perfect example of this‚Äù.Veolia and Renewable Natural Gas Veolia is now one of the world‚Äôs largest producers of energy from biogas  with 6 TWh of primary energy resources. A world leader in ecological transformation  Veolia aims to maximize biogas recovery in the form of Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) and to increase its global reserves  in a circular economy approach. The Group‚Äôs ambition is to become a leader in the RNG sector and further develop green energy production capacities to help in the fight against climate change.About Waga EnergyWaga Energy (EPA: WAGA) produces competitively priced Renewable Natural Gas (also known as ‚Äúbiomethane‚Äù) by upgrading landfill gas using a patented purification technology called WAGABOX¬Æ. The RNG produced is injected directly into the gas distribution networks that supply individuals and businesses  providing a substitute for natural gas. Waga Energy finances  builds and operates its WAGABOX¬Æ units under long-term contracts with landfill operators for the supply of raw gas  and generates income by selling the RNG it generated. Waga Energy operates fourteen WAGABOX¬Æ units in France  representing an installed capacity of 415 GWh/year. Fifteen units are under construction in France  Spain  Canada and the US. Each project initiated by Waga Energy contributes to the fight against global warming and helps the energy transition.

The IDMC assessment included an evaluation of interim efficacy and safety data from three-month data  with a total of 31 patients. Top-line data from the study is anticipated in the second half of 2023.‚ÄúWe are very pleased to continue the KALAHARI trial following the IDMC‚Äôs recommendation after their review of our interim data ‚Äù said Andy De Deene  MD  Chief Development Officer of Oxurion. ‚ÄúThis trial is evaluating THR-149 for the treatment of DME against the current standard of care anti-VEGF therapy. THR-149 could provide an important alternative for the up to 50% of patients with DME who respond suboptimally to anti-VEGF.‚ÄùOxurion‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer  Tom Graney  CFA  added that ‚ÄúContinuing this trial based on the results of the interim analysis is a critical milestone for patients with DME  which is the leading cause of blindness in working-age people. We look forward to completing this study  which  if positive  would enable Phase 3 development that could position THR-149 as an important second line therapy in the $5+ billion global DME market.‚ÄùDiabetic Macular Edema (DME)Approximately 22 million people worldwide have DME  with prevalence increasing due to the growing global diabetic epidemic. DME is the leading cause of vision loss in working-age people  and the market for treatments is currently estimated at $5+ billion.People who suffer from DME have leaking vessels in the back of the eye. This leakage leads to a thickening of the retina and causes vision problems. DME may cause blurriness in the center of vision  the appearance of dark spots or patches in the field of vision  and colors to look dull. These symptoms may affect the ability to read  write  drive  and recognize faces ‚Äì presenting a significant patient and caregiver burden.Current treatments for DME include inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  steroids and laser therapy. However  while anti-VEGF is the mainstay of therapy  up to 50% of patients do not respond optimally. Moreover  the treatment regimen itself presents a high burden: patients must have intravitreal injections on a frequent basis (can be as often as monthly)  resulting in a lack of compliance and an increase in loss of vision.About THR-149THR-149 is a bicyclic peptide that selectively inhibits human plasma kallikrein (PKal) with an inhibition constant of 0.22 nM. Through the inhibition of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS)  THR-149 prevents the induction of retinal vascular permeability  neurodegeneration  and inflammation.THR-149 is currently being evaluated in the KALAHARI Phase 2  Part B clinical trial as a potential treatment for patients who respond suboptimally to anti-VEGF standard of care for treatment of DME.KALAHARI Phase 2  Part BPart B is the second part of the Phase 2 KALAHARI study  a two-part  randomized  prospective  multi-center study assessing multiple (3) injections of THR-149 in DME patients. Part B is double-masked and actively controlled  with the high dose of THR-149 selected from Part A of the trial being evaluated. Part B of the study is enrolling just over one hundred patients who have previously shown a suboptimal response to anti-VEGF therapy  and where THR-149 is being evaluated against aflibercept  the current standard of care  as the active comparator.KALAHARI Phase 2  Part APart A of the KALAHARI study demonstrated that all dose levels of THR-149 had a favorable safety profile. All adverse events in the study eye were mild to moderate in intensity and no severe ocular adverse events were reported and no inflammation observed. High-level data from Part A of the KALAHARI trial was first presented in October 2021  which demonstrated that the eight patients who received the highest dose of THR-149  achieved a mean BCVA gain of 6.1 letters at Month 3  the primary endpoint. A post-hoc analysis was performed by the masked central reading center in February 2022 based on an OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) biomarker assessment.The masked reading center identified two subjects with abnormalities at baseline  which could impact responsiveness to any medical treatment. Excluding these two subjects resulted in an improvement in mean BCVA of 9.3 letters at Month 3  which was sustained until Month 6  the end of the trial. The Month 6 data also demonstrated THR-149‚Äôs attractive safety profile and its ability to stabilize the Central Subfield Thickness (CST). The learnings from the Part A data were incorporated into Part B through an amended study design excluding patients that would not respond to any treatment.

The electric yard tractors will be used at Amazon's U.S. sites. ""This important electric yard tractor order by Amazon represents a significant milestone for GAUSSIN's revenue growth and global expansion. Amazon's choice of GAUSSIN is a recognition of the maturity of our turn-keyzero-emission solutions  and of our technical  functional  and design differentiators "" said Christophe Gaussin  CEO and President of GAUSSIN Group. ""We look forward to working with Amazon to help achieve their decarbonization goals."" The agreement with Amazon commits to delivering the electric yard tractors to Amazon sites in the United States beginning in 2023. They will be manufactured at GAUSSIN's facility in France  which currently has the capacity to produce 2 400 electric yard tractors per year. The order is subject to terms and conditions  including that it is cancellable without penalty for a specified period in advance of each tractor's scheduled delivery date. GAUSSIN NA is also planning to open a manufacturing facility in the U.S. in 2023 to begin transitioning to local fulfillment. A clean and flexible technology GAUSSIN vehicles are distinguished by their performance and modularity. The ATM¬Æ tractors are capable of towing loads of up to 38 tons  some of which will feature drive-by-wire capabilities. An ATM¬Æ 38T ""FULL ELEC"" yard tractors"" from the GAUSSIN logistics range to transport trailers and semi-trailersA step forward in the U.S. for GAUSSIN These orders represent a step towards expanding GAUSSIN's commercial and production footprint in North America. They follow previous orders from Plug Power and a series of strategic partnerships and commercial agreements in recent months with other North American companies  the first step in a large- scale deployment across the Atlantic. GAUSSIN NA has capitalized on recent U.S. federal and state government initiatives to provide financial incentives for electric trucks in the form of subsidies and tax breaks  the tightening of emission regulations  and falling battery prices. These developments provide growth opportunities for companies like GAUSSIN  by making the capital investment required to purchase electric trucks more attractive than their diesel counterparts. Warrants to subscribe for GAUSSIN shares Amazon will receive warrants without payment for up to 20% of GAUSSIN's fully diluted shares on a post- issuance basis as of the date of signing of the warrant issuance agreement  subject to shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders to be convened in 2023. Each warrant will entitle its holder to subscribe to one GAUSSIN share  subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The warrants  which do not represent a direct investment or acquisition of GAUSSIN shares by Amazon  will have a 10-year term from the date of their issuance after shareholder approval and will vest in three successive tranches based on payments by Amazon to GAUSSIN in connection with the orders during such term  with full vesting either if payments reach $500 million  or upon a change of control of GAUSSIN. The exercise price for the initial 15% of warrant coverage will be ‚Ç¨4.04 (i.e.  the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) for the 30 trading days preceding this press release)  and the exercise price for the remaining 5% will be determined on the date on which payments made by AMAZON in connection with the orders result in the full vesting and exercisability of the initial 15% and will be equal to ninety percent (90%) of the 30-day VWAP preceding such date. The theoretical dilution on the shareholding of a shareholder holding 1% of the share capital of GAUSSIN prior to the exercise of all the warrants (calculated on the basis of the number of shares representing the share capital of GAUSSIN as of that date) would be as follows: 0.80% (and 0.75% on a diluted basis).

14831,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artmarket-com-kept-promise-confirms-064500754.html,Artmarket.com has kept its promise and confirms the successful deployment of its new Artprice Artists Homepages  with already promising uptake stats and an excellent outlook for 2023 as we progress toward the grail of art valuation.,Our new version of 800 000 Artists' Homepages from the 4th century to the present day  bolsters the primary and preferred entry points to all of Artprice's...,"PARIS  Dec. 14  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Our new version of 800 000 Artists' Homepages from the 4th century to the present day  bolsters the primary and preferred entry points to all of Artprice's databases and services because artists indeed are the foundation on which the art market has been based since its origin.The new Artprice Artist Homepage: featuring Wassily KandinskyWith this new version ‚Äì the most successful since Artprice's creation ‚Äì Artprice by Artmarket has received enthusiastic feedback over the past two months from a selection of target users throughout the global art market's twelve principal countries. Our beta testing was accompanied by a methodical feedback retrieval based on rigorous specifications designed by the team of external consultants involved in the complete overhaul of Artprice.com over 18 months.First of all  on a short data sample  Artprice observed a very significant increase in visits to its site  as well as an extension of the average connexion time (ACT)  especially on its databases  all good signs for the future of Artmarket.com.Similarly  according to official Google stats for November 2022  Googlebots have indicated that its user-agents over one month indexed 28.8 million pages in the Artprice by Artmarket databases  i.e. 960 000 per day.As a result of this major deployment and the opening of Artprice databases to crawling Googlebots (exploration process)  the number of Artists' Homepages and their works (which are the heart of Artprice by Artmarket) crawled has risen from 0.96 to 2.5 million per day in evergreen content mode (Googlebot user-agent allowing it to execute javascript).A direct result of a well-considered business and legal decision to open its non-paying directories to indexing engines  this increase represents  in SEO terms  a major boost to our online indexation.The consequence will therefore be a very substantial contribution to turnover in 2023 because Artprice by Artmarket.com  as the world leader in Art Market information  has by far the largest number of artists and artworks in its databases  numbering in the tens of millions.Story continuesAccording to thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com:""Any major network deployment on our different sites/countries is never a foregone conclusion and it's always an adrenaline rush for our different teams (myself included) when we switch to such a substantially new version of Artmarket.com. Everything went remarkably well and this new version is now 100% operational.""See the new version of the Artist Homepage: https://www.artprice.com/artist/15079/wassily-kandinskyThus  Artprice customers and members will discover  from the Artists' Homepages  several centuries of knowledge that have been organized for 25 years by the historians and editors of Artprice by Artmarket. In a perfectly intuitive and natural way  they will now be able to immerse themselves in the exceptional and complex history of the Art Market  via a human and straightforward pedagogy that is specific to the identity of Artprice. This will give them a level of confidence  which is often lacking in the world of GAFAs.These Artists' Homepages will allow users access to very relevant and personalized recommendations to pursue their discovery of the Art Market and thus generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore more turnover for Artmarket.com.As previously announced  this change ‚Äì implemented after extensive UI/UX research ‚Äì comes ahead of a substantial price increase at the beginning of 2023 and is aimed at boosting Artmarket.com's revenue.Following a request for proposals with demanding and precise specifications at the end of 2019  Artprice by Artmarket selected a team of very high-level external consultants with references from major accounts with similar processes to those of Artprice. This team has played a key role in the audit and development of this major Artprice overhaul  using a solid UI/UX approach.The quality and efficiency of the work conducted by our consultants have prompted Artprice by Artmarket to extend the partnership to 2023  which will mark Artprice's 25th anniversary.As a result of the UI/UX approach  new users of Artprice by Artmarket will be able to explore a vast educational resource quickly and intuitively via innovative ergonomics designed per the expectations and needs of users.The experience now involves ""Artprice tutorials"" that constantly guide navigation by providing information on the essential points to be discovered. These tutorials represent a highly sophisticated system of signposts that allow the user the best possible navigation as quickly as possible.As a result  customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket will intuitively dive into the heart of Art Market news and will feel like privileged players.We used User Experience (UX) design to enhance the experience of Artprice customers and members as much as possible; to make it as pleasant and intuitive as possible  whether on mobile  tablet  or PC/Mac.Thanks to UX Design  navigation on our site is now more fluid and more efficient. UX Design is particularly sensitive to eliminating the feeling of being lost  and this has involved a careful analysis of the irrational and emotive aspects of navigation within the Artprice universe.We used UI Design (User Interface design) to enhance users' interaction with Artprice databases and services. UI analysis has been involved in all stages of development up to final deployment and will continue to play a role in the permanent monitoring of the public operation phase.Unlike UX  UI is more focused on the visual aspect to attract the user's eye and to encourage Artprice users to remain on the various databases and services.The UI approach has facilitated navigation through all of Artprice's decision support tools. Its primary objective is to attract new prospects and customers  enthusiasts  collectors  and art market professionals. Thus  Artprice has modified its R&D policy by collaborating in a highly selective manner with the very best consultants in the field to acquire new market share.thierry Ehrmann: ""This new policy of collaborating with specialized consultants with fresh perspectives provides a definite gain in time and competitiveness for Artprice which  until recently  has always managed its new developments internally. In this digital century  you have to know how to adapt and change very quickly. Of course  Artprice's original computer programming is not subject to any outsourcing.""The new deployment implies a complete change in our economic model  notably by fully integrating paying advertisers into our databases and services.These are essentially the 6 500 auction houses around the world ‚Äì affiliated with Artprice for over two decades ‚Äì and which now spend 98% of their communication budgets (to announce upcoming sales) on Internet advertising.These 6 500 historical partner Auction Houses actively collaborated over the last 18 months development phase of this latest version of Artprice. They are of course aware that it is in their interest to collaborate with Artprice as it will draw attention with discreet and effective prestige to their future sales. This in turn will generate new recurring income for Artprice via its proprietary Intranet - a real reference tool for Auction Houses around the world for 25 years used to appraise  price and edit their digital and paper sales catalogs.They can now benefit by being featured on the Artists Homepage as a paying advertiser and with the aid of search criteria of 7.2 million Artprice clients and members  be able to promote their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  while being in perfect compliance with European and American regulations on confidentiality and the protection of personal data.Indeed  a 'public sale' is above all dependent on a very precise corpus of artists whose works 'ultimately' form the basis of the catalog of the public sale.On average over the past 50 years  auction houses have spent 34% of their overall costs on advertising future sales at public auctions  regardless of the country or the size of the auction business.As auctions are now advertised almost exclusively on the Internet  pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2022 to promote their future sales for a fee has found the best response with this successful new deployment of our Artists' Homepages.Indeed  the auction houses consider it perfectly logical to spend their future sales advertising budgets (amounting to 34% of the costs of the sale) on the Internet  rather than on expensive and non-computer-targeted newspaper advertising  as the former targets specifically the profiles of collectors who follow specific artists.Sellers of art are willing to invest 34% of their overall budgets on advertising because they want the works they offer for sale to fetch the best prices. Above all  they want to avoid unsold lots which can undermine the value of the works in future sales.In the past  Artprice considered online advertising (banners  etc.) as incompatible with its databases  in terms of readability and reputation. It was therefore a major challenge to respond to the demand from Auction Houses while maintaining Artprice's original DNA.In this new successful deployment  for the announcement of their future sales  the 6 500 Auction Houses will be able to integrate and merge into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket  via the new Artists Homepages and via the alerts sent to Artprice's 7.2 million customers and members (by SMS  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  my artists' page  etc.).It is now possible that future revenue generated from the promotion of upcoming sales by the 6 500 auction houses (advertisers affiliated with Artprice since 1997) will ultimately generate higher revenue than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice's revenue. Artprice by Artmarket.com's plan is clearly to double its revenue by responding to a long-standing demand from its partner auction houses.It should be noted that Artprice's economic outlook is primarily based on incoming requests from auction houses/auctioneers  and not outgoing in prospecting mode  which makes all the difference in terms of human resources and financial costs.The success of this major deployment will therefore substantially contribute to a smooth acceptance of the significant increase in prices of subscriptions and services at the beginning of January 2023.With this major revamp of our website and our economic model  Artprice also aims to reposition artists at the heart of the art market by introducing the production of Art NFTs  which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.This tremendous overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com will also highlight Artprice's proprietary archive of manuscripts and original printed auction catalogs (the largest in the world) dating back to 1700. This archive  in turn  legitimizes its digital standardization of the Art Market and bolsters its position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years.Since 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population to facilitate its development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable  and above all contextualized data.At the end of January 2023 when the redesigned homepage is online  Artprice customers and members will be able to virtually visit all of its ultra-secure document collections  manuscripts  and annotated catalogs. This section is currently being produced and filmed to showcase Artprice's multiple skills.In an all-digital era  this gives Artprice customers and members a unique layer of additional confidence. Artprice has been a Pure Internet Player since 1997 (with its parent company Serveur Groupe  which has been on the Internet since 1987)  whose knowledge and processes are based on a core of hundreds of thousands of manuscripts and original auction catalogs going back over 300 years (and valued in Artmarket.com's balance sheet at 16 million euros). These documents represent the entire History of the Art Market since its birth.Artprice's position as World Leader in Art Market Information has also been forged by our acquisition of a large number of well-known specialist art and art-price publishers  as well as numerous prestigious editorial archives in Europe and the USA during its first ten years of activity (see our Universal Registration Document (URD) filed each year with the AMF).Our new Artists Homepages highlight the wealth and high-added value of Artmarket.com's databases and services. The use of algorithmic AI (Artificial Intelligence) allows the 7.2 million customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket access to highly relevant and personalized recommendations  and it allows them to deepen their knowledge of the art market. It will therefore generate more sophisticated subscriptions and hence more revenue.Artprice by Artmarket in 2023: toward the Grail of Art Market expertiseOne of Artprice by Artmarket.com's objectives is to roll out  in 2023  a premium professional subscription above ‚Ç¨1 800. Artprice  with its globally unique editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity can use the repeat sales method to retrace the progression of a unique (and therefore homogeneous) work through the decades  centuries  countries  and current or past auction houses.In terms of art valuation  this service represents an absolute grail and it will be the basis for a premium subscription that only Artprice by Artmarket is capable of producing  based on its editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity  combined with its Big Data analysis capacity and its highly sophisticated proprietary econometric tools.Note that with just one single relevant request on Artprice  a subscriber can justify the price of an annual 'premium' subscription  which is not necessarily the case for all professional databases.In addition  our new Artists Homepages bring Artprice by Artmarket customers and members fully into the world of Web 3.0 and ‚Äì by extension ‚Äì into the domain of Art NFTs  thereby giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.With cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs  and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. These art enthusiasts and collectors have no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe  which is indisputably the future of the Internet.This overhaul includes  of course  the arrival of Art NFTs  the growth of which is exponential and constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's market-makers  and in particular the majority of its auction houses around the world  now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum/art galleries industry are starting to publish their own NFTs.With its globally unique specificities  Artprice now has ambitions to capture the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs via legitimate and fair market competition.In preparation for this major and successful revamp of our site and our model Artprice and its consultants had the opportunity to conduct a series of interviews and user tests (so-called 'UX/UI guerilla testing') with its historical clients and its new customers and members. This opportunity was provided by the Covid lockdowns since many of our customers found themselves with more time on their hands than usual.thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com  also emphasizes the eco-responsible aspect of Artprice's latest deployments: ""Since 2017 we have been developing processes to optimize the use of our servers by adapting the energy requirement and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers worldwide by 40% in 2022  and a target of a 50% reduction in 2023. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energies.Through its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies concerning new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ""formativity"" (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a 'climatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Groupe Serveur  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture  and the sentiments of our customers and shareholders.Artprice by Artmarket's offer will remain highly competitive even after the January 2023 price increase  with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most comprehensive in the world with nearly 800 000 artists referenced with their biographies  auction results  indices  decision-making help tools  signatures & monograms  and information about past and future sales. In total  this adds up to several tens of millions of inter-connected and high-value-added data logs  all protected by various intellectual property rights.Artmarket.com has been profitable for a decade  so the bulk of the additional revenue will translate into additional net income because under the French fiscal regime  we can generate up to 90 million euros p/a without incurring additional tax charges.Despite the substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best-placed compared with the slowly evolving offer from our competition which offers limited-search annual professional subscriptions (e.g. 150 queries for ‚Ç¨350/year  450 queries for ‚Ç¨975/year and  in the event of overrun  ‚Ç¨2.45 per search). (Information certified by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In the world of ""unlimited"" offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competition's offer is based on data regarding only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 800 000 artists and 6 400 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from ‚Ç¨265 to ‚Ç¨529/year including a range of indices  decision-making tools and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world.In short  Artprice's offer will remain highly competitive even after the fee increase and with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Going forward  our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997 should enable Artprice to generate additional income through annual price increases  justified as required  notably by the constant enrichment of its various databases with at least one million ultra-qualified data logs added every year for its customers. Because Artprice provides its customers with essential data that cannot be found anywhere else.The Art Market is displaying insolent health  with regular records hammered across all artistic periods during recent sales in 2022 and  very likely  in future sales during 2023.Somewhat counter-intuitively ‚Äì given the geopolitical and economic context ‚Äì the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods  regardless of the country  during recent sales sessions. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023 which are the main indicators of the Art Market.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100¬© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market.Artprice had already noted that during the main crises of the past (the Nasdaq crash in 2000  9/11 in 2001  the Afghan war in 2001  the Iraq war in 2003  the subprime and CDS crises in 2007  the negative rates crisis in 2011  the 2019 Covid crisis  etc.) the art market was less impacted than other markets and the economy.Christie's recent dispersal of the Paul Allen collection proves this point very firmly by turning a new page in the history of auctions. It was the first private collection to generate over one billion dollars at auction ($1.62 billion) with five works selling above the $100 million threshold.This new record follows one set by Christie's competitor Sotheby's when it took $922 million from the sale of the Macklowe Collection between autumn 2021 and spring 2022.Thanks to the dispersion of these exceptional American collections  the year 2022 has become an outstanding year in the history of public sales.As we approach the end of 2022  it is abundantly clear that the war on European soil and fears of a recession have not got the better of the Art Market.Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/12/tablette-page-artiste_en.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

When Dr. Goran Stojmenovik retires as chair  it will see the end of Barco's eight-year run heading the industry body. The previous chair  Jan Daem  was also from Barco. A founding member of LIPA in 2011  Barco still intends to play ""a very active role"" moving forward.Educating the marketLIPA's role is to present the world with a single industry voice when it comes to rationalizing laser regulations. One example is the governmental regulations that put onerous and costly requirements on the cinema exhibitors that integrate laser engines into their projectors. LIPA has had some success with better explaining the industry's position  noting that regulators prefer that the industry stakeholders speak with a single unified voice.Stojmenovik's tenure was marked by what he calls ""market education""  providing science-based responses to regulatory issues. These have included articles  interviews  webinars  white papers and blog articles. ""This body of work now constitutes a bank of material for rationalization and education around technical and regulatory topics "" according to Stojmenovik.LIPA also worked the optical hazard department of the FDA in the US. This led to the easing of some requirements for laser illuminated projectors  notably reducing their minimum height from 3 meters to 2.5 in some cases.

ENDS About Spasticity Spasticity is a condition in which there is an abnormal increase in muscle tone or stiffness in one or more muscles  which might interfere with movement. Spasticity is usually caused by damage to nerve pathways in the brain or spinal cord that control muscle movement  and may occur in association with cerebral palsy  spinal cord injury  multiple sclerosis  stroke  and brain or head trauma. In adults  approximately one in three stroke patients  one in three patients with spinal cord injury  one in six patients with traumatic brain injury  and two in three patients with MS will develop lower limb spasticity. About Dysport Dysport¬Æ (abobotulinumtoxinA) is an injectable form of a botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) product  which is a substance derived from Clostridium bacteria producing BoNT-A that inhibits the effective transmission of nerve impulses and thereby reduces muscular contractions. It is supplied as a lyophilized powder. AbobotulinumtoxinA has marketing authorization in more than 90 countries  more than 30 years of clinical experience and 6 million treatment years of patient experience. The detailed recommendations for the use of Dysport are described in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for Dysport (300 units)Powder and Dysport (500 units)Powder.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen's future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words 'believes'  'anticipates' and 'expects' and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen's expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations.

These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share.

In addition  a biotope has been created next to the KraussMaffei site as a compensatory area. This will help to significantly improve the habitat for animals as well as insects and birds and increase the comfort for employees on the footpaths through the biotope.In addition  care was taken in the planning of the park to integrate natural areas into the project. Thus  in addition to green roofs and the greening of the fa√ßades  the multi-storey parking garages are also greened. In addition  the VGP Park Munich has electric charging stations for e-cars  energy-efficient hall heating with LED lighting and groundwater heat pumps. These measures contribute to achieving the requirements of a DGNB Gold certification for VGP Park Munich.Very near to the city centre  directly adjacent to S-Bahn station (S2-Grub) and only 30 minutes by car from Munich Airport  the park is located north of the Parsdorf junction on the A 94 motorway in a region of economic importance for agriculture  industry and trade.CONTACT DETAILS VGP FOR INVESTORS AND MEDIA ENQUIRIESMartijn VluttersVP ‚Äì Business Development & Investor Relations Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1433Karen HuybrechtsHead of Marketing Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1432ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

The reasons for the proposal are to contribute to the possibilities to retain and attract qualified personnel and to increase motivation of the employees of the company by being involved in and working for a positive revenue growth during the period covered by the Share Savings Program 2023/2026.In light of the terms and conditions  size of allotment and other circumstances  the board of directors considers the Share Savings Program 2023/2026  in accordance with the below  to be reasonable and advantageous for the company and its shareholders.The program is suggested to have a three-year performance period. Participation in the program is suggested to be offered to all employees within the company  conditional upon that the employee makes an initial investment in the company's shares (""investment shares""). For each investment share  the participant may receive two additional shares free of charge in MAG after the performance period  whereof one is conditional upon retained employment (""retention shares"")  and one is conditional upon retained employment and the fulfilment of a performance criteria concerning the company's average annual revenue growth during the program (""performance shares"")  (together ""share rights""). The board of directors' intention is to propose a similar incentive program at the AGM 2024.A. The board of directors' proposal for implementation of the Share Savings Program 2023/2026The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 mainly in accordance with the following terms:In total  the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 shall consist of no more than 130 000 share rights  whereof 65 000 retention shares  and 65 000 performance shares.Participation in the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 requires that participants make a personal investment in the company's shares or allocate already held shares to the program. Each participant shall be offered to participate with a maximum number of investment shares which shall be allocated to the Share Savings Program 2023/2026.The Share Savings Program 2023/2026 shall  in accordance with the below  be offered to: all employees of the company (including employees in MAG Games Ltd) as of 31 January 2023 (approximately 104 persons)  including members of the company's executive management team that are not founders or large shareholders of the company. Participants within each category shall be offered to participate with a maximum number of investment shares as is outlined in the table below:Categories of participants Maximum number of investment shares Group 1 - Executive management (4 persons) 15 000 Group 2 - Other employees (100 persons) 50 000 Total number of investment shares 65 000For each investment share that is bought and allocated to the program  participants may be granted one retention share and one performance share free of charge.Allotment of share rights is conditional upon that the participants employment with the company has not been terminated  with certain exceptions for common ""good leaver"" conditions. In case a participant's employment with the company is terminated on good leaver grounds during the performance period  the participant shall be granted share rights pro-rated in relation to the time remaining of the performance period.Allotment of performance shares is  in addition to what is outlined above  subject to the fulfilment of a performance condition concerning the company's average annual revenue growth during the performance period (the ""performance condition""). Fulfilment of the performance condition shall be calculated based on a comparison between the average revenue in the company's quarterly reports during the period from and including 1 March 2025  up to and including 28 February 2026 and the average revenue in the company's quarterly reports during the period from and including 1 March 2022  up to and including 28 February 2023. Performance shares will only be allotted if the revenue has grown during the performance period. Performance fulfilment is calculated to a maximum of one (1) share at 20% average annual revenue growth with pro-rated allotment in case of performance fulfilment between 5% and 20% average annual revenue growth. The number of performance shares to be allotted will be rounded upwards to the nearest whole number of shares.Notice of participation in the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 shall have been received by the company on 30 April 2023 at the latest  and the board of directors shall be entitled to extend this time period. The allotment of share rights to participants shall be made promptly after the expiration of the performance period.The share rights will vest three years after the program start (1 March 2026).Vesting of share rights is accelerated  under certain conditions  in case of a merger in which the company is absorbed by another company or in case of a public offer for all shares in the company whereby the offeror acquires more than 2/3 of the shares in the company  including shares that the offeror or a closely related party to the offeror acquire outside  but in connection with  the offer.The holders can exercise allotted and vested share rights during the period from and including 1 April 2026 up to and including 1 June 2026. The board of directors may  in individual cases  extend the exercise period to no later than 4 July 2026 if the holder  due to applicable rules  cannot exercise the share rights during the initial exercise period.For employees resident outside of Sweden  participation requires that such participation is in accordance with applicable laws  and that the board of directors  in its sole discretion  consider it to be possible with reasonable administrative and economic efforts.The share rights shall be governed by separate agreements with each participant. The board of directors shall be responsible for the preparation and management of the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 within the above-mentioned substantial terms.B. The board of directors' proposal for an issue of warrantsIn order to enable the company's delivery of shares under the Share Savings Program 2023/2026  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 130 000 warrants of series 2023/2026  free of charge  to a wholly owned subsidiary of MAG Interactive AB (publ) (the ""Subsidiary"") in accordance with the following:Each warrant of series 2023/2026 entitles the holder to subscription for one (1) share in MAG Interactive AB (publ) during the period from 1 February 2023  or the later date on which the warrants are registered  up to and including 25 July 2026. Subscription for new shares by way of exercising warrants of series 2023/2026 shall be made at a price per share of SEK 0.025974  which corresponds to the quota value of the shares. The exercise price and the number of shares that each warrant of series 2023/2026 entitles to may be subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  share split  rights issue  or similar actions  wherein the recalculation terms in the complete terms and conditions of the warrants shall be applied. The subscription of warrants of series 2023/2026 shall be made no later than on 8 April 2023. However  the board of directors shall be entitled to extend the subscription period. There can be no over-subscription. For complete terms  see Appendix 1 and Appendix A1 .If the warrants of series 2023/2026 are exercised in full  the share capital will increase by SEK 3 377.C. The board of directors' proposal for approval of transfer of shares and/or warrantsThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to approve that the Subsidiary may transfer shares and/or warrants of series 2023/2026 to the participants in the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 in connection with the allotment of the share rights in accordance with the terms set out in section A.Dilution effect  market value  costs  etc.The board of directors' proposal to resolve on issuance of warrants entails a dilution effect corresponding to a maximum of approximately 0.49 per cent of the shares and votes in the company if the proposed warrants are exercised in full. The dilution effect is calculated as the relation between the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for and the sum of the current number of shares and the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for. Residual warrants will be cancelled and as such will not result in any dilution effect for the shareholders.The Share Savings Program 2023/2026 is expected to have only marginal effects on the company's key ratios.The board of directors' assessment is that the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 will trigger costs mainly related to administration  accounting salary costs and social security contributions.The total costs for administration are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 200 000.The share rights will be accounted as an employee expense over the performance period  without affecting the company's cash flow. If share rights are allotted  the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 will also entail social security contributions. The total costs for social security contributions during the performance period will depend on the participants employee status  the number of share rights that will be vested  and the value of the benefit that the participant will receive  i.e. the value of the retention shares and performance shares at exercise in 2026. Social security contributions will be expensed in the income statement during the performance period based on the value of the share rights.Based on the assumption that 100 per cent of the share rights included in the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 are vested  a share price of SEK 54 upon exercise of the retention shares and performance shares and an average social security cost of 31.42 per cent  the total costs for the program are calculated to amount to approximately SEK 5.5 million during the period 2023-2026  which corresponds to 8 percent of the company's annual employee cost (including social security contribution) based on the employee costs during the financial year 2021/2022.All of the calculations above are preliminary and aim only to present an example of the potential costs that the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 may incur. Actual costs may therefore deviate from what is stated above.Previous incentive programs in MAG Interactive AB (publ)The company currently has three ongoing warrant programs and three ongoing employee stock option programs for key employees and other employees. These previously approved incentive programs are  together with the Share Savings Program 2023/2026  expected to entail a dilution of approximately 5.77 per cent of the total number of outstanding shares provided that all outstanding and proposed warrants are exercised in full. The dilution effect is calculated as the relation between the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for and the sum of the current number of shares and the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for. For a more detailed description of the company's other share related incentive programs  reference is made to the annual report for the financial year 2021/2022.Preparation of the proposalThe proposal has been prepared by the board of directors together with external advisors.Item 17 - Resolution regarding adoption of amended articles of associationThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to update the articles of association by inserting a new paragraph in accordance with the following:¬ß 10The board of directors may collect proxies pursuant to the procedure stated in Chapter 7  Section 4  second paragraph of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551).The board of directors may decide before a general meeting that the shareholders shall be able to exercise their voting rights by post before the general meeting pursuant to the procedure stated in Chapter 7 Section 4 a of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551).

The reasons for the proposal are to contribute to the possibilities to retain and attract qualified personnel and to increase motivation of the employees of the company by being involved in and working for a positive revenue growth during the period covered by the Share Savings Program 2023/2026.In light of the terms and conditions  size of allotment and other circumstances  the board of directors considers the Share Savings Program 2023/2026  in accordance with the below  to be reasonable and advantageous for the company and its shareholders.The program is suggested to have a three-year performance period. Participation in the program is suggested to be offered to all employees within the company  conditional upon that the employee makes an initial investment in the company's shares (""investment shares""). For each investment share  the participant may receive two additional shares free of charge in MAG after the performance period  whereof one is conditional upon retained employment (""retention shares"")  and one is conditional upon retained employment and the fulfilment of a performance criteria concerning the company's average annual revenue growth during the program (""performance shares"")  (together ""share rights""). The board of directors' intention is to propose a similar incentive program at the AGM 2024.A. The board of directors' proposal for implementation of the Share Savings Program 2023/2026The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 mainly in accordance with the following terms:In total  the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 shall consist of no more than 130 000 share rights  whereof 65 000 retention shares  and 65 000 performance shares.Participation in the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 requires that participants make a personal investment in the company's shares or allocate already held shares to the program. Each participant shall be offered to participate with a maximum number of investment shares which shall be allocated to the Share Savings Program 2023/2026.The Share Savings Program 2023/2026 shall  in accordance with the below  be offered to: all employees of the company (including employees in MAG Games Ltd) as of 31 January 2023 (approximately 104 persons)  including members of the company's executive management team that are not founders or large shareholders of the company. Participants within each category shall be offered to participate with a maximum number of investment shares as is outlined in the table below:Categories of participants Maximum number of investment shares Group 1 - Executive management (4 persons) 15 000 Group 2 - Other employees (100 persons) 50 000 Total number of investment shares 65 000For each investment share that is bought and allocated to the program  participants may be granted one retention share and one performance share free of charge.Allotment of share rights is conditional upon that the participants employment with the company has not been terminated  with certain exceptions for common ""good leaver"" conditions. In case a participant's employment with the company is terminated on good leaver grounds during the performance period  the participant shall be granted share rights pro-rated in relation to the time remaining of the performance period.Allotment of performance shares is  in addition to what is outlined above  subject to the fulfilment of a performance condition concerning the company's average annual revenue growth during the performance period (the ""performance condition""). Fulfilment of the performance condition shall be calculated based on a comparison between the average revenue in the company's quarterly reports during the period from and including 1 March 2025  up to and including 28 February 2026 and the average revenue in the company's quarterly reports during the period from and including 1 March 2022  up to and including 28 February 2023. Performance shares will only be allotted if the revenue has grown during the performance period. Performance fulfilment is calculated to a maximum of one (1) share at 20% average annual revenue growth with pro-rated allotment in case of performance fulfilment between 5% and 20% average annual revenue growth. The number of performance shares to be allotted will be rounded upwards to the nearest whole number of shares.Notice of participation in the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 shall have been received by the company on 30 April 2023 at the latest  and the board of directors shall be entitled to extend this time period. The allotment of share rights to participants shall be made promptly after the expiration of the performance period.The share rights will vest three years after the program start (1 March 2026).Vesting of share rights is accelerated  under certain conditions  in case of a merger in which the company is absorbed by another company or in case of a public offer for all shares in the company whereby the offeror acquires more than 2/3 of the shares in the company  including shares that the offeror or a closely related party to the offeror acquire outside  but in connection with  the offer.The holders can exercise allotted and vested share rights during the period from and including 1 April 2026 up to and including 1 June 2026. The board of directors may  in individual cases  extend the exercise period to no later than 4 July 2026 if the holder  due to applicable rules  cannot exercise the share rights during the initial exercise period.For employees resident outside of Sweden  participation requires that such participation is in accordance with applicable laws  and that the board of directors  in its sole discretion  consider it to be possible with reasonable administrative and economic efforts.The share rights shall be governed by separate agreements with each participant. The board of directors shall be responsible for the preparation and management of the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 within the above-mentioned substantial terms.B. The board of directors' proposal for an issue of warrantsIn order to enable the company's delivery of shares under the Share Savings Program 2023/2026  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 130 000 warrants of series 2023/2026  free of charge  to a wholly owned subsidiary of MAG Interactive AB (publ) (the ""Subsidiary"") in accordance with the following:Each warrant of series 2023/2026 entitles the holder to subscription for one (1) share in MAG Interactive AB (publ) during the period from 1 February 2023  or the later date on which the warrants are registered  up to and including 25 July 2026. Subscription for new shares by way of exercising warrants of series 2023/2026 shall be made at a price per share of SEK 0.025974  which corresponds to the quota value of the shares. The exercise price and the number of shares that each warrant of series 2023/2026 entitles to may be subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  share split  rights issue  or similar actions  wherein the recalculation terms in the complete terms and conditions of the warrants shall be applied. The subscription of warrants of series 2023/2026 shall be made no later than on 8 April 2023. However  the board of directors shall be entitled to extend the subscription period. There can be no over-subscription. For complete terms  see Appendix 1 and Appendix A1 .If the warrants of series 2023/2026 are exercised in full  the share capital will increase by SEK 3 377.C. The board of directors' proposal for approval of transfer of shares and/or warrantsThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to approve that the Subsidiary may transfer shares and/or warrants of series 2023/2026 to the participants in the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 in connection with the allotment of the share rights in accordance with the terms set out in section A.Dilution effect  market value  costs  etc.The board of directors' proposal to resolve on issuance of warrants entails a dilution effect corresponding to a maximum of approximately 0.49 per cent of the shares and votes in the company if the proposed warrants are exercised in full. The dilution effect is calculated as the relation between the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for and the sum of the current number of shares and the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for. Residual warrants will be cancelled and as such will not result in any dilution effect for the shareholders.The Share Savings Program 2023/2026 is expected to have only marginal effects on the company's key ratios.The board of directors' assessment is that the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 will trigger costs mainly related to administration  accounting salary costs and social security contributions.The total costs for administration are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 200 000.The share rights will be accounted as an employee expense over the performance period  without affecting the company's cash flow. If share rights are allotted  the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 will also entail social security contributions. The total costs for social security contributions during the performance period will depend on the participants employee status  the number of share rights that will be vested  and the value of the benefit that the participant will receive  i.e. the value of the retention shares and performance shares at exercise in 2026. Social security contributions will be expensed in the income statement during the performance period based on the value of the share rights.Based on the assumption that 100 per cent of the share rights included in the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 are vested  a share price of SEK 54 upon exercise of the retention shares and performance shares and an average social security cost of 31.42 per cent  the total costs for the program are calculated to amount to approximately SEK 5.5 million during the period 2023-2026  which corresponds to 8 percent of the company's annual employee cost (including social security contribution) based on the employee costs during the financial year 2021/2022.All of the calculations above are preliminary and aim only to present an example of the potential costs that the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 may incur. Actual costs may therefore deviate from what is stated above.Previous incentive programs in MAG Interactive AB (publ)The company currently has three ongoing warrant programs and three ongoing employee stock option programs for key employees and other employees. These previously approved incentive programs are  together with the Share Savings Program 2023/2026  expected to entail a dilution of approximately 5.77 per cent of the total number of outstanding shares provided that all outstanding and proposed warrants are exercised in full. The dilution effect is calculated as the relation between the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for and the sum of the current number of shares and the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for. For a more detailed description of the company's other share related incentive programs  reference is made to the annual report for the financial year 2021/2022.Preparation of the proposalThe proposal has been prepared by the board of directors together with external advisors.Item 17 - Resolution regarding adoption of amended articles of associationThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to update the articles of association by inserting a new paragraph in accordance with the following:¬ß 10The board of directors may collect proxies pursuant to the procedure stated in Chapter 7  Section 4  second paragraph of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551).The board of directors may decide before a general meeting that the shareholders shall be able to exercise their voting rights by post before the general meeting pursuant to the procedure stated in Chapter 7 Section 4 a of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551). Postal voting may be made by electronic means if the board of directors so decides.Resolutions proposed by the Nomination CommitteeMAG Interactive AB (publ)'s nomination committee consists of Joachim Spetz (Swedbank Robur Fonder)  Henrik Sandell (Didner & Gerge Fonder)  Kaj Nygren (NMO Invest AB and Playful Days AB)  and Johan Persson (Johan Persson  Fredrik Stenh and Anders Larsson)  who together represent approximately 56 per cent of the voting rights in respect of all shares in the company.

The reasons for the proposal are to contribute to the possibilities to retain and attract qualified personnel and to increase motivation of the employees of the company by being involved in and working for a positive revenue growth during the period covered by the Share Savings Program 2023/2026.In light of the terms and conditions  size of allotment and other circumstances  the board of directors considers the Share Savings Program 2023/2026  in accordance with the below  to be reasonable and advantageous for the company and its shareholders.The program is suggested to have a three-year performance period. Participation in the program is suggested to be offered to all employees within the company  conditional upon that the employee makes an initial investment in the company's shares (""investment shares""). For each investment share  the participant may receive two additional shares free of charge in MAG after the performance period  whereof one is conditional upon retained employment (""retention shares"")  and one is conditional upon retained employment and the fulfilment of a performance criteria concerning the company's average annual revenue growth during the program (""performance shares"")  (together ""share rights""). The board of directors' intention is to propose a similar incentive program at the AGM 2024.A. The board of directors' proposal for implementation of the Share Savings Program 2023/2026The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 mainly in accordance with the following terms:In total  the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 shall consist of no more than 130 000 share rights  whereof 65 000 retention shares  and 65 000 performance shares.Participation in the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 requires that participants make a personal investment in the company's shares or allocate already held shares to the program. Each participant shall be offered to participate with a maximum number of investment shares which shall be allocated to the Share Savings Program 2023/2026.The Share Savings Program 2023/2026 shall  in accordance with the below  be offered to: all employees of the company (including employees in MAG Games Ltd) as of 31 January 2023 (approximately 104 persons)  including members of the company's executive management team that are not founders or large shareholders of the company. Participants within each category shall be offered to participate with a maximum number of investment shares as is outlined in the table below:Categories of participants Maximum number of investment shares Group 1 - Executive management (4 persons) 15 000 Group 2 - Other employees (100 persons) 50 000 Total number of investment shares 65 000For each investment share that is bought and allocated to the program  participants may be granted one retention share and one performance share free of charge.Allotment of share rights is conditional upon that the participants employment with the company has not been terminated  with certain exceptions for common ""good leaver"" conditions. In case a participant's employment with the company is terminated on good leaver grounds during the performance period  the participant shall be granted share rights pro-rated in relation to the time remaining of the performance period.Allotment of performance shares is  in addition to what is outlined above  subject to the fulfilment of a performance condition concerning the company's average annual revenue growth during the performance period (the ""performance condition""). Fulfilment of the performance condition shall be calculated based on a comparison between the average revenue in the company's quarterly reports during the period from and including 1 March 2025  up to and including 28 February 2026 and the average revenue in the company's quarterly reports during the period from and including 1 March 2022  up to and including 28 February 2023. Performance shares will only be allotted if the revenue has grown during the performance period. Performance fulfilment is calculated to a maximum of one (1) share at 20% average annual revenue growth with pro-rated allotment in case of performance fulfilment between 5% and 20% average annual revenue growth. The number of performance shares to be allotted will be rounded upwards to the nearest whole number of shares.Notice of participation in the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 shall have been received by the company on 30 April 2023 at the latest  and the board of directors shall be entitled to extend this time period. The allotment of share rights to participants shall be made promptly after the expiration of the performance period.The share rights will vest three years after the program start (1 March 2026).Vesting of share rights is accelerated  under certain conditions  in case of a merger in which the company is absorbed by another company or in case of a public offer for all shares in the company whereby the offeror acquires more than 2/3 of the shares in the company  including shares that the offeror or a closely related party to the offeror acquire outside  but in connection with  the offer.The holders can exercise allotted and vested share rights during the period from and including 1 April 2026 up to and including 1 June 2026. The board of directors may  in individual cases  extend the exercise period to no later than 4 July 2026 if the holder  due to applicable rules  cannot exercise the share rights during the initial exercise period.For employees resident outside of Sweden  participation requires that such participation is in accordance with applicable laws  and that the board of directors  in its sole discretion  consider it to be possible with reasonable administrative and economic efforts.The share rights shall be governed by separate agreements with each participant. The board of directors shall be responsible for the preparation and management of the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 within the above-mentioned substantial terms.B. The board of directors' proposal for an issue of warrantsIn order to enable the company's delivery of shares under the Share Savings Program 2023/2026  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 130 000 warrants of series 2023/2026  free of charge  to a wholly owned subsidiary of MAG Interactive AB (publ) (the ""Subsidiary"") in accordance with the following:Each warrant of series 2023/2026 entitles the holder to subscription for one (1) share in MAG Interactive AB (publ) during the period from 1 February 2023  or the later date on which the warrants are registered  up to and including 25 July 2026. Subscription for new shares by way of exercising warrants of series 2023/2026 shall be made at a price per share of SEK 0.025974  which corresponds to the quota value of the shares. The exercise price and the number of shares that each warrant of series 2023/2026 entitles to may be subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  share split  rights issue  or similar actions  wherein the recalculation terms in the complete terms and conditions of the warrants shall be applied. The subscription of warrants of series 2023/2026 shall be made no later than on 8 April 2023. However  the board of directors shall be entitled to extend the subscription period. There can be no over-subscription. For complete terms  see Appendix 1 and Appendix A1 .If the warrants of series 2023/2026 are exercised in full  the share capital will increase by SEK 3 377.C. The board of directors' proposal for approval of transfer of shares and/or warrantsThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to approve that the Subsidiary may transfer shares and/or warrants of series 2023/2026 to the participants in the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 in connection with the allotment of the share rights in accordance with the terms set out in section A.Dilution effect  market value  costs  etc.The board of directors' proposal to resolve on issuance of warrants entails a dilution effect corresponding to a maximum of approximately 0.49 per cent of the shares and votes in the company if the proposed warrants are exercised in full. The dilution effect is calculated as the relation between the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for and the sum of the current number of shares and the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for. Residual warrants will be cancelled and as such will not result in any dilution effect for the shareholders.The Share Savings Program 2023/2026 is expected to have only marginal effects on the company's key ratios.The board of directors' assessment is that the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 will trigger costs mainly related to administration  accounting salary costs and social security contributions.The total costs for administration are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 200 000.The share rights will be accounted as an employee expense over the performance period  without affecting the company's cash flow. If share rights are allotted  the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 will also entail social security contributions. The total costs for social security contributions during the performance period will depend on the participants employee status  the number of share rights that will be vested  and the value of the benefit that the participant will receive  i.e. the value of the retention shares and performance shares at exercise in 2026. Social security contributions will be expensed in the income statement during the performance period based on the value of the share rights.Based on the assumption that 100 per cent of the share rights included in the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 are vested  a share price of SEK 54 upon exercise of the retention shares and performance shares and an average social security cost of 31.42 per cent  the total costs for the program are calculated to amount to approximately SEK 5.5 million during the period 2023-2026  which corresponds to 8 percent of the company's annual employee cost (including social security contribution) based on the employee costs during the financial year 2021/2022.All of the calculations above are preliminary and aim only to present an example of the potential costs that the Share Savings Program 2023/2026 may incur. Actual costs may therefore deviate from what is stated above.Previous incentive programs in MAG Interactive AB (publ)The company currently has three ongoing warrant programs and three ongoing employee stock option programs for key employees and other employees. These previously approved incentive programs are  together with the Share Savings Program 2023/2026  expected to entail a dilution of approximately 5.77 per cent of the total number of outstanding shares provided that all outstanding and proposed warrants are exercised in full. The dilution effect is calculated as the relation between the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for and the sum of the current number of shares and the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for. For a more detailed description of the company's other share related incentive programs  reference is made to the annual report for the financial year 2021/2022.Preparation of the proposalThe proposal has been prepared by the board of directors together with external advisors.Item 17 - Resolution regarding adoption of amended articles of associationThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to update the articles of association by inserting a new paragraph in accordance with the following:¬ß 10The board of directors may collect proxies pursuant to the procedure stated in Chapter 7  Section 4  second paragraph of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551).The board of directors may decide before a general meeting that the shareholders shall be able to exercise their voting rights by post before the general meeting pursuant to the procedure stated in Chapter 7 Section 4 a of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551). Postal voting may be made by electronic means if the board of directors so decides.Resolutions proposed by the Nomination CommitteeMAG Interactive AB (publ)'s nomination committee consists of Joachim Spetz (Swedbank Robur Fonder)  Henrik Sandell (Didner & Gerge Fonder)  Kaj Nygren (NMO Invest AB and Playful Days AB)  and Johan Persson (Johan Persson  Fredrik Stenh and Anders Larsson)  who together represent approximately 56 per cent of the voting rights in respect of all shares in the company.

The transactions  which are the first of their kind  involved financial institutions and regulators from across Europe and underlined how blockchain technology can be used to enhance borrowers and asset managers‚Äô liquidity ,Rabobank Completes Landmark Blockchain Pilot to Provide Borrowers and Asset Managers with Real-time LiquidityRabobank has completed its largest-ever blockchain pilot  executing 19 real-time Euro Commercial Paper transactions using the technology.The transactions  which are the first of their kind  involved financial institutions and regulators from across Europe and underlined how blockchain technology can be used to enhance borrowers and asset managers‚Äô liquidity  as global investors contend with liquidity crunches and money market turbulence.In total  Rabobank‚Äôs pilot executed more than ‚Ç¨40 million in notional  one-week maturity Euro Commercial Papers in EUR and GBP in a fixed and floating format  from the Dutch State Treasury Agency and Rabobank Treasury in the Netherlands and Erste Bank in Austria to UK-based asset manager Northern Trust Asset Management.The transactions were executed  distributed and settled in under 30 minutes  as opposed to the standard two business days  providing close to real-time liquidity to Northern Trust Asset Management for publicly issued and traded debt securities on both primary and secondary markets. The securities were issued out of the existing CP and CD funding programmes of participating borrowers with assigned individual XS-ISIN.The trade economics and settlement instructions were confirmed and matched in real-time using a private-permissioned ledger-based platform built by Rabobank and integrated into operational flows and legacy front-to-back risk systems. The securities were instantly issued in and settled against fiat cash on Euroclear Bank‚Äôs infrastructure and harmonized with the issuing and paying agent on their infrastructure  and soon the electronic trading venue of Tradeweb. The transactions reduced the execution  issuance cost and time  improved operational efficiencies and contributed to real-time trade supervisory.European regulators  including The Netherlands Authority for Financial Markets (AFM)  also had dedicated access to the blockchain  which allowed them to trace and track the pilot transactions in real-time  highlighting the potential for the technology to support regulatory efforts across financial markets.The transactions were the continuation of pilot transactions executed by Rabobank in 2021 with NN Investment Partners and PGGM. Rabobank is now working on building the ecosystem and network effect with key institutional players.Youssef el Mir  Global Head of Trading at Rabobank  said: ‚ÄúWe believe the digitisation of money markets can enhance liquidity and transparency at a critical time for the asset management industry. Our 2021 pilot was all about proof of concept. These latest transactions  and the solution we‚Äôve worked collaboratively to deliver  prove that blockchain technology can be smoothly and seamlessly integrated in financial institutions‚Äô legacy systems with the right approach. ‚ÄúAs the top global money market dealer  we can now offer the security and operational efficiency of fast delivery versus payment settlement to borrowers and fixed income asset managers  helping them to standardise and better manage cash flow and portfolio risk.‚ÄùRoland van der Vorst  Global Head of Wholesale & Rural Innovation at Rabobank  said: ‚ÄúBlockchain‚Äôs reputation as a technology with legitimate applications for global financial markets has undoubtedly been shaken by the turmoil surrounding cryptocurrencies. The scale and success of our pilot  delivered in partnership with some of the biggest financial institutions in Europe  will hopefully help to address misconceptions and show the revolutionary impact innovation in this space can truly have.‚ÄùPhilippe Verriest  Head of Innovation  Research and Development at Euroclear  said: ‚ÄúWe are delighted to have worked on this truly innovative project with our industry partners. The pilot successfully resulted in a large reduction in ECP instrument issuance and settlement processing times while also providing near-instantaneous liquidity to the issuer. Through our scalable infrastructure and network  we were able to jointly provide secure  real-time issuance and settlement of these instruments. In our role as a financial market infrastructure  we are here to support and collaborate with the market in the development of pioneering technologies that will drive real efficiencies.‚Äù,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.71,0.15,0.14,True,English,"['Landmark Blockchain Pilot', 'Asset Managers', 'Real-time Liquidity', 'Rabobank', 'Borrowers', 'notional, one-week maturity Euro Commercial Papers', '19 real-time Euro Commercial Paper transactions', 'top global money market dealer', 'standard two business days', 'Roland van der Vorst', 'Dutch State Treasury Agency', 'Northern Trust Asset Management', 'fixed income asset managers', 'financial institutions‚Äô legacy systems', 'asset management industry', 'money market turbulence', 'UK-based asset manager', 'CD funding programmes', 'private-permissioned ledger-based platform', 'back risk systems', 'key institutional players', 'Youssef el Mir', 'biggest financial institutions', 'ECP instrument issuance', 'asset managers‚Äô liquidity', 'secure, real-time issuance', 'electronic trading venue', 'The Netherlands Authority', 'revolutionary impact innovation', 'settlement processing times', 'real-time trade supervisory', 'global financial markets', 'financial market infrastructure', 'Landmark Blockchain Pilot', 'money markets', 'global investors', 'issuance cost', 'trade economics', 'portfolio risk', 'industry partners', 'Global Head', 'Real-time Liquidity', 'secondary markets', 'Rabobank Treasury', 'liquidity crunches', 'floating format', 'Erste Bank', 'existing CP', 'individual XS-ISIN', 'settlement instructions', 'operational flows', 'fiat cash', 'paying agent', 'operational efficiencies', 'regulatory efforts', 'Investment Partners', 'right approach', 'operational efficiency', 'fast delivery', 'payment settlement', 'cash flow', 'Rural Innovation', 'legitimate applications', 'Philippe Verriest', 'innovative project', 'large reduction', 'instantaneous liquidity', 'pioneering technologies', 'real efficiencies', 'latest transactions', 'scalable infrastructure', 'Euroclear Bank', 'European regulators', 'pilot transactions', 'network effect', 'critical time', 'debt securities', 'participating borrowers', 'blockchain technology', '2021 pilot', 'largest', 'kind', 'total', 'GBP', 'Austria', '30 minutes', 'primary', 'issuing', 'Tradeweb', 'execution', 'AFM', 'access', 'potential', 'continuation', 'PGGM', 'ecosystem', 'digitisation', 'transparency', 'proof', 'concept', 'solution', 'security', 'Wholesale', 'reputation', 'turmoil', 'cryptocurrencies', 'scale', 'success', 'partnership', 'space', 'Research', 'Development', 'issuer', 'instruments', 'role']",2022-12-15,2022-12-15,financialit.net

Koneti Rao  MD  shared new evidence of long-term safety and hematologic response in patients who received leniolisib to treat APDS  a rare primary immunodeficiencyInterim analysis demonstrated leniolisib to be well tolerated and indicated the durability of the efficacy results seen in the Phase II/III randomized  controlled trialLEIDEN  Netherlands  Dec. 15  2022 /CNW/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces data  including new evidence  from an interim analysis of its open-label extension study evaluating the investigational drug leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  to treat adult and adolescent patients with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency. Principal investigator V. Koneti Rao  M.D.  a staff physician in the Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda  Maryland  U.S.  shared the positive findings in an oral presentation at the 2022 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH).Pharming Group N.V. LogoDr. Virgil Dalm  Principal Investigator  Consultant Clinical Immunology  Erasmus MC  Rotterdam  the Netherlands  commented:""I'm excited about Pharming's findings that further support leniolisib as a well-tolerated investigational treatment benefitting patients with APDS. The results demonstrate the long-term tolerability of leniolisib  with a median duration on study therapy of just over 2 years (102 weeks) and 5 subjects being treated for 5 years or more. Individuals with APDS frequently suffer from recurrent infections and lifelong Immunoglobulin Replacement Therapy (IRT) is required to reduce this burden. Notably  leniolisib treatment demonstrated a significant reduction in the annualized infection rate  while 37% of study patients on IRT were able to either reduce or altogether stop their IRT regimens. This is a remarkable outcome for any study of inborn errors of immunity and through the continued study of leniolisib  I look forward to contributing to the knowledge of an improved treatment option for individuals with APDS.""The ongoing extension study includes 37 patients with APDS aged 12 years or older who  at the time of data cutoff for the interim analysis  had received 70 mg of the selective PI3KŒ¥ inhibitor leniolisib twice a day for up to six years and three months  with a median duration on study therapy of 102 weeks. The study was primarily designed to assess the safety and tolerability of long-term leniolisib treatment in adolescent and adult patients with APDS who previously participated in a Phase II/III leniolisib study. The extension study's secondary endpoints are intended to evaluate the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of long-term leniolisib treatment in these patients.The interim analysis found that leniolisib was well tolerated to this point in the study. It also indicated the durability of the efficacy results seen in the randomized  controlled trial  which showed significant improvement over placebo in the co-primary endpoints of reduction in lymph node size and increase in na√Øve B cells. The interim results indicate a favorable long-term impact on the immune dysregulation and deficiency often seen in patients with APDS  with clinical manifestations including infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  enteropathy  bronchiectasis  increased risk of lymphoma  and early mortality.The majority of adverse events (AEs) reported in the interim analysis were grades 1 and 2  and included upper respiratory tract infection  headache and pyrexia. Grade 1 AEs are the least severe and grade 5 the most severe. Overall  13.5% of AEs were study drug-related; these affected five patients and included weight gain  arthralgia  hyperglycemia  and decreased neutrophil count. Of all AEs assessed in the analysis  16.2% were classified as serious  but none of these were identified as related to study treatment. There was one death among study participants which was identified as not related to study treatment.Among study participants  some experienced reductions in APDS disease markers  with levels of response varying between individuals. Responses included:reduced lymphadenopathy  splenomegaly  and IgM levels;improved or resolved anemia  thrombocytopenia  and lymphopenia; andresolved neutropenia in all affected patients.Importantly  37% of participants who were on immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IRT) were able to reduce their IRT use while taking leniolisib. Six patients became IRT-independent  with four of those patients having been IRT-independent for 1 to 2.5 years at the data cutoff. As of the data cut-off for the interim analysis  among three patients who had a history of lymphoma prior to the trial  none had a recurrence or new lymphoma while participating in the study.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""Pharming is pleased to share positive interim findings on the long-term safety and efficacy of leniolisib. The results announced at the 2022 ASH Annual Meeting build on the Phase II/III study findings announced earlier this year and published in Blood1 in November 2022  which highlighted leniolisib's potential to control the development of immune-related symptoms of APDS. We're proud to help fill an unmet need by developing what could become the first approved drug to target the cause of APDS.""The interim analysis findings are consistent with the data  first reported on February 2  2022  for the Phase II/III clinical trial investigating leniolisib as a treatment for adult and adolescent patients with APDS. Compared with placebo  patients in the Phase II/III clinical trial achieved significant reductions in index lymph node size and increases in the percentage of na√Øve B cells in peripheral blood.Based on the results of Phase II/III clinical trial and the long-term  open-label extension data  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is conducting a priority review of Pharming's New Drug Application for leniolisib as a treatment for adolescents and adults with APDS and has an assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 29  2023. In addition  Pharming's Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib in the same patient population has been validated for evaluation under an accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Marketing authorization for leniolisib in the European Union is anticipated in H1 2023.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.2 3 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.2 4 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.5 6 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.7 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.5-8 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3KŒ¥ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

A group of 208 matched patients from natural history studies was used as an external control group.The inclusion of REFLECT data permits outcomes in bilaterally treated eyes to be compared to those of patients treated unilaterally. When adjusted for covariates  the bilateral intravitreal injection (IVT) data presented in the article showed an improvement of +22.5 ETDRS letters versus natural history  as compared to an improvement of +17.5 ETDRS letters versus natural history for the unilateral IVT. Bilateral IVT also had an on-chart response rate of 79.2% compared to 67.0% for those with the unilateral IVT.Overall  the patients with LUMEVOQ¬Æ showed a clinically significant and sustained improvement in their visual acuity when compared to the natural history patients. Mean improvement versus natural history was +15 ETDRS letters up to 3.9 years after treatment (p<0.01). At 4 years (48 months) after vision loss  the majority of treated eyes were on-chart compared to less than half of natural history eyes (89.6% versus 48.1%) (p<0.01). When adjusted for covariates of interest (gender  age of onset  ethnicity  and duration of follow-up)  the estimated mean gain was - 0.43 logMAR (+ 21.5 ETDRS letters equivalent) versus natural history at last observation (p<0.0001). Thus  the treatment effect remained highly clinically significant when controlling for potential confounding factors (figure 1).The evolution of natural history eyes showed an absence of recovery throughout the entire follow-up period  with a plateau up to 36 months followed by a slow decline. By contrast  eyes treated with LUMEVOQ¬Æ showed a progressive  continuous and sustained improvement between 12 and 52 months after vision loss.""The results published in this peer-reviewed scientific paper provide more evidence of LUMEVOQ's potential as an effective treatment for LHON. The results indicate that LUMEVOQ treatment offers a better chance of recovery of vision than the published natural history of this disorder  giving hope to people affected by this debilitating blinding disease."" said Valerio Carelli  MD  PhD  Professor of Medical Genetics  Director of the Program in Neurogenetics  Department of Biomedical and NeuroMotor Sciences  University of Bologna School of Medicine and lead author of the article.The data was taken from four pooled Phase 3 studies  REVERSE  RESCUE and their long-term extension trial RESTORE  as well as the REFLECT trial. In the first three trials LUMEVOQ¬Æ was administered exclusively as a unilateral intravitreal injection (IVT)  while in the REFLECT trial it was assessed as either an unilateral or a bilateral IVT.The article is available in print and online via this link.Note: Evolution of visual acuity of treated eyes versus natural history eyes. The evolution of visual acuities over time for treated eyes (n = 348) and natural history eyes (n = 408) was estimated by LOESS regression (solid line) with 95% CI around the fitted curve (shaded area). Visual acuity values > 52 months were assigned to the 52-month time point using the next observation carried backward method. Smoothing parameter: 0.315 for treated eyes and 0.408 for natural history eyes. The statistically significant difference between treated and natural history eyes is illustrated by the non-overlapping CIs of LOESS curves. Mean differences at month 18 [15; 21]  month 24 [21; 30]  month 36 [30; 42] and month 48 [42; 54] were estimated by a mixed-model ANCOVA with repeated measures: *P = 0.03  **P = 0.02 and ***P < 0.01 versus natural history; and with Kruskal Wallis test: #P < 0.01 versus natural history.About GenSight BiologicsGenSight Biologics S.A. is a clinical-stage biopharma company focused on developing and commercializing innovative gene therapies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system disorders. GenSight Biologics‚Äô pipeline leverages two core technology platforms  the Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence (MTS) and optogenetics  to help preserve or restore vision in patients suffering from blinding retinal diseases. GenSight Biologics‚Äô lead product candidate  LUMEVOQ¬Æ (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec)  is an investigational compound and has not been registered in any country at this stage; a marketing authorization application is currently under review by the EMA for the treatment of Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)  a rare mitochondrial disease affecting primarily teens and young adults that leads to irreversible blindness. Using its gene therapy-based approach  GenSight Biologics‚Äô product candidates are designed to be administered in a single treatment to each eye by intravitreal injection to offer patients a sustainable functional visual recovery.About LUMEVOQ¬Æ (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec)LUMEVOQ¬Æ (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec) targets Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) by leveraging a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) proprietary technology platform  arising from research conducted at the Institut de la Vision in Paris  which  when associated with the gene of interest  allows the platform to specifically address defects inside the mitochondria using an AAV vector (Adeno-Associated Virus). The gene of interest is transferred into the cell to be expressed and produces the functional protein  which will then be shuttled to the mitochondria through specific nucleotidic sequences in order to restore the missing or deficient mitochondrial function. ‚ÄúLUMEVOQ‚Äù was accepted as the invented name for GS010 (lenadogene nolparvovec) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in October 2018. LUMEVOQ¬Æ (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec)  is an investigational compound and has not been registered in any country at this stage; a marketing authorization application is currently under review by the EMA.About REFLECTREFLECT is a multi-center  randomized  double-masked  placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bilateral injections of GS010 in subjects with LHON due to the NADH dehydrogenase 4 (ND4) mutation. In the active arm  GS010 was administered as a single intravitreal injection in each eye of each subject. In the placebo arm  GS010 was administered as a single intravitreal injection to the first affected eye  while the fellow eye received a placebo injection.The primary endpoint for the REFLECT trial is the BCVA reported in LogMAR at 1.5 years (78 weeks) post-treatment in the second‚Äëaffected/not‚Äëyet‚Äëaffected eye. The change from baseline in second‚Äëaffected/not‚Äëyet‚Äëaffected eyes receiving GS010 and placebo is the primary response of interest. The secondary efficacy endpoints include: BCVA reported in LogMAR at 2 years post-treatment in the second‚Äëaffected/not‚Äëyet‚Äëaffected eye compared to both placebo and the first‚Äëaffected eye receiving GS010  OCT and contrast sensitivity and quality of life scales.The trial was conducted in multiple centers across Europe (1 each in France  Spain  Italy and the UK)  the US (6 centers) and Taiwan (1 center).

The report outlines Carbios‚Äô commitment to developing environmental  social and governance (ESG) initiatives that go beyond the industrial development of its innovative plastics biorecycling technologies. Although not subject to the regulatory requirement of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD)  Carbios has nonetheless structured its report in accordance with the requirements of the European directive on Extra-Financial Performance Statements.‚ÄúThis first Sustainability Report aims to communicate in full transparency our CSR1 strategy  our values and our ambitions to contribute  with all our stakeholders  to building a sustainable future and a circular economy ‚Äù said Emmanuel Ladent  Chief Executive Officer of Carbios. ‚ÄúWe commit ourselves to publishing a Sustainability Report annually  as we strive to continually strengthen our business practices to have a positive impact on the world and our fellow citizens.‚ÄùCarbios‚Äô sustainability strategy is based on three pillars (governance and ethics  the environment  social and societal issues) divided into 22 priority material challenges. Each one has led to the implementation of a dedicated policy and the monitoring of specific KPIs to anchor sustainable development in the day-to-day operations and at the heart of governance.With its breakthrough technologies  Carbios has the most advanced biological solution to move the plastic and textile industries towards circularity by keeping existing plastics at their highest value for as long as possible (almost infinitely) while reducing CO 2 emissions.

Through its unique approach of combining enzymes and plastics  Carbios aims to address new consumer expectations and the challenges of a broad ecological transition by taking up a major challenge of our time: plastic and textile pollution. Carbios deconstructs any type of PET (the dominant polymer in bottles  trays  textiles made of polyester) into its basic components which can then be reused to produce new PET plastics with equivalent quality to virgin ones. This PET innovation  the first of its kind in the world  was recently recognized in a scientific paper published in front cover of the prestigious journal Nature. Carbios successfully started up its demonstration plant in Clermont-Ferrand in 2021. It has now taken another key step towards the industrialization of its process with the construction of a first-of-a-kind unit in partnership with Indorama Ventures.In 2017  Carbios and L‚ÄôOr√©al co-founded a consortium to contribute to the industrialization of its proprietary recycling technology. Committed to developing innovative solutions for sustainable development  Nestl√© Waters  PepsiCo and Suntory Beverage & Food Europe joined this consortium in April 2019. In 2022  Carbios signed an agreement with On  Patagonia  PUMA  and Salomon  to develop solutions promoting the recyclability and circularity of their products.The Company has also developed an enzymatic biodegradation technology for PLA-based (a bio sourced polymer) single-use plastics. This technology can create a new generation of plastics that are 100% compostable in domestic conditions  integrating enzymes at the heart of the plastic product.For more information  please visit www.carbios.com/en / Twitter: Carbios LinkedIn: Carbios Instagram: insidecarbiosCarbios (ISIN FR0011648716/ALCRB) is eligible for the PEA-PME  a government program allowing French residents investing in SMEs to benefit from income tax rebates.Translation is for information purposes only.In case of discrepancy between the French and the English version of this press release  the English version shall prevail1 Corporate Social Responsibility,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.87,0.13,0.0,True,English,"['First Sustainability Report', 'Environmental Responsibilities', 'Carbios', 'Commitment', 'Circularity', 'first industrial-scale enzymatic PET recycling plant', '4 million food trays SOCIAL OBJECTIVES', 'innovative plastics biorecycling technologies', 'proprietary recycling technology', 'Extra-Financial Performance Statements', 'new consumer expectations', 'broad ecological transition', 'L‚ÄôOr√©al', 'first Sustainability Report', 'Non-Financial Reporting Directive', 'lowest carbon impact', 'Chief Executive Officer', '22 priority material challenges', 'advanced biological solution', 'Life Cycle Assessment', 'local economic development', 'green chemistry company', 'new PET plastics', '3.2 million plastic bottles', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'Carbios‚Äô sustainability strategy', 'Carbios‚Äô Sustainability Report', 'Food Europe', 'Demonstration Plant', 'sustainability objectives', 'ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES', 'biological technologies', 'breakthrough technologies', 'innovative processes', '2021 Sustainability Report', 'PET innovation', 'European directive', 'CSR1 strategy', 'positive impact', 'environmental sustainability', 'GOVERNANCE OBJECTIVES', 'existing plastics', 'innovative solutions', 'full report', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'Regulatory News', 'baseline year', 'ESG) initiatives', 'industrial development', 'regulatory requirement', 'sustainable future', 'circular economy', 'Emmanuel Ladent', 'business practices', 'fellow citizens', 'three pillars', 'societal issues', 'dedicated policy', 'specific KPIs', 'sustainable development', 'textile industries', 'highest value', 'CO 2 emissions', 'relentless efforts', 'employee relations', 'several targets', 'sustainable company', 'responsible company', 'LCA) method', 'desirable company', 'indirect jobs', 'strong growth', 'employee well-being', 'psycho-social risks', 'international research', 'academic partnerships', 'scientific publications', 'inclusive company', '40% female members', 'Executive Committee', '60% independent members', 'CSR committee', 'Truffle Capital', 'unique approach', 'major challenge', 'textile pollution', 'dominant polymer', 'basic components', 'scientific paper', 'front cover', 'prestigious journal', 'key step', 'Indorama Ventures', 'Nestl√© Waters', 'Suntory Beverage', 'The C', 'full transparency', 'day operations', 'corporate governance', 'CSR governance', 'equivalent quality', 'kind unit', 'Carbios website', 'Carbios‚Äô commitment', 'CLERMONT-FERRAND', 'France', 'ALCRB', 'pioneer', 'industrialization', 'textiles', 'NFRD', 'accordance', 'requirements', 'values', 'ambitions', 'stakeholders', 'world', 'ethics', 'implementation', 'monitoring', 'heart', 'circularity', 'dedication', 'action', 'areas', 'diversity', 'inclusion', '60 tons', 'Longlaville', '150 direct', 'context', 'safety', 'training', 'management', 'prevention', 'diverse', 'Board', 'Directors', 'creation', 'compensation', 'enzymes', 'time', 'type', 'polyester', 'virgin', 'Nature', 'construction', 'consortium', 'PepsiCo', 'April', 'agreement', 'Patagonia', 'PUMA', 'Salomon', 'recyclability', 'products']",2022-12-15,2022-12-15,businesswire.com

The study aims to confirm the safety and clinical benefits provided by the Prima System and is the last clinical step before seeking market approval in Europe.The study is being conducted in leading clinical centers in France  Germany  the UK  the Netherlands  and Italy. A read-out of the PRIMAvera study's primary endpoints is expected around the end of 2023.""This is an important milestone in the clinical development of our innovative Prima System  and we are very pleased to have reached it successfully "" said Lloyd Diamond  Chief Executive Officer of Pixium Vision. ""I'd like to thank all the physicians and patients involved in the PRIMAvera study as well as the whole Pixium team for their hard work in contributing to this significant achievement. We are now looking ahead to next year's read-out on the primary endpoints. From there we expect to be able to start discussions with the European regulator in preparation for bringing this cutting-edge technology to market for the benefit of those suffering from the loss of their sight due to dry AMD. Along with the US and French feasibility studies  we expect that the data from the PRIMAvera pivotal study will also play an important supporting role in the US regulatory submission.‚ÄùStory continues‚ÄúI am proud to be leading the PRIMAvera pivotal study and of the progress we have made in opening multiple clinical sites across Europe and completing dozens of successful implantations "" said Professor Frank Holz  Scientific Coordinator of the PRIMAvera study. ""It is a testament to the skill of the surgical teams involved in the study and to the technological integrity of the Prima System that the implantations have proceeded in such an efficient and expeditious manner. We also saw better-than-expected recruitment demonstrating a strong interest among patients suffering from late-stage atrophic age-related macular degeneration in the PRIMA implant and the study as a whole. We are looking forward to next year's target read-out and to hopefully having the Prima System available to the many patients affected by dry AMD.""""The PRIMAvera pivotal study marks a major step forward in the treatment of atrophic dry AMD and it is very rewarding to see the Prima System progressing so well in a clinical setting "" said Professor Jos√©-Alain Sahel  M.D.  University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and a co-founder of Pixium Vision. ""We have great confidence in the technology as Pixium has already demonstrated how the prosthetic central vision generated by the Prima System can be used simultaneously with patients' remaining peripheral vision  indicating the technology's potential to help improve the lives of those suffering from dry AMD  who currently have no other treatment options.""The PRIMAvera study design is based on the positive data generated in a French feasibility study  showing the ability of patients with dry AMD to improve visual acuity with the Prima System. The primary efficacy endpoint of the PRIMAvera study is the proportion of subjects with an improvement of visual acuity of logMAR 0.2 or more from baseline after 12 months  and the primary safety endpoint is the number and severity of device and procedure-related serious adverse events at 12 months follow-up. The study will include three years of follow-up  with an assessment of the primary endpoints at 12 months after implantation.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

The three-city tour  which hit major cities from coast to coast  began in New York on November 9th  followed by Mexico on November 17th  and Los Angeles on December 8th providing expert insight and commentary on ways to fuel the fashion industry forward as brands and retailers continue to face pressure due to macroeconomic issues  supply chain disruptions and rising inflation.Bill McRaith  industry veteran and former executive at PVH  Walmart  and Victoria's Secret opened the series of conferences with a keynote focused on the supply chain challenges that retailers and global brands face with consumers going digital  the rise of fast fashion  inventory management and apparel waste  in addition to global factors including war and recession.‚ÄúWe are in an adapt or die moment in our industry ‚Äù said McRaith. ‚ÄúThe supply chains we have today no longer suit today‚Äôs needs. They need to be radically changed. To do that  long linear supply chains must evolve into multidimensional  dynamically optimized networks  which means unlocking the value of nearshore and onshore models. By bringing just 10% of production onshore  we can fix 100% of supply chain issues.‚ÄùThe conference was well attended across three cities by over 200 participants  and included 14 sponsors  namely platinum sponsors Kornit and Greentex  as well as sponsors SPESA  DXM  Twine  Fashion Snoops and Coresight Research.

Dec. 15  2022 The European Commission (EC) has expanded the marketing authorization for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in the European Union to treat adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis who are candidates for systemic therapy. Prurigo nodularis is a chronic  debilitating skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and its impact on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases. With this approval  Dupixent is the first and only targeted medicine specifically indicated to treat prurigo nodularis in Europe and the U.S.Naimish Patel  M.D.Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi""As the first and only targeted medicine approved to treat people living with prurigo nodularis  Dupixent has the potential to transform the standard-of-care for people in Europe living with this debilitating skin disease. In the pivotal trials  patients treated with Dupixent experienced significant improvements in key hallmarks of the disease  such as reduction in itch and achieving clearer skin  as well as broader impacts on their daily lives. This approval of Dupixent underscores our continued commitment to bringing Dupixent to patients suffering from chronic skin diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation as quickly as possible.""George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron""For the first time  patients with prurigo nodularis in Europe have a medicine that can help relieve the burden of itchy and painful nodules covering their skin  which can have a devastating impact on their day-to-day lives  both physically and mentally. Dupixent is now approved for its second dermatological disease and fourth disease overall. We remain committed to further investigating this innovative medicine for diseases ‚Äì such as chronic urticarias and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ‚Äì in which type 2 inflammation may play a role.""Story continuesThe EC decision is based on data from two Phase 3 trials  PRIME and PRIME2  evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent (PRIME n=75; PRIME2 n=78) in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis compared to placebo (PRIME n=76; PRIME2 n=82). In these trials  respectively  44% and 37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch at 12 weeks  compared to 16% and 22% for placebo. The improvement further increased at 24 weeks  with approximately three times as many Dupixent patients (60% and 58%) experiencing a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline  compared to placebo (18% and 20%).In PRIME and PRIME2  more than twice as many Dupixent patients (48% and 45%) also achieved clear or almost clear skin at 24 weeks  compared to placebo (18% and 16%). Dupixent also significantly improved health-related quality of life  while reducing measures of skin pain and symptoms of anxiety/depression from baseline at 24 weeks compared to placebo.The safety results of the trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications  with the most common side effects across indications including injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes  and eosinophilia. Adverse events more commonly observed in PN with Dupixent compared to placebo included conjunctivitis (4% vs. 1%).Dupixent was granted an additional one-year marketing protection in the EU based on recommendation by the CHMP that the medicine brings significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies for patients with prurigo nodularis.About Prurigo NodularisPrurigo nodularis is a chronic  debilitating skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and has one of the highest impacts on a patient‚Äôs quality of life among all inflammatory skin diseases dues to the extreme itch it causes. Those with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. The disease is often painful  with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin and can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term. In Europe  about 70 000 adults living with prurigo nodularis are most in need of new treatment options.About the Dupixent Prurigo Nodularis TrialsThe PRIME and PRIME2 Phase 3 double-blind  placebo-controlled trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 311 adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. In PRIME and PRIME2  the primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch from baseline (measured by a ‚â•4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] on a 0-10 scale) at 24 and 12 weeks  respectively.Additional endpoints included the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin of nodules at 24 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] on a 0-4 scale)  the proportion of patients who achieved a clinically meaningful response in both WI-NRS and IGA PN-S  improvement from baseline in health-related quality of life (measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI] on a 0-30 scale)  improvement from baseline in skin pain (measured by a Numerical Rating Scale from 0-10)  and improvement from baseline in symptoms of anxiety and depression (measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] from 0-42).About DupixentDupixent is an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In the EU for adults with prurigo nodularis  Dupixent is administered at 300 mg every two weeks  following a loading dose. It is available as both a pre-filled pen and pre-filled syringe at the 300 mg dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and prurigo nodularis  as well as investigational disease eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in the EU.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

Only 10% of the listed real estate companies worldwide have set comprehensive targets to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions on all three scopes (externally verified) by 2050  according to research by Van Lanschot Kempen.60% of listed real estate companies are still researching their commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050  according to our research. They have not formalised their research into a commitment as of yet  whilst urgent action is needed  Amongst those companies which have taken action  13% of those analysed have publicly-stated alignment to the Paris Agreement but give no detail on how this will be achieved. 17% have taken an incomplete approach whereby they have publicly stated an aim to achieve carbon neutrality but not for all material greenhouse gas emissions. Only 10% of companies analysed have committed to becoming net zero by 2050 across all material greenhouse gas emissions and have their targets externally verified. For Van Lanschot Kempen this is the complete approach every company should strive for.Van Lanschot Kempen‚Äôs Real Assets Team analysed listed real estate companies globally to assess how the sector is progressing towards the Paris Climate Change goals2. The analysis represents 92% of the total listed real estate market capitalisation constituting almost $2 trillion worth of real estate worldwide.

Only 10% of the listed real estate companies worldwide have set comprehensive targets to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions on all three scopes (externally verified) by 2050  according to research by Van Lanschot Kempen.60% of listed real estate companies are still researching their commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050  according to our research. They have not formalised their research into a commitment as of yet  whilst urgent action is needed  Amongst those companies which have taken action  13% of those analysed have publicly-stated alignment to the Paris Agreement but give no detail on how this will be achieved. 17% have taken an incomplete approach whereby they have publicly stated an aim to achieve carbon neutrality but not for all material greenhouse gas emissions. Only 10% of companies analysed have committed to becoming net zero by 2050 across all material greenhouse gas emissions and have their targets externally verified. For Van Lanschot Kempen this is the complete approach every company should strive for.Van Lanschot Kempen‚Äôs Real Assets Team analysed listed real estate companies globally to assess how the sector is progressing towards the Paris Climate Change goals2. The analysis represents 92% of the total listed real estate market capitalisation constituting almost $2 trillion worth of real estate worldwide.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Commission (EC) has expanded the marketing authorization for...,"Approval based on direct-to-Phase 3 program showing more than three times as many Dupixent patients (60% and 58%) experienced clinically meaningful itch reduction at 24 weeks compared to placebo (18% and 20%)Dupixent also significantly reduced skin lesions and improved health-related quality of life compared to placeboIn Europe  about 70 000 adults living with prurigo nodularis are most in need of new treatment optionsDupixent now approved to treat four chronic inflammatory diseases in the EUTARRYTOWN  N.Y. and PARIS  Dec. 15  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Commission (EC) has expanded the marketing authorization for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in the European Union to treat adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis who are candidates for systemic therapy. Prurigo nodularis is a chronic  debilitating skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and its impact on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases. With this approval  Dupixent is the first and only targeted medicine specifically indicated to treat prurigo nodularis in Europe and the U.S.""For the first time  patients with prurigo nodularis in Europe have a medicine that can help relieve the burden of itchy and painful nodules covering their skin  which can have a devastating impact on their day-to-day lives  both physically and mentally "" said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Dupixent is now approved for its second dermatological disease and fourth disease overall. We remain committed to further investigating this innovative medicine for diseases ‚Äì such as chronic urticarias and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ‚Äì in which type 2 inflammation may play a role.""""As the first and only targeted medicine approved to treat people living with prurigo nodularis  Dupixent has the potential to transform the standard-of-care for people in Europe living with this debilitating skin disease. In the pivotal trials  patients treated with Dupixent experienced significant improvements in key hallmarks of the disease  such as reduction in itch and achieving clearer skin  as well as broader impacts on their daily lives "" Naimish Patel  M.D. Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""This approval of Dupixent underscores our continued commitment to bringing Dupixent to patients suffering from chronic skin diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation as quickly as possible.""Story continuesThe EC decision is based on data from two Phase 3 trials  PRIME and PRIME2  evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent (PRIME n=75; PRIME2 n=78) in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis compared to placebo (PRIME n=76; PRIME2 n=82). In these trials  44% and 37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch at 12 weeks  compared to 16% and 22% for placebo  respectively. The improvement further increased at 24 weeks  with approximately three times as many Dupixent patients (60% and 58%) experiencing a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline  compared to placebo (18% and 20%).In PRIME and PRIME2  more than twice as many Dupixent patients (48% and 45%) also achieved clear or almost clear skin at 24 weeks  compared to placebo (18% and 16%). Dupixent also significantly improved health-related quality of life  while reducing measures of skin pain and symptoms of anxiety/depression from baseline at 24 weeks compared to placebo.The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications  with the most common side effects across indications including injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes and eosinophilia. Adverse events more commonly observed in prurigo nodularis with Dupixent compared to placebo included conjunctivitis (4% Dupixent and 1% placebo).About Prurigo NodularisPrurigo nodularis is a chronic  debilitating skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and has one of the highest impacts on a patient's quality of life among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch it causes. Those with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. The disease is often painful ‚Äì with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin ‚Äì and can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term. In Europe  about 70 000 adults living with prurigo nodularis are most in need of new treatment options.About the Dupixent Prurigo Nodularis TrialsThe PRIME and PRIME2 Phase 3 double-blind  placebo-controlled trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 311 adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. In PRIME and PRIME2  the primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch from baseline (measured by a ‚â•4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] on a 0-10 scale) at 24 and 12 weeks  respectively.Additional endpoints included the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin of nodules at 24 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] on a 0-4 scale)  the proportion of patients who achieved a clinically meaningful response in both WI-NRS and IGA PN-S  improvement from baseline in health-related quality of life (measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI] on a 0-30 scale)  improvement from baseline in skin pain (measured by a Numerical Rating Scale from 0-10)  and improvement from baseline in symptoms of anxiety and depression (measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] from 0-42).About DupixentDupixent is an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In the EU for adults with prurigo nodularis  Dupixent is administered at 300 mg every two weeks  following a loading dose. It is available as both a pre-filled pen and pre-filled syringe at the 300 mg dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and prurigo nodularis  as well as investigational disease eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in the EU.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb¬Æ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

On this occasion  WALLIX is also launching a program dedicated to IT and cloud service providers - the MSPs (Managed Service Providers). MSPs are key players in the digital transformation of businesses and represent a growing market. Valued at $243.33 billion in 2021  it is estimated to reach $557.10 billion by 2028  growing at a rate of 12.6%  according to Fortune Business Insights‚Ñ¢.WALLIX is evolving its Business Partner Program to meet new strategic challenges‚Ä¶WALLIX's distribution network currently includes more than 300 partners (distributors  reseller integrators  global integrators (GSIs)  and consulting firms). With the previous development plan - Ambition 21 - the objective was to commercially cover 80% of the world market  relying on partners with a strong regional influence. Today  having achieved this objective  it is time to consolidate and accelerate.To reach ‚Ç¨100M in revenues and 15% operating margin by 2025  as set out in the Unicorn 25 plan  WALLIX now values the performance of its partners and supports them in the implementation of their business plan built for WALLIX PAM4ALL  WALLIX's unified solution  which goes beyond securing privileged accounts and protects  according to the principle of least privilege  all digital access  whether human or machine.WALLIX provides teams  certifications  and marketing and technical content adapted to the target market (healthcare  industry  ESOs  public administrations  schools  etc.) and the country or region covered (United States  Canada  DACH  etc.).WALLIX is also able to help its partners to increase their skills  especially to address the specific needs of the industry. The industry is a strategic sector for WALLIX and is at the heart of the Unicorn 25 plan. Indeed  the industrial cybersecurity market is estimated to be worth $15.5 billion  with a global growth rate of 15.8% by 2027[1] according to VPA Research. WALLIX has strong expertise in this sector for many years and has just launched its OT.security by WALLIX brand. The partners who wish to do so can now benefit from specific training to have the double expertise: IT (Information Technology) and OT (Operational Technology)....and creates a program adapted to MSPs (Managed Service Providers) to address this growing marketIT and cloud service providers - MSPs (Managed Service Providers) - are an important area for WALLIX. This is a high-potential market[2] that will contribute to achieving the objectives of the Unicorn 25 plan and those of the following years. On the one hand  WALLIX can address MSPs with an offer that is particularly well adapted to their needs and those of their customers. On the other hand  many IT resellers are adopting a new business strategy and becoming MSPs. WALLIX accompanies this transformation from beginning to end.MSPs are now an essential part of our ecosystem: cloud providers  healthcare data or website hosts  telecom and internet operators  outsourcers (IT infrastructure managers)  Managed Security Service Providers (cybersecurity managers)  etc. Post-pandemic  digital transformation is accelerating. Organizations of all sizes are increasingly outsourcing the partial or total management of their IT infrastructure and digital tools (cybersecurity solutions  data storage and sharing  customer relationship management software  etc.). The goal is to reduce costs but also to gain in performance  agility and flexibility and  above all  to effectively address the shortage of cybersecurity experts by outsourcing to specialists.For MSPs  cybersecurity is becoming a real competitive advantage. Organizations will turn to providers who can meet the highest performance  security  and data protection requirements (GDPR  SecNumCloud  PAMS  HDS  PCI DSS  etc.)  and provide the best cybersecurity solutions on the market.WALLIX allows MSPs to guarantee the security of their own access to their IT infrastructure  while offering a packaged solution known as WALLIX PAM4ALL  recognized as the best PAM solution on the market by the analyst firms Gartner  KuppingerCole  Quadrant Knowledge Solutions  and Frost & Sullivan and labeled Cybersecurity Made in Europe.To support MSPs  last year WALLIX announced that it was strengthening its sales strategy for this target group and has now taken a further step. The particularity of WALLIX is to consider MSPs as full partners  and not as customers. As a result  MSPs now benefit from a dedicated partner program  which gives them access to a set of resources adapted to help them create innovative service offers  including WALLIX PAM4ALL  to conquer new markets. For example  MSPs have access to training for their engineering  sales  and customer support teams (L1-3)  as well as marketing content designed specifically for them to help them grow their business with WALLIX. They will then be able to offer different sales approaches to their customers (buy-sell) or managed services (MSP) regardless of the IT or OT environment. End customers will be able to benefit from the offer that best suits their needs at the time.""The strengthening of our Channel First strategy is a key step in the development of WALLIX. It is imperative to maintain the links with our partners who have the ambition to accompany us in this growth. We are therefore evolving our Business Partner Program to offer our partners the support they need to meet their objectives while making it a point of honor to facilitate their work as much as possible  whether in the relationship with our teams or with their customers "" says Laurent Gentil  Channel Director at WALLIX.""I am pleased that our MSP offer is taking a real turn and is taking shape through the creation of a dedicated partner program that integrates the Business Partner Program  to always respond more closely to the needs of organizations.""

The report outlines Carbios‚Äô commitment to developing environmental  social and governance (ESG) initiatives that go beyond the industrial development of its innovative plastics biorecycling technologies. Although not subject to the regulatory requirement of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD)  Carbios has nonetheless structured its report in accordance with the requirements of the European directive on Extra-Financial Performance Statements.‚ÄúThis first Sustainability Report aims to communicate in full transparency our CSR1 strategy  our values and our ambitions to contribute  with all our stakeholders  to building a sustainable future and a circular economy ‚Äù said Emmanuel Ladent  Chief Executive Officer of Carbios. ‚ÄúWe commit ourselves to publishing a Sustainability Report annually  as we strive to continually strengthen our business practices to have a positive impact on the world and our fellow citizens.‚ÄùCarbios‚Äô sustainability strategy is based on three pillars (governance and ethics  the environment  social and societal issues) divided into 22 priority material challenges. Each one has led to the implementation of a dedicated policy and the monitoring of specific KPIs to anchor sustainable development in the day-to-day operations and at the heart of governance.With its breakthrough technologies  Carbios has the most advanced biological solution to move the plastic and textile industries towards circularity by keeping existing plastics at their highest value for as long as possible (almost infinitely) while reducing CO 2 emissions.

Through its unique approach of combining enzymes and plastics  Carbios aims to address new consumer expectations and the challenges of a broad ecological transition by taking up a major challenge of our time: plastic and textile pollution. Carbios deconstructs any type of PET (the dominant polymer in bottles  trays  textiles made of polyester) into its basic components which can then be reused to produce new PET plastics with equivalent quality to virgin ones. This PET innovation  the first of its kind in the world  was recently recognized in a scientific paper published in front cover of the prestigious journal Nature. Carbios successfully started up its demonstration plant in Clermont-Ferrand in 2021. It has now taken another key step towards the industrialization of its process with the construction of a first-of-a-kind unit in partnership with Indorama Ventures.In 2017  Carbios and L‚ÄôOr√©al co-founded a consortium to contribute to the industrialization of its proprietary recycling technology. Committed to developing innovative solutions for sustainable development  Nestl√© Waters  PepsiCo and Suntory Beverage & Food Europe joined this consortium in April 2019. In 2022  Carbios signed an agreement with On  Patagonia  PUMA  and Salomon  to develop solutions promoting the recyclability and circularity of their products.The Company has also developed an enzymatic biodegradation technology for PLA-based (a bio sourced polymer) single-use plastics. This technology can create a new generation of plastics that are 100% compostable in domestic conditions  integrating enzymes at the heart of the plastic product.For more information  please visit www.carbios.com/en / Twitter: Carbios LinkedIn: Carbios Instagram: insidecarbiosCarbios (ISIN FR0011648716/ALCRB) is eligible for the PEA-PME  a government program allowing French residents investing in SMEs to benefit from income tax rebates.Translation is for information purposes only.In case of discrepancy between the French and the English version of this press release  the English version shall prevail1 Corporate Social ResponsibilityView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221214005608/en/,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.87,0.13,0.0,True,English,"['First Sustainability Report', 'Environmental Responsibilities', 'Carbios', 'Commitment', 'Circularity', 'first industrial-scale enzymatic PET recycling plant', '4 million food trays SOCIAL OBJECTIVES', 'innovative plastics biorecycling technologies', 'proprietary recycling technology', 'Extra-Financial Performance Statements', 'new consumer expectations', 'broad ecological transition', 'L‚ÄôOr√©al', 'first Sustainability Report', 'Non-Financial Reporting Directive', 'lowest carbon impact', 'Chief Executive Officer', '22 priority material challenges', 'advanced biological solution', 'Life Cycle Assessment', 'local economic development', 'green chemistry company', 'new PET plastics', '3.2 million plastic bottles', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'Carbios‚Äô sustainability strategy', 'Carbios‚Äô Sustainability Report', 'enzymatic biod', 'Food Europe', 'Demonstration Plant', 'sustainability objectives', 'ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES', 'biological technologies', 'breakthrough technologies', 'innovative processes', '2021 Sustainability Report', 'PET innovation', 'European directive', 'CSR1 strategy', 'positive impact', 'environmental sustainability', 'GOVERNANCE OBJECTIVES', 'existing plastics', 'innovative solutions', 'full report', 'Regulatory News', 'baseline year', 'ESG) initiatives', 'industrial development', 'regulatory requirement', 'sustainable future', 'circular economy', 'Emmanuel Ladent', 'business practices', 'fellow citizens', 'three pillars', 'societal issues', 'dedicated policy', 'specific KPIs', 'sustainable development', 'textile industries', 'highest value', 'CO 2 emissions', 'relentless efforts', 'employee relations', 'several targets', 'sustainable company', 'responsible company', 'LCA) method', 'desirable company', 'indirect jobs', 'strong growth', 'employee well-being', 'psycho-social risks', 'international research', 'academic partnerships', 'scientific publications', 'inclusive company', '40% female members', 'Executive Committee', '60% independent members', 'CSR committee', 'Truffle Capital', 'unique approach', 'major challenge', 'textile pollution', 'dominant polymer', 'basic components', 'scientific paper', 'front cover', 'prestigious journal', 'key step', 'Indorama Ventures', 'Nestl√© Waters', 'Suntory Beverage', 'The Company', 'full transparency', 'day operations', 'corporate governance', 'CSR governance', 'equivalent quality', 'kind unit', 'Carbios website', 'Carbios‚Äô commitment', 'ALCRB', 'pioneer', 'industrialization', 'textiles', 'NFRD', 'accordance', 'requirements', 'values', 'ambitions', 'stakeholders', 'world', 'ethics', 'implementation', 'monitoring', 'heart', 'circularity', 'dedication', 'action', 'areas', 'diversity', 'inclusion', '60 tons', 'Clermont-Ferrand', 'France', 'Longlaville', '150 direct', 'context', 'safety', 'training', 'management', 'prevention', 'diverse', 'Board', 'Directors', 'creation', 'compensation', 'enzymes', 'time', 'type', 'polyester', 'virgin', 'Nature', 'construction', 'consortium', 'PepsiCo', 'April', 'agreement', 'Patagonia', 'PUMA', 'Salomon', 'recyclability', 'products']",2022-12-15,2022-12-15,businesswireindia.com
