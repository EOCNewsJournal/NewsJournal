The Supervisory Board today approved the annual financial statements and set the date for the Annual General Meeting for 31 January 2023. The publication will take place today on the company website and subsequently in the Federal Gazette. The net loss for 2021 amounts to 3.8 million euros. The equity capital remains at around 69 million euros.Philippe Perret  CEO of fox e-mobility AG  emphasizes: ""With the MIA 2.0  we are developing an innovative electric car for individual passenger transport and for logistics applications. The demand for corresponding solutions is unbrokenly high. Financing this project is a huge challenge  which we are tackling with determination. The development of the restructuring plan and the scheduling of the Annual General Meeting are important steps on this path.""Focus on financing the development of MIA 2.0The auditor's unqualified opinion points out the material uncertainty regarding the ""going concern"". The maintenance of solvency and thus the going concern assumption depends on financial support and capitalization from external capital providers. In addition  the value of the investment in Fox Automotive Switzerland AG as well as the recoverability of the loans issued to Fox Automotive Switzerland AG depends on the realization of the business plan prepared for MIA 2.0. For the implementation of the restructuring plan  the short-term capital requirement is 0.2 million euros.In order to achieve the construction of a concept car in 2023 and subsequently a prototype for large serial production  the management is in ongoing discussions with investors and engineering firms. In addition  expenses were reduced through cost-cutting and savings measures compared to the original planning. For the 2023 financial year  the focus is on securing long-term financing for the project and subsequently on the operational implementation of the MIA 2.0 vehicle concept.Presentation of the restructuring plan at the Annual General MeetingManagement is developing a restructuring plan which will be outlined to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting scheduled for 31 January 2023. The restructuring proposal will be published thereafter in order to obtain approval from the shareholders at a subsequent Extraordinary General Meeting. The planned restructuring measures include  inter alia  the conversion of the legal form of the Company into an Irish public limited company (PLC)  which will remain listed on the D√ºsseldorf Stock Exchange with a future secondary listing on Euronext.Accordingly  an Irish subsidiary is to be established in January 2023 to prepare for a cross-border transfer of the company's seat to Ireland together with a listing on Euronext. The new corporate structure is to be implemented by April 2023. In this context  the company's largest creditor (Atlas Special Opportunities LLC) has confirmed that the framework agreement for financing via convertible bonds will remain valid (residual amount: 22 million euros) even with a new corporate structure.The 2021 annual financial statements will be published on the company's website in the course of the day at the following link: https://fox-em.com/financial-reports/.

December 2022. The Supervisory Board today approved the annual financial statements in accordance with ¬ß 172 AktG. Publication will take place today on the company website and subsequently in the Federal Gazette. The report about the annual financial statements will be made at the Annual General Meeting scheduled for 31 January 2023.The auditor's report highlights the material uncertainty relating to Going-Concerns. The maintenance of solvency and thus the going concern assumption depends on the financial support and capitalisation provided by external capital providers. In addition  the recoverability of the investment in Fox Automotive Switzerland AG as well as the loans given to it depends on the realisation of the business plan prepared for MIA 2.0.The company has a cash requirement of 1.95 million euros to maintain its going concern status until the end of 2023. In this regard  the company has already received financing commitments of 1.55 million euros  of which 1.35 million euros are conditional on a change in the corporate structure to be implemented by the second quarter of 2023. The difference of 400 thousand euros is not yet secured but a commitment is expected in the short term.The restructuring measures include the conversion of the legal form of the Company into an Irish public limited company (PLC)  which will remain listed on the D√ºsseldorf Stock Exchange with a future secondary listing on Euronext. The restructuring plan will be presented in detail at the Annual General Meeting scheduled for 31 January 2023 and will subsequently be approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting. 16-Dec-2022 CET/CEST The EQS Distribution Services include Regulatory Announcements  Financial/Corporate News and Press Releases.Archive at www.eqs-news.com,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.02,0.98,True,English,"['annual financial statements', 'Audit certificate', 'Fox', 'Concern', 'restructuring', 'D√ºsseldorf Stock Exchange', 'Irish public limited company', 'The EQS Distribution Services', 'Fox Automotive Switzerland AG', 'Key word(s', 'external capital providers', 'future secondary listing', 'Extraordinary General Meeting', 'Annual General Meeting', 'annual financial statements', 'EQS Group AG', 'unqualified audit opinion', 'going concern assumption', 'going concern status', 'The Supervisory Board', 'fox e-mobility AG', 'EQS News', 'Annual Results', 'financial support', 'Management Board', 'Audit certificate', 'inside information', 'Dr. Kleeberg', 'Federal Gazette', 'material uncertainty', 'business plan', 'cash requirement', '1.95 million euros', 'financing commitments', '1.55 million euros', '1.35 million euros', 'corporate structure', 'second quarter', '400 thousand euros', 'short term', 'legal form', 'Regulatory Announcements', 'Financial/Corporate News', 'Press Releases', 'company website', 'restructuring measures', 'restructuring plan', 'management report', 'EQS-Ad', 'hoc', 'Going-Concern', 'CEST', 'Disclosure', 'Article', 'MAR', 'Regulation', 'issuer', 'content', 'Munich', 'auditor', 'Partner', 'September', 'December', 'accordance', '¬ß 172 AktG', 'Publication', 'place', '31 January', 'maintenance', 'solvency', 'capitalisation', 'addition', 'recoverability', 'investment', 'loans', 'realisation', 'MIA', 'end', 'regard', 'difference', 'conversion', 'PLC', 'Euronext', 'detail', 'shareholders', 'Archive']",2022-12-16,2022-12-17,marketscreener.com

With +16.4% revenue growth and a significant improvement in its financial indicators  the Group is demonstrating the relevance of its redeployment and structural optimization strategy.These developments are supported by the Group's robust growth on the strong value-added Digital and Technology markets  and specifically HPC  financial IT and telecoms in Brazil. The renewal of several client listings on these markets and the major new contracts signed  particularly in Brazil  made it possible to offset the slowdown in the IT outsourcing and telecoms activities in France  as well as the withdrawal from the activities in South Africa.Alongside this  the Group's streamlining of its cost structure has contributed to a better level of agility.Lastly  the financing set up with the issue of ORNAN bonds redeemable in cash and/or new shares has enabled the Group to cover its short and medium-term cash requirements  while supporting the strengthening of its financial position.Overall  the Group's robust commercial development  its strict control over costs and its continued deleveraging made it possible to achieve a significant improvement in its financial structure and results.FIRST-HALF EARNINGS__________The Group's half-year revenues at September 30  2022 came to ‚Ç¨9.8m  up +16.4% from the first half of 2021-22 (+15.9% at constant exchange rates)  with the following breakdown: 60.6% for Digital and 39.4% for Technology  with international operations representing 23.8% of the Group's business.Current operating income is negative  coming in at ‚Ç¨(0.3)m  compared with ‚Ç¨(0.8)m for the first half of the previous year. This improvement in operational efficiency primarily reflects the progress made with the gross margin in a context of stronger value-added growth  as well as the effective management of overheads  which have been reduced for the last three half-year periods.Net income (Group share) came to ‚Ç¨(0.3)m at September 30  2022  compared with ‚Ç¨(1.4)m at September 30  2021. It includes ‚Ç¨(0.3)m of non-recurring costs linked in particular to the early exit from the lease in Trappes following the deconsolidation of the company Etud Int√©gral in 2021.FINANCIAL STRUCTURE__________After factoring in half-year earnings  shareholders' equity (Group share) is positive at September 30  2022  with ‚Ç¨2.6m  versus ‚Ç¨1.6m at March 31  2022. It includes a total of ‚Ç¨1.0m for the capital increases carried out through the conversion of 100 ORNAN bonds2 issued in connection with the financing agreement set up on September 30  2020. This financing also enabled the Group to repay part of its debt.The Group had ‚Ç¨6.6m of net financial debt at end-September 2022  down ‚Ç¨1.0m or -13.3% from March 31  2022 (‚Ç¨7.6m). It includes ‚Ç¨2.9m of financial debt  ‚Ç¨0.7m for the restatement of lease charges  ‚Ç¨3.4m of debt linked to the Eolen Group's acquisition (put and vendor loan)  ‚Ç¨0.2m for a partner current account3 and ‚Ç¨0.7m of cash.OUTLOOK__________The Group is actively moving forward with its innovation strategy  combining technology and digital  to further strengthen its positions on its high-potential markets - telecommunications  transport  renewable energies  IT and smart cities - and meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving planet by supporting institutions and businesses with their digital  ecological and energy transformation needs.GECI International is benefiting from technological partnerships  business alliances and the creativity required to support the development of its two business divisions  ramp up their convergence and roll out a robust new entrepreneurial approach with the development of new smart products and solutions for smart cities.With this in mind  the Group has embarked on a first stage by signing  in September 2022  an exclusive distribution agreement with Gertrude SAEM  a company specialized in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)  with GECI International's subsidiaries in Israel and Brazil to sell the Gertrude ITS software. This smart traffic management system optimizes public and private vehicle flows  reduces pollution and improves the safety of urban and metropolitan roads.With the innovative mindset that has guided the Group since it was founded  its expert management of complex projects  and its ability to drive progress with new technological companies  the Group aims to expand its business model to include new growth drivers  while aligning its development with a roadmap for profitable growth.Following these first-half results  the Group is forecasting double-digit growth in its full-year revenues  combined with a further improvement in its results.The half-year financial report is available on the company website (www.geci.net).NEXT DATE2022-23 full-year revenues on May 15  2023 (after close of trading)ABOUT GECI INTERNATIONAL__________‚ÄúSmart Solutions for a Smart World‚ÄùGECI International  driven by Innovation since it was founded in 1980 and combining Technology and Digital  provides advanced digital solutions and technology consulting services for major players from the Industry  Finance  Research  Services and Telecoms sectors.GECI International is also rolling out a robust new entrepreneurial approach with the development of new smart products and solutions for smart cities  thanks to an ecosystem of technological partnerships  business alliances and highly qualified capabilities around the world.GECI International is listed on the Euronext Growth Paris market.

On this occasion  WALLIX is also launching a program dedicated to IT and cloud service providers - the MSPs (Managed Service Providers). MSPs are key players in the digital transformation of businesses and represent a growing market. Valued at $243.33 billion in 2021  it is estimated to reach $557.10 billion by 2028  growing at a rate of 12.6%  according to Fortune Business Insights‚Ñ¢.WALLIX is evolving its Business Partner Program to meet new strategic challenges‚Ä¶WALLIX's distribution network currently includes more than 300 partners (distributors  reseller integrators  global integrators (GSIs)  and consulting firms). With the previous development plan - Ambition 21 - the objective was to commercially cover 80% of the world market  relying on partners with a strong regional influence. Today  having achieved this objective  it is time to consolidate and accelerate.To reach ‚Ç¨100M in revenues and 15% operating margin by 2025  as set out in the Unicorn 25 plan  WALLIX now values the performance of its partners and supports them in the implementation of their business plan built for WALLIX PAM4ALL  WALLIX's unified solution  which goes beyond securing privileged accounts and protects  according to the principle of least privilege  all digital access  whether human or machine.WALLIX provides teams  certifications  and marketing and technical content adapted to the target market (healthcare  industry  ESOs  public administrations  schools  etc.) and the country or region covered (United States  Canada  DACH  etc.).WALLIX is also able to help its partners to increase their skills  especially to address the specific needs of the industry. The industry is a strategic sector for WALLIX and is at the heart of the Unicorn 25 plan. Indeed  the industrial cybersecurity market is estimated to be worth $15.5 billion  with a global growth rate of 15.8% by 2027[1] according to VPA Research. WALLIX has strong expertise in this sector for many years and has just launched its OT.security by WALLIX brand. The partners who wish to do so can now benefit from specific training to have the double expertise: IT (Information Technology) and OT (Operational Technology)....and creates a program adapted to MSPs (Managed Service Providers) to address this growing marketIT and cloud service providers - MSPs (Managed Service Providers) - are an important area for WALLIX. This is a high-potential market[2] that will contribute to achieving the objectives of the Unicorn 25 plan and those of the following years. On the one hand  WALLIX can address MSPs with an offer that is particularly well adapted to their needs and those of their customers. On the other hand  many IT resellers are adopting a new business strategy and becoming MSPs. WALLIX accompanies this transformation from beginning to end.MSPs are now an essential part of our ecosystem: cloud providers  healthcare data or website hosts  telecom and internet operators  outsourcers (IT infrastructure managers)  Managed Security Service Providers (cybersecurity managers)  etc. Post-pandemic  digital transformation is accelerating. Organizations of all sizes are increasingly outsourcing the partial or total management of their IT infrastructure and digital tools (cybersecurity solutions  data storage and sharing  customer relationship management software  etc.). The goal is to reduce costs but also to gain in performance  agility and flexibility and  above all  to effectively address the shortage of cybersecurity experts by outsourcing to specialists.For MSPs  cybersecurity is becoming a real competitive advantage. Organizations will turn to providers who can meet the highest performance  security  and data protection requirements (GDPR  SecNumCloud  PAMS  HDS  PCI DSS  etc.)  and provide the best cybersecurity solutions on the market.WALLIX allows MSPs to guarantee the security of their own access to their IT infrastructure  while offering a packaged solution known as WALLIX PAM4ALL  recognized as the best PAM solution on the market by the analyst firms Gartner  KuppingerCole  Quadrant Knowledge Solutions  and Frost & Sullivan and labeled Cybersecurity Made in Europe.To support MSPs  last year WALLIX announced that it was strengthening its sales strategy for this target group and has now taken a further step. The particularity of WALLIX is to consider MSPs as full partners  and not as customers. As a result  MSPs now benefit from a dedicated partner program  which gives them access to a set of resources adapted to help them create innovative service offers  including WALLIX PAM4ALL  to conquer new markets. For example  MSPs have access to training for their engineering  sales  and customer support teams (L1-3)  as well as marketing content designed specifically for them to help them grow their business with WALLIX. They will then be able to offer different sales approaches to their customers (buy-sell) or managed services (MSP) regardless of the IT or OT environment. End customers will be able to benefit from the offer that best suits their needs at the time.""The strengthening of our Channel First strategy is a key step in the development of WALLIX. It is imperative to maintain the links with our partners who have the ambition to accompany us in this growth. We are therefore evolving our Business Partner Program to offer our partners the support they need to meet their objectives while making it a point of honor to facilitate their work as much as possible  whether in the relationship with our teams or with their customers "" says Laurent Gentil  Channel Director at WALLIX.""I am pleased that our MSP offer is taking a real turn and is taking shape through the creation of a dedicated partner program that integrates the Business Partner Program  to always respond more closely to the needs of organizations.""

The trend is primarily resulting from the underperformance of the Hardware line of business and the effect of an unfavourable comparison with the prior period that included contributions of ICICB licensing contracts that have since been terminated.Games : The change in Games revenue includes notably a positive FX effect  as well as the contribution of RCT games and new premium games including new titles in the Recharged series.: The change in Games revenue includes notably a positive FX effect  as well as the contribution of RCT games and new premium games including new titles in the Recharged series.

This is mainly due to the decrease in Hardware COGS resulting from the suspension of existing VCS manufacturing contracts decided in context of the revision of Atari‚Äôs hardware strategy.Current Operating Income ‚Äì Current operating income for the period stood at -‚Ç¨4.2 M  compared to -‚Ç¨2.8 M in the previous period. Research & Development and Marketing & Sales expenses decreased by ‚Ç¨1.5 M over the period in an effort to focus on games profitability and reduction in VCS marketing. General Administrative expenses increased to ‚Ç¨4.9 M due to the costs associated with the transformation  notably  legal costs and personnel costs related to the new team organisation.Operating Income ‚Äì Operating income for the period came at -‚Ç¨5.2M  notably impacted by the reversal of a provision on litigation in the amount of ‚Ç¨0.9M1  prior year royalties adjustment of ‚Ç¨0.5M and other income for a total of ‚Ç¨0.7M. These positive effects have been offset by a ‚Ç¨1.6M impairment on VCS spare parts and inventories  a ‚Ç¨0.5M depreciation on cryptocurrencies2  a ‚Ç¨0.6M impairment on Games  a ‚Ç¨0.1M provision for litigation and a ‚Ç¨0.5M write-off in hardware manufacturing contract.BALANCE SHEET SUMMARYASSETS (M‚Ç¨) H1 22/23 FY 21/22 Non-current assets 22.0 18.9 Current assets 6.7 7.0 Total assets 28.7 26.0 EQUITY & LIABILITIES (M‚Ç¨) H1 22/23 FY 21/22 Shareholders' equity 13.0 4.4 Minority interests (0.0) 0.0 Total equity 12.9 4.4 Non-current liabilities 4.6 8.0 Current liabilities 11.2 13.6 Total equity and liabilities 28.7 26.0Non-current AssetsIntangible assets increased from ‚Ç¨6.1M to ‚Ç¨8.4M over the period. This is essentially due to:+‚Ç¨1.8M increase in capitalized R&D with the continued investment in the development of new games;+‚Ç¨0.3M increase in Licenses essentially due to foreign exchange effect and the acquisition of one IP;+‚Ç¨0.2M increase in digital assets  where digital assets increased by ‚Ç¨0.7M over the period before taking into account the ‚Ç¨0.5M impairment related to cryptocurrencies that were previously recorded at historical value.Current Assets decreased by ‚Ç¨0.3M over the period. The evolution is mainly due to the ‚Ç¨1.5M decrease in inventories resulting mainly from VCS inventory depreciation including FX effect  ‚Ç¨0.6M decrease in other current assets and ‚Ç¨1.9M increase in cash and cash equivalents  in connection with the capital increase of April 2022.Non-current Liabilities decreased ‚Ç¨3.4M over the period  notably with the decrease in shareholders loans partially redeemed by debt set-off in the capital increase  for a total amount of ‚Ç¨2.9M  and the reversal of a provision for litigation for ‚Ç¨0.9M.Current Liabilities stood at ‚Ç¨11.2M  notably thanks to the ‚Ç¨2.9M decrease in trade payables resulting from the clean-up of certain working capital items with the proceeds of the capital increase. Other current liabilities represent ‚Ç¨4.8M  and include  notably  ‚Ç¨2.4M in deferred revenues from ATRI Tokens previously sold or awarded  and staff-related liabilities for ‚Ç¨2.1M.Shareholders‚Äô equity increased from ‚Ç¨4.4M to ‚Ç¨12.9M and was mainly impacted by the proceeds of the capital increase concluded in April 2022 for a total amount of ‚Ç¨12.5M and the allocation of a portion of costs of the capital increase on issuance premium for an amount of ‚Ç¨0.6M.Financial debt - As of September 30  2022 the Group had a cash position of ‚Ç¨2.5M  versus a net cash amount of ‚Ç¨0.6M on March 31  2022. Financial debt is composed of shareholder loans for a total consideration of ‚Ç¨2.5M  taking into account partial redemption by debt set-off in the capital increase for an amount of ‚Ç¨2.9M. The loans being denominated in US Dollars  financial liabilities include a ‚Ç¨0.4M FX impact.(M‚Ç¨) H1 22/23 FY 21/22 Non-current financial liabilities (2.5) (5.0) Current financial liabilities (0.1) (0.1) Financial debt (2.6) (5.2)Cash flow statement(M‚Ç¨) H1 22/23 FY 21/22 NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES (7.1) (5.8) NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES (2.6) (4.3) NET CASH PROVIDED (USED IN) BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES 9 4 7 6 Impact of changes in exchange rates 2.2 0 7 NET CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 1 9 (1 8) Net opening cash balance 0 6 2 5 Net closing cash balance 2 5 0 6 NET CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 1 9 (1 8)Digital assets holdingsAs of September 30  2022  digital assets held by the Company  recorded under intangible assets  include:972 parcels of land in the Sandbox metaverse - The historical cost of those lands is zero given the fact that when they were given there was no active market for the land. Given the high volatility of these assets (whose value changes depending in particular on the cryptocurrency environment) and an illiquid market for large assets  it is difficult to assign an aggregate value to these assets (although public indications are available on certain market places);259 million ATRI Token. As a consequence of Atari Chain  Ltd former joint venture termination  Atari does not intend to sell the ATRI Tokens it holds  nor to pursue its development in any way. Atari does not anticipate any potential revenues that would be generated by these ATRI tokens and that could impact the consolidated financial statements. In the financial statements  ATRI Token are only valued when they give rise to a sale or an allocation.As such  58 million tokens are valued for ‚Ç¨0.3M in intangible assets  corresponding mainly to bonus allocated to some employees of Atari as per July 14  2020 but not effectively transferred. Any remaining tokens are not valued in the financial statements.Portfolio of other cryptocurrencies received in context of swaps and NFT sales for a value of ‚Ç¨0.8M as of September 30  2022  taking into account an impairment to adjust for recent cryptocurrency market conditions.Additionally  Atari does not intend to sell ATRI Token or parcels of land in The Sandbox within the next twelve months.Going ConcernThe Company conducted a review of its liquidity risk based on projections of all of its four activities: Gaming  Hardware  Licensing and Blockchain. These forecasts rely on assumptions whose timing is uncertain as to their realization  particularly since the Group is developing into new and volatile industries  notably Blockchain  and the success of new initiatives isn‚Äôt guaranteed  notably Games and Hardware. Any delays in the development of these new activities  or underperformance of new initiatives  may lead to changes in revenue generation  and in turn a liquidity shortfall and additional financing requirements.Given the uncertain macro-environment for video games and blockchain  the Group considers that the implementation of its new growth strategy may require additional funding resources. Given its uncertain cash flow horizon in a context of transformation  the Company could in due course (i) enter into new tranches of shareholder loans with Irata on market terms and conditions  enabling it to meet certain short-term maturities (the Group benefits from the support of its main shareholder  Irata LLC through September 2023  formalized in a written support) and/or (ii) raise new financing  under terms and conditions and within a timeframe to be determined (including  if necessary  by way of a public offering)  to meet capital needs and refinance the Company's debt.OUTLOOKIn the second half of the year  Atari intends to continue to focus on executing its turnaround strategy and transformational efforts across all four lines of business:Games - Continue to launch new premium games leveraging Atari‚Äôs large catalog of intellectual property. Atari‚Äôs collaboration with Fig Publishing  Inc.  part of the Republic ecosystem  to co-produce certain new video games in development is expected to start in the first quarter of calendar year 2023;- Continue to launch new premium games leveraging Atari‚Äôs large catalog of intellectual property. Atari‚Äôs collaboration with Fig Publishing  Inc.  part of the Republic ecosystem  to co-produce certain new video games in development is expected to start in the first quarter of calendar year 2023; Hardware - Implementation of a new commercial strategy for VCS and launching a complementary hardware strategy via partnerships and under license agreements;- Implementation of a new commercial strategy for VCS and launching a complementary hardware strategy via partnerships and under license agreements; Licensing - Continued development of licensing opportunities with the support of a brand licensing agency across multiple geographies and verticals;- Continued development of licensing opportunities with the support of a brand licensing agency across multiple geographies and verticals; Blockchain - Continued development of Atari‚Äôs Web3 ecosystem and Atari X community  including partnerships and collaborations with leading Web3 partners as well as new NFT initiatives.It is  at this stage  too early to expect the turnaround strategy to have a significant impact on revenue and profitability. In a challenging macro-environment for video games and blockchain initiatives  Atari intends to continue focusing on executing its roadmap and transforming its operations across all four lines of business.New Token UpdateIn April of 2022 Atari announced plans to investigate creating a new token as a component in its blockchain roadmap. This project still remains at an early stage of its development as Atari intends to thoroughly consider the various structuring options available and regulatory framework  as well as current uncertainty around the blockchain market environment  in order to make this project relevant for its community of fans and partners. Further announcements on this project may be made in the course of Atari‚Äôs next fiscal year.The semi-annual financial report is available on the website of the Group and has been filed today with the ‚ÄúAutorit√© des march√©s financiers‚Äù (AMF).About ATARIAtari is an interactive entertainment company and an iconic gaming industry brand that transcends generations and audiences.

DECEMBER 16  2022 The European Medicines Agency‚Äôs Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion  recommending the approval of Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat adults and adolescents with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). This positive opinion covers those who are 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg  and inadequately controlled by  are intolerant to or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months. In May 2022  Dupixent 300 mg weekly was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg.EoE is a chronic  progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and adolescents with EoE demonstrate that interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. For people with EoE  swallowing even small amounts of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. They are often left to contend with the frustration and anxiety of a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid  a poor quality of life and a higher risk of depression. In cases where EoE causes the esophagus to narrow  forced and potentially painful dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed. In severe cases  a feeding tube may be the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by 52-week data from a Phase 3 trial consisting of three parts ‚Äì Part A and Part B investigated Dupixent 300 mg weekly compared to placebo for 24 weeks  and Part C observed patients from Parts A and B  all of whom were on Dupixent  having continued on or switched to Dupixent for an additional 28 weeks. The results demonstrated Dupixent-treated patients experienced improvements in their ability to swallow as early as four weeks  as well as histological disease remission  improvements in abnormal endoscopic findings of the esophagus and cellular improvements at 24 weeks compared to placebo  with outcomes maintained up to one year. The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included infections.The use of Dupixent in adults and adolescents with EoE is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and prurigo nodularis  as well as investigational diseases such as EoE in the EU.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and prurigo nodularis  as well as investigational diseases such as EoE in the EU.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion  recommending the approval of Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat adults and adolescents with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). This positive opinion covers those who are 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg  and inadequately controlled by  are intolerant to or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months. In May 2022  Dupixent 300 mg weekly was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg.EoE is a chronic  progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and adolescents with EoE demonstrate that interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. For people with EoE  swallowing even small amounts of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. They are often left to contend with the frustration and anxiety of a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid  a poor quality of life and a higher risk of depression. In cases where EoE causes the esophagus to narrow  forced and potentially painful dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed. In severe cases  a feeding tube may be the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by 52-week data from a Phase 3 trial consisting of three parts ‚Äì Part A and Part B investigated Dupixent 300 mg weekly compared to placebo for 24 weeks  and Part C observed patients from Parts A and B  all of whom were on Dupixent  having continued on or switched to Dupixent for an additional 28 weeks. The results demonstrated Dupixent-treated patients experienced improvements in their ability to swallow as early as four weeks  as well as histological disease remission  improvements in abnormal endoscopic findings of the esophagus and cellular improvements at 24 weeks compared to placebo  with outcomes maintained up to one year. The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included infections.The use of Dupixent in adults and adolescents with EoE is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and prurigo nodularis  as well as investigational diseases such as EoE in the EU.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb¬Æ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

15034,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/as-investors-sour-on-irish-property-housing-output-faces-fresh-risks-42226029.html,As investors sour on Irish property  housing output faces fresh risks,When considered on their merits  Irish listed property and construction firms should be coveted by investors.,When considered on their merits  Irish listed property and construction firms should be coveted by investors.A well-documented persistent demand for homes has pushed house prices back to boom-time levels while residential rents have never been higher.Yet the shares of Ires Reit  Cairn Homes and Glenveagh Properties have all underperformed the market this year and are among Euronext Dublin‚Äôs worst stocks in 2022.Analysts say investors are steering clear over worries about pricing  margins and volume in the sector  as input cost inflation and higher interest rates push the profitability threshold higher. It hasn‚Äôt been a good year for Reits globally which have experienced their worst year on record apart from in the global financial crises.Indeed  the overall construction market has stalled in Ireland  with activity levels dropping in recent months. Housing commencements are down after a strong start to the year and completions for 2023 are likely to decline.Take Ires Reit as an example. The biggest landlord in the country has 4 000 units  99.3pc of which are let. The net asset value of this portfolio is about ‚Ç¨900m  yet the market capitalisation of the company is not even ‚Ç¨600m. The stock has endured a torrid year  falling 37pc since the start of January.Reits tend to track equity markets more than property markets  so when markets are down  a gap will open between price and the value of assets  spurring transactions.All were taken private by canny buyers who saw the opportunity to buy property and rental income streams on the cheapThis is what happened to all the commercial property Reits on the Irish market. All were taken private by canny buyers who saw the opportunity to buy property and rental income streams on the cheap.A combination of deteriorating economic conditions and the change in yield dynamics have altered the conditions that gave birth to Reits in the first place.Reits were introduced after the financial crisis when there were a lot of cheap buying opportunities in Irish property but not a lot of capital or liquidity. They solved both problems ‚Äì with generous tax breaks thrown in.But they also happened in a world of zero interest rates  making leverage cheap and yields above the risk-free rate easier to come by.Ires‚Äôs 5.6pc yield may simply not look as attractive in a world where European Central Bank borrowing rates have risen to 2.5pc in less than six months and still have further to go  according to ECB president Christine Lagarde.That certainly helps explain why apartment building has ground to a half after a year and a half where multifamily units accounted for most of the net increase in Irish housing.Higher costs from materials and wage inflation ‚Äì as well as labour shortages ‚Äì are making it harder to build apartments profitably to meet continued intense demand. Meanwhile  zoning and planning regulations favour precisely that kind of development over houses.That means the industry is at something of an impasse: the opportunity is there  but the means to exploit it are lacking.Expand Close Stephen Garvey  CEO of Glenveagh / FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp Stephen Garvey  CEO of GlenveaghThat‚Äôs certainly the argument of Glenveagh CEO Stephen Garvey  who said in September that the Government would have to relax planning rules to allow for more suburban houses instead of apartment blocks.There are indications from Government that Garvey may get his wish for less rigid regulations allowing more of his preferred ‚Äòown door‚Äô housing rather than capital intensive apartment developments.It‚Äôs instructive to look at Glenveagh‚Äôs margins for clues to what is driving investor preferences and Garvey‚Äôs complaints.The housebuilder had healthy margins of 16.5pc at the half-year  but apartments delivered just 15pc while suburban houses came in at 17.3pc  making Glenveagh‚Äôs preferred housing type far more profitable than the apartments favoured by the planning system.While help on the planning laws may take some time to arrive  the Central Bank gave housebuilders a boost in October by loosening mortgage lending rules  allowing borrowers to take on 14pc more debt from next year.Cairn and Glenveagh shares bounced on the news and both have recovered somewhat from dismal lows at the end of the third quarter.Going forward  their fortunes may depend ‚Äì ironically ‚Äì on how the banks continue to grow the mortgage market amid rapidly rising rates.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion  recommending the approval of Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat adults and adolescents with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). This positive opinion covers those who are 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg  and inadequately controlled by  are intolerant to or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months. In May 2022  Dupixent 300 mg weekly was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg.EoE is a chronic  progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and adolescents with EoE demonstrate that interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. For people with EoE  swallowing even small amounts of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. They are often left to contend with the frustration and anxiety of a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid  a poor quality of life and a higher risk of depression. In cases where EoE causes the esophagus to narrow  forced and potentially painful dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed. In severe cases  a feeding tube may be the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by 52-week data from a Phase 3 trial consisting of three parts ‚Äì Part A and Part B investigated Dupixent 300 mg weekly compared to placebo for 24 weeks  and Part C observed patients from Parts A and B  all of whom were on Dupixent  having continued on or switched to Dupixent for an additional 28 weeks. The results demonstrated Dupixent-treated patients experienced improvements in their ability to swallow as early as four weeks  as well as histological disease remission  improvements in abnormal endoscopic findings of the esophagus and cellular improvements at 24 weeks compared to placebo  with outcomes maintained up to one year. The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included infections.The use of Dupixent in adults and adolescents with EoE is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and prurigo nodularis  as well as investigational diseases such as EoE in the EU.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb¬Æ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

15036,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-11549059/Microsoft-deal-proves-London-king-stock-markets-NOT-Paris.html,Microsoft deal that proves London is king of the stock markets - NOT Paris,It has once again taken an overseas entrepreneur leading a great British corporation to recognise the City's global leadership as a financial centre,A landmark ¬£1.4billion deal between Microsoft's Satya Nadella and the London Stock Exchange Group's ebullient chief executive David Schwimmer was finally concluded in a flurry of online video calls between the two leaders last weekend.As soon as the loose strings were tied up  Microsoft's top commercial officer Judson Althoff caught the red eye to London for a handshake on the steps of St Paul's Cathedral for the epoch-making deal between Europe's leading stock market and financial data repository and America's pioneering ¬£1.5trillion computing and software giant.The new relationship didn't just happen. The London exchange and Microsoft have put in hours behind the scenes  involving hundreds of engineers on both sides of the Atlantic  to bring the ambitions of the two companies closer together.Deal: The London Stock Exchange's David Schwimmer  left  and Judson AlthoffThe talks 'began over a year ago and involved countless virtual calls on Teams between experts'  Schwimmer tells The Mail on Sunday. For the former Goldman Sachs banker it is another transformational deal that follows the American's blockbuster ¬£22billion takeover of Refinitiv  the former Reuters data and trading arm  last year.In a post-Brexit era  when so many UK companies have shown a reluctance to invest  it has once again taken an overseas entrepreneur leading a great British corporation to recognise the City's global leadership as a financial centre ‚Äì one now ready to take advantage of the freedoms offered by the UK's new status in the world. Instead of allowing itself to be a seven-stone weakling  there for the taking by would-be buyers  the LSE has robustly rejected all comers over two decades.Successive chief executives Dame Clara Furse and Xavier Rolet largely stood firm against wooing from Deutsche Borse  Nasdaq  the Hong Kong Stock Exchange  and chose to go it alone.Under Schwimmer  the LSE has ballooned into a ¬£45billion behemoth valued more highly than each of Britain's high street banks  with the exception of under-siege HSBC.There are those keen to drag London's trading and information powerhouse crown from its head. Data rival Bloomberg trumpeted Euronext and the Paris Bourse as having overtaken London in cash trading of shares. Schwimmer is irritated by exaggerations built on sloppy data.But is the French CAC All-Tradable index really overtaking the FTSE All-Share?He tells me the Paris claim was based on 'just a few days trading in November 2022'. Those making the case for Paris's superiority excluded from their calculations 'international funds  ETFs (ExchangeTraded Funds)  IPOs (Initial Public Offerings ‚Äì or flotations) on the LSE  capital raising and much else ' he argues. As the European Union focuses on 20th Century cash trading  and launches a campaign to repatriate a proportion of derivatives trading and clearing to the Continent  the LSE is steaming off in new directions.The deal with Microsoft not only puts the LSE on the 'cloud'  helping to make it more flexible and efficient  it also speeds up London's capability in processing and data analytics. The Microsoft alliance parallels 21st Century deals in the US between Nasdaq and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange with Silicon Valley  giving them access to cloud and the best tech processing.At the outset the LSE has agreed to relatively modest spending of $2.8billion (¬£2.3billion) in its cloud computing capacity over the next decade. Microsoft believes there is at least $5billion to be harvested.The partnership with Microsoft also enables the LSE  through Refinitiv  to step up its battle with Bloomberg and other data providers in the trading rooms and on the desks of investment bankers  hedge funds and brokers. It is designed to spew out new products  too.As former Wall Street banker and writer Michael Lewis demonstrated in his book Flash Boys  speed is of the essence and provides an edge in financial trading. The arrival of Big Tech in market dealings  data and analytics is a new frontier.For the LSE it has been a long journey from its origins in the coffee shops in the narrow lanes of the Square Mile in 1698. The stock market itself has become more of an adjunct to its ability to process  analyse and aggregate financial data across the planet.The LSE also has capability in foreign exchange  fixed interest and derivatives trading alongside Europe's dominant site for settling complex trades ‚Äì the London Clearing House.Plainly the world of cash trading is at the core of what London stands for and Schwimmer takes credit for grabbing a decent share of IPOs and capital raising in a year when markets across the world have suffered from extreme volatility.Schwimmer and the LSE  with a Microsoft techie now on the board  can genuinely claim to be the City's first institution to take advantage of new freedoms and reach across the Atlantic and to the Far East.The arrival of Silicon Valley in the world of exchanges and financial data may give regulators  concerned about the power of big data  cause for pause. But the rocket to trades on the cloud has already left the launch pad.,neutral,0.12,0.87,0.01,mixed,0.15,0.12,0.73,True,English,"['Microsoft deal', 'stock markets', 'London', 'king', 'Paris', 'Successive chief executives Dame Clara Furse', 'ebullient chief executive David Schwimmer', 'French CAC All-Tradable index', 'former Goldman Sachs banker', 'former Wall Street banker', 'Hong Kong Stock Exchange', 'London Stock Exchange Group', '20th Century cash trading', 'The London Stock Exchange', 'high street banks', '21st Century deals', 'Chicago Mercantile Exchange', 'online video calls', 'top commercial officer', 'countless virtual calls', 'blockbuster ¬£22billion takeover', 'great British corporation', 'information powerhouse crown', 'Initial Public Offerings', 'writer Michael Lewis', 'former Reuters data', 'leading stock market', 'other data providers', 'The London exchange', 'London Clearing House', 'landmark ¬£1.4billion deal', 'financial data repository', 'many UK companies', 'best tech processing', 'Data rival Bloomberg', 'The Microsoft alliance', 'cloud computing capacity', 'foreign exchange', 'The Mail', 'two companies', 'Big Tech', 'financial trading', 'market dealings', 'sloppy data', 'big data', 'financial centre', 'trading arm', 'trading rooms', 'Satya Nadella', 'two leaders', 'loose strings', 'Judson Althoff', 'red eye', 'St Paul', 'pioneering ¬£1.5trillion', 'software giant', 'new relationship', 'post-Brexit era', 'overseas entrepreneur', 'global leadership', 'new status', 'seven-stone weakling', 'two decades', 'Xavier Rolet', 'Deutsche Borse', '¬£45billion behemoth', 'FTSE All-Share', 'international funds', 'ExchangeTraded Funds', 'capital raising', 'European Union', 'new directions', 'Silicon Valley', 'modest spending', 'next decade', 'investment bankers', 'hedge funds', 'new products', 'Flash Boys', 'new frontier', 'long journey', 'coffee shops', 'narrow lanes', 'Square Mile', 'fixed interest', 'dominant site', 'decent share', 'extreme volatility', 'first institution', 'Far East', 'The LSE', 'epoch-making deal', 'transformational deal', 'data analytics', 'Paris Bourse', 'Paris claim', 'complex trades', 'new freedoms', 'Microsoft techie', 'flurry', 'handshake', 'steps', 'Cathedral', 'America', 'hours', 'scenes', 'hundreds', 'engineers', 'sides', 'Atlantic', 'ambitions', 'talks', 'Teams', 'experts', 'Sunday', 'Refinitiv', 'reluctance', 'advantage', 'world', 'buyers', 'comers', 'Nasdaq', 'Britain', 'exception', 'siege', 'HSBC', 'head', 'Euronext', 'shares', 'exaggerations', 'days', 'November', 'case', 'superiority', 'calculations', 'ETFs', 'IPOs', 'flotations', 'campaign', 'proportion', 'derivatives', 'Continent', 'capability', 'access', 'outset', 'partnership', 'battle', 'desks', 'brokers', 'book', 'speed', 'essence', 'arrival', 'origins', 'adjunct', 'planet', 'core', 'credit', 'year', 'markets', 'board', 'exchanges', 'regulators', 'cause', 'pause', 'rocket']",2022-12-17,2022-12-17,thisismoney.co.uk
