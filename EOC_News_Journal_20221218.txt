15034,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/as-investors-sour-on-irish-property-housing-output-faces-fresh-risks-42226029.html,As investors sour on Irish property  housing output faces fresh risks,When considered on their merits  Irish listed property and construction firms should be coveted by investors.,When considered on their merits  Irish listed property and construction firms should be coveted by investors.A well-documented persistent demand for homes has pushed house prices back to boom-time levels while residential rents have never been higher.Yet the shares of Ires Reit  Cairn Homes and Glenveagh Properties have all underperformed the market this year and are among Euronext Dublin’s worst stocks in 2022.Analysts say investors are steering clear over worries about pricing  margins and volume in the sector  as input cost inflation and higher interest rates push the profitability threshold higher. It hasn’t been a good year for Reits globally which have experienced their worst year on record apart from in the global financial crises.Indeed  the overall construction market has stalled in Ireland  with activity levels dropping in recent months. Housing commencements are down after a strong start to the year and completions for 2023 are likely to decline.Take Ires Reit as an example. The biggest landlord in the country has 4 000 units  99.3pc of which are let. The net asset value of this portfolio is about €900m  yet the market capitalisation of the company is not even €600m. The stock has endured a torrid year  falling 37pc since the start of January.Reits tend to track equity markets more than property markets  so when markets are down  a gap will open between price and the value of assets  spurring transactions.All were taken private by canny buyers who saw the opportunity to buy property and rental income streams on the cheapThis is what happened to all the commercial property Reits on the Irish market. All were taken private by canny buyers who saw the opportunity to buy property and rental income streams on the cheap.A combination of deteriorating economic conditions and the change in yield dynamics have altered the conditions that gave birth to Reits in the first place.Reits were introduced after the financial crisis when there were a lot of cheap buying opportunities in Irish property but not a lot of capital or liquidity. They solved both problems – with generous tax breaks thrown in.But they also happened in a world of zero interest rates  making leverage cheap and yields above the risk-free rate easier to come by.Ires’s 5.6pc yield may simply not look as attractive in a world where European Central Bank borrowing rates have risen to 2.5pc in less than six months and still have further to go  according to ECB president Christine Lagarde.That certainly helps explain why apartment building has ground to a half after a year and a half where multifamily units accounted for most of the net increase in Irish housing.Higher costs from materials and wage inflation – as well as labour shortages – are making it harder to build apartments profitably to meet continued intense demand. Meanwhile  zoning and planning regulations favour precisely that kind of development over houses.That means the industry is at something of an impasse: the opportunity is there  but the means to exploit it are lacking.Expand Close Stephen Garvey  CEO of Glenveagh / FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp Stephen Garvey  CEO of GlenveaghThat’s certainly the argument of Glenveagh CEO Stephen Garvey  who said in September that the Government would have to relax planning rules to allow for more suburban houses instead of apartment blocks.There are indications from Government that Garvey may get his wish for less rigid regulations allowing more of his preferred ‘own door’ housing rather than capital intensive apartment developments.It’s instructive to look at Glenveagh’s margins for clues to what is driving investor preferences and Garvey’s complaints.The housebuilder had healthy margins of 16.5pc at the half-year  but apartments delivered just 15pc while suburban houses came in at 17.3pc  making Glenveagh’s preferred housing type far more profitable than the apartments favoured by the planning system.While help on the planning laws may take some time to arrive  the Central Bank gave housebuilders a boost in October by loosening mortgage lending rules  allowing borrowers to take on 14pc more debt from next year.Cairn and Glenveagh shares bounced on the news and both have recovered somewhat from dismal lows at the end of the third quarter.Going forward  their fortunes may depend – ironically – on how the banks continue to grow the mortgage market amid rapidly rising rates. The Irish banks have had a stellar year on the stock market  by contrast  suggesting investors are betting on a profitable 2023. Whether their good fortune spills over into property shares remains to be seen.​,negative,0.0,0.01,0.99,mixed,0.3,0.08,0.62,True,English,"['Irish property', 'housing output', 'fresh risks', 'investors', 'European Central Bank borrowing rates', 'ECB president Christine Lagarde', 'capital intensive apartment developments', 'zero interest rates', 'rental income streams', 'generous tax breaks', 'higher interest rates', 'input cost inflation', 'global financial crises', 'Glenveagh CEO Stephen Garvey', 'deteriorating economic conditions', 'cheap buying opportunities', 'mortgage lending rules', 'overall construction market', 'net asset value', 'less rigid regulations', 'preferred housing type', 'Irish listed property', 'commercial property Reits', 'rising rates', 'apartment building', 'apartment blocks', 'construction firms', 'financial crisis', 'net increase', 'Higher costs', 'wage inflation', 'planning regulations', 'planning rules', 'mortgage market', 'Irish housing', 'Housing commencements', 'door’ housing', 'Irish market', 'Irish property', 'persistent demand', 'house prices', 'boom-time levels', 'residential rents', 'Euronext Dublin', 'worst stocks', 'profitability threshold', 'activity levels', 'recent months', 'biggest landlord', 'market capitalisation', 'canny buyers', 'yield dynamics', 'first place', 'risk-free rate', '5.6pc yield', 'six months', 'labour shortages', 'intense demand', 'investor preferences', 'planning system', 'planning laws', 'dismal lows', 'third quarter', 'good fortune', 'Glenveagh Properties', 'good year', 'worst year', 'torrid year', 'next year', 'stellar year', 'Irish banks', 'Ires Reit', 'equity markets', 'property markets', 'suburban houses', 'property shares', 'strong start', 'multifamily units', 'stock market', 'Glenveagh shares', 'healthy margins', 'Cairn Homes', '4,000 units', 'merits', 'investors', 'Analysts', 'worries', 'pricing', 'volume', 'sector', 'record', 'Ireland', 'completions', 'example', 'country', '99.3pc', 'portfolio', 'company', 'January', 'gap', 'assets', 'transactions', 'opportunity', 'combination', 'change', 'birth', 'lot', 'liquidity', 'problems', 'world', 'leverage', 'yields', '2.5pc', 'ground', 'half', 'materials', 'apartments', 'continued', 'zoning', 'kind', 'industry', 'something', 'impasse', 'means', 'Facebook', 'Twitter', 'Email', 'Whatsapp', 'argument', 'September', 'Government', 'indications', 'wish', 'own', 'clues', 'complaints', 'housebuilder', '16.5pc', '17.3pc', 'help', 'boost', 'October', 'borrowers', '14pc', 'debt', 'news', 'fortunes', 'contrast', 'profitable 2023']",2022-12-17,2022-12-18,independent.ie

15040,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-11549059/Microsoft-deal-proves-London-king-stock-markets-NOT-Paris.html,Microsoft deal that proves London is king of the stock markets - NOT Paris,It has once again taken an overseas entrepreneur leading a great British corporation to recognise the City's global leadership as a financial centre,A landmark £1.4billion deal between Microsoft's Satya Nadella and the London Stock Exchange Group's ebullient chief executive David Schwimmer was finally concluded in a flurry of online video calls between the two leaders last weekend.As soon as the loose strings were tied up  Microsoft's top commercial officer Judson Althoff caught the red eye to London for a handshake on the steps of St Paul's Cathedral for the epoch-making deal between Europe's leading stock market and financial data repository and America's pioneering £1.5trillion computing and software giant.The new relationship didn't just happen. The London exchange and Microsoft have put in hours behind the scenes  involving hundreds of engineers on both sides of the Atlantic  to bring the ambitions of the two companies closer together.Deal: The London Stock Exchange's David Schwimmer  left  and Judson AlthoffThe talks 'began over a year ago and involved countless virtual calls on Teams between experts'  Schwimmer tells The Mail on Sunday. For the former Goldman Sachs banker it is another transformational deal that follows the American's blockbuster £22billion takeover of Refinitiv  the former Reuters data and trading arm  last year.In a post-Brexit era  when so many UK companies have shown a reluctance to invest  it has once again taken an overseas entrepreneur leading a great British corporation to recognise the City's global leadership as a financial centre – one now ready to take advantage of the freedoms offered by the UK's new status in the world. Instead of allowing itself to be a seven-stone weakling  there for the taking by would-be buyers  the LSE has robustly rejected all comers over two decades.Successive chief executives Dame Clara Furse and Xavier Rolet largely stood firm against wooing from Deutsche Borse  Nasdaq  the Hong Kong Stock Exchange  and chose to go it alone.Under Schwimmer  the LSE has ballooned into a £45billion behemoth valued more highly than each of Britain's high street banks  with the exception of under-siege HSBC.There are those keen to drag London's trading and information powerhouse crown from its head. Data rival Bloomberg trumpeted Euronext and the Paris Bourse as having overtaken London in cash trading of shares. Schwimmer is irritated by exaggerations built on sloppy data.But is the French CAC All-Tradable index really overtaking the FTSE All-Share?He tells me the Paris claim was based on 'just a few days trading in November 2022'. Those making the case for Paris's superiority excluded from their calculations 'international funds  ETFs (ExchangeTraded Funds)  IPOs (Initial Public Offerings – or flotations) on the LSE  capital raising and much else ' he argues. As the European Union focuses on 20th Century cash trading  and launches a campaign to repatriate a proportion of derivatives trading and clearing to the Continent  the LSE is steaming off in new directions.The deal with Microsoft not only puts the LSE on the 'cloud'  helping to make it more flexible and efficient  it also speeds up London's capability in processing and data analytics. The Microsoft alliance parallels 21st Century deals in the US between Nasdaq and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange with Silicon Valley  giving them access to cloud and the best tech processing.At the outset the LSE has agreed to relatively modest spending of $2.8billion (£2.3billion) in its cloud computing capacity over the next decade. Microsoft believes there is at least $5billion to be harvested.The partnership with Microsoft also enables the LSE  through Refinitiv  to step up its battle with Bloomberg and other data providers in the trading rooms and on the desks of investment bankers  hedge funds and brokers. It is designed to spew out new products  too.As former Wall Street banker and writer Michael Lewis demonstrated in his book Flash Boys  speed is of the essence and provides an edge in financial trading. The arrival of Big Tech in market dealings  data and analytics is a new frontier.For the LSE it has been a long journey from its origins in the coffee shops in the narrow lanes of the Square Mile in 1698. The stock market itself has become more of an adjunct to its ability to process  analyse and aggregate financial data across the planet.The LSE also has capability in foreign exchange  fixed interest and derivatives trading alongside Europe's dominant site for settling complex trades – the London Clearing House.Plainly the world of cash trading is at the core of what London stands for and Schwimmer takes credit for grabbing a decent share of IPOs and capital raising in a year when markets across the world have suffered from extreme volatility.Schwimmer and the LSE  with a Microsoft techie now on the board  can genuinely claim to be the City's first institution to take advantage of new freedoms and reach across the Atlantic and to the Far East.The arrival of Silicon Valley in the world of exchanges and financial data may give regulators  concerned about the power of big data  cause for pause. But the rocket to trades on the cloud has already left the launch pad.,neutral,0.12,0.87,0.01,mixed,0.15,0.12,0.73,True,English,"['Microsoft deal', 'stock markets', 'London', 'king', 'Paris', 'Successive chief executives Dame Clara Furse', 'ebullient chief executive David Schwimmer', 'French CAC All-Tradable index', 'former Goldman Sachs banker', 'former Wall Street banker', 'Hong Kong Stock Exchange', 'London Stock Exchange Group', '20th Century cash trading', 'The London Stock Exchange', 'high street banks', '21st Century deals', 'Chicago Mercantile Exchange', 'online video calls', 'top commercial officer', 'countless virtual calls', 'blockbuster £22billion takeover', 'great British corporation', 'information powerhouse crown', 'Initial Public Offerings', 'writer Michael Lewis', 'former Reuters data', 'leading stock market', 'other data providers', 'The London exchange', 'London Clearing House', 'landmark £1.4billion deal', 'financial data repository', 'many UK companies', 'best tech processing', 'Data rival Bloomberg', 'The Microsoft alliance', 'cloud computing capacity', 'foreign exchange', 'The Mail', 'two companies', 'Big Tech', 'financial trading', 'market dealings', 'sloppy data', 'big data', 'financial centre', 'trading arm', 'trading rooms', 'Satya Nadella', 'two leaders', 'loose strings', 'Judson Althoff', 'red eye', 'St Paul', 'pioneering £1.5trillion', 'software giant', 'new relationship', 'post-Brexit era', 'overseas entrepreneur', 'global leadership', 'new status', 'seven-stone weakling', 'two decades', 'Xavier Rolet', 'Deutsche Borse', '£45billion behemoth', 'FTSE All-Share', 'international funds', 'ExchangeTraded Funds', 'capital raising', 'European Union', 'new directions', 'Silicon Valley', 'modest spending', 'next decade', 'investment bankers', 'hedge funds', 'new products', 'Flash Boys', 'new frontier', 'long journey', 'coffee shops', 'narrow lanes', 'Square Mile', 'fixed interest', 'dominant site', 'decent share', 'extreme volatility', 'first institution', 'Far East', 'The LSE', 'epoch-making deal', 'transformational deal', 'data analytics', 'Paris Bourse', 'Paris claim', 'complex trades', 'new freedoms', 'Microsoft techie', 'flurry', 'handshake', 'steps', 'Cathedral', 'America', 'hours', 'scenes', 'hundreds', 'engineers', 'sides', 'Atlantic', 'ambitions', 'talks', 'Teams', 'experts', 'Sunday', 'Refinitiv', 'reluctance', 'advantage', 'world', 'buyers', 'comers', 'Nasdaq', 'Britain', 'exception', 'siege', 'HSBC', 'head', 'Euronext', 'shares', 'exaggerations', 'days', 'November', 'case', 'superiority', 'calculations', 'ETFs', 'IPOs', 'flotations', 'campaign', 'proportion', 'derivatives', 'Continent', 'capability', 'access', 'outset', 'partnership', 'battle', 'desks', 'brokers', 'book', 'speed', 'essence', 'arrival', 'origins', 'adjunct', 'planet', 'core', 'credit', 'year', 'markets', 'board', 'exchanges', 'regulators', 'cause', 'pause', 'rocket']",2022-12-17,2022-12-18,thisismoney.co.uk
