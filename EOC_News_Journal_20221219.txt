In order to maximize the long-term value of our rich R&D portfolio and in-line with our strategic priorities  we intend to boost in 2023 our R&D investment to around 8.5% of our revenues. In parallel  and in order to prepare for the future  to accompany Virbac’s growth and to increase our medium-term productivity we intend to increase our capital expenditure investments in 2023 to around €100 million. This will include possible € 20-25 million one-time real estate investments in France that will allow us to expand our footprint to prepare for the development of our operations for the next decades. Finally  we continue to execute on the other dimensions of our 2030 Strategic Plan including our commercial focus on our Virbac Busters  the geo-extensions of our key products as well as our entry into new markets such as petfood and livestock in the USA  or parasiticides and petfood in China.As such  in 2023  the ratio of “current operating income  before depreciation of assets arising from acquisitions” (EBIT Adjusted) to “revenue” should consolidate between 13% to 14% at constant exchange rates with a growth in revenue at constant rates and scope anticipated between 4% to 6%. This deterioration in our EBIT adjusted ratio is primarily the result of our deliberate acceleration of our R&D investments as a ratio to revenues since the beginning of 2022 representing  in 2023  ~+2 percentage points compared to 2021 and +~1 percentage point compared to 2022. Consequently  we anticipate our cash position to remain constant at the end of 2023 when compared to 2022.In the medium term  our objective of reaching 20% of EBIT adjusted ratio by 2025-2030 remains unchanged with the assumption of a R&D ""ratio to revenues"" at around 6.5% (vs around 8.5%1 expected in 2023 given our deliberate additional investments). The timing continues to be dependent upon mainly external growth contribution (M&A)  success rate of our R&D projects  as well as top-line dynamics (impacted by external market conditions).Story continuesA lifelong commitment to animal healthAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

15079,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/scor-renews-contingent-capital-facility-163700633.html,SCOR renews its contingent capital facility,Press Release December 19  2022 - N° 20 SCOR renews its contingent capital facility SCOR announces the renewal  for three years  of a contingent capital...,SCORPress ReleaseDecember 19  2022 - N° 20SCOR renews its contingent capital facilitySCOR announces the renewal  for three years  of a contingent capital facility that would provide the Group with additional capital of up to EUR 300 million coverage in case of extreme events (natural catastrophe or life events impacting mortality) or a significant fall in the share price.The facility aims to protect the Group’s share capital and therefore its solvency.This is the fourth renewal of this innovative facility  which was introduced in January 2011.The contingent capital facility rests on share subscription warrants  issued by SCOR and subscribed by J.P. Morgan  which will be exercised automatically in the scenarios set out in the agreement.The period covered by the renewed facility runs from January 1  2023  to December 31  2025. In the absence of any triggering event during this period  no shares will be exercised. SCOR has the option to terminate the agreement on December 31 of each year.The exercise of the warrants could result in an increase in SCOR’s share capital of up to EUR 300 million (including issuance premium)  with the dilution limited to a maximum of 10% of the share capital in accordance with the authorization granted by the 2022 General Meeting.The facility offers a very cost-effective alternative to traditional retro and ILS  and enhances the resilience of SCOR's balance sheet.Laurent Rousseau  Chief Executive Officer of SCOR  comments: “In a fast-changing environment driven by a number of paradigm shifts  SCOR has issued a new contingent capital facility and sticks to its strategic cornerstone of maintaining a robust capital shield.The renewal of this contingent capital facility is an essential part of our active capital management and balance sheet protection policy  which helps to protect the Group’s solvency and resilience at a low cost. We are building from a sound base to take advantage of market tailwinds such as the hardening of the P&C market  the increasing demand for life reinsurance products  and the increase in interest rates.”Story continues** *Characteristics of the contingent equity lineThe transaction will give rise to the issuance of approximately 9.0 million warrants issued by SCOR to J.P. Morgan. Each warrant gives J.P. Morgan the right to subscribe to two new SCOR shares without exceeding 10% of SCOR’s share capital.The issuance of the warrants was authorized by the 23rd resolution of the Extraordinary General Meeting of SCOR shareholders on May 18  2022  and was approved by a resolution of its Board of Directors on November 8  2022.Under the transaction agreement  SCOR has undertaken to drawdown the facility upon the occurrence of a triggering event resulting from natural or non-natural catastrophes as described below  and J.P. Morgan has undertaken to exercise accordingly the number of warrants necessary for the subscription of EUR 300 million1 (issuance premium included) of new shares in two separate tranches of EUR 150 million each.The drawdowns of the facility will only be available when:1) the amount of the estimated ultimate net loss2 incurred by the SCOR group as an insurer or reinsurer (as reviewed by SCOR's statutory auditors) reaches pre-defined thresholds in a given calendar year from January 1  2023  to December 31  2025  as a direct result of the occurrence within that year of one or more natural catastrophe-type events  including but not limited to:earthquake  seaquake  earthquake shock  seismic and/or volcanic disturbance/eruption hurricane  rainstorm  storm  tempest  tornado  cyclone  typhoon tidal wave  tsunami  flood hail  winter weather/freeze  ice storm  weight of snow  avalanche meteor/asteroid impact landslip  landslide  mudslide  bush fire  forest fire and lightning.Or  when:2) the amount of ultimate net claims3 of the SCOR group’s life reinsurance segment over two (2) consecutive semesters over the period from July 1  2022  to December 31  2025  (as reviewed by SCOR's statutory auditors) reaches pre-defined thresholds as the consequence  in particular  of one or more of the following life business related events:deviation of epidemic  pandemic or a similar incidence or wide spread of one or more medical conditions deriving from any disease(s) acts of war  acts of terrorism accidents due to non-natural cause(s) material deviation from forecast biometric trends (mortality  morbidity  disability or longevity) recorded by the life segment for any reason whatsoever.In addition  subject to no drawdown having already been conducted under the facility  if the volume-weighted average price over three consecutive trading days of the SCOR shares on Euronext Paris falls strictly below EUR 10 (i.e. a price level close to the par value of the SCOR shares)  an individual tranche of EUR 150 million (issuance premium included) will be drawn down in order to ensure the availability of this financial cover (the warrants being non-exercisable below par value) if a natural or non-natural catastrophe-type event occurs during the remainder of the Risk Coverage Period.The warrants will remain exercisable until three months after the expiry of the Risk Coverage Period.In accordance with the authorization granted by the General Meeting of SCOR shareholders on May 18  2022  the maximum number of new shares issued in the event of exercise of the warrants may not exceed 10% of SCOR’s share capital.All subscriptions for new shares by J.P. Morgan will be made at a price equal to the volume-weighted average price of the SCOR shares on Euronext Paris over the three trading days preceding the exercise of the warrants  with a discount of 7.5%.J.P. Morgan is committed to subscribing to the new shares but does not intend to become a long-term shareholder of SCOR and will resell the shares by way of private placements and/or sales on the open market. In this respect SCOR and J.P. Morgan have entered into a profit sharing arrangement whereby 75% of the gain  if any  will be shared with SCOR. If the resale of the new shares occurs immediately upon exercise of the warrants through an off-market transaction  the profit share ratio owed to SCOR will be paid in the form of SCOR shares in order to limit the dilutive impact of the transaction for SCOR’s shareholders.From the notification of the occurrence of a triggering event by SCOR to J.P. Morgan until the exercise of the warrants  J.P. Morgan will be prohibited from engaging in hedging transactions on SCOR shares  other than ordinary course of business transactions undertaken independently by J.P. Morgan's affiliated banking and brokerage businesses.By way of illustration:a/ Under current market conditions (i.e. an issuance price of EUR 19.2 based on a 7.5% discount on a three-trading day volume-weighted average price of EUR 20.74 per share)  drawdown of the total cover (EUR 300 million) would account for a maximum of 8.7 % of SCOR's share capital5.b/ In the highly adverse event that a single tranche of EUR 150 million is drawn down due to the fall of SCOR’s share price  based on a 3-trading day volume-weighted average price of EUR 10 per share (i.e. an issuance price of EUR 9.3 per share after the 7.5% discount) the transaction would account for 9.0% of SCOR’s share capital6.Given these theoretical dilution levels  and because the number of new shares issued upon exercise of the warrants cannot exceed 10% of SCOR’s share capital  no prospectus for the AMF will be prepared in connection with the setting up of this contingent equity line. Should the contingent capital be triggered and issued  SCOR will make the appropriate disclosures to the market in compliance with applicable market regulations as at the time of issuance of the new shares  regarding the circumstances of such issuance  the amount of the drawdown  the issuance price  the number of shares issued and the consequences of such issuance for its shareholders.The transaction will have no impact on SCOR’s 2022 accounts except for the immaterial subscription amount received by SCOR from J.P. Morgan for the warrant issuance (EUR 0.001 per warrant).Limited potential dilutive impact of the transaction for SCOR shareholdersThis financial coverage is an event-driven contingent capital equity line  which may only be triggered by the occurrence of the aforementioned triggering events. Its potential dilutive impact therefore depends on the probability of occurrence of such triggering events  as well as on the share price at the time of trigger.SCOR’s management believes that such a contingent capital solution provides a significant net economic benefit for its shareholders  as it favorably compares to traditional retrocession and Insurance-Linked Securities (ILS) and it optimizes SCOR’s risk protection costs with a limited potential dilutive impact.The following chart summarizes the potential dilutive impact of the transaction under various scenarios for a shareholder holding 1% of SCOR's share capital prior to the share issuance (calculated on the basis of the number of shares that make up the share capital as at November 30  2022).Share issuance price Scenario Number of new shares issuedshares issued Percentage interestof an example shareholder Non-diluted basis (1) Diluted basis (2) At the current 3-day VWAP of EUR 20.7(issuance price = EUR 19.2)No trigger 0 1.000% 0.976% 2 tranches drawn down 15 639 479 0.920% 0.899%(1) Based on the dilution of share capital as at November 30  2022.(2) Based on the dilution of share capital as at November 30  2022  which would result from the exercise of all the outstanding stock option plans (options allocated but not vested and options vested but not exercised)This table should be read as follows: a shareholder currently holding 1% of SCOR’s share capital (on a non-diluted basis) would hold  on the occurrence of a triggering event  0.920% of the capital following exercise of the warrants on the basis of an issuance price of EUR 19.2 per share (including discount).** *Contact detailsMedia RelationsNathalie Mikaeloff and Alexandre Garciamedia@scor.comInvestor RelationsYves Cormierycormier@scor.comwww.scor.comLinkedIn: SCOR | Twitter: @SCOR_SESCOR  a Global Tier 1 ReinsurerSCOR  a leading global reinsurer  offers its clients a diversified and innovative range of reinsurance and insurance solutions and services to control and manage risk.

New patents drive continued growth in face of a complex business environment.NEW YORK  Dec. 19  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- A recent study drafted by Coller IP a Mathys Squire company  has valued Lleida.net's SaaS IP portfolio at as much as EUR14.1 million  a conservative valuation of a single family of the company's key intangible assets.Nowadays  the company's current patent portfolio encompasses 17 patent families respectively aimed at different aspects of the company's technologies and developments.Each patent family comprises granted patents as well as pending patent applications with a grant ratio above 90%  the company's IP strategy is clearly focused on quality over quantity since the first patent filed in January 2012 and the first allowance being notified in 2013.New solutions are produced on a monthly basis and the IP department along with the R&D teams overviews the new solutions crafted in the light of the technological problems arising in this digital society.This ensures a company's presence in every technological achievement relevant for the fields of certification  verification and telecommunications for the forthcoming 20 years due to the life cycle of the already granted patents and those new applications filed as a result of the company's IP policies.This value is based upon the revenues generated from the IP for SaaS business.As the global economic and business environment becomes more complicated and difficult to navigate  Lleida Networks Serveis Telematics S.A. (Lleida.net) is securing future growth and stability on a solid foundation of world-class intellectual property (IP) and multiple families of patents that ensure rapid growth in revenue.Lleida.net (OTCQX:LLEIF) (EPA:ALLLN) (BME:LLN) is a sophisticated technology company that has built its business on strong intellectual property.Story continuesThis foundation of IP  helped Lleida.net generate growth of 940% in 2020 and emerge as the top performing listed company in Europe that year  capping 20 straight quarters of growth. And this same foundation ensures the company continues performance going forward  as Lleida.net's products and services – strengthened by its powerful IP – ensure many more quarters and years of profitable performance.The company is now building on that banner year with further revenue growth and the ongoing expansion of its family of patents  which further strengthens its powerful and valuable IP.The latest patent received by the company by the South Korean authorities   which refers to its EIDAS-certified sourcing method.This newest patent is valid for 20 years  giving the company's business in the Middle East a deep level of security for two decades. Lleida.net now has four patents in the region  a developing economy that it first entered 10 years ago.Business roots strengthened by IPAfter more than 25 years in the market  Lleida.net has built a comprehensive business that derives a significant amount of value and ongoing revenue from its family of 218 patents that have been either granted or are in process in 64 countries around the world.The company's family of patents represents an important benefit for clients  stakeholders and investors and secures the future development for the medium and long term. The multiple layers of protection that these patents give to the company's intellectual property assure future growth and stability.Lleida.net has revenue streams that stem from its powerful and sophisticated IP generating tens of millions of euros in turnover. The hundreds of patents granted to the company can be grouped into different patent families covering different business lines.One family of patents covers the company's SaaS business  which is poised to generate significant growth going forward being in line with current market trends and demand. A recent study valued Lleida.net's IP based on revenue generated by its Saas business line.The study done by Coller IP  a Mathys Squire company  put the value of the company's SaaS IP at as much as EUR14.1 million  a conservative valuation of a single family of the company's key intangible assets. This value is based upon the revenues generated from the IP for SaaS business.Another parallel study considered the revenues that Lleida.net generates directly from IP related to its ""Click & Sign"" family of products. Coller IP put the fair market value of this IP at as much as EUR2.8 million.The value of the patents encompasses the historic cost of developing IP  market value based on transactions that can be used as thresholds and forthcoming revenue patents may generate.In 2020  Lleida generated turnover of EUR16.4 million  representing growth of 10.48%. Sales of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) accounted for 30.2% of turnover that year. Revenue from certified email services in 2020 added up to EUR1.7 million and is expected to grow at between 25%-30% per year through the rest of this decade to generate revenue of EUR21.9 million by 2030.A PATENT PORTFOLIO THAT KEEPS ON GROWINGGoing forward  Lleida.net plans to continue generating more IP and adding items to its patent portfolio to create ongoing value for investors and shareholders.Lleida.net is a top global player in one of the fastest-growing markets in the post-COVID-19 economy. The company has become a key global player in rapidly growing business segments like eSignature  eNotification and eContracting. The company is already on the path to become the main European player in these areas over the next decade by speeding up international growth  research and development (R&D)  proprietary technology  and transparent investor relations.The pandemic supercharged the market for Lleida.net products  services  and IP  including the e-certification services the company provides. The e-certification market was worth US$1.5 billion in 2017 and is now projected to be worth US$25.2 billion by 2030  almost 17 times larger. Already  75 countries recognize the validity of eSignatures and there is increasing legislative support for e-Signature technology across all the major markets in which Lleida.net operates.Another growth driver is rising demand to ensure security of financial  bureaucratic  and regulatory transactions  not only in developed markets but also in developing markets looking to leapfrog ahead by digitalising services. This includes the three largest developing markets in the world of India  China  and Brazil.Lleida.net is the European leader in the registered electronic signature  notification  and contracting industry. With more than 218 patents received from more than 60 countries worldwide  it holds one of the largest Intellectual Property portfolios in its field in the world.So far  it has received patents from markets such as the European Union  the United States  China  Russia  India  Mexico  Japan  Colombia  Argentina  Peru  South Africa  Nigeria  Australia and New Zealand.Lleida.net is listed on the OTCQX index in New York  on Euronext Growth in Paris and on BME Growth in Madrid.The company has more than 2 500 investors.INCREASE IN SALES IN ALL BUSINESS LINESIn the first nine months of 2022  all of the company's business lines saw an increase in their turnover volumes  attesting to the solidity of the company's business model.SaaS sales now account for 39 percent of the group's total sales  and sales of hybrid products have soared by 134 percent.The contract line (which includes both standard products such as Click & Sign Standard  contact email and contract SMS  and more complex products such as Click & Sign Pro) grew by four percent in the first nine months of 2022  compared with the same period in 2021  to €2.4 million.The notification line sales (including the registered email and registered SMS products) increased by 15 percent through September 30  to €1.76 million - and by 24 percent in the third quarter  to €642 000.The recently announced renewal agreement with the Colombian postal services company  4-72  and the acquisition of new accounts  will be the focus of growth in both the notification and contract lines.SMS sales have reached 2.8 million euros in cumulative figures  a 38 percent growth compared to 2021. The higher volume of SMS traffic drove the change. In the third quarter  the increase was four percent due to the seasonal nature of this type of sales  boosted by commercial campaigns.Similarly  Wholesale line sales followed the same growth trend  with a 15 percent increase in cumulative figures and a 14 percent increase in the third quarter of the year  compared to the same quarter of 2021.Traffic has been boosted thanks to the events being organized  and the destinations and the quality of service offered by Lleida.net makes a difference in an increasingly competitive market.INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERSLleida.net has managed in these three quarters to increase the number of different customers to whom an invoice has been sent  with an increase of 9 percent of the customer portfolio  compared to the same quarter of 2021.Likewise  the average billing invoice continues to increase by 11 percent compared to the accumulated data as of the third quarter of 2021.In geographical terms  the international percentage of the company's sales continues to grow. Sales outside Spain now account for 57 percent of turnover  particularly relevant in the European and Latin American markets  where the company has a strong presence in Colombia and Peru.In the third quarter  Net Financial Debt increased by 312 000 euros  following the signing of a new loan agreement for 700 000 thousand euros  at variable interest. In addition  the group has reduced the remaining debt positions with financial institutions due to the periodic amortization of loans.CisionView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/strong-ip-hundreds-of-patents-secure-future-growth-for-lleidanet-301706064.htmlSOURCE Lleida.net",neutral,0.41,0.58,0.0,positive,0.59,0.31,0.1,True,English,"['Strong IP', 'future growth', 'Lleida.net', 'hundreds', 'patents', 'R&D teams', 'Telematics S.A.', 'South Korean authorities', 'EIDAS-certified sourcing method', 'current market trends', 'world-class intellectual property', 'strong intellectual property', 'certified email services', 'different business lines', 'complex business environment', 'current patent portfolio', 'Mathys Squire company', 'different patent families', 'fair market value', 'key intangible assets', 'performing listed company', 'sophisticated technology company', 'Saas business line', 'SaaS IP portfolio', 'IP, market value', 'forthcoming revenue patents', 'different aspects', '17 patent families', 'top performing', 'multiple families', 'patent applications', 'first patent', 'latest patent', 'newest patent', 'sophisticated IP', 'Business roots', 'comprehensive business', 'NEW YORK', 'conservative valuation', 'grant ratio', 'first allowance', 'New solutions', 'monthly basis', 'technological problems', 'digital society', 'technological achievement', 'life cycle', 'new applications', 'global economic', 'ongoing expansion', 'Middle East', 'deep level', 'two decades', 'developing economy', 'significant amount', 'important benefit', 'future development', 'long term', 'multiple layers', 'historic cost', 'patent family', 'Lleida Networks', 'recent study', 'forthcoming 20 years', 'parallel study', 'Lleida.net', 'Coller IP', 'IP strategy', 'IP department', 'IP policies', 'valuable IP', 'solid foundation', 'same foundation', 'ongoing revenue', 'revenue streams', 'single family', 'One family', 'Sign"" family', 'ongoing growth', 'future growth', 'rapid growth', 'significant growth', '20 straight quarters', 'profitable performance', 'banner year', 'IP revenue', 'New patents', 'four patents', 'revenue growth', 'powerful IP', '218 patents', '25 years', 'Europe', 'continued', 'face', 'PRNewswire', 'technologies', 'developments', 'quality', 'quantity', 'January', 'light', 'presence', 'fields', 'certification', 'verification', 'telecommunications', 'result', 'revenues', 'stability', 'LLEIF', 'ALLLN', 'Story', 'products', 'many', 'security', 'region', 'process', '64 countries', 'clients', 'stakeholders', 'investors', 'medium', 'protection', 'tens', 'millions', 'euros', 'turnover', 'hundreds', 'demand', 'Click', 'transactions', 'thresholds', 'Sales', 'Software', 'rest', '10.', '9']",2022-12-19,2022-12-19,finance.yahoo.com

(hereinafter  ""Juventus""  the ""Company"" or the ""Issuer"") is the parent company of the Juventus Football Club group (hereinafter the ""Group"" or the ""Juventus Group""). The Company's headquarters are in Via Druento no. 175  Turin  Italy.Juventus is a listed professional football club  which  thanks to its more than century-long history  has become one of the most representative and popular teams at a national and international level. The Company's core business is participation in domestic and international football competitions and the organisation of matches. The main sources of income come from the licensing of audiovisual and media rights (in relation to the matches played)  sponsorships  revenues from the stadium  direct retail  e- commerce and trademark licensing for the creation of products  as well as the marketing of additional services to fans. Another source of core revenues derives from the management of players' registration rights.Juventus' shares are listed on the Euronext Milan  a regulated market organised and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (""EXM"").Juventus is controlled by EXOR N.V.  a Dutch company based in Amsterdam (Netherlands)  only listed from 27 September 2022 on Euronext Amsterdam  a regulated market organised and managed by Euronext Amsterdam N.V.  which holds 63.8% of the share capital (equal to 77.87% of voting rights). EXOR N.V. is one of the main European investment firms and is controlled by Giovanni Agnelli B.V.Lindsell Train Ltd. holds 11.9% of Juventus' share capital (i.e. 6.95% of the voting rights) and the remaining 24.3% is the portion of share capital circulated on the market (free float).The history of JuventusA group of friends  united by a passion for football  a special game that had recently been ""imported"" from England  met on a bench on Corso Re Umberto  one of the major boulevards in the centre of Turin. They had an intriguing idea: to create a sports club just for football. The boys attended Massimo D'Azeglio high school which specialised in Classical studies  they were well-educated and none of them was over age 17. For this reason they chose the name Juventus  which means ""youth"" in Latin"". It was 1 November 1897. They didn't realise it  but they had just given birth to a legend.And so  almost by chance  Italy's greatest football team got its start. The Club's first chairman was Enrico Canfari  its first pitch was in Piazza d'Armi and its first jersey was pink. Juventus made its début  in 1900  in the National Championship wearing the same jersey. Three years later  the Bianconero (black and white) appeared  imported from Nottingham. And five years later  in 1905  the first Italian title arrived  after an exciting three-teamplay-off with Genoa and Milanese. The president was the Swiss Alfredo Dick who left the Club shortly afterwards following locker-room arguments and various complaints. He went on to establish Torino and took the best foreign players with him. Juventus witnessed hard times in subsequent years lasting until the beginning of WWI due to being unable to compete with the new football powerhouses of the time  Pro Vercelli and Casale. However  straight after the first world war  Juventus returned to the top again: goalkeeper Giacone and fullbacks Novo and Bruna were the first Juventus players to wear the National Team's jersey. The Chairman was the poet and man of words Corradino Corradini  who also penned the Juventus anthem used until the 60s. 1923 was a special year: Giampiero Combi made his début with the first team  one of the greatest goalkeepers of all times  and even more importantly the Club's leadership changed hands. On 24 July the Shareholders' Meeting elected the new chairman by acclamation: Edoardo Agnelli  the son of the founder of FIAT. The club also had its own pitch now  in Corso Marsiglia. The stands were in masonry and the number of supporters increased day by day. All of the foundations had been laid to progress through the ranks of Italian football and strengthen a team that already boasted players like Combi  Rosetta  Munerati  Bigatto and Grabbi  and its first team manager  the Hungarian Jeno Karoly  and first foreign champion  also from Hungary  left-winger Hirzer.In 1925/1926 Juventus won their second national championship  following a gripping final with Bologna  beaten only in a play-off and a grand final against Alba Roma. And this was just the beginning: from 1930 to 1935 Juventus was way out in front and five consecutive national league titles arrived in Turin. The stars of the ""Golden five-year period"" were the manager Carlo Carcano and champions such as Orsi  Caligaris  Monti  Cesarini  Varglien I and II  Bertolini  Ferrari and Borel II. Juventus also made a major contribution to the National Team  who won the world Cup in Rome in 1934. During the 1930's the team also had their first experience in international football  taking part in the European Cup  the illustrious predecessor of the current Champions League. Luck was not on their side  but they did make four semi-final appearances.Financial report at 30 June 2022 - Report on operations5",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.49,0.11,0.4,True,English,"['Juventus Football Club S', 'Annual financial reporting', '30 June', 'The Juventus Football Club S.p.A.', 'Borsa Italiana S.p.A.', ""Massimo D'Azeglio high school"", 'main European investment firms', 'Giovanni Agnelli B.V.', 'Euronext Amsterdam N.V.', 'Massimo Della Ragione', 'EXOR N.V.', 'Juventus Football Club group', 'Katryn Frances Fink', 'director Daniela Marilungo', 'Lindsell Train Ltd.', ""Piazza d'Armi"", 'Swiss Alfredo Dick', 'Hungarian Jeno Karoly', 'professional football club', 'first world war', 'first foreign champion', 'international football competitions', 'Corso Re Umberto', 'best foreign players', 'new football powerhouses', 'first Italian title', 'first team manager', ""players' registration rights"", 'greatest football team', 'second national championship', 'first Juventus players', ""Juventus' share capital"", 'The Club', 'Italian football', 'The Company', 'main sources', 'début', 'Andrea Agnelli', 'Euronext Milan', 'Edoardo Agnelli', 'sports club', 'international level', 'greatest goalkeepers', 'Corso Marsiglia', 'media rights', 'voting rights', 'first chairman', 'first jersey', 'National Team', 'first pitch', 'Pavel Nedved', 'Maurizio Arrabene', 'Laurence Debroux', 'Suzanne Heywood', 'Francesco Roncaglio', 'Giorgio Tacquia', ""Shareholders' Meeting"", 'new Board', 'GROUP PROFILE', 'Juventus Group', 'Via Druento', 'popular teams', 'core business', 'direct retail', 'additional services', 'free float', 'special game', 'major boulevards', 'intriguing idea', 'Classical studies', 'Enrico Canfari', 'exciting three-teamplay-off', 'locker-room arguments', 'various complaints', 'subsequent years', 'Pro Vercelli', 'goalkeeper Giacone', 'Corradino Corradini', 'Juventus anthem', 'special year', 'new chairman', 'left-winger Hirzer', 'grand final', 'parent company', 'Dutch company', 'entire Board', 'regulated market', 'same jersey', 'century-long history', 'trademark licensing', 'core revenues', 'hard times', 'Giampiero Combi', 'loss', 'majority', 'Directors', 'office', 'result', 'resignations', '28 November', 'law', 'Articles', 'Association', 'activities', 'termination', 'appointment', 'exception', 'Issuer', 'headquarters', 'Turin', 'Italy', 'representative', 'participation', 'domestic', 'organisation', 'matches', 'income', 'audiovisual', 'relation', 'sponsorships', 'stadium', 'creation', 'products', 'marketing', 'fans', 'management', 'shares', 'EXM', 'Netherlands', '27 September', 'portion', 'friends', 'passion', 'England', 'bench', 'centre', 'boys', 'none', 'reason', 'name', 'youth', 'Latin', '1 November', 'birth', 'legend', 'chance', 'start', 'Bianconero', 'Nottingham', 'Genoa', 'Milanese', 'president', 'Torino', 'beginning', 'WWI', 'Casale', 'top', 'fullbacks', 'Novo', 'Bruna', 'poet', 'words', '60s', 'leadership', 'hands', '24 July', 'acclamation', 'founder', 'FIAT', 'stands', 'masonry', 'number', 'supporters', 'day', 'foundations', 'ranks', 'Rosetta', 'Munerati', 'Bigatto', 'Grabbi', 'Hungary', 'gripping', 'Bologna', '18', '6.']",2022-12-19,2022-12-19,marketscreener.com

In order to maximize the long-term value of our rich R&D portfolio and in-line with our strategic priorities  we intend to boost in 2023 our R&D investment to around 8.5% of our revenues. In parallel  and in order to prepare for the future  to accompany Virbac’s growth and to increase our medium-term productivity we intend to increase our capital expenditure investments in 2023 to around €100 million. This will include possible € 20-25 million one-time real estate investments in France that will allow us to expand our footprint to prepare for the development of our operations for the next decades. Finally  we continue to execute on the other dimensions of our 2030 Strategic Plan including our commercial focus on our Virbac Busters  the geo-extensions of our key products as well as our entry into new markets such as petfood and livestock in the USA  or parasiticides and petfood in China.As such  in 2023  the ratio of “current operating income  before depreciation of assets arising from acquisitions” (EBIT Adjusted) to “revenue” should consolidate between 13% to 14% at constant exchange rates with a growth in revenue at constant rates and scope anticipated between 4% to 6%. This deterioration in our EBIT adjusted ratio is primarily the result of our deliberate acceleration of our R&D investments as a ratio to revenues since the beginning of 2022 representing  in 2023  ~+2 percentage points compared to 2021 and +~1 percentage point compared to 2022. Consequently  we anticipate our cash position to remain constant at the end of 2023 when compared to 2022.In the medium term  our objective of reaching 20% of EBIT adjusted ratio by 2025-2030 remains unchanged with the assumption of a R&D ""ratio to revenues"" at around 6.5% (vs around 8.5%1 expected in 2023 given our deliberate additional investments). The timing continues to be dependent upon mainly external growth contribution (M&A)  success rate of our R&D projects  as well as top-line dynamics (impacted by external market conditions).A lifelong commitment to animal healthAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

15119,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/SCOR-SE-40096/news/SCOR-renews-its-contingent-capital-facility-42580276/?utm_medium=RSS&utm_content=20221219,SCOR renews its contingent capital facility,(marketscreener.com) Press Release December 19  2022 - N° 20 SCOR renews its contingent capital facility SCOR announces the renewal  for three years  of a contingent capital facility that would provide the Group with additional capital of up to EUR 300 millio…,Press ReleaseDecember 19  2022 - N° 20SCOR renews its contingent capital facilitySCOR announces the renewal  for three years  of a contingent capital facility that would provide the Group with additional capital of up to EUR 300 million coverage in case of extreme events (natural catastrophe or life events impacting mortality) or a significant fall in the share price.The facility aims to protect the Group’s share capital and therefore its solvency.This is the fourth renewal of this innovative facility  which was introduced in January 2011.The contingent capital facility rests on share subscription warrants  issued by SCOR and subscribed by J.P. Morgan  which will be exercised automatically in the scenarios set out in the agreement.The period covered by the renewed facility runs from January 1  2023  to December 31  2025. In the absence of any triggering event during this period  no shares will be exercised. SCOR has the option to terminate the agreement on December 31 of each year.The exercise of the warrants could result in an increase in SCOR’s share capital of up to EUR 300 million (including issuance premium)  with the dilution limited to a maximum of 10% of the share capital in accordance with the authorization granted by the 2022 General Meeting.The facility offers a very cost-effective alternative to traditional retro and ILS  and enhances the resilience of SCOR's balance sheet.Laurent Rousseau  Chief Executive Officer of SCOR  comments: “In a fast-changing environment driven by a number of paradigm shifts  SCOR has issued a new contingent capital facility and sticks to its strategic cornerstone of maintaining a robust capital shield.The renewal of this contingent capital facility is an essential part of our active capital management and balance sheet protection policy  which helps to protect the Group’s solvency and resilience at a low cost. We are building from a sound base to take advantage of market tailwinds such as the hardening of the P&C market  the increasing demand for life reinsurance products  and the increase in interest rates.”** *Characteristics of the contingent equity lineThe transaction will give rise to the issuance of approximately 9.0 million warrants issued by SCOR to J.P. Morgan. Each warrant gives J.P. Morgan the right to subscribe to two new SCOR shares without exceeding 10% of SCOR’s share capital.The issuance of the warrants was authorized by the 23rd resolution of the Extraordinary General Meeting of SCOR shareholders on May 18  2022  and was approved by a resolution of its Board of Directors on November 8  2022.Under the transaction agreement  SCOR has undertaken to drawdown the facility upon the occurrence of a triggering event resulting from natural or non-natural catastrophes as described below  and J.P. Morgan has undertaken to exercise accordingly the number of warrants necessary for the subscription of EUR 300 million1 (issuance premium included) of new shares in two separate tranches of EUR 150 million each.The drawdowns of the facility will only be available when:1) the amount of the estimated ultimate net loss2 incurred by the SCOR group as an insurer or reinsurer (as reviewed by SCOR's statutory auditors) reaches pre-defined thresholds in a given calendar year from January 1  2023  to December 31  2025  as a direct result of the occurrence within that year of one or more natural catastrophe-type events  including but not limited to:earthquake  seaquake  earthquake shock  seismic and/or volcanic disturbance/eruption hurricane  rainstorm  storm  tempest  tornado  cyclone  typhoon tidal wave  tsunami  flood hail  winter weather/freeze  ice storm  weight of snow  avalanche meteor/asteroid impact landslip  landslide  mudslide  bush fire  forest fire and lightning.Or  when:2) the amount of ultimate net claims3 of the SCOR group’s life reinsurance segment over two (2) consecutive semesters over the period from July 1  2022  to December 31  2025  (as reviewed by SCOR's statutory auditors) reaches pre-defined thresholds as the consequence  in particular  of one or more of the following life business related events:deviation of epidemic  pandemic or a similar incidence or wide spread of one or more medical conditions deriving from any disease(s) acts of war  acts of terrorism accidents due to non-natural cause(s) material deviation from forecast biometric trends (mortality  morbidity  disability or longevity) recorded by the life segment for any reason whatsoever.In addition  subject to no drawdown having already been conducted under the facility  if the volume-weighted average price over three consecutive trading days of the SCOR shares on Euronext Paris falls strictly below EUR 10 (i.e. a price level close to the par value of the SCOR shares)  an individual tranche of EUR 150 million (issuance premium included) will be drawn down in order to ensure the availability of this financial cover (the warrants being non-exercisable below par value) if a natural or non-natural catastrophe-type event occurs during the remainder of the Risk Coverage Period.The warrants will remain exercisable until three months after the expiry of the Risk Coverage Period.In accordance with the authorization granted by the General Meeting of SCOR shareholders on May 18  2022  the maximum number of new shares issued in the event of exercise of the warrants may not exceed 10% of SCOR’s share capital.All subscriptions for new shares by J.P. Morgan will be made at a price equal to the volume-weighted average price of the SCOR shares on Euronext Paris over the three trading days preceding the exercise of the warrants  with a discount of 7.5%.J.P. Morgan is committed to subscribing to the new shares but does not intend to become a long-term shareholder of SCOR and will resell the shares by way of private placements and/or sales on the open market. In this respect SCOR and J.P. Morgan have entered into a profit sharing arrangement whereby 75% of the gain  if any  will be shared with SCOR. If the resale of the new shares occurs immediately upon exercise of the warrants through an off-market transaction  the profit share ratio owed to SCOR will be paid in the form of SCOR shares in order to limit the dilutive impact of the transaction for SCOR’s shareholders.From the notification of the occurrence of a triggering event by SCOR to J.P. Morgan until the exercise of the warrants  J.P. Morgan will be prohibited from engaging in hedging transactions on SCOR shares  other than ordinary course of business transactions undertaken independently by J.P. Morgan's affiliated banking and brokerage businesses.By way of illustration:a/ Under current market conditions (i.e. an issuance price of EUR 19.2 based on a 7.5% discount on a three-trading day volume-weighted average price of EUR 20.74 per share)  drawdown of the total cover (EUR 300 million) would account for a maximum of 8.7 % of SCOR's share capital5.b/ In the highly adverse event that a single tranche of EUR 150 million is drawn down due to the fall of SCOR’s share price  based on a 3-trading day volume-weighted average price of EUR 10 per share (i.e. an issuance price of EUR 9.3 per share after the 7.5% discount) the transaction would account for 9.0% of SCOR’s share capital6.Given these theoretical dilution levels  and because the number of new shares issued upon exercise of the warrants cannot exceed 10% of SCOR’s share capital  no prospectus for the AMF will be prepared in connection with the setting up of this contingent equity line. Should the contingent capital be triggered and issued  SCOR will make the appropriate disclosures to the market in compliance with applicable market regulations as at the time of issuance of the new shares  regarding the circumstances of such issuance  the amount of the drawdown  the issuance price  the number of shares issued and the consequences of such issuance for its shareholders.The transaction will have no impact on SCOR’s 2022 accounts except for the immaterial subscription amount received by SCOR from J.P. Morgan for the warrant issuance (EUR 0.001 per warrant).Limited potential dilutive impact of the transaction for SCOR shareholdersThis financial coverage is an event-driven contingent capital equity line  which may only be triggered by the occurrence of the aforementioned triggering events. Its potential dilutive impact therefore depends on the probability of occurrence of such triggering events  as well as on the share price at the time of trigger.SCOR’s management believes that such a contingent capital solution provides a significant net economic benefit for its shareholders  as it favorably compares to traditional retrocession and Insurance-Linked Securities (ILS) and it optimizes SCOR’s risk protection costs with a limited potential dilutive impact.The following chart summarizes the potential dilutive impact of the transaction under various scenarios for a shareholder holding 1% of SCOR's share capital prior to the share issuance (calculated on the basis of the number of shares that make up the share capital as at November 30  2022).Share issuance price Scenario Number of new shares issuedshares issued Percentage interestof an example shareholder Non-diluted basis (1) Diluted basis (2) At the current 3-day VWAP of EUR 20.7(issuance price = EUR 19.2)No trigger 0 1.000% 0.976% 2 tranches drawn down 15 639 479 0.920% 0.899%(1) Based on the dilution of share capital as at November 30  2022.(2) Based on the dilution of share capital as at November 30  2022  which would result from the exercise of all the outstanding stock option plans (options allocated but not vested and options vested but not exercised)This table should be read as follows: a shareholder currently holding 1% of SCOR’s share capital (on a non-diluted basis) would hold  on the occurrence of a triggering event  0.920% of the capital following exercise of the warrants on the basis of an issuance price of EUR 19.2 per share (including discount).** *Contact detailsMedia RelationsNathalie Mikaeloff and Alexandre Garciamedia@scor.comInvestor RelationsYves Cormierycormier@scor.comwww.scor.comLinkedIn: SCOR | Twitter: @SCOR_SESCOR  a Global Tier 1 ReinsurerSCOR  a leading global reinsurer  offers its clients a diversified and innovative range of reinsurance and insurance solutions and services to control and manage risk.

15120,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/12/19/2576526/0/en/SCOR-renews-its-contingent-capital-facility.html,SCOR renews its contingent capital facility,Press Release      December 19  2022 - N° 20               SCOR renews its contingent capital facility                  SCOR announces the renewal  for......,English FrenchPress ReleaseDecember 19  2022 - N° 20SCOR renews its contingent capital facilitySCOR announces the renewal  for three years  of a contingent capital facility that would provide the Group with additional capital of up to EUR 300 million coverage in case of extreme events (natural catastrophe or life events impacting mortality) or a significant fall in the share price.The facility aims to protect the Group’s share capital and therefore its solvency.This is the fourth renewal of this innovative facility  which was introduced in January 2011.The contingent capital facility rests on share subscription warrants  issued by SCOR and subscribed by J.P. Morgan  which will be exercised automatically in the scenarios set out in the agreement.The period covered by the renewed facility runs from January 1  2023  to December 31  2025. In the absence of any triggering event during this period  no shares will be exercised. SCOR has the option to terminate the agreement on December 31 of each year.The exercise of the warrants could result in an increase in SCOR’s share capital of up to EUR 300 million (including issuance premium)  with the dilution limited to a maximum of 10% of the share capital in accordance with the authorization granted by the 2022 General Meeting.The facility offers a very cost-effective alternative to traditional retro and ILS  and enhances the resilience of SCOR's balance sheet.Laurent Rousseau  Chief Executive Officer of SCOR  comments: “In a fast-changing environment driven by a number of paradigm shifts  SCOR has issued a new contingent capital facility and sticks to its strategic cornerstone of maintaining a robust capital shield.The renewal of this contingent capital facility is an essential part of our active capital management and balance sheet protection policy  which helps to protect the Group’s solvency and resilience at a low cost. We are building from a sound base to take advantage of market tailwinds such as the hardening of the P&C market  the increasing demand for life reinsurance products  and the increase in interest rates.”** *Characteristics of the contingent equity lineThe transaction will give rise to the issuance of approximately 9.0 million warrants issued by SCOR to J.P. Morgan. Each warrant gives J.P. Morgan the right to subscribe to two new SCOR shares without exceeding 10% of SCOR’s share capital.The issuance of the warrants was authorized by the 23rd resolution of the Extraordinary General Meeting of SCOR shareholders on May 18  2022  and was approved by a resolution of its Board of Directors on November 8  2022.Under the transaction agreement  SCOR has undertaken to drawdown the facility upon the occurrence of a triggering event resulting from natural or non-natural catastrophes as described below  and J.P. Morgan has undertaken to exercise accordingly the number of warrants necessary for the subscription of EUR 300 million1 (issuance premium included) of new shares in two separate tranches of EUR 150 million each.The drawdowns of the facility will only be available when:1) the amount of the estimated ultimate net loss2 incurred by the SCOR group as an insurer or reinsurer (as reviewed by SCOR's statutory auditors) reaches pre-defined thresholds in a given calendar year from January 1  2023  to December 31  2025  as a direct result of the occurrence within that year of one or more natural catastrophe-type events  including but not limited to:earthquake  seaquake  earthquake shock  seismic and/or volcanic disturbance/eruption hurricane  rainstorm  storm  tempest  tornado  cyclone  typhoon tidal wave  tsunami  flood hail  winter weather/freeze  ice storm  weight of snow  avalanche meteor/asteroid impact landslip  landslide  mudslide  bush fire  forest fire and lightning.Or  when:2) the amount of ultimate net claims3 of the SCOR group’s life reinsurance segment over two (2) consecutive semesters over the period from July 1  2022  to December 31  2025  (as reviewed by SCOR's statutory auditors) reaches pre-defined thresholds as the consequence  in particular  of one or more of the following life business related events:deviation of epidemic  pandemic or a similar incidence or wide spread of one or more medical conditions deriving from any disease(s) acts of war  acts of terrorism accidents due to non-natural cause(s) material deviation from forecast biometric trends (mortality  morbidity  disability or longevity) recorded by the life segment for any reason whatsoever.In addition  subject to no drawdown having already been conducted under the facility  if the volume-weighted average price over three consecutive trading days of the SCOR shares on Euronext Paris falls strictly below EUR 10 (i.e. a price level close to the par value of the SCOR shares)  an individual tranche of EUR 150 million (issuance premium included) will be drawn down in order to ensure the availability of this financial cover (the warrants being non-exercisable below par value) if a natural or non-natural catastrophe-type event occurs during the remainder of the Risk Coverage Period.The warrants will remain exercisable until three months after the expiry of the Risk Coverage Period.In accordance with the authorization granted by the General Meeting of SCOR shareholders on May 18  2022  the maximum number of new shares issued in the event of exercise of the warrants may not exceed 10% of SCOR’s share capital.All subscriptions for new shares by J.P. Morgan will be made at a price equal to the volume-weighted average price of the SCOR shares on Euronext Paris over the three trading days preceding the exercise of the warrants  with a discount of 7.5%.J.P. Morgan is committed to subscribing to the new shares but does not intend to become a long-term shareholder of SCOR and will resell the shares by way of private placements and/or sales on the open market. In this respect SCOR and J.P. Morgan have entered into a profit sharing arrangement whereby 75% of the gain  if any  will be shared with SCOR. If the resale of the new shares occurs immediately upon exercise of the warrants through an off-market transaction  the profit share ratio owed to SCOR will be paid in the form of SCOR shares in order to limit the dilutive impact of the transaction for SCOR’s shareholders.From the notification of the occurrence of a triggering event by SCOR to J.P. Morgan until the exercise of the warrants  J.P. Morgan will be prohibited from engaging in hedging transactions on SCOR shares  other than ordinary course of business transactions undertaken independently by J.P. Morgan's affiliated banking and brokerage businesses.By way of illustration:a/ Under current market conditions (i.e. an issuance price of EUR 19.2 based on a 7.5% discount on a three-trading day volume-weighted average price of EUR 20.74 per share)  drawdown of the total cover (EUR 300 million) would account for a maximum of 8.7 % of SCOR's share capital5.b/ In the highly adverse event that a single tranche of EUR 150 million is drawn down due to the fall of SCOR’s share price  based on a 3-trading day volume-weighted average price of EUR 10 per share (i.e. an issuance price of EUR 9.3 per share after the 7.5% discount) the transaction would account for 9.0% of SCOR’s share capital6.Given these theoretical dilution levels  and because the number of new shares issued upon exercise of the warrants cannot exceed 10% of SCOR’s share capital  no prospectus for the AMF will be prepared in connection with the setting up of this contingent equity line. Should the contingent capital be triggered and issued  SCOR will make the appropriate disclosures to the market in compliance with applicable market regulations as at the time of issuance of the new shares  regarding the circumstances of such issuance  the amount of the drawdown  the issuance price  the number of shares issued and the consequences of such issuance for its shareholders.The transaction will have no impact on SCOR’s 2022 accounts except for the immaterial subscription amount received by SCOR from J.P. Morgan for the warrant issuance (EUR 0.001 per warrant).Limited potential dilutive impact of the transaction for SCOR shareholdersThis financial coverage is an event-driven contingent capital equity line  which may only be triggered by the occurrence of the aforementioned triggering events. Its potential dilutive impact therefore depends on the probability of occurrence of such triggering events  as well as on the share price at the time of trigger.SCOR’s management believes that such a contingent capital solution provides a significant net economic benefit for its shareholders  as it favorably compares to traditional retrocession and Insurance-Linked Securities (ILS) and it optimizes SCOR’s risk protection costs with a limited potential dilutive impact.The following chart summarizes the potential dilutive impact of the transaction under various scenarios for a shareholder holding 1% of SCOR's share capital prior to the share issuance (calculated on the basis of the number of shares that make up the share capital as at November 30  2022).Share issuance price Scenario Number of new shares issuedshares issued Percentage interestof an example shareholder Non-diluted basis (1) Diluted basis (2) At the current 3-day VWAP of EUR 20.7(issuance price = EUR 19.2)No trigger 0 1.000% 0.976% 2 tranches drawn down 15 639 479 0.920% 0.899%(1) Based on the dilution of share capital as at November 30  2022.(2) Based on the dilution of share capital as at November 30  2022  which would result from the exercise of all the outstanding stock option plans (options allocated but not vested and options vested but not exercised)This table should be read as follows: a shareholder currently holding 1% of SCOR’s share capital (on a non-diluted basis) would hold  on the occurrence of a triggering event  0.920% of the capital following exercise of the warrants on the basis of an issuance price of EUR 19.2 per share (including discount).** *Contact detailsMedia RelationsNathalie Mikaeloff and Alexandre Garciamedia@scor.comInvestor RelationsYves Cormierycormier@scor.comwww.scor.comLinkedIn: SCOR | Twitter: @SCOR_SESCOR  a Global Tier 1 ReinsurerSCOR  a leading global reinsurer  offers its clients a diversified and innovative range of reinsurance and insurance solutions and services to control and manage risk.

Fenfluramine is already approved in the US for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox- Gastaut syndrome. In addition  it is also approved for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in the EU*  US  and Japan.5 6 7The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency based its positive opinion on safety and efficacy data from a global  randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial  in 263 patients with LGS (aged 2-35 years)  that demonstrated adjunctive fenfluramine at a dose of 0.7/mg/kg/day  provided a significantly greater reduction in the frequency of drop seizures (p=0.001) compared to placebo.1 The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were decreased appetite  somnolence  fatigue and pyrexia.1 No cases of valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension were observed.1The CHMP's positive opinion on fenfluramine will be referred to the European Commission (EC)  which will deliver a final decision in Q1 2023.""This positive CHMP opinion is a significant regulatory milestone towards providing a new treatment option to individuals - and their families - living with this rare epilepsy in the EU "" said Mike Davis  Head of Global Epilepsy & Rare Syndromes  UCB. ""We're delighted by this recommendation  highlighting our ongoing commitment to the LGS community by ensuring we bring differentiated medicines to those with unmet needs.""Additional data supporting the safety and efficacy of fenfluramine in LGS in the open label extension (OLE) part of the study was recently published in Epilepsia showing fenfluramine  when added to a patient's current anti-epileptic treatment regimen for seizures associated with LGS  was effective in reducing the frequency of multiple seizure types and was generally well tolerated during a median treatment duration of 364 days.2 Study participants experienced a sustained reduction in the frequency of motor seizures including those that resulted in a drop or fall (Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures (GTCS)  secondary GTCS (SGTC; focal to bilateral tonic-clonic)  tonic seizures  atonic seizures  and tonic-atonic seizures).2 In the OLE phase  the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were decreased appetite  fatigue  nasopharyngitis and seizure. The cardiovascular safety in this study further corroborates the fenfluramine safety profiles observed; no cases of valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension were observed. 2LGS is a severe childhood-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) characterized by multiple types of drug-refractory seizures with high morbidity3 4 as well as serious impairment of neurodevelopmental  cognitive  and motor functions.4 LGS affects an estimated 2 in 10 000 people in European Union (EU).8 LGS has far-reaching effects beyond seizures  including issues with developmental communication  psychiatric symptoms  sleep  behavioural challenges  and mobility.9 Drop seizures are hallmark features of LGS  particularly tonic seizures. Convulsive seizures (eg  generalized tonic-clonic [GTC] seizures) are also commonly observed and usually occur in later stages of LGS but sometimes may precede core seizure types. In addition to being associated with bodily injury and hospitalizations  GTC seizures are a primary risk factor of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Patients with GTC seizures have an approximately 10-fold greater risk for SUDEP than patients with other seizure types.5About fenfluramine C-IV in EU*Fintepla is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome as an add-on therapy to other anti-epileptic medicines for patients 2 years of age and older. Fenfluramine is a serotonin releasing agent  and thereby stimulates multiple 5-HT receptor sub-types through the release of serotonin. Fenfluramine may reduce seizures by acting as an agonist at specific serotonin receptors in the brain  including the 5-HT1D  5-HT2A  and 5-HT2C receptors  and also by acting on the sigma-1 receptor.5Fenfluramine oral solution is available under a controlled access program for Dravet Syndrome to ensure regular cardiac monitoring and to mitigate potential off-label use for weight management.Please refer to Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) before prescribing.▼This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.FINTEPLA® is a registered trademark of the UCB Group of Companies.Key Safety Information about FINTEPLA®▼ in EU5Aortic or mitral valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertensionBecause of reported cases of valvular heart disease that may have been caused by fenfluramine at higher doses used to treat adult obesity  cardiac monitoring must be performed using echocardiography. In the controlled clinical studies of fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome  no valvular heart disease was observed. Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to establish a baseline prior to initiating treatment and exclude any pre-existing valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension. Echocardiogram monitoring should be conducted every 6 months for the first 2 years and annually thereafter. If an echocardiogram indicates pathological valvular changes  a follow-up echocardiogram should be considered at an earlier timeframe to evaluate whether the abnormality is persistent. If pathological abnormalities on the echocardiogram are observed  it is recommended to evaluate the benefit versus risk of continuing fenfluramine treatment with the prescriber  caregiver  and cardiologist. If treatment is stopped because of aortic or mitral valvular heart disease  appropriate monitoring and follow-up should be provided in accordance with local guidelines for the treatment of aortic or mitral valvular heart disease. With past use in higher doses to treat adult obesity  fenfluramine was reported to be associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Pulmonary arterial hypertension was not observed in the clinical programme  but because of the low incidence of this disease  the clinical trial experience with fenfluramine is inadequate to determine if fenfluramine increases the risk for pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with Dravet syndrome. If echocardiogram findings are suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension  a repeat echocardiogram should be performed as soon as possible and within 3 months to confirm these findings. If the echocardiogram finding is confirmed suggestive of an increased probability of pulmonary arterial hypertension defined as ""intermediate probability"" by the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Guidelines  it should lead to a benefit-risk evaluation of continuation of Fintepla by the prescriber  carer  and cardiologist. If the echocardiogram finding  after confirmation  suggests of a high probability of pulmonary arterial hypertension  as defined by the 2015 ESC and ERS Guidelines  it is recommended fenfluramine treatment should be stopped.Decreased appetite and weight lossFenfluramine can cause decreased appetite and weight loss. An additive effect on decreased appetite can occur when fenfluramine is combined with other anti-epileptic medicines  for example stiripentol. The decrease in weight appears to be dose related. Most subjects resumed weight gain over time while continuing treatment. The patient's weight should be monitored. A benefit risk evaluation should be undertaken prior to commencing treatment with fenfluramine in patients with a history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.Fintepla controlled access programmeA controlled access programme has been created to 1) prevent off-label use in weight management in obese patients and 2) confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking Fintepla.SomnolenceFenfluramine can cause somnolence. Other central nervous system depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate the somnolence effect of fenfluramine.Suicidal behaviour and ideationSuicidal behaviour and ideation have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic medicines in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials with anti-epileptic medicines that did not include fenfluramine has shown a small increased risk of suicidal behaviour and ideation. The mechanism of this risk is not known  and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for fenfluramine. Patients and caregivers of patients should be advised to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal behaviour and ideation emerge.Serotonin syndromeAs with other serotonergic agents  serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with fenfluramine treatment  particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic agents (including SSRIs  SNRIs  tricyclic antidepressants  or triptans); with agents that impair metabolism of serotonin such as MAOIs; or with antipsychotics that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular aberrations (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhoea). If concomitant treatment with fenfluramine and other serotonergic agents that may affect the serotonergic systems is clinically warranted  careful observation of the patient is advised  particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.Increased seizure frequencyAs with other anti-epileptic medicines  a clinically relevant increase in seizure frequency may occur during treatment with fenfluramine  which may require adjustment in the dose of fenfluramine and/or concomitant anti-epileptic medicines  or discontinuation of fenfluramine  should the benefit-risk be negative.CyproheptadineCyproheptadine is a potent serotonin receptor antagonist and may therefore decrease the efficacy of fenfluramine. If cyproheptadine is added to treatment with fenfluramine  patients should be monitored for worsening of seizures. If fenfluramine treatment is initiated in a patient taking cyproheptadine  fenfluramine's efficacy may be reduced.GlaucomaFenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Discontinue therapy in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity. Consider discontinuation if there is ocular pain and another cause cannot be determined.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducersCo-administration with strong CYP1A2 inducers or CYP2B6 inducers may decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations. An increase in fenfluramine dosage should be considered when co-administered with a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer; the maximum daily dose should not be exceeded.ExcipientsThis medicinal product contains sodium ethyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 215) and sodium methyl para hydroxybenzoate (E 219) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).

New patents drive continued growth in face of a complex business environment. NEW YORK  Dec. 19  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- A recent study drafted…,"Portfolio of patents  IP revenue set to drive ongoing growth for the best performing listed company in Europe in 2020. New patents drive continued growth in face of a complex business environment.NEW YORK  Dec. 19  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- A recent study drafted by Coller IP a Mathys Squire company  has valued Lleida.net's SaaS IP portfolio at as much as EUR14.1 million  a conservative valuation of a single family of the company's key intangible assets.Nowadays  the company's current patent portfolio encompasses 17 patent families respectively aimed at different aspects of the company's technologies and developments.Each patent family comprises granted patents as well as pending patent applications with a grant ratio above 90%  the company's IP strategy is clearly focused on quality over quantity since the first patent filed in January 2012 and the first allowance being notified in 2013.New solutions are produced on a monthly basis and the IP department along with the R&D teams overviews the new solutions crafted in the light of the technological problems arising in this digital society.This ensures a company's presence in every technological achievement relevant for the fields of certification  verification and telecommunications for the forthcoming 20 years due to the life cycle of the already granted patents and those new applications filed as a result of the company's IP policies.This value is based upon the revenues generated from the IP for SaaS business.As the global economic and business environment becomes more complicated and difficult to navigate  Lleida Networks Serveis Telematics S.A. (Lleida.net) is securing future growth and stability on a solid foundation of world-class intellectual property (IP) and multiple families of patents that ensure rapid growth in revenue.Lleida.net (OTCQX:LLEIF) (EPA:ALLLN) (BME:LLN) is a sophisticated technology company that has built its business on strong intellectual property.This foundation of IP  helped Lleida.net generate growth of 940% in 2020 and emerge as the top performing listed company in Europe that year  capping 20 straight quarters of growth. And this same foundation ensures the company continues performance going forward  as Lleida.net's products and services – strengthened by its powerful IP – ensure many more quarters and years of profitable performance.The company is now building on that banner year with further revenue growth and the ongoing expansion of its family of patents  which further strengthens its powerful and valuable IP.The latest patent received by the company by the South Korean authorities   which refers to its EIDAS-certified sourcing method.This newest patent is valid for 20 years  giving the company's business in the Middle East a deep level of security for two decades. Lleida.net now has four patents in the region  a developing economy that it first entered 10 years ago.Business roots strengthened by IPAfter more than 25 years in the market  Lleida.net has built a comprehensive business that derives a significant amount of value and ongoing revenue from its family of 218 patents that have been either granted or are in process in 64 countries around the world.The company's family of patents represents an important benefit for clients  stakeholders and investors and secures the future development for the medium and long term. The multiple layers of protection that these patents give to the company's intellectual property assure future growth and stability.Lleida.net has revenue streams that stem from its powerful and sophisticated IP generating tens of millions of euros in turnover. The hundreds of patents granted to the company can be grouped into different patent families covering different business lines.One family of patents covers the company's SaaS business  which is poised to generate significant growth going forward being in line with current market trends and demand. A recent study valued Lleida.net's IP based on revenue generated by its Saas business line.The study done by Coller IP  a Mathys Squire company  put the value of the company's SaaS IP at as much as EUR14.1 million  a conservative valuation of a single family of the company's key intangible assets. This value is based upon the revenues generated from the IP for SaaS business.Another parallel study considered the revenues that Lleida.net generates directly from IP related to its ""Click & Sign"" family of products. Coller IP put the fair market value of this IP at as much as EUR2.8 million.The value of the patents encompasses the historic cost of developing IP  market value based on transactions that can be used as thresholds and forthcoming revenue patents may generate.In 2020  Lleida generated turnover of EUR16.4 million  representing growth of 10.48%. Sales of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) accounted for 30.2% of turnover that year. Revenue from certified email services in 2020 added up to EUR1.7 million and is expected to grow at between 25%-30% per year through the rest of this decade to generate revenue of EUR21.9 million by 2030.A PATENT PORTFOLIO THAT KEEPS ON GROWINGGoing forward  Lleida.net plans to continue generating more IP and adding items to its patent portfolio to create ongoing value for investors and shareholders.Lleida.net is a top global player in one of the fastest-growing markets in the post-COVID-19 economy. The company has become a key global player in rapidly growing business segments like eSignature  eNotification and eContracting. The company is already on the path to become the main European player in these areas over the next decade by speeding up international growth  research and development (R&D)  proprietary technology  and transparent investor relations.The pandemic supercharged the market for Lleida.net products  services  and IP  including the e-certification services the company provides. The e-certification market was worth US$1.5 billion in 2017 and is now projected to be worth US$25.2 billion by 2030  almost 17 times larger. Already  75 countries recognize the validity of eSignatures and there is increasing legislative support for e-Signature technology across all the major markets in which Lleida.net operates.Another growth driver is rising demand to ensure security of financial  bureaucratic  and regulatory transactions  not only in developed markets but also in developing markets looking to leapfrog ahead by digitalising services. This includes the three largest developing markets in the world of India  China  and Brazil.Lleida.net is the European leader in the registered electronic signature  notification  and contracting industry. With more than 218 patents received from more than 60 countries worldwide  it holds one of the largest Intellectual Property portfolios in its field in the world.So far  it has received patents from markets such as the European Union  the United States  China  Russia  India  Mexico  Japan  Colombia  Argentina  Peru  South Africa  Nigeria  Australia and New Zealand.Lleida.net is listed on the OTCQX index in New York  on Euronext Growth in Paris and on BME Growth in Madrid.The company has more than 2 500 investors.INCREASE IN SALES IN ALL BUSINESS LINESIn the first nine months of 2022  all of the company's business lines saw an increase in their turnover volumes  attesting to the solidity of the company's business model.SaaS sales now account for 39 percent of the group's total sales  and sales of hybrid products have soared by 134 percent.The contract line (which includes both standard products such as Click & Sign Standard  contact email and contract SMS  and more complex products such as Click & Sign Pro) grew by four percent in the first nine months of 2022  compared with the same period in 2021  to €2.4 million.The notification line sales (including the registered email and registered SMS products) increased by 15 percent through September 30  to €1.76 million - and by 24 percent in the third quarter  to €642 000.The recently announced renewal agreement with the Colombian postal services company  4-72  and the acquisition of new accounts  will be the focus of growth in both the notification and contract lines.SMS sales have reached 2.8 million euros in cumulative figures  a 38 percent growth compared to 2021. The higher volume of SMS traffic drove the change.

It raised €12m from that initial public offering. Earlier this year  it raised a further €11m from investors via a share placement.Shares in the company have more than doubled this year  having surged as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine saw energy prices soar and fears raised about security of supply across Europe.The group now has a market capitalisation of €191m.Corre Energy is developing about a dozen large-scale hydrogen-based energy storage projects across northern Europe. It said these facilities will address grid-level imbalances associated with increasing volumes of renewable energy generation.Under the terms of the arrangement with Eneco  Corre Energy will construct  operate and maintain the Zuidwending facility. Eneco will optimise the entire output of the storage site on behalf of Corre Energy. Eneco will provide market access services  enabling Corre Energy to benefit from revenue linked to the high flexibility value of the asset  while also guaranteeing a base level of income.“Zuidwending will be hydrogen fuel enabled from day one and we expect the maturing of the hydrogen market to allow the facility to operate entirely on surplus renewable energy and green hydrogen  making an increasingly positive environmental impact ” said Mr McGrane.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.0,1.0,True,English,"['Corre Energy', 'supply deal', 'Dutch site', 'dozen large-scale hydrogen-based energy storage projects', 'Zuidwending Compressed Air Energy Storage', 'maximum storage discharge duration', 'entire storage capacity', '15-year offtake agreement', 'up to 320MW', 'initial public offering', 'high flexibility value', 'positive environmental impact', 'renewable energy generation', 'surplus renewable energy', 'cavern development partner', 'Euronext Growth market', 'market access services', 'Energy storage group', 'Dutch power provider', 'storage site', 'Zuidwending facility', 'Corre Energy', 'energy prices', 'investment partner', 'market capitalisation', 'entire output', 'hydrogen market', 'Dutch site', 'extension rights', 'exclusive rights', 'salt caverns', 'Common Interest', 'chief executive', 'Kevin McGrane', 'share placement', 'grid-level imbalances', 'increasing volumes', 'base level', 'hydrogen fuel', 'green hydrogen', 'Mr McGrane', 'major facility', 'CAES) facility', 'CAES facility', 'northern Europe', 'deal', 'Netherlands', 'Eneco', 'province', 'Groningen', 'conjunction', '3.5 days', 'grants', 'Infracapital', 'Dublin', 'investors', 'Shares', 'company', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'fears', 'security', 'supply', 'facilities', 'terms', 'arrangement', 'behalf', 'revenue', 'asset', 'income', 'maturing']",2022-12-19,2022-12-19,independent.ie
