Our relationship with Innate aligns with our commitment to work with promising French companies and supports our ambition to develop a diverse portfolio of next-generation NK cell engagers  highly synergistic with Sanofi’s allogeneic NK cell platform  engineered lymphokines that stimulate NK cells  and growing Immuno-oncology pipeline. As a leading global company with roots in France  we are proud to collaborate to support the French healthcare ecosystem.”Yannis Morel  Ph.D.  Executive Vice President  Product portfolio strategy & Business development at Innate Pharma“Building on the success of our existing collaboration on hematologic targets  we are pleased to expand and strengthen our partnership with Sanofi on NK Cell Engagers with the addition of up to three new programs  including in solid tumors. Sanofi’s investment in Innate further validates the value of our ANKETTM platform and its potential to address multiple tumor types. By incorporating various tumor antigen binders  NK Cell Engagers are a versatile technology that may provide new options for patients and offer clinical benefit across multiple cancers  whilst also maintaining a good safety profile. This agreement also highlights Innate’s strategy to build a broad portfolio of ANKET programs addressing different types of cancer.”Under the terms of the new license agreement  Innate will receive €25m upfront payment and up to €1.35bn total in preclinical  clinical  regulatory and commercial milestones plus royalties on potential net sales. Closing of the transaction is subject to HSR approval.About ANKETTMANKETTM (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics) is Innate's proprietary platform for developing next-generation  multi-specific natural killer (NK) cell engagers to treat certain types of cancer.This versatile  fit-for-purpose technology is creating an entirely new class of molecules to induce synthetic immunity against cancer.

In order to maximize the long-term value of our rich R&D portfolio and in-line with our strategic priorities  we intend to boost in 2023 our R&D investment to around 8.5% of our revenues. In parallel  and in order to prepare for the future  to accompany Virbac’s growth and to increase our medium-term productivity we intend to increase our capital expenditure investments in 2023 to around €100 million. This will include possible € 20-25 million one-time real estate investments in France that will allow us to expand our footprint to prepare for the development of our operations for the next decades. Finally  we continue to execute on the other dimensions of our 2030 Strategic Plan including our commercial focus on our Virbac Busters  the geo-extensions of our key products as well as our entry into new markets such as petfood and livestock in the USA  or parasiticides and petfood in China.As such  in 2023  the ratio of “current operating income  before depreciation of assets arising from acquisitions” (EBIT Adjusted) to “revenue” should consolidate between 13% to 14% at constant exchange rates with a growth in revenue at constant rates and scope anticipated between 4% to 6%. This deterioration in our EBIT adjusted ratio is primarily the result of our deliberate acceleration of our R&D investments as a ratio to revenues since the beginning of 2022 representing  in 2023  ~+2 percentage points compared to 2021 and +~1 percentage point compared to 2022. Consequently  we anticipate our cash position to remain constant at the end of 2023 when compared to 2022.In the medium term  our objective of reaching 20% of EBIT adjusted ratio by 2025-2030 remains unchanged with the assumption of a R&D ""ratio to revenues"" at around 6.5% (vs around 8.5%1 expected in 2023 given our deliberate additional investments). The timing continues to be dependent upon mainly external growth contribution (M&A)  success rate of our R&D projects  as well as top-line dynamics (impacted by external market conditions).Story continuesA lifelong commitment to animal healthAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world. Covering more than 50 species  our range of products and services enables us to diagnose  prevent and treat the majority of pathologies.

15079,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/scor-renews-contingent-capital-facility-163700633.html,SCOR renews its contingent capital facility,Press Release December 19  2022 - N° 20 SCOR renews its contingent capital facility SCOR announces the renewal  for three years  of a contingent capital...,SCORPress ReleaseDecember 19  2022 - N° 20SCOR renews its contingent capital facilitySCOR announces the renewal  for three years  of a contingent capital facility that would provide the Group with additional capital of up to EUR 300 million coverage in case of extreme events (natural catastrophe or life events impacting mortality) or a significant fall in the share price.The facility aims to protect the Group’s share capital and therefore its solvency.This is the fourth renewal of this innovative facility  which was introduced in January 2011.The contingent capital facility rests on share subscription warrants  issued by SCOR and subscribed by J.P. Morgan  which will be exercised automatically in the scenarios set out in the agreement.The period covered by the renewed facility runs from January 1  2023  to December 31  2025. In the absence of any triggering event during this period  no shares will be exercised. SCOR has the option to terminate the agreement on December 31 of each year.The exercise of the warrants could result in an increase in SCOR’s share capital of up to EUR 300 million (including issuance premium)  with the dilution limited to a maximum of 10% of the share capital in accordance with the authorization granted by the 2022 General Meeting.The facility offers a very cost-effective alternative to traditional retro and ILS  and enhances the resilience of SCOR's balance sheet.Laurent Rousseau  Chief Executive Officer of SCOR  comments: “In a fast-changing environment driven by a number of paradigm shifts  SCOR has issued a new contingent capital facility and sticks to its strategic cornerstone of maintaining a robust capital shield.The renewal of this contingent capital facility is an essential part of our active capital management and balance sheet protection policy  which helps to protect the Group’s solvency and resilience at a low cost. We are building from a sound base to take advantage of market tailwinds such as the hardening of the P&C market  the increasing demand for life reinsurance products  and the increase in interest rates.”Story continues** *Characteristics of the contingent equity lineThe transaction will give rise to the issuance of approximately 9.0 million warrants issued by SCOR to J.P. Morgan. Each warrant gives J.P. Morgan the right to subscribe to two new SCOR shares without exceeding 10% of SCOR’s share capital.The issuance of the warrants was authorized by the 23rd resolution of the Extraordinary General Meeting of SCOR shareholders on May 18  2022  and was approved by a resolution of its Board of Directors on November 8  2022.Under the transaction agreement  SCOR has undertaken to drawdown the facility upon the occurrence of a triggering event resulting from natural or non-natural catastrophes as described below  and J.P. Morgan has undertaken to exercise accordingly the number of warrants necessary for the subscription of EUR 300 million1 (issuance premium included) of new shares in two separate tranches of EUR 150 million each.The drawdowns of the facility will only be available when:1) the amount of the estimated ultimate net loss2 incurred by the SCOR group as an insurer or reinsurer (as reviewed by SCOR's statutory auditors) reaches pre-defined thresholds in a given calendar year from January 1  2023  to December 31  2025  as a direct result of the occurrence within that year of one or more natural catastrophe-type events  including but not limited to:earthquake  seaquake  earthquake shock  seismic and/or volcanic disturbance/eruption hurricane  rainstorm  storm  tempest  tornado  cyclone  typhoon tidal wave  tsunami  flood hail  winter weather/freeze  ice storm  weight of snow  avalanche meteor/asteroid impact landslip  landslide  mudslide  bush fire  forest fire and lightning.Or  when:2) the amount of ultimate net claims3 of the SCOR group’s life reinsurance segment over two (2) consecutive semesters over the period from July 1  2022  to December 31  2025  (as reviewed by SCOR's statutory auditors) reaches pre-defined thresholds as the consequence  in particular  of one or more of the following life business related events:deviation of epidemic  pandemic or a similar incidence or wide spread of one or more medical conditions deriving from any disease(s) acts of war  acts of terrorism accidents due to non-natural cause(s) material deviation from forecast biometric trends (mortality  morbidity  disability or longevity) recorded by the life segment for any reason whatsoever.In addition  subject to no drawdown having already been conducted under the facility  if the volume-weighted average price over three consecutive trading days of the SCOR shares on Euronext Paris falls strictly below EUR 10 (i.e. a price level close to the par value of the SCOR shares)  an individual tranche of EUR 150 million (issuance premium included) will be drawn down in order to ensure the availability of this financial cover (the warrants being non-exercisable below par value) if a natural or non-natural catastrophe-type event occurs during the remainder of the Risk Coverage Period.The warrants will remain exercisable until three months after the expiry of the Risk Coverage Period.In accordance with the authorization granted by the General Meeting of SCOR shareholders on May 18  2022  the maximum number of new shares issued in the event of exercise of the warrants may not exceed 10% of SCOR’s share capital.All subscriptions for new shares by J.P. Morgan will be made at a price equal to the volume-weighted average price of the SCOR shares on Euronext Paris over the three trading days preceding the exercise of the warrants  with a discount of 7.5%.J.P. Morgan is committed to subscribing to the new shares but does not intend to become a long-term shareholder of SCOR and will resell the shares by way of private placements and/or sales on the open market. In this respect SCOR and J.P. Morgan have entered into a profit sharing arrangement whereby 75% of the gain  if any  will be shared with SCOR. If the resale of the new shares occurs immediately upon exercise of the warrants through an off-market transaction  the profit share ratio owed to SCOR will be paid in the form of SCOR shares in order to limit the dilutive impact of the transaction for SCOR’s shareholders.From the notification of the occurrence of a triggering event by SCOR to J.P. Morgan until the exercise of the warrants  J.P. Morgan will be prohibited from engaging in hedging transactions on SCOR shares  other than ordinary course of business transactions undertaken independently by J.P. Morgan's affiliated banking and brokerage businesses.By way of illustration:a/ Under current market conditions (i.e. an issuance price of EUR 19.2 based on a 7.5% discount on a three-trading day volume-weighted average price of EUR 20.74 per share)  drawdown of the total cover (EUR 300 million) would account for a maximum of 8.7 % of SCOR's share capital5.b/ In the highly adverse event that a single tranche of EUR 150 million is drawn down due to the fall of SCOR’s share price  based on a 3-trading day volume-weighted average price of EUR 10 per share (i.e. an issuance price of EUR 9.3 per share after the 7.5% discount) the transaction would account for 9.0% of SCOR’s share capital6.Given these theoretical dilution levels  and because the number of new shares issued upon exercise of the warrants cannot exceed 10% of SCOR’s share capital  no prospectus for the AMF will be prepared in connection with the setting up of this contingent equity line. Should the contingent capital be triggered and issued  SCOR will make the appropriate disclosures to the market in compliance with applicable market regulations as at the time of issuance of the new shares  regarding the circumstances of such issuance  the amount of the drawdown  the issuance price  the number of shares issued and the consequences of such issuance for its shareholders.The transaction will have no impact on SCOR’s 2022 accounts except for the immaterial subscription amount received by SCOR from J.P. Morgan for the warrant issuance (EUR 0.001 per warrant).Limited potential dilutive impact of the transaction for SCOR shareholdersThis financial coverage is an event-driven contingent capital equity line  which may only be triggered by the occurrence of the aforementioned triggering events. Its potential dilutive impact therefore depends on the probability of occurrence of such triggering events  as well as on the share price at the time of trigger.SCOR’s management believes that such a contingent capital solution provides a significant net economic benefit for its shareholders  as it favorably compares to traditional retrocession and Insurance-Linked Securities (ILS) and it optimizes SCOR’s risk protection costs with a limited potential dilutive impact.The following chart summarizes the potential dilutive impact of the transaction under various scenarios for a shareholder holding 1% of SCOR's share capital prior to the share issuance (calculated on the basis of the number of shares that make up the share capital as at November 30  2022).Share issuance price Scenario Number of new shares issuedshares issued Percentage interestof an example shareholder Non-diluted basis (1) Diluted basis (2) At the current 3-day VWAP of EUR 20.7(issuance price = EUR 19.2)No trigger 0 1.000% 0.976% 2 tranches drawn down 15 639 479 0.920% 0.899%(1) Based on the dilution of share capital as at November 30  2022.(2) Based on the dilution of share capital as at November 30  2022  which would result from the exercise of all the outstanding stock option plans (options allocated but not vested and options vested but not exercised)This table should be read as follows: a shareholder currently holding 1% of SCOR’s share capital (on a non-diluted basis) would hold  on the occurrence of a triggering event  0.920% of the capital following exercise of the warrants on the basis of an issuance price of EUR 19.2 per share (including discount).** *Contact detailsMedia RelationsNathalie Mikaeloff and Alexandre Garciamedia@scor.comInvestor RelationsYves Cormierycormier@scor.comwww.scor.comLinkedIn: SCOR | Twitter: @SCOR_SESCOR  a Global Tier 1 ReinsurerSCOR  a leading global reinsurer  offers its clients a diversified and innovative range of reinsurance and insurance solutions and services to control and manage risk.

New patents drive continued growth in face of a complex business environment.NEW YORK  Dec. 19  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- A recent study drafted by Coller IP a Mathys Squire company  has valued Lleida.net's SaaS IP portfolio at as much as EUR14.1 million  a conservative valuation of a single family of the company's key intangible assets.Nowadays  the company's current patent portfolio encompasses 17 patent families respectively aimed at different aspects of the company's technologies and developments.Each patent family comprises granted patents as well as pending patent applications with a grant ratio above 90%  the company's IP strategy is clearly focused on quality over quantity since the first patent filed in January 2012 and the first allowance being notified in 2013.New solutions are produced on a monthly basis and the IP department along with the R&D teams overviews the new solutions crafted in the light of the technological problems arising in this digital society.This ensures a company's presence in every technological achievement relevant for the fields of certification  verification and telecommunications for the forthcoming 20 years due to the life cycle of the already granted patents and those new applications filed as a result of the company's IP policies.This value is based upon the revenues generated from the IP for SaaS business.As the global economic and business environment becomes more complicated and difficult to navigate  Lleida Networks Serveis Telematics S.A. (Lleida.net) is securing future growth and stability on a solid foundation of world-class intellectual property (IP) and multiple families of patents that ensure rapid growth in revenue.Lleida.net (OTCQX:LLEIF) (EPA:ALLLN) (BME:LLN) is a sophisticated technology company that has built its business on strong intellectual property.Story continuesThis foundation of IP  helped Lleida.net generate growth of 940% in 2020 and emerge as the top performing listed company in Europe that year  capping 20 straight quarters of growth. And this same foundation ensures the company continues performance going forward  as Lleida.net's products and services – strengthened by its powerful IP – ensure many more quarters and years of profitable performance.The company is now building on that banner year with further revenue growth and the ongoing expansion of its family of patents  which further strengthens its powerful and valuable IP.The latest patent received by the company by the South Korean authorities   which refers to its EIDAS-certified sourcing method.This newest patent is valid for 20 years  giving the company's business in the Middle East a deep level of security for two decades. Lleida.net now has four patents in the region  a developing economy that it first entered 10 years ago.Business roots strengthened by IPAfter more than 25 years in the market  Lleida.net has built a comprehensive business that derives a significant amount of value and ongoing revenue from its family of 218 patents that have been either granted or are in process in 64 countries around the world.The company's family of patents represents an important benefit for clients  stakeholders and investors and secures the future development for the medium and long term. The multiple layers of protection that these patents give to the company's intellectual property assure future growth and stability.Lleida.net has revenue streams that stem from its powerful and sophisticated IP generating tens of millions of euros in turnover. The hundreds of patents granted to the company can be grouped into different patent families covering different business lines.One family of patents covers the company's SaaS business  which is poised to generate significant growth going forward being in line with current market trends and demand. A recent study valued Lleida.net's IP based on revenue generated by its Saas business line.The study done by Coller IP  a Mathys Squire company  put the value of the company's SaaS IP at as much as EUR14.1 million  a conservative valuation of a single family of the company's key intangible assets. This value is based upon the revenues generated from the IP for SaaS business.Another parallel study considered the revenues that Lleida.net generates directly from IP related to its ""Click & Sign"" family of products. Coller IP put the fair market value of this IP at as much as EUR2.8 million.The value of the patents encompasses the historic cost of developing IP  market value based on transactions that can be used as thresholds and forthcoming revenue patents may generate.In 2020  Lleida generated turnover of EUR16.4 million  representing growth of 10.48%. Sales of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) accounted for 30.2% of turnover that year. Revenue from certified email services in 2020 added up to EUR1.7 million and is expected to grow at between 25%-30% per year through the rest of this decade to generate revenue of EUR21.9 million by 2030.A PATENT PORTFOLIO THAT KEEPS ON GROWINGGoing forward  Lleida.net plans to continue generating more IP and adding items to its patent portfolio to create ongoing value for investors and shareholders.Lleida.net is a top global player in one of the fastest-growing markets in the post-COVID-19 economy. The company has become a key global player in rapidly growing business segments like eSignature  eNotification and eContracting. The company is already on the path to become the main European player in these areas over the next decade by speeding up international growth  research and development (R&D)  proprietary technology  and transparent investor relations.The pandemic supercharged the market for Lleida.net products  services  and IP  including the e-certification services the company provides. The e-certification market was worth US$1.5 billion in 2017 and is now projected to be worth US$25.2 billion by 2030  almost 17 times larger. Already  75 countries recognize the validity of eSignatures and there is increasing legislative support for e-Signature technology across all the major markets in which Lleida.net operates.Another growth driver is rising demand to ensure security of financial  bureaucratic  and regulatory transactions  not only in developed markets but also in developing markets looking to leapfrog ahead by digitalising services. This includes the three largest developing markets in the world of India  China  and Brazil.Lleida.net is the European leader in the registered electronic signature  notification  and contracting industry. With more than 218 patents received from more than 60 countries worldwide  it holds one of the largest Intellectual Property portfolios in its field in the world.So far  it has received patents from markets such as the European Union  the United States  China  Russia  India  Mexico  Japan  Colombia  Argentina  Peru  South Africa  Nigeria  Australia and New Zealand.Lleida.net is listed on the OTCQX index in New York  on Euronext Growth in Paris and on BME Growth in Madrid.The company has more than 2 500 investors.INCREASE IN SALES IN ALL BUSINESS LINESIn the first nine months of 2022  all of the company's business lines saw an increase in their turnover volumes  attesting to the solidity of the company's business model.SaaS sales now account for 39 percent of the group's total sales  and sales of hybrid products have soared by 134 percent.The contract line (which includes both standard products such as Click & Sign Standard  contact email and contract SMS  and more complex products such as Click & Sign Pro) grew by four percent in the first nine months of 2022  compared with the same period in 2021  to €2.4 million.The notification line sales (including the registered email and registered SMS products) increased by 15 percent through September 30  to €1.76 million - and by 24 percent in the third quarter  to €642 000.The recently announced renewal agreement with the Colombian postal services company  4-72  and the acquisition of new accounts  will be the focus of growth in both the notification and contract lines.SMS sales have reached 2.8 million euros in cumulative figures  a 38 percent growth compared to 2021. The higher volume of SMS traffic drove the change. In the third quarter  the increase was four percent due to the seasonal nature of this type of sales  boosted by commercial campaigns.Similarly  Wholesale line sales followed the same growth trend  with a 15 percent increase in cumulative figures and a 14 percent increase in the third quarter of the year  compared to the same quarter of 2021.Traffic has been boosted thanks to the events being organized  and the destinations and the quality of service offered by Lleida.net makes a difference in an increasingly competitive market.INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERSLleida.net has managed in these three quarters to increase the number of different customers to whom an invoice has been sent  with an increase of 9 percent of the customer portfolio  compared to the same quarter of 2021.Likewise  the average billing invoice continues to increase by 11 percent compared to the accumulated data as of the third quarter of 2021.In geographical terms  the international percentage of the company's sales continues to grow. Sales outside Spain now account for 57 percent of turnover  particularly relevant in the European and Latin American markets  where the company has a strong presence in Colombia and Peru.In the third quarter  Net Financial Debt increased by 312 000 euros  following the signing of a new loan agreement for 700 000 thousand euros  at variable interest. In addition  the group has reduced the remaining debt positions with financial institutions due to the periodic amortization of loans.CisionView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/strong-ip-hundreds-of-patents-secure-future-growth-for-lleidanet-301706064.htmlSOURCE Lleida.net",neutral,0.41,0.58,0.0,positive,0.59,0.31,0.1,True,English,"['Strong IP', 'future growth', 'Lleida.net', 'hundreds', 'patents', 'R&D teams', 'Telematics S.A.', 'South Korean authorities', 'EIDAS-certified sourcing method', 'current market trends', 'world-class intellectual property', 'strong intellectual property', 'certified email services', 'different business lines', 'complex business environment', 'current patent portfolio', 'Mathys Squire company', 'different patent families', 'fair market value', 'key intangible assets', 'performing listed company', 'sophisticated technology company', 'Saas business line', 'SaaS IP portfolio', 'IP, market value', 'forthcoming revenue patents', 'different aspects', '17 patent families', 'top performing', 'multiple families', 'patent applications', 'first patent', 'latest patent', 'newest patent', 'sophisticated IP', 'Business roots', 'comprehensive business', 'NEW YORK', 'conservative valuation', 'grant ratio', 'first allowance', 'New solutions', 'monthly basis', 'technological problems', 'digital society', 'technological achievement', 'life cycle', 'new applications', 'global economic', 'ongoing expansion', 'Middle East', 'deep level', 'two decades', 'developing economy', 'significant amount', 'important benefit', 'future development', 'long term', 'multiple layers', 'historic cost', 'patent family', 'Lleida Networks', 'recent study', 'forthcoming 20 years', 'parallel study', 'Lleida.net', 'Coller IP', 'IP strategy', 'IP department', 'IP policies', 'valuable IP', 'solid foundation', 'same foundation', 'ongoing revenue', 'revenue streams', 'single family', 'One family', 'Sign"" family', 'ongoing growth', 'future growth', 'rapid growth', 'significant growth', '20 straight quarters', 'profitable performance', 'banner year', 'IP revenue', 'New patents', 'four patents', 'revenue growth', 'powerful IP', '218 patents', '25 years', 'Europe', 'continued', 'face', 'PRNewswire', 'technologies', 'developments', 'quality', 'quantity', 'January', 'light', 'presence', 'fields', 'certification', 'verification', 'telecommunications', 'result', 'revenues', 'stability', 'LLEIF', 'ALLLN', 'Story', 'products', 'many', 'security', 'region', 'process', '64 countries', 'clients', 'stakeholders', 'investors', 'medium', 'protection', 'tens', 'millions', 'euros', 'turnover', 'hundreds', 'demand', 'Click', 'transactions', 'thresholds', 'Sales', 'Software', 'rest', '10.', '9']",2022-12-19,2022-12-20,finance.yahoo.com

(hereinafter  ""Juventus""  the ""Company"" or the ""Issuer"") is the parent company of the Juventus Football Club group (hereinafter the ""Group"" or the ""Juventus Group""). The Company's headquarters are in Via Druento no. 175  Turin  Italy.Juventus is a listed professional football club  which  thanks to its more than century-long history  has become one of the most representative and popular teams at a national and international level. The Company's core business is participation in domestic and international football competitions and the organisation of matches. The main sources of income come from the licensing of audiovisual and media rights (in relation to the matches played)  sponsorships  revenues from the stadium  direct retail  e- commerce and trademark licensing for the creation of products  as well as the marketing of additional services to fans. Another source of core revenues derives from the management of players' registration rights.Juventus' shares are listed on the Euronext Milan  a regulated market organised and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (""EXM"").Juventus is controlled by EXOR N.V.  a Dutch company based in Amsterdam (Netherlands)  only listed from 27 September 2022 on Euronext Amsterdam  a regulated market organised and managed by Euronext Amsterdam N.V.  which holds 63.8% of the share capital (equal to 77.87% of voting rights). EXOR N.V. is one of the main European investment firms and is controlled by Giovanni Agnelli B.V.Lindsell Train Ltd. holds 11.9% of Juventus' share capital (i.e. 6.95% of the voting rights) and the remaining 24.3% is the portion of share capital circulated on the market (free float).The history of JuventusA group of friends  united by a passion for football  a special game that had recently been ""imported"" from England  met on a bench on Corso Re Umberto  one of the major boulevards in the centre of Turin. They had an intriguing idea: to create a sports club just for football. The boys attended Massimo D'Azeglio high school which specialised in Classical studies  they were well-educated and none of them was over age 17. For this reason they chose the name Juventus  which means ""youth"" in Latin"". It was 1 November 1897. They didn't realise it  but they had just given birth to a legend.And so  almost by chance  Italy's greatest football team got its start. The Club's first chairman was Enrico Canfari  its first pitch was in Piazza d'Armi and its first jersey was pink. Juventus made its début  in 1900  in the National Championship wearing the same jersey. Three years later  the Bianconero (black and white) appeared  imported from Nottingham. And five years later  in 1905  the first Italian title arrived  after an exciting three-teamplay-off with Genoa and Milanese. The president was the Swiss Alfredo Dick who left the Club shortly afterwards following locker-room arguments and various complaints. He went on to establish Torino and took the best foreign players with him. Juventus witnessed hard times in subsequent years lasting until the beginning of WWI due to being unable to compete with the new football powerhouses of the time  Pro Vercelli and Casale. However  straight after the first world war  Juventus returned to the top again: goalkeeper Giacone and fullbacks Novo and Bruna were the first Juventus players to wear the National Team's jersey. The Chairman was the poet and man of words Corradino Corradini  who also penned the Juventus anthem used until the 60s. 1923 was a special year: Giampiero Combi made his début with the first team  one of the greatest goalkeepers of all times  and even more importantly the Club's leadership changed hands. On 24 July the Shareholders' Meeting elected the new chairman by acclamation: Edoardo Agnelli  the son of the founder of FIAT. The club also had its own pitch now  in Corso Marsiglia. The stands were in masonry and the number of supporters increased day by day. All of the foundations had been laid to progress through the ranks of Italian football and strengthen a team that already boasted players like Combi  Rosetta  Munerati  Bigatto and Grabbi  and its first team manager  the Hungarian Jeno Karoly  and first foreign champion  also from Hungary  left-winger Hirzer.In 1925/1926 Juventus won their second national championship  following a gripping final with Bologna  beaten only in a play-off and a grand final against Alba Roma. And this was just the beginning: from 1930 to 1935 Juventus was way out in front and five consecutive national league titles arrived in Turin. The stars of the ""Golden five-year period"" were the manager Carlo Carcano and champions such as Orsi  Caligaris  Monti  Cesarini  Varglien I and II  Bertolini  Ferrari and Borel II. Juventus also made a major contribution to the National Team  who won the world Cup in Rome in 1934. During the 1930's the team also had their first experience in international football  taking part in the European Cup  the illustrious predecessor of the current Champions League. Luck was not on their side  but they did make four semi-final appearances.Financial report at 30 June 2022 - Report on operations5",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.49,0.11,0.4,True,English,"['Juventus Football Club S', 'Annual financial reporting', '30 June', 'The Juventus Football Club S.p.A.', 'Borsa Italiana S.p.A.', ""Massimo D'Azeglio high school"", 'main European investment firms', 'Giovanni Agnelli B.V.', 'Euronext Amsterdam N.V.', 'Massimo Della Ragione', 'EXOR N.V.', 'Juventus Football Club group', 'Katryn Frances Fink', 'director Daniela Marilungo', 'Lindsell Train Ltd.', ""Piazza d'Armi"", 'Swiss Alfredo Dick', 'Hungarian Jeno Karoly', 'professional football club', 'first world war', 'first foreign champion', 'international football competitions', 'Corso Re Umberto', 'best foreign players', 'new football powerhouses', 'first Italian title', 'first team manager', ""players' registration rights"", 'greatest football team', 'second national championship', 'first Juventus players', ""Juventus' share capital"", 'The Club', 'Italian football', 'The Company', 'main sources', 'début', 'Andrea Agnelli', 'Euronext Milan', 'Edoardo Agnelli', 'sports club', 'international level', 'greatest goalkeepers', 'Corso Marsiglia', 'media rights', 'voting rights', 'first chairman', 'first jersey', 'National Team', 'first pitch', 'Pavel Nedved', 'Maurizio Arrabene', 'Laurence Debroux', 'Suzanne Heywood', 'Francesco Roncaglio', 'Giorgio Tacquia', ""Shareholders' Meeting"", 'new Board', 'GROUP PROFILE', 'Juventus Group', 'Via Druento', 'popular teams', 'core business', 'direct retail', 'additional services', 'free float', 'special game', 'major boulevards', 'intriguing idea', 'Classical studies', 'Enrico Canfari', 'exciting three-teamplay-off', 'locker-room arguments', 'various complaints', 'subsequent years', 'Pro Vercelli', 'goalkeeper Giacone', 'Corradino Corradini', 'Juventus anthem', 'special year', 'new chairman', 'left-winger Hirzer', 'grand final', 'parent company', 'Dutch company', 'entire Board', 'regulated market', 'same jersey', 'century-long history', 'trademark licensing', 'core revenues', 'hard times', 'Giampiero Combi', 'loss', 'majority', 'Directors', 'office', 'result', 'resignations', '28 November', 'law', 'Articles', 'Association', 'activities', 'termination', 'appointment', 'exception', 'Issuer', 'headquarters', 'Turin', 'Italy', 'representative', 'participation', 'domestic', 'organisation', 'matches', 'income', 'audiovisual', 'relation', 'sponsorships', 'stadium', 'creation', 'products', 'marketing', 'fans', 'management', 'shares', 'EXM', 'Netherlands', '27 September', 'portion', 'friends', 'passion', 'England', 'bench', 'centre', 'boys', 'none', 'reason', 'name', 'youth', 'Latin', '1 November', 'birth', 'legend', 'chance', 'start', 'Bianconero', 'Nottingham', 'Genoa', 'Milanese', 'president', 'Torino', 'beginning', 'WWI', 'Casale', 'top', 'fullbacks', 'Novo', 'Bruna', 'poet', 'words', '60s', 'leadership', 'hands', '24 July', 'acclamation', 'founder', 'FIAT', 'stands', 'masonry', 'number', 'supporters', 'day', 'foundations', 'ranks', 'Rosetta', 'Munerati', 'Bigatto', 'Grabbi', 'Hungary', 'gripping', 'Bologna', '18', '6.']",2022-12-19,2022-12-20,marketscreener.com

The French Navy will use this multi-sensor autonomous vehicle to conduct experimentations with a view to define its future needs  with the technical support of the DGA  as part of the French Ministry for armed forces' strategy to understand and monitor seabed.The contract is scheduled to last about two years and includes academic and operational training for 12 sailors. This contract follows an initial operational evaluation campaign conducted last year and constitutes the first step in this experimentation program.The A18 AUV will be able to be embarked on several types of ships. It offers seabed reconnaissance and characterization capabilities thanks to various sensors  including sonars. Combined with the acoustic positioning system (GAPS) produced by Exail  it will be able to operate with great precision even at depths of 3 000 meters.Observing and monitoring what is happening in the deep ocean has become a real necessity to ensure the protection of national interests.

IPH6401/SAR’514 is a BCMA-targeting NK cell engager using Sanofi’s proprietary CROSSODILE® multi-functional platform  which comprises the Cross-Over-Dual-Variable-Domain (CODV) format. It induces a dual targeting of the NK activating receptors  NKp46 and CD16  for an optimized NK cell activation  based on Innate’s ANKETTM proprietary platform.Under the terms of the original license agreement  Sanofi is responsible for the development  manufacturing and commercialization of products resulting from the research collaboration. Innate Pharma will be eligible to up to €400m in development and commercial milestone payments as well as royalties on net sales. To date  €13m milestone payments to Innate have been announced.About Sanofi’s approach to NK therapies in oncologyAt Sanofi  we are exploring the intrinsic abilities of Natural Killer cells to create new immunotherapies for patients with cancer.

In order to maximize the long-term value of our rich R&D portfolio and in-line with our strate…,"English FrenchAs we continue to execute our 2030 strategic plan  we have made the decision to continue to accelerate in 2023 on two key dimensions : R&D and capital expenditures. In order to maximize the long-term value of our rich R&D portfolio and in-line with our strategic priorities  we intend to boost in 2023 our R&D investment to around 8.5% of our revenues. In parallel  and in order to prepare for the future  to accompany Virbac’s growth and to increase our medium-term productivity we intend to increase our capital expenditure investments in 2023 to around €100 million. This will include possible € 20-25 million one-time real estate investments in France that will allow us to expand our footprint to prepare for the development of our operations for the next decades. Finally  we continue to execute on the other dimensions of our 2030 Strategic Plan including our commercial focus on our Virbac Busters  the geo-extensions of our key products as well as our entry into new markets such as petfood and livestock in the USA  or parasiticides and petfood in China.As such  in 2023  the ratio of “current operating income  before depreciation of assets arising from acquisitions” (EBIT Adjusted) to “revenue” should consolidate between 13% to 14% at constant exchange rates with a growth in revenue at constant rates and scope anticipated between 4% to 6%. This deterioration in our EBIT adjusted ratio is primarily the result of our deliberate acceleration of our R&D investments as a ratio to revenues since the beginning of 2022 representing  in 2023  ~+2 percentage points compared to 2021 and +~1 percentage point compared to 2022.

In order to maximize the long-term value of our rich R&D portfolio and in-line with our strategic priorities  we intend to boost in 2023 our R&D investment to around 8.5% of our revenues. In parallel  and in order to prepare for the future  to accompany Virbac’s growth and to increase our medium-term productivity we intend to increase our capital expenditure investments in 2023 to around €100 million. This will include possible € 20-25 million one-time real estate investments in France that will allow us to expand our footprint to prepare for the development of our operations for the next decades. Finally  we continue to execute on the other dimensions of our 2030 Strategic Plan including our commercial focus on our Virbac Busters  the geo-extensions of our key products as well as our entry into new markets such as petfood and livestock in the USA  or parasiticides and petfood in China.As such  in 2023  the ratio of “current operating income  before depreciation of assets arising from acquisitions” (EBIT Adjusted) to “revenue” should consolidate between 13% to 14% at constant exchange rates with a growth in revenue at constant rates and scope anticipated between 4% to 6%. This deterioration in our EBIT adjusted ratio is primarily the result of our deliberate acceleration of our R&D investments as a ratio to revenues since the beginning of 2022 representing  in 2023  ~+2 percentage points compared to 2021 and +~1 percentage point compared to 2022. Consequently  we anticipate our cash position to remain constant at the end of 2023 when compared to 2022.In the medium term  our objective of reaching 20% of EBIT adjusted ratio by 2025-2030 remains unchanged with the assumption of a R&D ""ratio to revenues"" at around 6.5% (vs around 8.5%1 expected in 2023 given our deliberate additional investments).

15162,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-bourses-join-billion-dollar-230000386.html,Asian Bourses Join Billion-Dollar Race to Tap Carbon Offset Boom,(Bloomberg) -- The drive to launch new carbon exchanges in Asia has reached new heights with Malaysia entering the fray  raising questions about how many...,(Bloomberg) -- The drive to launch new carbon exchanges in Asia has reached new heights with Malaysia entering the fray  raising questions about how many will survive in a market that could be worth hundreds of billions in a few decades.Most Read from BloombergBursa Malaysia Bhd. opened an exchange this month  joining more than a dozen that are under way or planned across the region. Thailand and Japan debuted their platforms in September  followed by Hong Kong a month later. Singapore has two fledgling bourses.“We’re in another one of those mad dashes ” Thomas McMahon  co-founder of Singapore’s AirCarbon Pte  said in an interview. “We’ve seen this rush before  if you look at the early days of blockchain” and cryptocurrencies.The exchanges enter a crowded voluntary offsets market that could soar over the next few decades but has so far gotten off to a slow start. Trading and prices have slumped  while concerns mount about how much offsets actually contribute to fighting climate change.What’s clear is that money in Asia is flowing into the space  with investors betting the flurry of climate pledges from countries and companies will drive growth. The exchanges have raised tens of millions of dollars  with powerful backers including sovereign wealth funds like Temasek Holdings Pte of Singapore and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co.  along with banks such as Standard Chartered Plc and DBS Group Holdings Ltd.Demand for offsets could grow 40-fold between now and 2050  to 5.2 billion tons of CO2 equivalent  or about 10% of global emissions  according to BloombergNEF. Prices could reach $120 per ton by then  making it potentially a $600 billion market.Story continuesCompanies are drawn to the offsets market as a way to counter their emissions from burning fossil fuels. An offset is a promissory note that represents a ton of carbon dioxide emissions removed  or not added  to the atmosphere in return for a payment. Some regions  including the European Union and California  have mandatory programs imposed on some polluters  while many of the fledgling exchanges are voluntary markets.Some of these new bourses are setting themselves up for what’s to come in the region  including additional compliance credit schemes that are set to grow  said Hannah Hauman  global head of carbon trading at Trafigura Pte.“It’s a mix of national interest  capacity building  and that down the road  somebody could eventually have a lot of liquidity and win the game ” said Federico Di Credico  Asia-Pacific managing director at ACT Commodities.Elusive ProfitsSo far  it’s been far from lucrative. Existing platforms are struggling to attract enough transactions  with confusion over the integrity of carbon projects and a lack of clarity over how global trading of credits should work. Traders and analysts are also preparing for a bleak year ahead as polluters reduce buying amid inflation and recessionary fears.For standardized contracts to be profitable  volumes would have to be “extremely high” and the market isn’t there yet  Singapore’s Climate Impact X CEO Mikkel Larsen said in an interview. “A lot of things have to improve in the market for all of us to make money.”For now  profitability is “all in the primary market” as margins are higher  he added. In that market  buyers purchase carbon credits directly from project developers  such as through an auction. These can then be traded in the secondary market. CIX  which is backed by Singapore’s stock exchange and Temasek  has sold 420 000 credits through various auctions since it started.AirCarbon  or ACX  which has transacted over 17 million carbon credits to date  aims to break even by 2025  McMahon said. Having raised more than $25 million from funders including Enterprise Singapore  Deutsche Boerse AG and Mubadala  it’s seeking another $50 million in a new round. ACX is targeting $33 million in revenue and 20 million credits transacted next year  McMahon said.New PlayersMore platforms are coming. Indonesia’s bourse is looking to develop its own carbon exchange  while India is putting together a blueprint for a voluntary carbon market. Larsen and McMahon have talked to dozens of companies and countries interested in having their own exchanges.“Everybody decided in 2021  from a commercial perspective  that this would be a great area to build ” Peter Zaman  a Singapore-based lawyer at HFW  said in an interview. “For the current size of the voluntary market  especially in the latest weak demand environment  there are probably a few platforms too many.”Experts meanwhile aren’t convinced the explosion of exchanges will have any meaningful impact on the climate.“These sorts of exchanges might attract financial organizations  speculators  but maybe not so much buyers who actually want to use credits for their climate strategies ” said Gilles Dufrasne  global carbon markets lead at nonprofit Carbon Market Watch. “I don’t think that has the highest benefit for the climate.”--With assistance from Ali Asghar.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.27,0.13,0.6,True,English,"['Carbon Offset Boom', 'Asian Bourses', 'Billion-Dollar Race', 'Climate Impact X CEO Mikkel Larsen', 'additional compliance credit schemes', 'latest weak demand environment', 'DBS Group Holdings Ltd', 'nonprofit Carbon Market Watch', 'sovereign wealth funds', 'Standard Chartered Plc', 'Federico Di Credico', 'Asia-Pacific managing director', 'Deutsche Boerse AG', 'Bursa Malaysia Bhd.', 'two fledgling bourses', 'Mubadala Investment Co.', 'Temasek Holdings Pte', 'Bloomberg L.P.', 'carbon dioxide emissions', 'global carbon markets', 'voluntary carbon market', '17 million carbon credits', 'new carbon exchanges', 'voluntary offsets market', 'meaningful impact', 'voluntary markets', 'new bourses', 'carbon projects', 'carbon trading', 'climate change', 'climate pledges', 'Trafigura Pte', 'climate strategies', 'global emissions', 'global head', 'new heights', 'new round', 'New Players', '20 million credits', 'Hong Kong', 'mad dashes', 'early days', 'slow start', 'powerful backers', 'Abu Dhabi', '5.2 billion tons', 'CO2 equivalent', '$600 billion market', 'fossil fuels', 'promissory note', 'European Union', 'mandatory programs', 'Hannah Hauman', 'national interest', 'capacity building', 'ACT Commodities', 'Elusive Profits', 'enough transactions', 'recessionary fears', 'standardized contracts', 'primary market', 'project developers', 'secondary market', 'various auctions', 'commercial perspective', 'great area', 'Peter Zaman', 'Singapore-based lawyer', 'current size', 'financial organizations', 'Gilles Dufrasne', 'highest benefit', 'Ali Asghar', 'fledgling exchanges', 'global trading', 'AirCarbon Pte', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'stock exchange', 'Thomas McMahon', 'More platforms', 'Enterprise Singapore', '420,000 credits', 'drive', 'fray', 'questions', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'decades', 'dozen', 'way', 'region', 'Thailand', 'Japan', 'September', 'founder', 'interview', 'blockchain', 'cryptocurrencies', 'next', 'prices', 'concerns', 'money', 'space', 'investors', 'flurry', 'countries', 'companies', 'growth', 'tens', 'millions', 'dollars', 'banks', 'BloombergNEF.', 'Story', 'atmosphere', 'return', 'payment', 'California', 'polluters', 'mix', 'road', 'somebody', 'lot', 'liquidity', 'game', 'confusion', 'integrity', 'lack', 'clarity', 'Traders', 'analysts', 'year', 'buying', 'inflation', 'profitable', 'volumes', 'things', 'profitability', 'margins', 'buyers', 'CIX', 'ACX', 'date', 'funders', 'revenue', 'Indonesia', 'India', 'blueprint', 'Everybody', 'HFW', 'Experts', 'explosion', 'sorts', 'speculators', 'assistance']",2022-12-19,2022-12-20,finance.yahoo.com

The NFT Spend Value in the country will increase from US$1109.4 million in 2022 to reach US$5706.6 million by 2028.Globally  the NFT market is booming since NFTs are an innovation that establishes property rights in the digital zone for the first time  and this uniqueness is driving the value of NFTs and hence  the market.In Germany  NFTs are mainly used in digital trading cards  game characters  virtual lands in virtual worlds  or crypto art. As per a novel crypto exchange aggregator  Coincub  Germany had outrun Singapore as the most crypto-friendly country. Germany adopted blockchain technology long back in 2019  boosting digital transformation. This further made the country an attractive hub for developing blockchain  NFT  Web3  and metaverse applications which are further leveraged in fintech  climate tech  and businesses  including Germany's digital identities project.Since the country started to allow crypto investments in long-term domestic savings  the country turned out to be the most suitable for crypto investments. Therefore  the publisher anticipates that in a country such as Germany  where the government's policies are smart and sharp and are much ahead of time  the country is likely to witness substantial growth over the next three to four years.German companies such as About You  SAP  BrainBot  BigchainDB  and many others have been developing NFT  Metaverse  Web3  and crypto payment applications in e-commerce platforms. To fund these upcoming new technologies  a New York-based ETF sponsor focused on innovative thematic funds  Roundhill Investments  introduced the Roundhill Ball Metaverse UCITS ETF on the Deutsche Borse Xetra in March 2022. This is Germany's first metaverse exchange-traded fund.Story continuesThus  it can be inferred that these developments have enabled Germany to adopt and utilize the NFT market in various businesses and organizations in the country. Further  various blockchain start-ups had established in Germany's crypto capital of Berlin  boosting the NFT and allied new markets.The publisher projects that over the next four to eight quarters  the country with a regulatory framework facilitating crypto investments is likely to see significant new start-ups and established businesses plunge into the NFT space to drive growth in business.Drivers of the NFT MarketThe main technology behind most NFTs is Ethereum cryptocurrency's blockchain  a distributed public ledger that records transactions. People are interested in crypto trading and like to collect artworks by NFTs.Germany was ranked as one of the European countries that saw high cryptocurrency adoption in Q1 2022 as Coinclub  an online portal for coin collectors. A Few drivers in the NFT market provide impetus to the NFT market in Germany.Government regulations facilitating the NFT market in the countryOf all the EU countries  Germany enables the user to invest in crypto for long-term domestic savings. Its zero-tax policy supports long-term capital gains from crypto investments. Therefore  it states clearly that these pro-government regulations provided momentum to the NFT adoption in the country.Early blockchain technology adoption in the countryGermany was the first country to adopt blockchain technology and harness it to advance digital transformation in 2019.  At the end of January 2021  Germany's second-largest stock exchange  Boerse Stuttgart Group  officially introduced its crypto-trading app Bison  which enables free-of-charge trading in Bitcoin (BTC)  Ethereum (ETH)  Litecoin (LTC)  and Ripple (XRP).Therefore  early adoption of this technology helped develop NFTs  Web3  and metaverse applications in fintech  climate tech  and business in Germany. Additionally  various companies in Germany started developing NFT  Metaverse  Web3  and crypto payment applications leveraging this technology.Economies of royalty are providing momentum to the NFT market in the countryWhen a person buys an NFT  they gain ownership of the content. However  when it is made public  its value will keep increasing the more it is viewed on the internet. Thus  this is an ongoing source of revenue for the original creator as popular digital assets are bought and sold over time. Artists are entering the NFT space with mutations of their artworks in the country to earn revenueWith the increasing popularity of NFTs  artists and content creators are converting their digital artworks to earn profits. After minting the NFT  the creators have ownership of these unique contents. Therefore  an increasing number of artists are seen to mint NFTs to enhance their profits over the long run.A German-Polish artist  Alicja Kwade  who created artwork of her genome in 2020  had mutated in a series of NFTs in 2022. Her artwork  Selbstportrait  German for a self-portrait  was printed on 259 025 sheets of A4 paper.Interestingly  these NFTs are innovative since each part of the artwork will help the collector trace back to the person  the artist herself  since these NFTs are her genetic traits which are now made public. Her DNA self-portrait  Selbstportrait  is different from the traditional self-portrait as it is a matrix and depicts information that emphasizes similarities of individuals.It also points out how many differences are determined by an individual's upbringing  beliefs  and social injustices. Therefore  the publisher expects this unique DNA-based artwork to receive significant accolades from the collectors and fans in the country.Reasons to buyBased on data and analysis  develop country-level strategies.Identify investment opportunities in growth segments.Exceed competition by incorporating forecast data as well as market trends.Use the relationships between major data sets with valuable insights to improve strategy.Appropriate for providing accurate  high-quality data and analysis to support internal and external presentations.ScopeGermany NFT Market Size and Future Growth Dynamics by Key Performance Indicators  2019-2028Germany NFT Market Size and Forecast by Key Assets  2019-2028Collectibles and ArtReal EstateSportsGamingUtilityFashion & LuxuryOtherGermany NFT Market Size and Forecast by Key NFT Collectible Assets  2019-2028Digital ArtMusic & Sound ClipVideosMemes & GifOtherGermany NFT Market Size and Forecast by Currency  2019-2028EthereumSolanaAvalanchePolygonBSCFlowWaxRoninOtherGermany NFT Market Size and Forecast by Sales Channels  2019-2028PrimarySecondaryGermany User Statistics  2019-2028For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/7jw1iqCONTACT: CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.com Laura Wood Senior Press Manager press@researchandmarkets.com For E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470 For U.S./ CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630 For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.86,0.14,0.0,True,English,"['Future Growth Dynamics Report', 'Germany NFT Market Intelligence', 'Market Value', 'Government Regulations', 'next three to four years', 'next four to eight quarters', 'Roundhill Ball Metaverse UCITS ETF', 'New York-based ETF sponsor', 'Future Growth Dynamics Databook', 'novel crypto exchange aggregator', 'first metaverse exchange-traded fund', 'The NFT Spend Value', 'Early blockchain technology adoption', 'Germany NFT Market Intelligence', 'long-term domestic savings', 'upcoming new technologies', 'innovative thematic funds', 'Deutsche Borse Xetra', 'significant new start-ups', 'distributed public ledger', 'Boerse Stuttgart Group', 'long-term capital gains', 'digital identities project', 'high cryptocurrency adoption', 'A Few drivers', 'popular digital assets', 'crypto payment applications', 'The NFT industry', 'various blockchain start-ups', 'digital trading cards', 'early adoption', 'Roundhill Investments', 'metaverse applications', 'new markets', 'crypto capital', 'NFT adoption', 'Key Assets', 'digital zone', 'digital transformation', 'substantial growth', 'various companies', 'crypto investments', 'crypto trading', 'Company Logo', 'GLOBE NEWSWIRE', '50+ KPIs', 'NFT Investments', 'Sales Channels', 'ResearchAndMarkets.com', 'annual basis', 'forecast period', 'property rights', 'first time', 'game characters', 'virtual lands', 'virtual worlds', 'climate tech', 'German companies', 'many others', 'e-commerce platforms', 'various businesses', 'regulatory framework', 'NFT space', 'main technology', 'Ethereum cryptocurrency', 'European countries', 'online portal', 'coin collectors', 'EU countries', 'zero-tax policy', 'pro-government regulations', 'crypto-trading app', 'ongoing source', 'original creator', 'increasing popularity', 'unique contents', 'increasing number', 'first country', 'crypto art', 'digital artworks', 'established businesses', 'most NFTs', 'crypto-friendly country', 'content creators', 'Dublin', 'Dec.', 'report', 'offering', 'CAGR', 'innovation', 'uniqueness', 'Coincub', 'Singapore', 'fintech', 'publisher', 'policies', 'SAP', 'BrainBot', 'BigchainDB', 'Web', 'March', 'Story', 'developments', 'organizations', 'Berlin', 'transactions', 'People', 'Q1', 'Coinclub', 'impetus', 'user', 'momentum', 'January', 'Bison', 'charge', 'Bitcoin', 'BTC', 'Litecoin', 'LTC', 'Ripple', 'XRP', 'Economies', 'royalty', 'person', 'ownership', 'internet', 'revenue', 'Artists', 'mutations', 'profits']",2022-12-20,2022-12-20,finance.yahoo.com

This is due on the one hand to further acquisitions  but also to index-linked rent increases in the past financial year due to the value protection clauses. The increase in rents was counteracted by the rent disposals of the properties sold in the financial year.Funds from operations (""FFO"") were stable at EUR 41.1 million (previous year EUR 41.2 million) due to property disposals as well as higher maintenance expenses and slightly higher value adjustments  which is within the previous year's forecast (EUR 40.0 million to EUR 44.0 million). Accordingly  FFO per share was also stable at EUR 1.17. The aFFO (FFO after deduction of capitalised modernisation measures) was also stable at EUR 22.5 million (previous year EUR 22.6 million) or EUR 0.64 per share (previous year EUR 0.64 per share) due to extensive investments in further revitalisation properties.Balance sheet value of the real estate portfolio at EUR 1.1 billion.In the past financial year  DKR acquired 25 retail properties with an investment volume of around EUR 100 million and an annual rent of EUR 8.0 million (average initial yield of 8.2%)  of which the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership of 14 properties with annual rents of EUR 3.9 million took place before the balance sheet date. This contrasts with the disposal of twelve sold properties with annual rents of EUR 3.4 million and sales proceeds of EUR 63.7 million (average yield 5.3%).Furthermore  as part of the annual property valuation by an external and independent valuation company  the property portfolio was revalued by approximately EUR 28 million as of the balance sheet date (after capex investments of EUR 18.6 million)  which means that the property portfolio is currently valued at approximately 14.3 times the annual rent.As a result  the property portfolio recognised as of 30 September 2022 comprises 175 retail properties with a balance sheet value of EUR 1.051 billion (30 September 2021: EUR 1.014 billion) and generates an annualised annual rent of approximately EUR 73.2 million (30 September 2021: EUR 72.9 million).Another food-anchored property in Suhl (Thuringia) was acquired by notarial deed in October 2022. The investment volume for this property is around EUR 0.5 million. The annualised rent amounts to approximately TEUR 54. The change of use and encumbrance of the property is expected to take place at the beginning of 2023.Including the other properties purchased and sold  for which the change of use and encumbrance did take place after 30 September 2022  the DKR portfolio currently comprises 185 retail properties on a pro forma basis with an annual rent of EUR 76.9 million and a balance sheet value of EUR 1.083 billion.The average yield on acquisition of the entire portfolio is currently around 10.0%.EPRA NTA per share increases to EUR 10.98 / Net LTV amounts to 49.7%The EPRA NTA per share (fully diluted) increased by 9% to EUR 10.98 as of 30 September 2022 (30 September 2021: EUR 10.10 per share). This is primarily the result of the profit for the period  which is significantly influenced by the property valuation in addition to the management result.The net LTV at the end of the financial year was 49.7% (previous year 53.2%) and is thus slightly below the target value of around 50%.Dividend proposal for the 2021/2022 business year of EUR 0.48 per shareThe Management Board is proposing a dividend of EUR 0.48 per share for the past financial year  which is 20% higher than the previous year's dividend.FFO forecast for the 2022/2023 financial year again between EUR 40 million and EUR 44 million.For the new financial year  the Management Board currently expects FFO between EUR 40 million and EUR 44 million  taking into account the higher interest rates for new financing due to the ECB's interest rate steps.Rolf Elgeti  CEO of Deutsche Konsum REIT-AG:""Despite the difficult overall environment  DKR's defensive business model again proved to be very robust in the past financial year 2021/2022. Above all  the value protection clauses have proven to be effective instruments in the current inflationary environment  with which even the interest rate increases can be compensated to a large extent. Furthermore  with selective property sales at attractive conditions  we have extensive liquid funds available for attractive purchases in the current situation.""Conference CallDeutsche Konsum REIT-AG will hold an analysts' conference (webcast and conference call) on the annual results of the 2021/2022 financial year today  20 December 2022   at 10:00 a.m. CET/11:00 SAST.

Therefore  it states clearly that these pro-government regulations provided momentum to the NFT adoption in the country.Early blockchain technology adoption in the countryGermany was the first country to adopt blockchain technology and harness it to advance digital transformation in 2019.  At the end of January 2021  Germany's second-largest stock exchange  Boerse Stuttgart Group  officially introduced its crypto-trading app Bison  which enables free-of-charge trading in Bitcoin (BTC)  Ethereum (ETH)  Litecoin (LTC)  and Ripple (XRP).Therefore  early adoption of this technology helped develop NFTs  Web3  and metaverse applications in fintech  climate tech  and business in Germany. Additionally  various companies in Germany started developing NFT  Metaverse  Web3  and crypto payment applications leveraging this technology.Economies of royalty are providing momentum to the NFT market in the countryWhen a person buys an NFT  they gain ownership of the content. However  when it is made public  its value will keep increasing the more it is viewed on the internet. Thus  this is an ongoing source of revenue for the original creator as popular digital assets are bought and sold over time. Artists are entering the NFT space with mutations of their artworks in the country to earn revenueWith the increasing popularity of NFTs  artists and content creators are converting their digital artworks to earn profits. After minting the NFT  the creators have ownership of these unique contents. Therefore  an increasing number of artists are seen to mint NFTs to enhance their profits over the long run.A German-Polish artist  Alicja Kwade  who created artwork of her genome in 2020  had mutated in a series of NFTs in 2022. Her artwork  Selbstportrait  German for a self-portrait  was printed on 259 025 sheets of A4 paper.Interestingly  these NFTs are innovative since each part of the artwork will help the collector trace back to the person  the artist herself  since these NFTs are her genetic traits which are now made public. Her DNA self-portrait  Selbstportrait  is different from the traditional self-portrait as it is a matrix and depicts information that emphasizes similarities of individuals.It also points out how many differences are determined by an individual's upbringing  beliefs  and social injustices. Therefore  the publisher expects this unique DNA-based artwork to receive significant accolades from the collectors and fans in the country.Reasons to buyBased on data and analysis  develop country-level strategies.Identify investment opportunities in growth segments.Exceed competition by incorporating forecast data as well as market trends.Use the relationships between major data sets with valuable insights to improve strategy.Appropriate for providing accurate  high-quality data and analysis to support internal and external presentations.ScopeGermany NFT Market Size and Future Growth Dynamics by Key Performance Indicators  2019-2028Germany NFT Market Size and Forecast by Key Assets  2019-2028Collectibles and ArtReal EstateSportsGamingUtilityFashion & LuxuryOtherGermany NFT Market Size and Forecast by Key NFT Collectible Assets  2019-2028Digital ArtMusic & Sound ClipVideosMemes & GifOtherGermany NFT Market Size and Forecast by Currency  2019-2028EthereumSolanaAvalanchePolygonBSCFlowWaxRoninOtherGermany NFT Market Size and Forecast by Sales Channels  2019-2028PrimarySecondaryGermany User Statistics  2019-2028For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/7jw1iq",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.65,0.34,0.0,True,English,"['Future Growth Dynamics Report', 'Germany NFT Market Intelligence', 'Market Value', 'Government Regulations', 'next three to four years', 'next four to eight quarters', 'Roundhill Ball Metaverse UCITS ETF', 'New York-based ETF sponsor', 'Future Growth Dynamics Databook', 'novel crypto exchange aggregator', 'first metaverse exchange-traded fund', 'The NFT Spend Value', 'Early blockchain technology adoption', 'Germany NFT Market Intelligence', 'long-term domestic savings', 'upcoming new technologies', 'innovative thematic funds', 'Deutsche Borse Xetra', 'significant new start-ups', 'Boerse Stuttgart Group', 'long-term capital gains', 'digital identities project', 'high cryptocurrency adoption', 'A Few drivers', 'popular digital assets', 'crypto payment applications', 'The NFT industry', 'various blockchain start-ups', 'digital trading cards', 'early adoption', 'Roundhill Investments', 'metaverse applications', 'new markets', 'crypto capital', 'NFT adoption', 'Key Assets', 'digital zone', 'digital transformation', 'substantial growth', 'various companies', 'crypto art', 'crypto investments', 'crypto trading', 'GLOBE NEWSWIRE', '50+ KPIs', 'NFT Investments', 'Sales Channels', 'ResearchAndMarkets.com', 'annual basis', 'forecast period', 'property rights', 'first time', 'game characters', 'virtual lands', 'virtual worlds', 'climate tech', 'German companies', 'many others', 'e-commerce platforms', 'various businesses', 'regulatory framework', 'NFT space', 'main technology', 'Ethereum cryptocurrency', 'public ledger', 'European countries', 'online portal', 'coin collectors', 'EU countries', 'zero-tax policy', 'pro-government regulations', 'crypto-trading app', 'ongoing source', 'original creator', 'increasing popularity', 'unique contents', 'increasing number', 'first country', 'digital artworks', 'established businesses', 'crypto-friendly country', 'most NFTs', 'content creators', 'Dublin', 'Dec.', 'Q2', 'report', 'offering', 'CAGR', 'innovation', 'uniqueness', 'Coincub', 'Singapore', 'publisher', 'policies', 'SAP', 'BrainBot', 'BigchainDB', 'Web', 'March', 'developments', 'organizations', 'Berlin', 'transactions', 'People', 'Q1', 'Coinclub', 'impetus', 'user', 'momentum', 'January', 'Bison', 'charge', 'Bitcoin', 'BTC', 'Litecoin', 'LTC', 'Ripple', 'XRP', 'fintech', 'Economies', 'royalty', 'person', 'ownership', 'internet', 'revenue', 'Artists', 'mutations', 'profits']",2022-12-20,2022-12-20,globenewswire.com

Thailand and Japan debuted their platforms in September  followed by Hong Kong a month later. Singapore has two fledgling bourses.“We’re in another one of those mad dashes ” Thomas McMahon  co-founder of Singapore’s AirCarbon Pte  said in an interview. “We’ve seen this rush before  if you look at the early days of blockchain” and cryptocurrencies.The exchanges enter a crowded voluntary offsets market that could soar over the next few decades but has so far gotten off to a slow start. Trading and prices have slumped  while concerns mount about how much offsets actually contribute to fighting .What’s clear is that money in Asia is flowing into the space  with investors betting the flurry of climate pledges from countries and companies will drive growth. The exchanges have raised tens of millions of dollars  with powerful backers including sovereign wealth funds like Temasek Holdings Pte of Singapore and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co.  along with banks such as Standard Chartered Plc and DBS Group Holdings Ltd.Demand for offsets could grow 40-fold between now and 2050  to 5.2 billion tons of CO2 equivalent  or about 10% of global emissions  according to BloombergNEF. Prices could reach $120 per ton by then  making it potentially a $600 billion market.Companies are drawn to the offsets market as a way to counter their emissions from burning fossil fuels. An offset is a promissory note that represents a ton of carbon dioxide emissions removed  or not added  to the atmosphere in return for a payment. Some regions  including the European Union and California  have mandatory programs imposed on some polluters  while many of the fledgling exchanges are voluntary markets.Some of these new bourses are setting themselves up for what’s to come in the region  including additional compliance credit schemes that are set to grow  said Hannah Hauman  global head of carbon trading at Trafigura Pte.“It’s a mix of national interest  capacity building  and that down the road  somebody could eventually have a lot of liquidity and win the game ” said Federico Di Credico  Asia-Pacific managing director at ACT Commodities.Elusive ProfitsSo far  it’s been far from lucrative. Existing platforms are struggling to attract enough transactions  with confusion over the integrity of carbon projects and a lack of clarity over how global trading of credits should work. Traders and analysts are also preparing for a bleak year ahead as polluters reduce buying amid inflation and recessionary fears.For standardized contracts to be profitable  volumes would have to be “extremely high” and the market isn’t there yet  Singapore’s Climate Impact X CEO Mikkel Larsen said in an interview. “A lot of things have to improve in the market for all of us to make money.”For now  profitability is “all in the primary market” as margins are higher  he added. In that market  buyers purchase carbon credits directly from project developers  such as through an auction. These can then be traded in the secondary market. CIX  which is backed by Singapore’s stock exchange and Temasek  has sold 420 000 credits through various auctions since it started.AirCarbon  or ACX  which has transacted over 17 million carbon credits to date  aims to break even by 2025  McMahon said. Having raised more than $25 million from funders including Enterprise Singapore  Deutsche Boerse AG and Mubadala  it’s seeking another $50 million in a new round. ACX is targeting $33 million in revenue and 20 million credits transacted next year  McMahon said.New PlayersMore platforms are coming. Indonesia’s bourse is looking to develop its own carbon exchange  while India is putting together a blueprint for a voluntary carbon market. Larsen and McMahon have talked to dozens of companies and countries interested in having their own exchanges.“Everybody decided in 2021  from a commercial perspective  that this would be a great area to build ” Peter Zaman  a Singapore-based lawyer at HFW  said in an interview. “For the current size of the voluntary market  especially in the latest weak demand environment  there are probably a few platforms too many.”Experts meanwhile aren’t convinced the explosion of exchanges will have any meaningful impact on the climate.“These sorts of exchanges might attract financial organizations  speculators  but maybe not so much buyers who actually want to use credits for their climate strategies ” said Gilles Dufrasne  global carbon markets lead at nonprofit Carbon Market Watch. “I don’t think that has the highest benefit for the climate.”,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.21,0.1,0.69,True,English,"['new carbon exchanges', 'Asian bourses', 'billion-dollar race', 'Climate Impact X CEO Mikkel Larsen', 'additional compliance credit schemes', 'latest weak demand environment', 'DBS Group Holdings Ltd', 'nonprofit Carbon Market Watch', 'sovereign wealth funds', 'Standard Chartered Plc', 'Federico Di Credico', 'Asia-Pacific managing director', 'Deutsche Boerse AG', 'Bursa Malaysia Bhd.', 'two fledgling bourses', 'Mubadala Investment Co.', 'Temasek Holdings Pte', 'carbon dioxide emissions', 'global carbon markets', 'voluntary carbon market', '17 million carbon credits', 'new carbon exchanges', 'voluntary offsets market', 'meaningful impact', 'voluntary markets', 'new bourses', 'carbon projects', 'climate pledges', 'climate strategies', 'carbon trading', 'Trafigura Pte', 'global emissions', 'global head', 'new heights', 'new round', 'New Players', '20 million credits', 'Hong Kong', 'mad dashes', 'early days', 'slow start', 'powerful backers', 'Abu Dhabi', '5.2 billion tons', 'CO2 equivalent', '$600 billion market', 'fossil fuels', 'promissory note', 'European Union', 'mandatory programs', 'Hannah Hauman', 'national interest', 'capacity building', 'ACT Commodities', 'Elusive Profits', 'enough transactions', 'recessionary fears', 'standardized contracts', 'primary market', 'project developers', 'secondary market', 'various auctions', 'commercial perspective', 'great area', 'Peter Zaman', 'Singapore-based lawyer', 'current size', 'financial organizations', 'Gilles Dufrasne', 'highest benefit', 'fledgling exchanges', 'global trading', 'AirCarbon Pte', 'stock exchange', 'Thomas McMahon', 'More platforms', 'Enterprise Singapore', '420,000 credits', 'drive', 'fray', 'questions', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'decades', 'dozen', 'way', 'region', 'Thailand', 'Japan', 'September', 'founder', 'interview', 'blockchain', 'cryptocurrencies', 'next', 'prices', 'concerns', 'money', 'space', 'investors', 'flurry', 'countries', 'companies', 'growth', 'tens', 'millions', 'dollars', 'banks', 'BloombergNEF.', 'atmosphere', 'return', 'payment', 'California', 'polluters', 'mix', 'road', 'somebody', 'lot', 'liquidity', 'game', 'confusion', 'integrity', 'lack', 'clarity', 'Traders', 'analysts', 'year', 'buying', 'inflation', 'profitable', 'volumes', 'things', 'profitability', 'margins', 'buyers', 'CIX', 'ACX', 'date', 'funders', 'revenue', 'Indonesia', 'India', 'blueprint', 'HFW', 'Experts', 'explosion', 'sorts', 'speculators']",2022-12-20,2022-12-20,business-standard.com

This is due on the one hand to further acquisitions  but also to index-linked rent increases in the past financial year due to the value protection clauses. The increase in rents was counteracted by the rent disposals of the properties sold in the financial year.Funds from operations (""FFO"") were stable at EUR 41.1 million (previous year EUR 41.2 million) due to property disposals as well as higher maintenance expenses and slightly higher value adjustments  which is within the previous year's forecast (EUR 40.0 million to EUR 44.0 million). Accordingly  FFO per share was also stable at EUR 1.17. The aFFO (FFO after deduction of capitalised modernisation measures) was also stable at EUR 22.5 million (previous year EUR 22.6 million) or EUR 0.64 per share (previous year EUR 0.64 per share) due to extensive investments in further revitalisation properties.Balance sheet value of the real estate portfolio at EUR 1.1 billion.In the past financial year  DKR acquired 25 retail properties with an investment volume of around EUR 100 million and an annual rent of EUR 8.0 million (average initial yield of 8.2%)  of which the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership of 14 properties with annual rents of EUR 3.9 million took place before the balance sheet date. This contrasts with the disposal of twelve sold properties with annual rents of EUR 3.4 million and sales proceeds of EUR 63.7 million (average yield 5.3%).Furthermore  as part of the annual property valuation by an external and independent valuation company  the property portfolio was revalued by approximately EUR 28 million as of the balance sheet date (after capex investments of EUR 18.6 million)  which means that the property portfolio is currently valued at approximately 14.3 times the annual rent.As a result  the property portfolio recognised as of 30 September 2022 comprises 175 retail properties with a balance sheet value of EUR 1.051 billion (30 September 2021: EUR 1.014 billion) and generates an annualised annual rent of approximately EUR 73.2 million (30 September 2021: EUR 72.9 million).Another food-anchored property in Suhl (Thuringia) was acquired by notarial deed in October 2022. The investment volume for this property is around EUR 0.5 million. The annualised rent amounts to approximately TEUR 54. The change of use and encumbrance of the property is expected to take place at the beginning of 2023.Including the other properties purchased and sold  for which the change of use and encumbrance did take place after 30 September 2022  the DKR portfolio currently comprises 185 retail properties on a pro forma basis with an annual rent of EUR 76.9 million and a balance sheet value of EUR 1.083 billion.The average yield on acquisition of the entire portfolio is currently around 10.0%.EPRA NTA per share increases to EUR 10.98 / Net LTV amounts to 49.7%The EPRA NTA per share (fully diluted) increased by 9% to EUR 10.98 as of 30 September 2022 (30 September 2021: EUR 10.10 per share). This is primarily the result of the profit for the period  which is significantly influenced by the property valuation in addition to the management result.The net LTV at the end of the financial year was 49.7% (previous year 53.2%) and is thus slightly below the target value of around 50%.Dividend proposal for the 2021/2022 business year of EUR 0.48 per shareThe Management Board is proposing a dividend of EUR 0.48 per share for the past financial year  which is 20% higher than the previous year's dividend.FFO forecast for the 2022/2023 financial year again between EUR 40 million and EUR 44 million.For the new financial year  the Management Board currently expects FFO between EUR 40 million and EUR 44 million  taking into account the higher interest rates for new financing due to the ECB's interest rate steps.Rolf Elgeti  CEO of Deutsche Konsum REIT-AG:""Despite the difficult overall environment  DKR's defensive business model again proved to be very robust in the past financial year 2021/2022. Above all  the value protection clauses have proven to be effective instruments in the current inflationary environment  with which even the interest rate increases can be compensated to a large extent. Furthermore  with selective property sales at attractive conditions  we have extensive liquid funds available for attractive purchases in the current situation.""Conference CallDeutsche Konsum REIT-AG will hold an analysts' conference (webcast and conference call) on the annual results of the 2021/2022 financial year today  20 December 2022   at 10:00 a.m. CET/11:00 SAST.

Balance sheet value of the real estate portfolio at EUR 1.1 billion.In the past financial year  DKR acquired 25 retail properties with an investment volume of around EUR 100 million and an annual rent of EUR 8.0 million (average initial yield of 8.2%)  of which the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership of 14 properties with annual rents of EUR 3.9 million took place before the balance sheet date. This contrasts with the disposal of twelve sold properties with annual rents of EUR 3.4 million and sales proceeds of EUR 63.7 million (average yield 5.3%). Furthermore  as part of the annual property valuation by an external and independent valuation company  the property portfolio was revalued by approximately EUR 28 million as of the balance sheet date (after capex investments of EUR 18.6 million)  which means that the property portfolio is currently valued at approximately 14.3 times the annual rent. As a result  the property portfolio recognised as of 30 September 2022 comprises 175 retail properties with a balance sheet value of EUR 1.051 billion (30 September 2021: EUR 1.014 billion) and generates an annualised annual rent of approximately EUR 73.2 million (30 September 2021: EUR 72.9 million). Another food-anchored property in Suhl (Thuringia) was acquired by notarial deed in October 2022. The investment volume for this property is around EUR 0.5 million. The annualised rent amounts to approximately TEUR 54. The change of use and encumbrance of the property is expected to take place at the beginning of 2023. Including the other properties purchased and sold  for which the change of use and encumbrance did take place after 30 September 2022  the DKR portfolio currently comprises 185 retail properties on a pro forma basis with an annual rent of EUR 76.9 million and a balance sheet value of EUR 1.083 billion. The average yield on acquisition of the entire portfolio is currently around 10.0%. EPRA NTA per share increases to EUR 10.98 / Net LTV amounts to 49.7%The EPRA NTA per share (fully diluted) increased by 9% to EUR 10.98 as of 30 September 2022 (30 September 2021: EUR 10.10 per share). This is primarily the result of the profit for the period  which is significantly influenced by the property valuation in addition to the management result. The net LTV at the end of the financial year was 49.7% (previous year 53.2%) and is thus slightly below the target value of around 50%. Dividend proposal for the 2021/2022 business year of EUR 0.48 per shareThe Management Board is proposing a dividend of EUR 0.48 per share for the past financial year  which is 20% higher than the previous year's dividend. FFO forecast for the 2022/2023 financial year again between EUR 40 million and EUR 44 million.For the new financial year  the Management Board currently expects FFO between EUR 40 million and EUR 44 million  taking into account the higher interest rates for new financing due to the ECB's interest rate steps. Rolf Elgeti  CEO of Deutsche Konsum REIT-AG:""Despite the difficult overall environment  DKR's defensive business model again proved to be very robust in the past financial year 2021/2022. Above all  the value protection clauses have proven to be effective instruments in the current inflationary environment  with which even the interest rate increases can be compensated to a large extent. Furthermore  with selective property sales at attractive conditions  we have extensive liquid funds available for attractive purchases in the current situation.""

It’s expected to be operational by around the end of 2026. The Dutch site has been deemed a European Project of Common Interest by the EU and has already received more than €4m in grants.Corre Energy  whose chief executive is Kevin McGrane  has teamed up with investment partner Infracapital to help deliver the project.Corre Energy listed on the Euronext Growth market in Dublin in 2021. It raised €12m from that initial public offering. Earlier this year  it raised a further €11m from investors via a share placement.Shares in the company have more than doubled this year  having surged as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine saw energy prices soar and fears raised about security of supply across Europe.The group now has a market capitalisation of €191m.Corre Energy is developing about a dozen large-scale hydrogen-based energy storage projects across northern Europe. It said these facilities will address grid-level imbalances associated with increasing volumes of renewable energy generation.Under the terms of the arrangement with Eneco  Corre Energy will construct  operate and maintain the Zuidwending facility. Eneco will optimise the entire output of the storage site on behalf of Corre Energy. Eneco will provide market access services  enabling Corre Energy to benefit from revenue linked to the high flexibility value of the asset  while also guaranteeing a base level of income.“Zuidwending will be hydrogen fuel enabled from day one and we expect the maturing of the hydrogen market to allow the facility to operate entirely on surplus renewable energy and green hydrogen  making an increasingly positive environmental impact ” said Mr McGrane.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.0,1.0,True,English,"['Corre Energy', 'supply deal', 'Dutch site', 'dozen large-scale hydrogen-based energy storage projects', 'Zuidwending Compressed Air Energy Storage', 'maximum storage discharge duration', 'entire storage capacity', '15-year offtake agreement', 'up to 320MW', 'initial public offering', 'high flexibility value', 'positive environmental impact', 'renewable energy generation', 'surplus renewable energy', 'cavern development partner', 'Euronext Growth market', 'market access services', 'Energy storage group', 'Dutch power provider', 'storage site', 'Zuidwending facility', 'Corre Energy', 'energy prices', 'investment partner', 'market capitalisation', 'entire output', 'hydrogen market', 'Dutch site', 'extension rights', 'exclusive rights', 'salt caverns', 'Common Interest', 'chief executive', 'Kevin McGrane', 'share placement', 'grid-level imbalances', 'increasing volumes', 'base level', 'hydrogen fuel', 'green hydrogen', 'Mr McGrane', 'major facility', 'CAES) facility', 'CAES facility', 'northern Europe', 'deal', 'Netherlands', 'Eneco', 'province', 'Groningen', 'conjunction', '3.5 days', 'grants', 'Infracapital', 'Dublin', 'investors', 'Shares', 'company', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'fears', 'security', 'supply', 'facilities', 'terms', 'arrangement', 'behalf', 'revenue', 'asset', 'income', 'maturing']",2022-12-19,2022-12-20,independent.ie

These are based on the physical phenomenon of quantum entanglement  which occurs when two elementary particles - two electrons (electrical particles) or two photons (light particles) - share identical parameters even though they are very far apart.This requires stringent conditions for their production environment  which must be ultra-pure  ultra-controlled and ultra-cold  with single-atom precision.The technologies available to deliver these performance levels include MBE  the material growth technique in which RIBER has built up industry-leading expertise  which is one of the best positioned. That is why RIBER is part of a joint quantum computers laboratory program to develop the technological components enabling them to be built.To produce electrons or photons  it is possible to use “quantum dots”  which are small volumes of ultra-pure and ultra-controlled semiconductor alloys developed and controlled using MBE. To transport them  superconductor metals can be used with ultra-precise dimensions (atomic scale)  within which the electrons flow undisrupted. The MBE technology is perfect for depositing these superconducting materials in an ultra-pure environment with atomic layer-controlled thickness.These quantum dots and superconductors need to be perfectly insulated from their environment  which is achieved by depositing dedicated oxide materials.The various stages for developing the quantum dots  superconductors and insulators require various deposition chambers which must have an ultra-high - or almost perfect - vacuum in order to avoid any contamination. Vacuum quality is part of the excellence provided by RIBER’s technology for these MBE machines.An MBE machine for quantum computers will therefore include several deposition chambers connected together by robots under ultra-high vacuum conditions. It may include three to five chambers linked by two or three robots under ultra-high vacuum conditions  controlled by highly sophisticated supervision software which manages the sample movements and material deposition process.With the complexity of this type of equipment due to the number of chambers and the ultra-purity  ultra-control and ultra-cold performance levels  this advanced technology has a market value of several million euros per machine.This is illustrated by the order announced on October 25 for several million euros of research equipment  including several chambers and equipment items  in order to provide a new European research laboratory with the flexibility and versatility of MBE to use materials representing future quantum computer components.Michel Picault  Chairman of RIBER’s Executive Board  concludes: “The quantum technology is very promising  but it still needs to overcome some significant development challenges to build specific chips. RIBER’s MBE technology will make it possible to accelerate progress towards manufacturing quantum chips on a larger scale. Our Joint Laboratory with LAAS-CNRS will help us reach this higher level of technological maturity more quickly”.About RIBERRIBER is the global market leader for MBE - molecular beam epitaxy - equipment. It designs and produces MBE systems and evaporators for the semiconductor industry.

This requires stringent conditions for their production environment  which must be ultra-pure  ultra-controlled and ultra-cold  with single-atom precision.The technologies av…,PRESS RELEASERIBER deploys MBE technology to support quantum computing materialsBezons  December 20  2022 – 8am – RIBER  a global market leader for semiconductor industry equipment  has further strengthened its development on the quantum processor materials market in 2022.Through EPICENTRE  a Joint Laboratory with LAAS-CNRS in Toulouse  set up in June 2021  RIBER has started to deploy the technologies making it possible to build the core components of future-generation quantum computers. These are based on the physical phenomenon of quantum entanglement  which occurs when two elementary particles - two electrons (electrical particles) or two photons (light particles) - share identical parameters even though they are very far apart.This requires stringent conditions for their production environment  which must be ultra-pure  ultra-controlled and ultra-cold  with single-atom precision.The technologies available to deliver these performance levels include MBE  the material growth technique in which RIBER has built up industry-leading expertise  which is one of the best positioned. That is why RIBER is part of a joint quantum computers laboratory program to develop the technological components enabling them to be built.To produce electrons or photons  it is possible to use “quantum dots”  which are small volumes of ultra-pure and ultra-controlled semiconductor alloys developed and controlled using MBE. To transport them  superconductor metals can be used with ultra-precise dimensions (atomic scale)  within which the electrons flow undisrupted. The MBE technology is perfect for depositing these superconducting materials in an ultra-pure environment with atomic layer-controlled thickness.These quantum dots and superconductors need to be perfectly insulated from their environment  which is achieved by depositing dedicated oxide materials.The various stages for developing the quantum dots  superconductors and insulators require various deposition chambers which must have an ultra-high - or almost perfect - vacuum in order to avoid any contamination. Vacuum quality is part of the excellence provided by RIBER’s technology for these MBE machines.An MBE machine for quantum computers will therefore include several deposition chambers connected together by robots under ultra-high vacuum conditions. It may include three to five chambers linked by two or three robots under ultra-high vacuum conditions  controlled by highly sophisticated supervision software which manages the sample movements and material deposition process.With the complexity of this type of equipment due to the number of chambers and the ultra-purity  ultra-control and ultra-cold performance levels  this advanced technology has a market value of several million euros per machine.This is illustrated by the order announced on October 25 for several million euros of research equipment  including several chambers and equipment items  in order to provide a new European research laboratory with the flexibility and versatility of MBE to use materials representing future quantum computer components.Michel Picault  Chairman of RIBER’s Executive Board  concludes: “The quantum technology is very promising  but it still needs to overcome some significant development challenges to build specific chips. RIBER’s MBE technology will make it possible to accelerate progress towards manufacturing quantum chips on a larger scale. Our Joint Laboratory with LAAS-CNRS will help us reach this higher level of technological maturity more quickly”.About RIBERRIBER is the global market leader for MBE - molecular beam epitaxy - equipment.
