This is due on the one hand to further acquisitions  but also to index-linked rent increases in the past financial year due to the value protection clauses. The increase in rents was counteracted by the rent disposals of the properties sold in the financial year.Funds from operations (""FFO"") were stable at EUR 41.1 million (previous year EUR 41.2 million) due to property disposals as well as higher maintenance expenses and slightly higher value adjustments  which is within the previous year's forecast (EUR 40.0 million to EUR 44.0 million). Accordingly  FFO per share was also stable at EUR 1.17. The aFFO (FFO after deduction of capitalised modernisation measures) was also stable at EUR 22.5 million (previous year EUR 22.6 million) or EUR 0.64 per share (previous year EUR 0.64 per share) due to extensive investments in further revitalisation properties.Balance sheet value of the real estate portfolio at EUR 1.1 billion.In the past financial year  DKR acquired 25 retail properties with an investment volume of around EUR 100 million and an annual rent of EUR 8.0 million (average initial yield of 8.2%)  of which the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership of 14 properties with annual rents of EUR 3.9 million took place before the balance sheet date. This contrasts with the disposal of twelve sold properties with annual rents of EUR 3.4 million and sales proceeds of EUR 63.7 million (average yield 5.3%).Furthermore  as part of the annual property valuation by an external and independent valuation company  the property portfolio was revalued by approximately EUR 28 million as of the balance sheet date (after capex investments of EUR 18.6 million)  which means that the property portfolio is currently valued at approximately 14.3 times the annual rent.As a result  the property portfolio recognised as of 30 September 2022 comprises 175 retail properties with a balance sheet value of EUR 1.051 billion (30 September 2021: EUR 1.014 billion) and generates an annualised annual rent of approximately EUR 73.2 million (30 September 2021: EUR 72.9 million).Another food-anchored property in Suhl (Thuringia) was acquired by notarial deed in October 2022. The investment volume for this property is around EUR 0.5 million. The annualised rent amounts to approximately TEUR 54. The change of use and encumbrance of the property is expected to take place at the beginning of 2023.Including the other properties purchased and sold  for which the change of use and encumbrance did take place after 30 September 2022  the DKR portfolio currently comprises 185 retail properties on a pro forma basis with an annual rent of EUR 76.9 million and a balance sheet value of EUR 1.083 billion.The average yield on acquisition of the entire portfolio is currently around 10.0%.EPRA NTA per share increases to EUR 10.98 / Net LTV amounts to 49.7%The EPRA NTA per share (fully diluted) increased by 9% to EUR 10.98 as of 30 September 2022 (30 September 2021: EUR 10.10 per share). This is primarily the result of the profit for the period  which is significantly influenced by the property valuation in addition to the management result.The net LTV at the end of the financial year was 49.7% (previous year 53.2%) and is thus slightly below the target value of around 50%.Dividend proposal for the 2021/2022 business year of EUR 0.48 per shareThe Management Board is proposing a dividend of EUR 0.48 per share for the past financial year  which is 20% higher than the previous year's dividend.FFO forecast for the 2022/2023 financial year again between EUR 40 million and EUR 44 million.For the new financial year  the Management Board currently expects FFO between EUR 40 million and EUR 44 million  taking into account the higher interest rates for new financing due to the ECB's interest rate steps.Rolf Elgeti  CEO of Deutsche Konsum REIT-AG:""Despite the difficult overall environment  DKR's defensive business model again proved to be very robust in the past financial year 2021/2022. Above all  the value protection clauses have proven to be effective instruments in the current inflationary environment  with which even the interest rate increases can be compensated to a large extent. Furthermore  with selective property sales at attractive conditions  we have extensive liquid funds available for attractive purchases in the current situation.""Conference CallDeutsche Konsum REIT-AG will hold an analysts' conference (webcast and conference call) on the annual results of the 2021/2022 financial year today  20 December 2022   at 10:00 a.m. CET/11:00 SAST.

15167,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/asian-bourses-join-billion-dollar-race-to-launch-new-carbon-exchanges-122122000110_1.html,Asian bourses join billion-dollar race to launch new carbon exchanges,Trading and prices have slumped  while concerns mount about how much offsets actually contribute to fighting climate change,The drive to launch new carbon exchanges in Asia has reached new heights with Malaysia entering the fray  raising questions about how many will survive in a market that could be worth hundreds of billions in a few decades.Bursa Malaysia Bhd. opened an exchange this month  joining more than a dozen that are under way or planned across the region. Thailand and Japan debuted their platforms in September  followed by Hong Kong a month later. Singapore has two fledgling bourses.“We’re in another one of those mad dashes ” Thomas McMahon  co-founder of Singapore’s AirCarbon Pte  said in an interview. “We’ve seen this rush before  if you look at the early days of blockchain” and cryptocurrencies.The exchanges enter a crowded voluntary offsets market that could soar over the next few decades but has so far gotten off to a slow start. Trading and prices have slumped  while concerns mount about how much offsets actually contribute to fighting .What’s clear is that money in Asia is flowing into the space  with investors betting the flurry of climate pledges from countries and companies will drive growth. The exchanges have raised tens of millions of dollars  with powerful backers including sovereign wealth funds like Temasek Holdings Pte of Singapore and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co.  along with banks such as Standard Chartered Plc and DBS Group Holdings Ltd.Demand for offsets could grow 40-fold between now and 2050  to 5.2 billion tons of CO2 equivalent  or about 10% of global emissions  according to BloombergNEF. Prices could reach $120 per ton by then  making it potentially a $600 billion market.Companies are drawn to the offsets market as a way to counter their emissions from burning fossil fuels. An offset is a promissory note that represents a ton of carbon dioxide emissions removed  or not added  to the atmosphere in return for a payment. Some regions  including the European Union and California  have mandatory programs imposed on some polluters  while many of the fledgling exchanges are voluntary markets.Some of these new bourses are setting themselves up for what’s to come in the region  including additional compliance credit schemes that are set to grow  said Hannah Hauman  global head of carbon trading at Trafigura Pte.“It’s a mix of national interest  capacity building  and that down the road  somebody could eventually have a lot of liquidity and win the game ” said Federico Di Credico  Asia-Pacific managing director at ACT Commodities.Elusive ProfitsSo far  it’s been far from lucrative. Existing platforms are struggling to attract enough transactions  with confusion over the integrity of carbon projects and a lack of clarity over how global trading of credits should work. Traders and analysts are also preparing for a bleak year ahead as polluters reduce buying amid inflation and recessionary fears.For standardized contracts to be profitable  volumes would have to be “extremely high” and the market isn’t there yet  Singapore’s Climate Impact X CEO Mikkel Larsen said in an interview. “A lot of things have to improve in the market for all of us to make money.”For now  profitability is “all in the primary market” as margins are higher  he added. In that market  buyers purchase carbon credits directly from project developers  such as through an auction. These can then be traded in the secondary market. CIX  which is backed by Singapore’s stock exchange and Temasek  has sold 420 000 credits through various auctions since it started.AirCarbon  or ACX  which has transacted over 17 million carbon credits to date  aims to break even by 2025  McMahon said. Having raised more than $25 million from funders including Enterprise Singapore  Deutsche Boerse AG and Mubadala  it’s seeking another $50 million in a new round. ACX is targeting $33 million in revenue and 20 million credits transacted next year  McMahon said.New PlayersMore platforms are coming. Indonesia’s bourse is looking to develop its own carbon exchange  while India is putting together a blueprint for a voluntary carbon market. Larsen and McMahon have talked to dozens of companies and countries interested in having their own exchanges.“Everybody decided in 2021  from a commercial perspective  that this would be a great area to build ” Peter Zaman  a Singapore-based lawyer at HFW  said in an interview. “For the current size of the voluntary market  especially in the latest weak demand environment  there are probably a few platforms too many.”Experts meanwhile aren’t convinced the explosion of exchanges will have any meaningful impact on the climate.“These sorts of exchanges might attract financial organizations  speculators  but maybe not so much buyers who actually want to use credits for their climate strategies ” said Gilles Dufrasne  global carbon markets lead at nonprofit Carbon Market Watch. “I don’t think that has the highest benefit for the climate.”,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.21,0.1,0.69,True,English,"['new carbon exchanges', 'Asian bourses', 'billion-dollar race', 'Climate Impact X CEO Mikkel Larsen', 'additional compliance credit schemes', 'latest weak demand environment', 'DBS Group Holdings Ltd', 'nonprofit Carbon Market Watch', 'sovereign wealth funds', 'Standard Chartered Plc', 'Federico Di Credico', 'Asia-Pacific managing director', 'Deutsche Boerse AG', 'Bursa Malaysia Bhd.', 'two fledgling bourses', 'Mubadala Investment Co.', 'Temasek Holdings Pte', 'carbon dioxide emissions', 'global carbon markets', 'voluntary carbon market', '17 million carbon credits', 'new carbon exchanges', 'voluntary offsets market', 'meaningful impact', 'voluntary markets', 'new bourses', 'carbon projects', 'climate pledges', 'climate strategies', 'carbon trading', 'Trafigura Pte', 'global emissions', 'global head', 'new heights', 'new round', 'New Players', '20 million credits', 'Hong Kong', 'mad dashes', 'early days', 'slow start', 'powerful backers', 'Abu Dhabi', '5.2 billion tons', 'CO2 equivalent', '$600 billion market', 'fossil fuels', 'promissory note', 'European Union', 'mandatory programs', 'Hannah Hauman', 'national interest', 'capacity building', 'ACT Commodities', 'Elusive Profits', 'enough transactions', 'recessionary fears', 'standardized contracts', 'primary market', 'project developers', 'secondary market', 'various auctions', 'commercial perspective', 'great area', 'Peter Zaman', 'Singapore-based lawyer', 'current size', 'financial organizations', 'Gilles Dufrasne', 'highest benefit', 'fledgling exchanges', 'global trading', 'AirCarbon Pte', 'stock exchange', 'Thomas McMahon', 'More platforms', 'Enterprise Singapore', '420,000 credits', 'drive', 'fray', 'questions', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'decades', 'dozen', 'way', 'region', 'Thailand', 'Japan', 'September', 'founder', 'interview', 'blockchain', 'cryptocurrencies', 'next', 'prices', 'concerns', 'money', 'space', 'investors', 'flurry', 'countries', 'companies', 'growth', 'tens', 'millions', 'dollars', 'banks', 'BloombergNEF.', 'atmosphere', 'return', 'payment', 'California', 'polluters', 'mix', 'road', 'somebody', 'lot', 'liquidity', 'game', 'confusion', 'integrity', 'lack', 'clarity', 'Traders', 'analysts', 'year', 'buying', 'inflation', 'profitable', 'volumes', 'things', 'profitability', 'margins', 'buyers', 'CIX', 'ACX', 'date', 'funders', 'revenue', 'Indonesia', 'India', 'blueprint', 'HFW', 'Experts', 'explosion', 'sorts', 'speculators']",2022-12-20,2022-12-21,business-standard.com

McPhy – a long-time SOLIDWORKS customer – chose to move to a collaborative business platform deployed by the Visiativ team. This would deliver the collaborative design and product life cycle management capabilities to support its growth strategy as it scales up its business  in particular with the preparation for its new Gigafactory in France in 2024.“The Dassault Systèmes 3DEXPERIENCE platform deployed by Visiativ will help us structure our teams and our business. A unified architecture across all our sites (France  Italy and Germany) is a key step in McPhy's industrial scale-up  with the aim of optimizing collaborative processes across our European technology teams. We will also reduce our time-to-market in product development and project engineering for our clients  in particular by modelling the manufacturing process before our products are launched on the market "" said Benoît Barrière  Chief Technology Officer of McPhy.Reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 implies switching most of the world’s total energy consumption away from fossil fuels.

These are based on the physical phenomenon of quantum entanglement  which occurs when two elementary particles - two electrons (electrical particles) or two photons (light particles) - share identical parameters even though they are very far apart.This requires stringent conditions for their production environment  which must be ultra-pure  ultra-controlled and ultra-cold  with single-atom precision.The technologies available to deliver these performance levels include MBE  the material growth technique in which RIBER has built up industry-leading expertise  which is one of the best positioned. That is why RIBER is part of a joint quantum computers laboratory program to develop the technological components enabling them to be built.To produce electrons or photons  it is possible to use “quantum dots”  which are small volumes of ultra-pure and ultra-controlled semiconductor alloys developed and controlled using MBE. To transport them  superconductor metals can be used with ultra-precise dimensions (atomic scale)  within which the electrons flow undisrupted. The MBE technology is perfect for depositing these superconducting materials in an ultra-pure environment with atomic layer-controlled thickness.These quantum dots and superconductors need to be perfectly insulated from their environment  which is achieved by depositing dedicated oxide materials.The various stages for developing the quantum dots  superconductors and insulators require various deposition chambers which must have an ultra-high - or almost perfect - vacuum in order to avoid any contamination. Vacuum quality is part of the excellence provided by RIBER’s technology for these MBE machines.An MBE machine for quantum computers will therefore include several deposition chambers connected together by robots under ultra-high vacuum conditions. It may include three to five chambers linked by two or three robots under ultra-high vacuum conditions  controlled by highly sophisticated supervision software which manages the sample movements and material deposition process.With the complexity of this type of equipment due to the number of chambers and the ultra-purity  ultra-control and ultra-cold performance levels  this advanced technology has a market value of several million euros per machine.This is illustrated by the order announced on October 25 for several million euros of research equipment  including several chambers and equipment items  in order to provide a new European research laboratory with the flexibility and versatility of MBE to use materials representing future quantum computer components.Michel Picault  Chairman of RIBER’s Executive Board  concludes: “The quantum technology is very promising  but it still needs to overcome some significant development challenges to build specific chips. RIBER’s MBE technology will make it possible to accelerate progress towards manufacturing quantum chips on a larger scale. Our Joint Laboratory with LAAS-CNRS will help us reach this higher level of technological maturity more quickly”.About RIBERRIBER is the global market leader for MBE - molecular beam epitaxy - equipment. It designs and produces MBE systems and evaporators for the semiconductor industry. It also provides technical and scientific support for its clients  maintaining their equipment and optimizing their performance and output levels.

This requires stringent conditions for their production environment  which must be ultra-pure  ultra-controlled and ultra-cold  with single-atom precision.The technologies av…,PRESS RELEASERIBER deploys MBE technology to support quantum computing materialsBezons  December 20  2022 – 8am – RIBER  a global market leader for semiconductor industry equipment  has further strengthened its development on the quantum processor materials market in 2022.Through EPICENTRE  a Joint Laboratory with LAAS-CNRS in Toulouse  set up in June 2021  RIBER has started to deploy the technologies making it possible to build the core components of future-generation quantum computers. These are based on the physical phenomenon of quantum entanglement  which occurs when two elementary particles - two electrons (electrical particles) or two photons (light particles) - share identical parameters even though they are very far apart.This requires stringent conditions for their production environment  which must be ultra-pure  ultra-controlled and ultra-cold  with single-atom precision.The technologies available to deliver these performance levels include MBE  the material growth technique in which RIBER has built up industry-leading expertise  which is one of the best positioned. That is why RIBER is part of a joint quantum computers laboratory program to develop the technological components enabling them to be built.To produce electrons or photons  it is possible to use “quantum dots”  which are small volumes of ultra-pure and ultra-controlled semiconductor alloys developed and controlled using MBE. To transport them  superconductor metals can be used with ultra-precise dimensions (atomic scale)  within which the electrons flow undisrupted. The MBE technology is perfect for depositing these superconducting materials in an ultra-pure environment with atomic layer-controlled thickness.These quantum dots and superconductors need to be perfectly insulated from their environment  which is achieved by depositing dedicated oxide materials.The various stages for developing the quantum dots  superconductors and insulators require various deposition chambers which must have an ultra-high - or almost perfect - vacuum in order to avoid any contamination. Vacuum quality is part of the excellence provided by RIBER’s technology for these MBE machines.An MBE machine for quantum computers will therefore include several deposition chambers connected together by robots under ultra-high vacuum conditions. It may include three to five chambers linked by two or three robots under ultra-high vacuum conditions  controlled by highly sophisticated supervision software which manages the sample movements and material deposition process.With the complexity of this type of equipment due to the number of chambers and the ultra-purity  ultra-control and ultra-cold performance levels  this advanced technology has a market value of several million euros per machine.This is illustrated by the order announced on October 25 for several million euros of research equipment  including several chambers and equipment items  in order to provide a new European research laboratory with the flexibility and versatility of MBE to use materials representing future quantum computer components.Michel Picault  Chairman of RIBER’s Executive Board  concludes: “The quantum technology is very promising  but it still needs to overcome some significant development challenges to build specific chips. RIBER’s MBE technology will make it possible to accelerate progress towards manufacturing quantum chips on a larger scale. Our Joint Laboratory with LAAS-CNRS will help us reach this higher level of technological maturity more quickly”.About RIBERRIBER is the global market leader for MBE - molecular beam epitaxy - equipment.

It is a requirement of Russian law that securities listed on MOEX be held in custody by depositaries via the NSD.Euroclear suspended interactions with the NSD following the EU's asset freeze designation of the NSD on June 3  2022 under the Council Regulation (EU) No 269/2014 of March 17  2014 concerning restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity  sovereignty and independence of Ukraine  as amended (the ""EU Regulation""). Consequently  the NSD has been prevented from making settlements for  and distribution of dividends to  the MOEX ADS Holders. In addition  the MOEX ADS Holders were not able to execute their voting rights and convert their ADSs into a Class B Ordinary Shares of QIWI PLC.Obtaining a MEK LicenseThe eighth round of EU sanctions introduced into the EU Regulation a new NSD-specific licensing ground for competent authorities to base their licenses on when applied for by an institution or entity.On November 30  2022  QIWI applied to the sanction authority established by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Cyprus (""MEK"") for an approval (the ""License"") based on Article 6b(5) of the EU Regulation  to authorize a derogation in respect of the NSD  for the termination by January 7  2023 of operations  contracts or other agreements concluded with it  or otherwise involving it  before June 3  2022.On December 20  2022  the authorities granted QIWI the License  which authorizes:(a) application by holders of the ADSs for the cancellation of the ADSs of the MOEX ADS Holders which are custodied with the NSD  and(b) the transfer out of the NSD of the ADSs  subject to the following conditions:(i) the relevant contracts were entered into prior to June 3  2022;(ii) the ADSs will not be transferred to another entity or central securities depository which is subject to sanctions; and(iii) any actions for the release of the ADSs shall be completed before January 7  2023.Consequences for the MOEX ADS HoldersQIWI will engage in communications with Euroclear in order to allow qualifying MOEX ADS Holders to benefit from the authorization envisaged by the License  provided that Euroclear will comply with terms of the License.It is QIWI's understanding that Euroclear may choose to take a different approach and may not process the relevant instructions for cancellation of the ADSs submitted by the MOEX ADS Holders. The Company highlights to MOEX ADS Holders that conversion of their ADSs allows to eliminate sanctioned parties from the depositary chain  but the underlaying Class B ordinary shares are not traded on any stock exchange and thus considered to be illiquid shares.The MOEX ADSs holders  who are willing to cancel their ADSs in order to withdraw the underlying Class B Ordinary shares of QIWI PLC are instructed to take the following steps:· to review the relevant provisions described in Section 2.05 of the Deposit Agreement  a copy of which is available for no charge at https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1201935/000101915513000182/qiwidepnrec.htm   and· to approach their broker or depositary for further assistance to surrender their ADSs as soon as possible given the existing time constraints for the License (January 7th 2023).This statement does not constitute individual investment  financial or legal advice. This statement is for information purposes only and QIWI PLC shall not be liable if the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations by the relevant state authorities differs from the interpretation given in this statement. The MOEX ADSs holders should make an independent decision on how to act in connection with the published statement and  if necessary  contact their investment  legal and other advisors.No impact for ADSs trading on NasdaqThe effect of the License shall not impact the rights of shareholders of ADSs traded on Nasdaq and held in custody by depositaries outside of the NSD.About QIWI plc.QIWI is a leading provider of cutting-edge payment and financial services in Russia and the CIS.

15231,Clearstream,Bing API,https://www.thetradenews.com/the-trade-predictions-series-2023-post-trade/,The TRADE predictions series 2023: Post-trade,Participants across Cboe Clear Europe  LCH  Eurex and Clearstream Banking S.A explore the post-trade trends of 2023.,Tim Beckwith  head of commercial development  Cboe Clear Europe: While Europe’s post-trade landscape will continue to develop in 2023  there is a risk that the significant progress made to expand access to competitive clearing in cash equities begins to unravel. The strongest indication of this is the decision of some national exchanges to revert to a reliance on their own clearing provider  but regulatory factors are also at play in the re-emergence of verticalised cash equities market infrastructures.A competitive clearing environment should be viewed as a key element of the EU’s efforts to revitalise its capital markets  helping to attract investors and reduce the costs of investing. Cboe Clear Europe  as a long-time proponent of open access  has witnessed first-hand the benefits this market structure brings to market participants. We have seen an increasing uptake for our preferred clearing service this year – which is used when both sides of a trade wish to use alternative CCPs  rather than the primary CCP – and will continue to push for this trend to become mainstream in 2023. Also on the agenda will be the impact of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) on settlement performance. With European policymakers working on a reform of the regulation – including a clarification of buy-in rules – we can expect the industry to pay close attention to this matter in 2023.Philip Brown  CEO  Clearstream Banking S.A.: In 2023  I predict three main notable trends; firstly  digital securities will start to become mainstream  will be better understood  and will start to deliver some of the digitisation benefits we have all anticipated for so long. Secondly  securities collateral management will come back with a vengeance as the changes wrought by the end of the era of low interest rates start to have effect. Thirdly  the more advanced players in the post-trade industry will start to develop really usable ESG solutions to the market  led by Europe and European issuers. After the scares around crypto and tying all these together  investors will wish to see all of this delivered by trusted  financially sound intermediaries who put the safety of their clients’ assets first.Susi de Verdelon  head of SwapClear and listed rates  LCH: Next year will see another big step forward in the global transition programme from existing benchmarks to risk-free rates with the cessation of US Dollar Libor in June and the comprehensive adoption of SOFR in its place. An extensive amount of coordination has been central to the implementation of changes that will ultimately see the adoption of rates that are truly representative of their underlying market. As one example of the fruits of this concerted industry effort  swap liquidity has grown considerably in the last 18 months – approximately 90% of USD swap risk cleared into SwapClear is now SOFR-based versus only 10% in January 2021. The USD Libor conversion will be a significant multilateral event – over 600 000 trades at SwapClear alone – which is much larger than previous conversions. With this in mind  as we approach the Q2 2023 conversion dates  it is important that market participants continue to collaborate to create conditions that accommodate the Libor cessation process and that firms have put final preparations in place to ensure a smooth and orderly transition to SOFR.Phil Simons  global head of FIC Derivatives and repo sales at Eurex: In 2022  we have seen double-digit percentage growth in European repo volumes  both in GC Pooling and the repo market. This trend will clearly continue in 2023. With rising inflation  a changing rates environment and increased volatility  initial margins have gone up considerably. With all that  efficient funding and subsequently financing collateral management will be key for the upcoming year. In addition  the temporary central clearing exemption granted to pension funds by the European Commission is going to expire in June 2023. All these factors mean that the number one priority for 2023 is going to be that the buy-side will be looking for cleared repo and linking that with their derivatives contracts. Repo plays an integral role in the financial markets providing a key source of funding and a substitute for unsecured deposits. The special and general collateral segments enhance the utility of the repo market by providing a means of financing securities portfolios and a mechanism for sourcing valuable collateral  which is of critical importance given the scarcity of high-quality assets.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.26,0.15,0.59,True,English,"['The TRADE predictions series', 'Post-trade', 'verticalised cash equities market infrastructures', 'Clearstream Banking S.A.', 'three main notable trends', 'trusted, financially sound intermediaries', 'temporary central clearing exemption', 'The USD Libor conversion', 'Central Securities Depositories Regulation', 'Q2 2023 conversion dates', 'US Dollar Libor', 'usable ESG solutions', 'Susi de Verdelon', 'double-digit percentage growth', 'preferred clearing service', 'significant multilateral event', 'number one priority', 'general collateral segments', 'Libor cessation process', 'competitive clearing environment', 'low interest rates', 'changing rates environment', 'global transition programme', 'concerted industry effort', 'USD swap risk', 'securities collateral management', 'European repo volumes', 'Cboe Clear Europe', 'clearing provider', 'digital securities', 'securities portfolios', 'significant progress', 'one example', 'swap liquidity', 'orderly transition', 'valuable collateral', 'market structure', 'market participants', 'European policymakers', 'European issuers', 'underlying market', 'European Commission', 'listed rates', 'risk-free rates', 'repo market', 'Tim Beckwith', 'commercial development', 'post-trade landscape', 'strongest indication', 'national exchanges', 'key element', 'capital markets', 'time proponent', 'increasing uptake', 'alternative CCPs', 'primary CCP', 'settlement performance', 'close attention', 'Philip Brown', 'advanced players', 'post-trade industry', 'clients’ assets', 'big step', 'existing benchmarks', 'extensive amount', 'last 18 months', 'previous conversions', 'final preparations', 'Phil Simons', 'FIC Derivatives', 'GC Pooling', 'rising inflation', 'initial margins', 'upcoming year', 'pension funds', 'derivatives contracts', 'integral role', 'financial markets', 'key source', 'unsecured deposits', 'critical importance', 'high-quality assets', 'global head', 'repo sales', 'regulatory factors', 'open access', 'digitisation benefits', 'comprehensive adoption', 'efficient funding', 'decision', 'reliance', 'emergence', 'efforts', 'investors', 'costs', 'investing', 'long', 'sides', 'agenda', 'impact', 'CSDR', 'reform', 'clarification', 'buy', 'rules', 'matter', 'CEO', 'vengeance', 'effect', 'scares', 'crypto', 'safety', 'SwapClear', 'LCH', 'June', 'SOFR', 'place', 'coordination', 'implementation', 'fruits', 'January', '600,000 trades', 'mind', 'conditions', 'firms', 'smooth', 'Eurex', 'volatility', 'addition', 'substitute', 'special', 'utility', 'means', 'mechanism', 'scarcity']",2022-12-21,2022-12-21,thetradenews.com

15242,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/celyad-oncology-provides-strategic-business-060000512.html,Celyad Oncology provides an update on its strategic business model  continuing to focus on opportunities to fully harness the true potential of its proprietary technology platforms and intellectual property,MONT-SAINT-GUIBERT  Belgium  Dec. 21  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Celyad Oncology (Euronext & Nasdaq: CYAD) (the “Company”)  a biotechnology company focused on ...,Celyad Oncology SAMONT-SAINT-GUIBERT  Belgium  Dec. 21  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Celyad Oncology (Euronext & Nasdaq: CYAD) (the “Company”)  a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of innovative technologies for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies  today provides an update on its Celyad 2.0 business strategy which has been adopted and implemented over the last few months.In keeping with this strategy  the Company intends to focus on maximizing its valuable intellectual property (IP) estate  and strengthening its research focus.The Company has compiled a foundational and broad IP estate that controls key aspects of developing therapies in the allogeneic cell therapy space. The patents around allogeneic CAR T-cell therapies and NKG2D-based therapies provide an avenue to develop intellectual property programs and to partner with outside parties around the licensing of these patents.In addition to IP partnering transactions  Celyad 2.0 will prioritize discovery research in areas of expertise where it can leverage the differentiated nature of its platforms. The Company is implementing a differentiated and innovative strategy  tackling the major current limitations of CAR T-cell therapies. This strategy includes: Multiplexing approach of the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) platform  allowing multiple genes  including essential and functional genes  to be modulated simultaneously; Dual CAR development of a next-generation NKG2D-based CAR which may help to overcome resistance and immune escape often observed with traditional single targeting approaches; and Development of B7-H6-targeting immunotherapies as the Company believes that B7-H6 is an underappreciated target that could change the paradigm of cell therapy due to its broad expression in a large variety of cancers.Celyad Oncology is of the opinion that it will potentially create more shareholder value by licensing its patent estate and further strengthening its research efforts to improve the differentiated nature of its platforms.Story continuesBased on a strategic and financial review  the Company has decided to discontinue the development of its remaining clinical program CYAD-211 (the allogeneic shRNA-based  anti-BCMA CAR T candidate for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM)). There were no safety concerns leading to this decision and all patients previously treated with CYAD-211 will continue to receive their protocol-defined follow-up.The key data points of the program are as follows:19 r/r MM patients have been treated with CYAD-211 in the IMMUNICY-1 trial which was developed to validate shRNA technology in the clinic;The observed safety profile  including the lack of observed Graft-versus-Host disease  provides proof-of-concept for the use of shRNA technology for allogeneic CAR Ts;Out of 17 evaluable patients  a partial response was achieved in five patients. One patient was recently re-treated with a second dose of CYAD-211 after having reached stable disease post first infusion; andEnhanced lymphodepletion did not seem to improve clinical activity nor persistence of the cells post-infusion.Anticipated milestones for 2023The Company will take part in several conferences including The World Oncology Cell Therapy Congress in April and the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) 38 th Annual Meeting in November; andThe Company will provide updates on the potential proof-of-concept of the dual CAR and multiplexing research programs and on business development in the second quarter of 2023.About Celyad OncologyCelyad Oncology is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of innovative technologies chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies. The Company is focusing on opportunities to fully harness the true potential of its proprietary technology platforms and intellectual property and support the development of next-generation CAR T candidates in solid tumors and hematological malignancies.

Subject to obtaining MHRA approval on the CTA  BenevolentAI plans to initiate a Phase I clinical trial of BEN-8744  anticipated to commence in the first half of 2023.Anne Phelan  Chief Scientific Officer at BenevolentAI  commented: “We are pleased to submit a CTA for BEN-8744 in line with our development timeline as we continue to progress this exciting investigational drug towards the clinic. We believe BEN-8744 has the potential to be a novel treatment for UC: a complex multifactorial disease that remains underserved by current standard-of-care therapies. BEN-8744 demonstrates BenevolentAI's unique ability to use vast quantities of multimodal data to uncover novel targets not previously linked to a given disease and increase confidence in the early phases of drug discovery. After rapidly delivering this drug candidate within just two years of target validation  we look forward to commencing first-in-human studies next year.”About BEN-8744BEN-8744 is an orally administered  peripherally restricted small molecule PDE10 inhibitor under development as a first-in-class treatment for ulcerative colitis and with the potential for other indications within inflammatory bowel disease. BEN-8744 is differentiated by its novel mechanism of action; there is an opportunity to further differentiate BEN-8744 based on safety and efficacy.PDE10 reduces intracellular levels of the signalling molecule cGMP. Restoration of cGMP levels by PDE10 inhibition is anticipated to have a direct anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying benefit.BenevolentAI will look to demonstrate that BEN-8744 is effective in treating moderate-to-severe cases of UC and with fewer side effects than the anti-TNF and JAK inhibitors that are currently the dominant form of treatment for this disease.BenevolentAI has filed for second medical use and composition of matter patents in respect of BEN-8744. BEN-8744 is a wholly owned asset in the BenevolentAI drug programme pipeline.About Ulcerative ColitisUC is a chronic disease that causes inflammation and ulceration of the inner lining of the colon and rectum. UC affects 0.4% of the US population  and 31% of patients have moderate-to-severe disease. 20-40% of those patients with moderate-to-severe UC do not respond to anti-TNF  the main treatment approach  and currently available treatments can have severe side effects.About BenevolentAIBenevolentAI (AMS: BAI) is a leading  clinical-stage AI-enabled drug discovery and development company listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. Through the combined capabilities of its AI platform  scientific expertise  and wet-lab facilities  BenevolentAI is well-positioned to deliver novel drug candidates with a higher probability of clinical success than those developed using traditional methods. The Benevolent Platform™ powers a growing in-house pipeline of 13 named drug programmes and over 10 exploratory programmes  and it maintains successful collaborations with AstraZeneca  as well as leading research and charitable institutions.

This would see less choice for smaller chicken farmers and processors  who might rely on ForFarmers and Boparan for their chicken feed.ForFarmers UK is a subsidiary of Dutch-based ForFarmers NV  which was founded as a farmer co-operative in 1896 and is now listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange.Boparan’s 2Agriculture is one of the UK’s largest poultry feed suppliers and uses its production to supply Hook 2 Sisters  which is linked to Boparan.Boparan also owns 2 Sisters Food Group  which supplies about a third of the chicken on UK supermarket shelves.,neutral,0.01,0.82,0.17,mixed,0.14,0.14,0.72,True,English,"['Poultry feed deal', 'depth probe', 'competition concerns', 'free real time breaking news alerts', 'free breaking news emails', 'Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange', 'animal feed milling operations', 'largest poultry feed suppliers', 'two poultry feed giants', 'valid email address', 'Sorcha O’Carroll', 'five working days', 'lower quality feed', 'Phase Two investigation', 'meat poultry feed', '2 Sisters Food Group', 'Dutch-based ForFarmers NV', 'UK supermarket shelves', 'four local areas', 'smaller chicken farmers', 'two businesses', 'four areas', 'Hook 2 Sisters', 'initial investigation', 'favourite meat', 'chicken feed', 'feed mills', 'food prices', 'The Independent', 'privacy notice', 'price hikes', 'East Anglia', 'north-western England', 'North Wales', 'Markets Authority', 'biggest expense', 'senior director', 'wider cost', 'living crisis', 'other types', 'next steps', 'combined businesses', 'joint venture', 'processing businesses', 'less choice', 'farmer co', 'depth investigation', 'higher prices', 'chicken farming', 'The CMA', 'third parties', 'competition watchdog', 'ForFarmers UK', '19 mills', 'inbox', 'offers', 'events', 'updates', 'verifyErrors', 'Something', 'tie-up', 'deal', 'costs', 'shoppers', 'merger', 'Boparan', '2 Agriculture', 'concerns', 'impact', 'service', 'consumers', 'reduction', 'situation', 'checkout', '2Agriculture', 'plans', 'July', 'companies', 'Burston', 'Bury', 'Llay', 'Preston', 'supply', 'processors', 'subsidiary', 'operative', 'production']",2022-12-21,2022-12-21,independent.co.uk

The patents around allogeneic CAR T-cell therapies and NKG2D-based therapies provide an avenue to develop intellectual property programs and to partner with outside parties around the licensing of these patents.In addition to IP partnering transactions  Celyad 2.0 will prioritize discovery research in areas of expertise where it can leverage the differentiated nature of its platforms. The Company is implementing a differentiated and innovative strategy  tackling the major current limitations of CAR T-cell therapies. This strategy includes:- Multiplexing approach of the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) platform  allowing multiple genes  including essential and functional genes  to be modulated simultaneously;- Dual CAR development of a next-generation NKG2D-based CAR which may help to overcome resistance and immune escape often observed with traditional single targeting approaches; and- Development of B7-H6-targeting immunotherapies as the Company believes that B7-H6 is an underappreciated target that could change the paradigm of cell therapy due to its broad expression in a large variety of cancers.Celyad Oncology is of the opinion that it will potentially create more shareholder value by licensing its patent estate and further strengthening its research efforts to improve the differentiated nature of its platforms.Story continuesBased on a strategic and financial review  the Company has decided to discontinue the development of its remaining clinical program CYAD-211 (the allogeneic shRNA-based  anti-BCMA CAR T candidate for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM)). There were no safety concerns leading to this decision and all patients previously treated with CYAD-211 will continue to receive their protocol-defined follow-up.The key data points of the program are as follows:19 r/r MM patients have been treated with CYAD-211 in the IMMUNICY-1 trial which was developed to validate shRNA technology in the clinic;The observed safety profile  including the lack of observed Graft-versus-Host disease  provides proof-of-concept for the use of shRNA technology for allogeneic CAR Ts;Out of 17 evaluable patients  a partial response was achieved in five patients. One patient was recently re-treated with a second dose of CYAD-211 after having reached stable disease post first infusion; andEnhanced lymphodepletion did not seem to improve clinical activity nor persistence of the cells post-infusion.Anticipated milestones for 2023The Company will take part in several conferences including The World Oncology Cell Therapy Congress in April and the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) 38 th Annual Meeting in November; andThe Company will provide updates on the potential proof-of-concept of the dual CAR and multiplexing research programs and on business development in the second quarter of 2023.About Celyad OncologyCelyad Oncology is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of innovative technologies chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies.

NOT FOR RELEASE  PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  IN OR INTO THE UNITED STATES  AUSTRALIA  CANADA  JAPAN  SOUTH AFRICA OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OR REGULATIONS OF SUCH JURISDICTION. ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE RESTRICTIONS MAY CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWSThe Board of Disruptive Capital Acquisition Company Limited announces the release of a circular to the Company’s Shareholders and holders of DCAC Warrants (the “Circular”) relating to the proposed amendment of the articles of incorporation of DCAC (the “Articles”) and to the proposed amendment of the Warrant Terms and Conditions (the “Warrant T&Cs”) including:(i) Notice of an Extraordinary General meeting of the DCAC Shareholders(ii) Notice of a class meeting of the DCAC Sponsor Shareholders(iii) Notice of an Ordinary Class meeting(iv) Notice of a meeting of the holders of the DCAC Warrants(together “the Meetings”)Notices of the Meetings to be held on 11 January 2023 are included in the Circular.In view of its upcoming business combination deadline  DCAC has been contemplating its options for the future. Rather than wind up DCAC  DCAC now proposes to preserve optionality for all shareholders and warrant holders  which would otherwise be lost.However  DCAC recognises that a return of cash would be welcomed by its shareholders. Therefore  if shareholders agree  DCAC is proposing to return up to an amount equal to £10.25 per DCAC Ordinary Share (being a maximum of £128 125 000) in cash to DCAC Ordinary Shareholders by way of a share buyback.Story continuesTo effectuate this  the Circular includes the following key proposals (among others):(1) Proposal to return capital to the shareholders  by offering to acquire from each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder up to 95% of the DCAC Ordinary Shares held by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder (the “Repurchase Offer”). If a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder accepts the offer in respect of all its DCAC Ordinary Shares  then the purchase price payable to that DCAC Ordinary Shareholder shall be an aggregate amount equal to £10.25 multiplied by the total number of DCAC Ordinary Shares held by the relevant DCAC Ordinary Shareholder.This would give an effective repurchase price of £10.789 per repurchased DCAC Ordinary Share  on the basis of a repurchase of 95% of the shareholder’s DCAC Ordinary Shares.(2) Proposal to amend the escrow waterfall  whereby the escrow account will be applied in the following order of priority:(a) first  to settle the cash due pursuant to the Repurchase Offer  up to £128 125 000 in total;(b) second  to release the surplus in the escrow account to the Company  which shall be used in first priority to settle outstanding costs and expenses of the Company up to £1 million; and thereafter for the general corporate purposes of the Company  with which to manage the business as it negotiates on the next target(s).(3) Proposal to extend termination provisions by removing the current termination provisions from the Articles and the Warrant T&Cs and replacing them by putting a continuation vote to shareholders to extend the life of the Company at a general meeting to be held no later than 11 April 2024.Subject to the proposals included in the Circular being adopted:(i) The Ordinary Shares and Warrants will continue to be listed on Euronext Amsterdam; and(ii) DCAC will continue to work to find a business combination within the next 15 months  with several interesting targets in preliminary consideration.(iii) Were the potential business combination to progress to the point of agreement  then DCAC will give shareholders:the right to vote on any new business combination; andpre-emption rights to subscribe for new shares in the Company to provide any funding requirement  before DCAC goes out to the wider market.and warrant holders:the right to opt for cashless conversion of their warrants into shares.A copy of the Circular is available on the Company’s website: www.disruptivecapitalac.comThe Board of DCAC also report that Dimitri Goulandris will be resigning from the Board of the Company with effect from 23 December 2022. The Board would like to express their thanks to Dimitri for all his endeavours in relation to the Company and are grateful that he will remain a supportive founder shareholder.Edmund Truell  CEO of DCAC  said “Whilst not the planned result  in the light of the disappointing news on the potential Saxo deal we commend these proposals to our shareholders  to preserve worthwhile optionality in DCAC shares and warrants; and at the same time delivering on the promise to return 102.50% of their investment in cash.”Enquiries to:disruptive@admina.ggRegistered office First Floor10 Lefebvre StreetSt Peter PortGuernseyGY1 2PEMedia inquiries:DCAC:James CulverhouseEQJames.culverhouse@eqcorp.co+44 (0)20 7223 1100/+44(0)7912 508 322,neutral,0.04,0.95,0.01,mixed,0.31,0.06,0.63,True,English,"['Extraordinary General Meeting', 'Warrant Holder Meeting', 'Class Meeting', 'Release', 'Circular', 'Notice', 'DISRUPTIVE CAPITAL ACQUISITION COMPANY LIMITED', 'EU MARKET ABUSE REGULATION', 'upcoming business combination deadline', 'relevant DCAC Ordinary Shareholder', 'several interesting targets', 'potential Saxo deal', 'supportive founder shareholder', 'general corporate purposes', 'potential business combination', 'APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS', 'Warrant T&Cs', 'next target(s', 'Extraordinary General Meeting', 'new business combination', 'Warrant Holder Meeting', 'Ordinary Class meeting', 'DCAC Ordinary Shares', 'current termination provisions', 'effective repurchase price', 'The Ordinary Shares', 'following key proposals', 'DCAC Ordinary Shareholders', 'DCAC Sponsor Shareholders', 'RELEVANT LAWS', 'new shares', 'wider market', 'share buyback', 'Warrant Terms', 'following order', 'next 15 months', 'DCAC sha', 'escrow waterfall', 'UNITED STATES', 'SOUTH AFRICA', 'warrant holders', 'escrow account', 'outstanding costs', 'continuation vote', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'preliminary consideration', 'pre-emption rights', 'funding requirement', 'cashless conversion', 'Edmund Truell', 'disappointing news', 'repurchase offer', 'DCAC Warrants', 'INSIDE INFORMATION', 'OTHER JURISDICTION', 'aggregate amount', 'total number', 'first priority', 'Dimitri Goulandris', 'worthwhile optionality', 'The Board', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'Circular', 'Notice', 'QUALIFIES', 'MEANING', 'DISTRIBUTION', 'AUSTRALIA', 'CANADA', 'JAPAN', 'VIOLATION', 'REGULATIONS', 'FAILURE', 'RESTRICTIONS', 'amendment', 'articles', 'Conditions', 'Meetings', '11 January', 'view', 'options', 'future', 'return', 'maximum', 'way', 'Story', 'others', 'respect', 'basis', 'surplus', 'expenses', 'life', '11 April', 'agreement', 'copy', 'website', '23 December', 'thanks', 'endeavours', 'relation', 'CEO', 'result', 'light']",2022-12-20,2022-12-21,finance.yahoo.com

The patents around allogeneic CAR T-cell therapies and NKG2D-based therapies provide an avenue to develop intellectual property programs and to partner with outside parties around the licensing of these patents.In addition to IP partnering transactions  Celyad 2.0 will prioritize discovery research in areas of expertise where it can leverage the differentiated nature of its platforms. The Company is implementing a differentiated and innovative strategy  tackling the major current limitations of CAR T-cell therapies. This strategy includes: Multiplexing approach of the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) platform  allowing multiple genes  including essential and functional genes  to be modulated simultaneously; Dual CAR development of a next-generation NKG2D-based CAR which may help to overcome resistance and immune escape often observed with traditional single targeting approaches; and Development of B7-H6-targeting immunotherapies as the Company believes that B7-H6 is an underappreciated target that could change the paradigm of cell therapy due to its broad expression in a large variety of cancers.Celyad Oncology is of the opinion that it will potentially create more shareholder value by licensing its patent estate and further strengthening its research efforts to improve the differentiated nature of its platforms.Based on a strategic and financial review  the Company has decided to discontinue the development of its remaining clinical program CYAD-211 (the allogeneic shRNA-based  anti-BCMA CAR T candidate for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM)). There were no safety concerns leading to this decision and all patients previously treated with CYAD-211 will continue to receive their protocol-defined follow-up.The key data points of the program are as follows:19 r/r MM patients have been treated with CYAD-211 in the IMMUNICY-1 trial which was developed to validate shRNA technology in the clinic;The observed safety profile  including the lack of observed Graft-versus-Host disease  provides proof-of-concept for the use of shRNA technology for allogeneic CAR Ts;Out of 17 evaluable patients  a partial response was achieved in five patients. One patient was recently re-treated with a second dose of CYAD-211 after having reached stable disease post first infusion; andEnhanced lymphodepletion did not seem to improve clinical activity nor persistence of the cells post-infusion.Anticipated milestones for 2023The Company will take part in several conferences including The World Oncology Cell Therapy Congress in April and the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) 38 th Annual Meeting in November; andAnnual Meeting in November; and The Company will provide updates on the potential proof-of-concept of the dual CAR and multiplexing research programs and on business development in the second quarter of 2023.About Celyad OncologyCelyad Oncology is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of innovative technologies chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies. The Company is focusing on opportunities to fully harness the true potential of its proprietary technology platforms and intellectual property and support the development of next-generation CAR T candidates in solid tumors and hematological malignancies.

This would see less choice for smaller chicken farmers and processors  who might rely on ForFarmers and Boparan for their chicken feed.ForFarmers UK is a subsidiary of Dutch-based ForFarmers NV  which was founded as a farmer co-operative in 1896 and is now listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange.Boparan’s 2Agriculture is one of the UK’s largest poultry feed suppliers and uses its production to supply Hook 2 Sisters  which is linked to Boparan.Boparan also owns 2 Sisters Food Group  which supplies about a third of the chicken on UK supermarket shelves.,neutral,0.01,0.82,0.17,mixed,0.1,0.2,0.7,True,English,"['Poultry feed deal', 'depth probe', 'competition concerns', 'Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange', 'animal feed milling operations', 'largest poultry feed suppliers', 'two poultry feed giants', 'Sorcha O’Carroll', 'five working days', 'lower quality feed', 'Phase Two investigation', 'meat poultry feed', '2 Sisters Food Group', 'Dutch-based ForFarmers NV', 'UK supermarket shelves', 'four local areas', 'smaller chicken farmers', 'two businesses', 'four areas', 'Hook 2 Sisters', 'chicken feed', 'initial investigation', 'favourite meat', 'feed mills', 'food prices', 'price hikes', 'East Anglia', 'north-western England', 'North Wales', 'Markets Authority', 'biggest expense', 'senior director', 'wider cost', 'living crisis', 'other types', 'next steps', 'combined businesses', 'joint venture', 'processing businesses', 'less choice', 'farmer co', 'depth investigation', 'higher prices', 'chicken farming', 'The CMA', 'third parties', 'competition watchdog', 'ForFarmers UK', '19 mills', 'tie-up', 'deal', 'costs', 'shoppers', 'merger', 'Boparan', '2 Agriculture', 'concerns', 'impact', 'service', 'consumers', 'reduction', 'situation', 'checkout', '2Agriculture', 'brood', 'hens', 'Facebook', 'Twitter', 'Email', 'Whatsapp', 'plans', 'July', 'companies', 'Burston', 'Bury', 'Llay', 'Preston', 'supply', 'processors', 'subsidiary', 'operative', 'production']",2022-12-21,2022-12-21,independent.ie

It also announced a tender offer to provide a liquidity opportunity for those shareholders who did not wish to participate in the Relaunch (the “Tender Offer”).In August 2022  the Tender Offer closed with ~47% of Ordinary Shares in issue as at 4 August 2022 tendered  resulting in Eurocastle accepting 864 980 shares in exchange for €10.26 per share  or €8.9 million in total. During the third quarter  the Company received €1.6 million  or over 50% of its Q2’22 NAV relating to its investments  comprising (i) a €1.3 million distribution from Real Estate Fund Investment V (~90% of its Q2’22 NAV)  and (ii) €0.3 million from the sale of one of the two remaining NPL pools.SUBSEQUENT EVENTS TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2022On 6 December 2022  the Company completed the sale of its second and last remaining NPL pool resulting in €1.0 million of proceeds  in line with its Q3 2022 NAV.Following this realisation  the Company’s assets mainly comprise:Two Real Estate Fund investments with a Q3 NAV of €0.8 million  or €0.76 per share  where all underlying apartments are now sold or currently under contract to be sold.€17.2 million of net corporate cash6RELAUNCH UPDATEEurocastle will commence its new investment strategy by initially focusing on opportunistic real estate in Greece with a plan to expand across Southern Europe  where the Manager has an extensive footprint and a long-term track record investing in this asset class. The Company will invest primarily in real estate auctions leveraging the Manager’s deep knowledge of the sector  which offers significant investment opportunities in the current market cycle. The Board believes that this strategy will allow Eurocastle to deploy available cash in order to establish a platform and create a meaningful track record  while generating attractive risk adjusted returns in the short term.At the same time  the Board will continue to monitor the market environment for raising new capital in order to assess pursuing all elements of its new investment strategy  which would require additional capital to achieve meaningful scale.The Board considers that any potential additional costs resulting from this phased approach are adequately covered by the Company’s existing Additional Reserves. The Board will continue to evaluate these reserves and the Company’s available capital  taking into account investment opportunities and the performance of the new strategy.Shareholders should however be aware that the implementation and performance of the Company’s new investment strategy is subject to risks  uncertainty  and assumptions. The Manager is currently in the early stages of pursuing a new investment strategy and there can be no certainty that it will have success in doing so. There is likewise no certainty that it will be able to attain sufficient scale to achieve the desired returns. In addition  changes in economic conditions generally and the real estate market specifically  the availability of appropriate investment opportunities and the ability to raise financing on suitable terms may also affect the success of the Relaunch. Accordingly  there is no guarantee that the Company’s new investment strategy will be effectively implemented nor will there necessarily be a future opportunity for shareholders to achieve an exit from their investment in the Company at a price equal to or higher than the current share price.For further details of the Relaunch  the Company’s new investment strategy and the Additional Reserves  please refer to the Circular published in July 2022 and available on the Company’s website under the Periodic Reports and Shareholder Communications section.NOTICE: This announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014.ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONFor investment portfolio information  please refer to the Company’s most recent Financial Report  which is available on the Company’s website (www.eurocastleinv.com).Terms not otherwise defined in this announcement shall have the meaning given to them in the Circular.ABOUT EUROCASTLEEurocastle Investment Limited (“Eurocastle” or the “Company”) is a publicly traded closed-ended investment company.

Subject to obtaining MHRA approval on the CTA  BenevolentAI plans to initiate a Phase I clinical trial of BEN-8744  anticipated to commence in the first half of 2023.Anne Phelan  Chief Scientific Officer at BenevolentAI  commented: “We are pleased to submit a CTA for BEN-8744 in line with our development timeline as we continue to progress this exciting investigational drug towards the clinic. We believe BEN-8744 has the potential to be a novel treatment for UC: a complex multifactorial disease that remains underserved by current standard-of-care therapies. BEN-8744 demonstrates BenevolentAI's unique ability to use vast quantities of multimodal data to uncover novel targets not previously linked to a given disease and increase confidence in the early phases of drug discovery. After rapidly delivering this drug candidate within just two years of target validation  we look forward to commencing first-in-human studies next year.”About BEN-8744BEN-8744 is an orally administered  peripherally restricted small molecule PDE10 inhibitor under development as a first-in-class treatment for ulcerative colitis and with the potential for other indications within inflammatory bowel disease. BEN-8744 is differentiated by its novel mechanism of action; there is an opportunity to further differentiate BEN-8744 based on safety and efficacy.PDE10 reduces intracellular levels of the signalling molecule cGMP. Restoration of cGMP levels by PDE10 inhibition is anticipated to have a direct anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying benefit.BenevolentAI will look to demonstrate that BEN-8744 is effective in treating moderate-to-severe cases of UC and with fewer side effects than the anti-TNF and JAK inhibitors that are currently the dominant form of treatment for this disease.BenevolentAI has filed for second medical use and composition of matter patents in respect of BEN-8744. BEN-8744 is a wholly owned asset in the BenevolentAI drug programme pipeline.About Ulcerative ColitisUC is a chronic disease that causes inflammation and ulceration of the inner lining of the colon and rectum. UC affects 0.4% of the US population  and 31% of patients have moderate-to-severe disease. 20-40% of those patients with moderate-to-severe UC do not respond to anti-TNF  the main treatment approach  and currently available treatments can have severe side effects.About BenevolentAIBenevolentAI (AMS: BAI) is a leading  clinical-stage AI-enabled drug discovery and development company listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. Through the combined capabilities of its AI platform  scientific expertise  and wet-lab facilities  BenevolentAI is well-positioned to deliver novel drug candidates with a higher probability of clinical success than those developed using traditional methods. The Benevolent Platform™ powers a growing in-house pipeline of 13 named drug programmes and over 10 exploratory programmes  and it maintains successful collaborations with AstraZeneca  as well as leading research and charitable institutions.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER OF ANY OF THE SECURITIES DESCRIBED HEREIN.Aberdeen  21st December 2022Reference is made to the stock exchange release from Awilco Drilling Plc (“Awilco Drilling” or the “Company”) (Euronext Growth: AWDR) published on 21st December 2021 regarding a contemplated private placement of new Sponsored Norwegian Depository Receipts in the Company up to NOK 78 million (equivalent to USD 8 million) in gross proceeds (the “Private Placement”)The Company is pleased to announce that the Private Placement has been successfully completed  raising gross proceeds of c. NOK 78 million  equivalent to c. USD 8 million  by allocation of 3 922 880 new Sponsored Norwegian Depository Receipts (the “Offer Shares”) in the Private Placement at a price per Offer Share of NOK 20 (the “Offer Price”).The Private Placement took place through an accelerated bookbuilding process managed by Clarksons Securities AS as Sole Manager and Bookrunner (the “Manager”) after close of markets on 21 December 2021.The net proceeds from the Private Placement will be used to partly finance Awilco Drillings' two arbitration cases against Keppel FELS Limited to their conclusions which are expected to take place no earlier than 2Q 2023 and 4Q 2023 for the two rigs.Notices of allocation of Offer Shares and payment instructions are expected to be distributed to the investors in the Private Placement through a notification from the Manager on 22nd December 2022 (T) (the ""Notification""). Any further settlement details will be stated in the Notification. The Offer Shares will be tradable upon allocation. Settlement of the Offer Shares is expected to take place on a delivery versus payment (DVP) basis on or about 28th December 2022 (the “Settlement Date”). The DvP settlement structure is facilitated by a pre-payment agreement (the “Pre-Payment Agreement”) between the Company and the Manager.Completion of the Private Placement is subject to  inter alia  the Pre-Payment Agreement remaining unmodified and in full force and effect and the Offer Shares having been fully paid and legally issued and delivered in VPS.Following the completion of the Private Placement  the Company will have a share capital of GBP 2 904 651.75 divided into 4 468 695 shares  each with a nominal value of GBP 0.65.The Company has considered the Private Placement in light of the equal treatment obligations under the rules on equal treatment under Euronext Growth Rule Book II and Oslo Børs' Guidelines for equal treatment  and is of the opinion that the Private Placement is in compliance with these requirements. The Company is in urgent need of new capital  and the delays involved in conducting a rights offering would have leaved the Company without the required funding for a sustained period. Further  the Board intends to carry out the Subsequent Offering (as defined below) following completion of the Private Placement that  if carried out  is expected to allow existing shareholders who are not offered to participate in the Private Placement the opportunity to maintain their pro rata ownership. As a consequence of the Private Placement structure  the shareholders' preferential rights to subscribe for the Offer Shares have been deviated from.The Board of Directors intends to conduct  subject to completion of the Private Placement and certain other conditions  a subsequent offering of new Sponsored Norwegian Depository Receipts raising gross proceeds of the NOK equivalent of up to USD 2 million at the same subscription price as the Offer Price in the Private Placement to existing shareholders in the Company as of 21st December 2022 (as registered in the VPS two trading days thereafter) who were not offered Offer Shares in the Private Placement and are not resident in a jurisdiction where such offering would be unlawful or would (in jurisdictions other than Norway) require any prospectus  filing  registration or similar action (the “Subsequent Offering”). Non-tradable subscription rights will be awarded. Completion of a Subsequent Offering is subject to approval by the Board  and the Board may at its discretion decide not to proceed with or cancel any Subsequent Offering. The subsequent offering is expected to be fully guaranteed by Awilhelmsen Offshore AS and QVT Family Office Fund LP. The Company reserves the right  in its sole discretion  to cancel the Subsequent Offering.A separate stock exchange notice will be made on key information for the Subsequent Offering.Advokatfirmaet Wiersholm AS is acting as Norwegian legal counsel to Awilco Drilling.For further information about the Private Placement please contact:Erik Jacobs  CEO of Awilco Drilling; Tel: +44 1224 737900Cathrine Haavind  Investor Relations of Awilco Drilling; Tel: +47 93 42 84 64  ch@awilcodrilling.comThe information in this announcement is considered to be inside information pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation for Awilco Drilling.
