It is a requirement of Russian law that securities listed on MOEX be held in custody by depositaries via the NSD.Euroclear suspended interactions with the NSD following the EU's asset freeze designation of the NSD on June 3  2022 under the Council Regulation (EU) No 269/2014 of March 17  2014 concerning restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity  sovereignty and independence of Ukraine  as amended (the ""EU Regulation""). Consequently  the NSD has been prevented from making settlements for  and distribution of dividends to  the MOEX ADS Holders. In addition  the MOEX ADS Holders were not able to execute their voting rights and convert their ADSs into a Class B Ordinary Shares of QIWI PLC.Obtaining a MEK LicenseThe eighth round of EU sanctions introduced into the EU Regulation a new NSD-specific licensing ground for competent authorities to base their licenses on when applied for by an institution or entity.On November 30  2022  QIWI applied to the sanction authority established by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Cyprus (""MEK"") for an approval (the ""License"") based on Article 6b(5) of the EU Regulation  to authorize a derogation in respect of the NSD  for the termination by January 7  2023 of operations  contracts or other agreements concluded with it  or otherwise involving it  before June 3  2022.On December 20  2022  the authorities granted QIWI the License  which authorizes:(a) application by holders of the ADSs for the cancellation of the ADSs of the MOEX ADS Holders which are custodied with the NSD  and(b) the transfer out of the NSD of the ADSs  subject to the following conditions:(i) the relevant contracts were entered into prior to June 3  2022;(ii) the ADSs will not be transferred to another entity or central securities depository which is subject to sanctions; and(iii) any actions for the release of the ADSs shall be completed before January 7  2023.Consequences for the MOEX ADS HoldersQIWI will engage in communications with Euroclear in order to allow qualifying MOEX ADS Holders to benefit from the authorization envisaged by the License  provided that Euroclear will comply with terms of the License.It is QIWI's understanding that Euroclear may choose to take a different approach and may not process the relevant instructions for cancellation of the ADSs submitted by the MOEX ADS Holders. The Company highlights to MOEX ADS Holders that conversion of their ADSs allows to eliminate sanctioned parties from the depositary chain  but the underlaying Class B ordinary shares are not traded on any stock exchange and thus considered to be illiquid shares.The MOEX ADSs holders  who are willing to cancel their ADSs in order to withdraw the underlying Class B Ordinary shares of QIWI PLC are instructed to take the following steps:· to review the relevant provisions described in Section 2.05 of the Deposit Agreement  a copy of which is available for no charge at https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1201935/000101915513000182/qiwidepnrec.htm   and· to approach their broker or depositary for further assistance to surrender their ADSs as soon as possible given the existing time constraints for the License (January 7th 2023).This statement does not constitute individual investment  financial or legal advice. This statement is for information purposes only and QIWI PLC shall not be liable if the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations by the relevant state authorities differs from the interpretation given in this statement. The MOEX ADSs holders should make an independent decision on how to act in connection with the published statement and  if necessary  contact their investment  legal and other advisors.No impact for ADSs trading on NasdaqThe effect of the License shall not impact the rights of shareholders of ADSs traded on Nasdaq and held in custody by depositaries outside of the NSD.About QIWI plc.QIWI is a leading provider of cutting-edge payment and financial services in Russia and the CIS.

The patents around allogeneic CAR T-cell therapies and NKG2D-based therapies provide an avenue to develop intellectual property programs and to partner with outside parties around the licensing of these patents.In addition to IP partnering transactions  Celyad 2.0 will prioritize discovery research in areas of expertise where it can leverage the differentiated nature of its platforms. The Company is implementing a differentiated and innovative strategy  tackling the major current limitations of CAR T-cell therapies. This strategy includes: Multiplexing approach of the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) platform  allowing multiple genes  including essential and functional genes  to be modulated simultaneously; Dual CAR development of a next-generation NKG2D-based CAR which may help to overcome resistance and immune escape often observed with traditional single targeting approaches; and Development of B7-H6-targeting immunotherapies as the Company believes that B7-H6 is an underappreciated target that could change the paradigm of cell therapy due to its broad expression in a large variety of cancers.Celyad Oncology is of the opinion that it will potentially create more shareholder value by licensing its patent estate and further strengthening its research efforts to improve the differentiated nature of its platforms.Story continuesBased on a strategic and financial review  the Company has decided to discontinue the development of its remaining clinical program CYAD-211 (the allogeneic shRNA-based  anti-BCMA CAR T candidate for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM)). There were no safety concerns leading to this decision and all patients previously treated with CYAD-211 will continue to receive their protocol-defined follow-up.The key data points of the program are as follows:19 r/r MM patients have been treated with CYAD-211 in the IMMUNICY-1 trial which was developed to validate shRNA technology in the clinic;The observed safety profile  including the lack of observed Graft-versus-Host disease  provides proof-of-concept for the use of shRNA technology for allogeneic CAR Ts;Out of 17 evaluable patients  a partial response was achieved in five patients. One patient was recently re-treated with a second dose of CYAD-211 after having reached stable disease post first infusion; andEnhanced lymphodepletion did not seem to improve clinical activity nor persistence of the cells post-infusion.Anticipated milestones for 2023The Company will take part in several conferences including The World Oncology Cell Therapy Congress in April and the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) 38 th Annual Meeting in November; andThe Company will provide updates on the potential proof-of-concept of the dual CAR and multiplexing research programs and on business development in the second quarter of 2023.About Celyad OncologyCelyad Oncology is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of innovative technologies chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies. The Company is focusing on opportunities to fully harness the true potential of its proprietary technology platforms and intellectual property and support the development of next-generation CAR T candidates in solid tumors and hematological malignancies.

McPhy – a long-time SOLIDWORKS customer – chose to move to a collaborative business platform deployed by the Visiativ team. This would deliver the collaborative design and product life cycle management capabilities to support its growth strategy as it scales up its business  in particular with the preparation for its new Gigafactory in France in 2024.“The Dassault Systèmes 3DEXPERIENCE platform deployed by Visiativ will help us structure our teams and our business. A unified architecture across all our sites (France  Italy and Germany) is a key step in McPhy's industrial scale-up  with the aim of optimizing collaborative processes across our European technology teams. We will also reduce our time-to-market in product development and project engineering for our clients  in particular by modelling the manufacturing process before our products are launched on the market "" said Benoît Barrière  Chief Technology Officer of McPhy.Story continuesReaching carbon neutrality by 2050 implies switching most of the world’s total energy consumption away from fossil fuels. McPhy’s electrolyzers and low-carbon hydrogen refueling stations are increasingly recognized by the industrial  mobility and energy markets as a viable solution to decarbonize their activities. Green hydrogen can be used to decarbonize the industrial sector as an energy carrier or as a raw material for steel production. It also can be turned into clean fuel to charge hydrogen vehicles  injected into gas networks  or used as an energy storage solution to help complement the renewable energy transition.The 3DEXPERIENCE platform will enable McPhy to leverage knowledge and know-how across the enterprise by standardizing processes and design and simulation applications  centralizing data and project management  and facilitating interaction among its teams.“As the world shifts away from the use of fossil fuels  our 3DEXPERIENCE platform offers new technological approaches to innovation across all phases of the life cycle  for equipment and products that contribute to a more sustainable economy ” said Philippe Bartissol  Vice President  Industrial Equipment industry  Dassault Systèmes. “Game-changers like McPhy can collaborate  innovate and manage the entire product life cycle in one virtual twin experience.”Visiativ  a digital transformation partner of Dassault Systèmes  is accompanying McPhy ’s deployment of the platform with integration and support services that enable all users to better collaborate and innovate by centralizing data and project management. This structuring and this multidisciplinary project was made possible thanks to the knowledge of Dassault Systèmes' solutions combined with the understanding of the customer's issues on the ground.“The success of this partnership is thanks to the collaboration  mutual trust  and commitment of McPhy  Dassault Systèmes and Visiativ ” said Laurent Fiard  CEO  Visiativ. “We are delighted to support McPhy in this global project in line with their innovation transformation strategy.

Subject to obtaining MHRA approval on the CTA  BenevolentAI plans to initiate a Phase I clinical trial of BEN-8744  anticipated to commence in the first half of 2023.Anne Phelan  Chief Scientific Officer at BenevolentAI  commented: “We are pleased to submit a CTA for BEN-8744 in line with our development timeline as we continue to progress this exciting investigational drug towards the clinic. We believe BEN-8744 has the potential to be a novel treatment for UC: a complex multifactorial disease that remains underserved by current standard-of-care therapies. BEN-8744 demonstrates BenevolentAI's unique ability to use vast quantities of multimodal data to uncover novel targets not previously linked to a given disease and increase confidence in the early phases of drug discovery. After rapidly delivering this drug candidate within just two years of target validation  we look forward to commencing first-in-human studies next year.”About BEN-8744BEN-8744 is an orally administered  peripherally restricted small molecule PDE10 inhibitor under development as a first-in-class treatment for ulcerative colitis and with the potential for other indications within inflammatory bowel disease. BEN-8744 is differentiated by its novel mechanism of action; there is an opportunity to further differentiate BEN-8744 based on safety and efficacy.PDE10 reduces intracellular levels of the signalling molecule cGMP. Restoration of cGMP levels by PDE10 inhibition is anticipated to have a direct anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying benefit.BenevolentAI will look to demonstrate that BEN-8744 is effective in treating moderate-to-severe cases of UC and with fewer side effects than the anti-TNF and JAK inhibitors that are currently the dominant form of treatment for this disease.BenevolentAI has filed for second medical use and composition of matter patents in respect of BEN-8744. BEN-8744 is a wholly owned asset in the BenevolentAI drug programme pipeline.About Ulcerative ColitisUC is a chronic disease that causes inflammation and ulceration of the inner lining of the colon and rectum. UC affects 0.4% of the US population  and 31% of patients have moderate-to-severe disease. 20-40% of those patients with moderate-to-severe UC do not respond to anti-TNF  the main treatment approach  and currently available treatments can have severe side effects.About BenevolentAIBenevolentAI (AMS: BAI) is a leading  clinical-stage AI-enabled drug discovery and development company listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. Through the combined capabilities of its AI platform  scientific expertise  and wet-lab facilities  BenevolentAI is well-positioned to deliver novel drug candidates with a higher probability of clinical success than those developed using traditional methods. The Benevolent Platform™ powers a growing in-house pipeline of 13 named drug programmes and over 10 exploratory programmes  and it maintains successful collaborations with AstraZeneca  as well as leading research and charitable institutions.

This would see less choice for smaller chicken farmers and processors  who might rely on ForFarmers and Boparan for their chicken feed.ForFarmers UK is a subsidiary of Dutch-based ForFarmers NV  which was founded as a farmer co-operative in 1896 and is now listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange.Boparan’s 2Agriculture is one of the UK’s largest poultry feed suppliers and uses its production to supply Hook 2 Sisters  which is linked to Boparan.Boparan also owns 2 Sisters Food Group  which supplies about a third of the chicken on UK supermarket shelves.,neutral,0.01,0.82,0.17,mixed,0.14,0.14,0.72,True,English,"['Poultry feed deal', 'depth probe', 'competition concerns', 'free real time breaking news alerts', 'free breaking news emails', 'Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange', 'animal feed milling operations', 'largest poultry feed suppliers', 'two poultry feed giants', 'valid email address', 'Sorcha O’Carroll', 'five working days', 'lower quality feed', 'Phase Two investigation', 'meat poultry feed', '2 Sisters Food Group', 'Dutch-based ForFarmers NV', 'UK supermarket shelves', 'four local areas', 'smaller chicken farmers', 'two businesses', 'four areas', 'Hook 2 Sisters', 'initial investigation', 'favourite meat', 'chicken feed', 'feed mills', 'food prices', 'The Independent', 'privacy notice', 'price hikes', 'East Anglia', 'north-western England', 'North Wales', 'Markets Authority', 'biggest expense', 'senior director', 'wider cost', 'living crisis', 'other types', 'next steps', 'combined businesses', 'joint venture', 'processing businesses', 'less choice', 'farmer co', 'depth investigation', 'higher prices', 'chicken farming', 'The CMA', 'third parties', 'competition watchdog', 'ForFarmers UK', '19 mills', 'inbox', 'offers', 'events', 'updates', 'verifyErrors', 'Something', 'tie-up', 'deal', 'costs', 'shoppers', 'merger', 'Boparan', '2 Agriculture', 'concerns', 'impact', 'service', 'consumers', 'reduction', 'situation', 'checkout', '2Agriculture', 'plans', 'July', 'companies', 'Burston', 'Bury', 'Llay', 'Preston', 'supply', 'processors', 'subsidiary', 'operative', 'production']",2022-12-21,2022-12-22,independent.co.uk

The patents around allogeneic CAR T-cell therapies and NKG2D-based therapies provide an avenue to develop intellectual property programs and to partner with outside parties around the licensing of these patents.In addition to IP partnering transactions  Celyad 2.0 will prioritize discovery research in areas of expertise where it can leverage the differentiated nature of its platforms. The Company is implementing a differentiated and innovative strategy  tackling the major current limitations of CAR T-cell therapies. This strategy includes:- Multiplexing approach of the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) platform  allowing multiple genes  including essential and functional genes  to be modulated simultaneously;- Dual CAR development of a next-generation NKG2D-based CAR which may help to overcome resistance and immune escape often observed with traditional single targeting approaches; and- Development of B7-H6-targeting immunotherapies as the Company believes that B7-H6 is an underappreciated target that could change the paradigm of cell therapy due to its broad expression in a large variety of cancers.Celyad Oncology is of the opinion that it will potentially create more shareholder value by licensing its patent estate and further strengthening its research efforts to improve the differentiated nature of its platforms.Story continuesBased on a strategic and financial review  the Company has decided to discontinue the development of its remaining clinical program CYAD-211 (the allogeneic shRNA-based  anti-BCMA CAR T candidate for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM)). There were no safety concerns leading to this decision and all patients previously treated with CYAD-211 will continue to receive their protocol-defined follow-up.The key data points of the program are as follows:19 r/r MM patients have been treated with CYAD-211 in the IMMUNICY-1 trial which was developed to validate shRNA technology in the clinic;The observed safety profile  including the lack of observed Graft-versus-Host disease  provides proof-of-concept for the use of shRNA technology for allogeneic CAR Ts;Out of 17 evaluable patients  a partial response was achieved in five patients. One patient was recently re-treated with a second dose of CYAD-211 after having reached stable disease post first infusion; andEnhanced lymphodepletion did not seem to improve clinical activity nor persistence of the cells post-infusion.Anticipated milestones for 2023The Company will take part in several conferences including The World Oncology Cell Therapy Congress in April and the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) 38 th Annual Meeting in November; andThe Company will provide updates on the potential proof-of-concept of the dual CAR and multiplexing research programs and on business development in the second quarter of 2023.About Celyad OncologyCelyad Oncology is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of innovative technologies chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies.

The patents around allogeneic CAR T-cell therapies and NKG2D-based therapies provide an avenue to develop intellectual property programs and to partner with outside parties around the licensing of these patents.In addition to IP partnering transactions  Celyad 2.0 will prioritize discovery research in areas of expertise where it can leverage the differentiated nature of its platforms. The Company is implementing a differentiated and innovative strategy  tackling the major current limitations of CAR T-cell therapies. This strategy includes: Multiplexing approach of the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) platform  allowing multiple genes  including essential and functional genes  to be modulated simultaneously; Dual CAR development of a next-generation NKG2D-based CAR which may help to overcome resistance and immune escape often observed with traditional single targeting approaches; and Development of B7-H6-targeting immunotherapies as the Company believes that B7-H6 is an underappreciated target that could change the paradigm of cell therapy due to its broad expression in a large variety of cancers.Celyad Oncology is of the opinion that it will potentially create more shareholder value by licensing its patent estate and further strengthening its research efforts to improve the differentiated nature of its platforms.Based on a strategic and financial review  the Company has decided to discontinue the development of its remaining clinical program CYAD-211 (the allogeneic shRNA-based  anti-BCMA CAR T candidate for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM)). There were no safety concerns leading to this decision and all patients previously treated with CYAD-211 will continue to receive their protocol-defined follow-up.The key data points of the program are as follows:19 r/r MM patients have been treated with CYAD-211 in the IMMUNICY-1 trial which was developed to validate shRNA technology in the clinic;The observed safety profile  including the lack of observed Graft-versus-Host disease  provides proof-of-concept for the use of shRNA technology for allogeneic CAR Ts;Out of 17 evaluable patients  a partial response was achieved in five patients. One patient was recently re-treated with a second dose of CYAD-211 after having reached stable disease post first infusion; andEnhanced lymphodepletion did not seem to improve clinical activity nor persistence of the cells post-infusion.Anticipated milestones for 2023The Company will take part in several conferences including The World Oncology Cell Therapy Congress in April and the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) 38 th Annual Meeting in November; andAnnual Meeting in November; and The Company will provide updates on the potential proof-of-concept of the dual CAR and multiplexing research programs and on business development in the second quarter of 2023.About Celyad OncologyCelyad Oncology is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of innovative technologies chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies. The Company is focusing on opportunities to fully harness the true potential of its proprietary technology platforms and intellectual property and support the development of next-generation CAR T candidates in solid tumors and hematological malignancies.

It also announced a tender offer to provide a liquidity opportunity for those shareholders who did not wish to participate in the Relaunch (the “Tender Offer”).In August 2022  the Tender Offer closed with ~47% of Ordinary Shares in issue as at 4 August 2022 tendered  resulting in Eurocastle accepting 864 980 shares in exchange for €10.26 per share  or €8.9 million in total.

The Company will invest primarily in real estate auctions leveraging the Manager’s deep knowledge of the sector  which offers significant investment opportunities in the current market cycle. The Board believes that this strategy will allow Eurocastle to deploy available cash in order to establish a platform and create a meaningful track record  while generating attractive risk adjusted returns in the short term.At the same time  the Board will continue to monitor the market environment for raising new capital in order to assess pursuing all elements of its new investment strategy  which would require additional capital to achieve meaningful scale.The Board considers that any potential additional costs resulting from this phased approach are adequately covered by the Company’s existing Additional Reserves. The Board will continue to evaluate these reserves and the Company’s available capital  taking into account investment opportunities and the performance of the new strategy.Shareholders should however be aware that the implementation and performance of the Company’s new investment strategy is subject to risks  uncertainty  and assumptions. The Manager is currently in the early stages of pursuing a new investment strategy and there can be no certainty that it will have success in doing so. There is likewise no certainty that it will be able to attain sufficient scale to achieve the desired returns. In addition  changes in economic conditions generally and the real estate market specifically  the availability of appropriate investment opportunities and the ability to raise financing on suitable terms may also affect the success of the Relaunch. Accordingly  there is no guarantee that the Company’s new investment strategy will be effectively implemented nor will there necessarily be a future opportunity for shareholders to achieve an exit from their investment in the Company at a price equal to or higher than the current share price.For further details of the Relaunch  the Company’s new investment strategy and the Additional Reserves  please refer to the Circular published in July 2022 and available on the Company’s website under the Periodic Reports and Shareholder Communications section.NOTICE: This announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014.ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONFor investment portfolio information  please refer to the Company’s most recent Financial Report  which is available on the Company’s website (www.eurocastleinv.com).Terms not otherwise defined in this announcement shall have the meaning given to them in the Circular.ABOUT EUROCASTLEEurocastle Investment Limited (“Eurocastle” or the “Company”) is a publicly traded closed-ended investment company.

Subject to obtaining MHRA approval on the CTA  BenevolentAI plans to initiate a Phase I clinical trial of BEN-8744  anticipated to commence in the first half of 2023.Anne Phelan  Chief Scientific Officer at BenevolentAI  commented: “We are pleased to submit a CTA for BEN-8744 in line with our development timeline as we continue to progress this exciting investigational drug towards the clinic. We believe BEN-8744 has the potential to be a novel treatment for UC: a complex multifactorial disease that remains underserved by current standard-of-care therapies. BEN-8744 demonstrates BenevolentAI's unique ability to use vast quantities of multimodal data to uncover novel targets not previously linked to a given disease and increase confidence in the early phases of drug discovery. After rapidly delivering this drug candidate within just two years of target validation  we look forward to commencing first-in-human studies next year.”About BEN-8744BEN-8744 is an orally administered  peripherally restricted small molecule PDE10 inhibitor under development as a first-in-class treatment for ulcerative colitis and with the potential for other indications within inflammatory bowel disease. BEN-8744 is differentiated by its novel mechanism of action; there is an opportunity to further differentiate BEN-8744 based on safety and efficacy.PDE10 reduces intracellular levels of the signalling molecule cGMP. Restoration of cGMP levels by PDE10 inhibition is anticipated to have a direct anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying benefit.BenevolentAI will look to demonstrate that BEN-8744 is effective in treating moderate-to-severe cases of UC and with fewer side effects than the anti-TNF and JAK inhibitors that are currently the dominant form of treatment for this disease.BenevolentAI has filed for second medical use and composition of matter patents in respect of BEN-8744. BEN-8744 is a wholly owned asset in the BenevolentAI drug programme pipeline.About Ulcerative ColitisUC is a chronic disease that causes inflammation and ulceration of the inner lining of the colon and rectum. UC affects 0.4% of the US population  and 31% of patients have moderate-to-severe disease. 20-40% of those patients with moderate-to-severe UC do not respond to anti-TNF  the main treatment approach  and currently available treatments can have severe side effects.About BenevolentAIBenevolentAI (AMS: BAI) is a leading  clinical-stage AI-enabled drug discovery and development company listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. Through the combined capabilities of its AI platform  scientific expertise  and wet-lab facilities  BenevolentAI is well-positioned to deliver novel drug candidates with a higher probability of clinical success than those developed using traditional methods.

AlphaVerse aims to become ""THE"" gateway to the worlds of metaverses  hence its name in reference to ""Alpha"" (""One"" in Greek).During the first season opened in September 2022  the first users were able to successfully test the first features of the Hub.With Season 2  AlphaVerse aims to introduce new functionalities  infrastructures and management tools and in particular:options for players to create content (images  videos) and avatar customization options;teleportation tools and new account creation features;wallet integration and a first version of NFT management tools.The modalities of participation in this Season 2 will be revealed on social networks by the operational teams before the opening date of the season.Development of virtual worlds and in particular a world dedicated to footballWithin the AlphaVerse universes  visitors and players will be able to create  share  and market content inside AlphaVerse through NFTs and crypto-currencies  but also outside on various blockchain platforms.CBI's strategy is to develop an AlphaVerse universe dedicated to football  the world's leading sport.This world dedicated to football will be an open world  with no crypto-currency required to create an account. Users will be able to visit places dedicated to their favorite clubs. Experiences will be diversified  with audiovisual content  club news  fan exchanges and a connection between the virtual and real worlds with concrete benefits such as free tickets. There will also be mini-games available in the virtual world  as well as virtual objects representative of the clubs  developed in partnership with them. Visitors will have the opportunity to purchase these items either in euros or other traditional currency  or with crypto-currencies.AlphaVerse  which favors the creation of tools for the production and broadcasting of audiovisual content  lends itself particularly well to the creation of a world dedicated to football in which matches and exchanges between players  clubs and fans will have their full place.The partnership agreements with the clubs take the form of long-term licenses  with royalty rates and guaranteed minimums typical of this type of contract and in line with market practices.DisclaimerThe realization of projects  as well as their operational budget and financing plan  remain fundamentally subject to uncertainties  and the non-realisation of the underlying assumptions may have a significant impact on the value of the assets and liabilities.About CBICRYPTO BLOCKCHAIN INDUSTRIES (“CBI”) is a French company that develops  operates and invests in video games  business applications and selected projects relating to the blockchain  non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) and cryptocurrencies.

It will also allow both parties to maximise the full market potential of jefacture.com. This e-invoicing platform developed by Unifiedpost for ECMA enables French chartered accountants to help their clients in the transition towards mandatory B2B e-invoicing. Next to that  it facilitates the additional  direct market entry of the platform to tens of thousands of SMEs.As from 1 July 2024  all French companies should be able to receive e-invoices. This implies a significant implementation of calibrated technology by all businesses in order to comply with this VAT-based regulation. Already in 2020  ECMA therefore closed a partnership with Belgian listed e-invoicing provider Unifiedpost in order to provide French accountants with a platform to manage the e-invoicing flows of their clients. Today jefacture.com allows SMEs to dematerialize and route all purchase and sales invoices in Factur-X format and to integrate them in their management tools. In France  there are about 20.000 accountants serving 2 75 million of SMEs. More than 600 million B2B invoices are send out yearly in the country.Now this partnership is taken to the next level. As ECMA wants to invest heavily in the ongoing transformation and therefore wants to sustainable anchor the exploitation of jefacture.com  also to SMEs directly  the joint venture Facturel was created together with Unifiedpost.François Millo  Director of ECMA stated: ""Although mandatory e-invoicing will bring productivity gains for businesses  and in particular the smallest ones  it will nevertheless remain complex to implement. With jefacture.com  chartered accountants know that they can rely on a trusted e-invoicing platform in the context of this crucial reform. jefacture.com enables them to be at the heart of the invoicing flows  to assist their clients in passing this legislative milestone.”Story continuesHans Leybaert  CEO and founder of Unifiedpost Group stated: “Thanks to the joined expertise and experience of ECMA and Unifiedpost  accumulated by the jefacture.com platform since its launch in 2020  chartered accountants and companies have a functional and efficient tool that allows them to anticipate the transition to electronic invoicing without waiting until July 2024. With the creation of Facturel  we are sending a message to the market of a joint long-term collaboration. It shows the necessary commitment and allows the pooling of significant resources to meet the security requirements set by the public authorities.”<End>Investor Relations & MediaSarah Heuninck+32 491 15 05 09sarah.heuninck@unifiedpost.comFinancial Calendar 20236 March 2023 Publication FY 2022 Financial Results18 April 2023 Publication Annual Report 202216 May 2023 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders22 May 2023 Publication Q1 2023 Business Update29 August 2023 Publication H1 2023 Financial Results16 November 2023 Publication Q3 2023 Business UpdateAbout Unifiedpost GroupUnifiedpost is a leading cloud-based platform for SME business services built on “Documents”  “Identity” and “Payments”.

UCART22 has been developed to potentially offer a therapeutic alternative for patients with r/r B-ALL  including patients that have relapsed from or unable to receive CD19-directed therapy. The ability to have our manufacturing completely in-house maximizes the chances that eligible patients can be treated without delay.” said Mark Frattini  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer at Cellectis.“This is a transformational step forward for Cellectis: our in-house manufacturing capabilities would allow us to move product candidates like UCART22 from R&D to development to a finished UCART product on a timeline that would not have been possible working with a contract manufacturer ” said Steven Doares  Senior Vice President  US Manufacturing & Raleigh Site Head. “We believe that having this capability in-house is a great competitive advantage as it would give us the ability to swiftly version our product candidates as we monitor clinical responses  resulting in what we expect to be the best product possible.”UCART22 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate that targets CD22 and is evaluated in the BALLI-01 clinical study  a Phase 1/2a open-label dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of the product candidate in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL).Story continuesThree years ago  Cellectis made the decision to build its proprietary GMP manufacturing facilities in both Raleigh (North Carolina) and Paris to take control of its production and manufacturing timelines.

EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology  today announced that it has signed a contract to install a fully integrated X-ray irradiation solution at a customer's new service center site in France. The solution includes an IBA Rhodotron®  a Beagle® process control system  a safety access system  an overhead conveyor for pallets and automated pallet storage. The value of the contract for IBA is estimated at around EUR 20 million and a downpayment has been received.This latest contract further highlights the significant growth of IBA's Industrial Solutions division  which has had a strong 2022 and recently passed the milestone of EUR 100 million order intake to date. The deal comes in the context of evolving industrial market dynamics  particularly sterilization  which has seen its growth rate increase from 7 to 10% annually[1]. Currently around 90% of the sterilization industry relies on ethylene oxide and Gamma radiation  derived from Cobalt-60. Both modalities are facing issues in terms of supply pressures and shortages  with ethylene oxide also being impacted by toxicity issues.Market challenges with incumbent sterilization technology have highlighted the need for high-quality alternative solutions such as X-ray and electron beam sterilization. IBA is the only manufacturer able to offer both X-ray and electron beam sterilization via its Rhodotron®  which has the largest power range of any accelerator on the market. Avoiding the use of toxic chemicals and radioactive materials  IBA's solutions are also significantly safer for the environment than the current standard.Thomas Servais  Vice President of IBA Industrial Solutions  commented: ""This new contract underlines the continued growth of our sterilization solutions business  with order volumes up strongly in 2022.

EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology  today announced that it has signed a contract to install a fully integrated X-ray irradiation solution at a customer’s new service center site in France. The solution includes an IBA Rhodotron®  a Beagle® process control system  a safety access system  an overhead conveyor for pallets and automated pallet storage. The value of the contract for IBA is estimated at around EUR 20 million and a downpayment has been received.This latest contract further highlights the significant growth of IBA’s Industrial Solutions division  which has had a strong 2022 and recently passed the milestone of EUR 100 million order intake to date. The deal comes in the context of evolving industrial market dynamics  particularly sterilization  which has seen its growth rate increase from 7 to 10% annually1. Currently around 90% of the sterilization industry relies on ethylene oxide and Gamma radiation  derived from Cobalt-60. Both modalities are facing issues in terms of supply pressures and shortages  with ethylene oxide also being impacted by toxicity issues.Market challenges with incumbent sterilization technology have highlighted the need for high-quality alternative solutions such as X-ray and electron beam sterilization. IBA is the only manufacturer able to offer both X-ray and electron beam sterilization via its Rhodotron®  which has the largest power range of any accelerator on the market. Avoiding the use of toxic chemicals and radioactive materials  IBA’s solutions are also significantly safer for the environment than the current standard.Thomas Servais  Vice President of IBA Industrial Solutions  commented: “This new contract underlines the continued growth of our sterilization solutions business  with order volumes up strongly in 2022. There is a clear opportunity for the future growth of IBA Industrial within the global sterilization landscape as we capitalize on the growth of the market and the need for an alternative  environmentally conscious solution to address the increasing demand.”***About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.

In addition  PerioTabs® helps fight the risk of serious health problems such as diabetes  respiratory diseases  heart problems  premature birth  kidney cancer and even Alzheimer's disease  all of which are directly linked to bleeding gums due to microbes entering the blood stream.PerioTabs® is the world's first microbial biofilm-removing brushing solution for teeth and gums that reduces bleedingThe past two years have been marked by several challenges for bonyf. Despite the pandemic  which slowed down our growth  we launched a number of projects to prepare for our future.

My role is to provide objective evidence of the safety and clinical efficacy of bonyf's products in order to meet strict regulatory requirements and customer expectations. We invest a lot of time and money in high quality pre-clinical and clinical studies. These studies are conducted by key opinion leaders worldwide resulting in publications in leading peer-reviewed scientific journals.Can you illustrate these clinical trials with some concrete examples?Of course. First of all  I would like to mention the 7 independent clinical studies carried out on OlivaFix® Gold denture adhesive cream which were performed in 8 different countries  and included over 300 denture wearers. These studies demonstrated the superiority of OlivaFix® Gold over current market leader products. Results were incredible to say the least  in terms of customer satisfaction  holding time and improving the overall quality of life of denture wearers. A further trial is currently ongoing in Brazil.We have also completed 8 studies for PerioTabs® highlighting the product's efficacy in reducing gingivitis and implant-related infection (peri-mucositis)  with two additional studies currently ongoing. One study is evaluating PerioTabs® efficacy in reducing swollen gums which is often observed in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. The second study assesses the long-term use of PerioTabs® in patients with periodontitis.We also recently completed a clinical trial for our mouth ulcer cream  AphtoFix®  demonstrating its pain reduction and fast healing in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis.

Each tranche is accompanied by the issue of warrants  the number of which is calculated in relation to a reference price of 14 euros according to the following formula : Number of warrants = Amount of the tranche / (14 x m) with m = 3.4 for tranche 1 and 3.7 for tranche 2.The first tranche has a maturity of six years and is therefore repayable in December 2028.

These warrants represent 0.24% of the current capital of the Company (if they were to be exercised in their entirety).The EIB also has a put option at intrinsic value (i.e. the difference between the stock market price and the exercise price) allowing it to require the Company to repurchase all or part of the warrants then exercisable but not yet exercised  under certain circumstances (for example in the event of a change of control or at the reimbursement date of the first tranche). In addition  the Company has a right of first refusal to redeem any warrants offered for sale to a third party  subject to certain exceptions.On the basis of 126 050 new shares of the Company that could be issued upon exercise of all of these warrants  the Company could potentially receive gross proceeds amounting to 1 085 290 euros.

It will also allow both parties to maximise the full market potential of jefacture.com. This e-invoicing platform developed by Unifiedpost for ECMA enables French chartered accountants to help their clients in the transition towards mandatory B2B e-invoicing. Next to that  it facilitates the additional  direct market entry of the platform to tens of thousands of SMEs.As from 1 July 2024  all French companies should be able to receive e-invoices. This implies a significant implementation of calibrated technology by all businesses in order to comply with this VAT-based regulation. Already in 2020  ECMA therefore closed a partnership with Belgian listed e-invoicing provider Unifiedpost in order to provide French accountants with a platform to manage the e-invoicing flows of their clients. Today jefacture.com allows SMEs to dematerialize and route all purchase and sales invoices in Factur-X format and to integrate them in their management tools. In France  there are about 20.000 accountants serving 2 75 million of SMEs. More than 600 million B2B invoices are send out yearly in the country.Now this partnership is taken to the next level. As ECMA wants to invest heavily in the ongoing transformation and therefore wants to sustainable anchor the exploitation of jefacture.com  also to SMEs directly  the joint venture Facturel was created together with Unifiedpost.François Millo  Director of ECMA stated: ""Although mandatory e-invoicing will bring productivity gains for businesses  and in particular the smallest ones  it will nevertheless remain complex to implement. With jefacture.com  chartered accountants know that they can rely on a trusted e-invoicing platform in the context of this crucial reform. jefacture.com enables them to be at the heart of the invoicing flows  to assist their clients in passing this legislative milestone.”Hans Leybaert  CEO and founder of Unifiedpost Group stated: “Thanks to the joined expertise and experience of ECMA and Unifiedpost  accumulated by the jefacture.com platform since its launch in 2020  chartered accountants and companies have a functional and efficient tool that allows them to anticipate the transition to electronic invoicing without waiting until July 2024. With the creation of Facturel  we are sending a message to the market of a joint long-term collaboration. It shows the necessary commitment and allows the pooling of significant resources to meet the security requirements set by the public authorities.”<End>Investor Relations & MediaSarah Heuninck+32 491 15 05 09sarah.heuninck@unifiedpost.comFinancial Calendar 20236 March 2023 Publication FY 2022 Financial Results18 April 2023 Publication Annual Report 202216 May 2023 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders22 May 2023 Publication Q1 2023 Business Update29 August 2023 Publication H1 2023 Financial Results16 November 2023 Publication Q3 2023 Business UpdateAbout Unifiedpost GroupUnifiedpost is a leading cloud-based platform for SME business services built on “Documents”  “Identity” and “Payments”.

But his program replaced more ambitious plans for a Big Bang 2  a reference to Margaret Thatcher’s revolutionary 1980s financial deregulation  leaving bankers wondering how radical the government will be this time.Some fear 2023 will be dominated by a tangle of reviews rather than action  despite the UK’s vote to leave the European Union being seven years ago. Brexit dividends may remain as unclear as they were in the aftermath of the referendum  they fear.UK’s Post-Brexit Financial Services Reforms Fall Short of Promised ‘Big Bang’Those concerns are overly pessimistic  and it is possible to discern an emerging plan for Britain’s financial services after years of wrangling about Brexit  according to Jonathan Hill  the former EU commissioner for financial services who completed a company listings review for the government.“After three wasted years  we have finally started to get a direction of travel ” Hill said. “It is a bit like a Pointillist painting. Up close it looks like lots of dots  but if you step back you can start to see a clearer picture emerging.”By next summer  supporters say  the UK could have modern company listings rules  guidelines for the crypto sector and one of the world’s most modern trading hubs. All could be overseen by regulators exercising a keen eye for opportunities to make the UK’s financial services more internationally competitive.It is time to be bold  according to Rachel Kent  a senior partner at law firm Hogan Lovells and chair of the International Regulatory Strategy Group  which looks at UK regulation. “Now is our chance ” she said. “This is a golden opportunity to get our rules right in the interests of the whole of the UK.”Reform PackageEven supporters agree the direction under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak isn’t revolutionary  but argue that changes coming through the Financial Services and Markets Bill and the 30-point plan announced in Edinburgh should help make London a more modern financial center  with rules tailored for the UK economy rather than what was a 28-country bloc.The two programs together offer a mix of legal changes and reviews  with topics ranging from relaxing EU Solvency II insurance capital standards and MiFID II markets regulations  to the securitization market and short-selling. The aim is to stimulate trading in London  and to encourage a multi-billion-pound inflow of pensions money and individuals’ savings into investments.If the hard work is done during 2023’s tough economic times  the UK could be in a strong position to attract international investment and company listings in 2024  according to Mike Coombes  vice president of corporate affairs at PrimaryBid Ltd.  a platform which provides retail investors with access to share sales.“By the end of next year  we could see a world where there are a significant number of IPOs coming down the line for 2024 that will include a retail offering ” Coombes said. “It could be a scenario where capital markets in the UK are starting to function quite efficiently  particularly if issuers can tap the over £300 billion ($364 billion) currently inactive in cash ISAs.”Intense CompetitionThat won’t be easy  according to skeptics who point to stiff competition from the US and Asia and a growing regulatory pull from Europe. Banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are continuing to move senior staff with EU roles inside the bloc  while London recently lost its crown as Europe’s biggest stock market to Paris.“London used to be the largest financial center of the European Union  and everybody liked it ” Stephane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer of European exchange Euronext said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “Today  London is the largest financial center of the United Kingdom.”UK Should Avoid Hasty Financial Services Reforms Following Brexit: LawmakersThe English capital is still a stronghold for international finance and well-positioned to lead the world in fintech and green finance  according to Nicholas Lyons  a veteran investment banker and insurance executive now serving as Lord Mayor of London  an ambassadorial role.But there also needs to be a shift in attitude  Lyons believes. Since the financial crisis  “the UK lost its competitive edge ” he told Bloomberg News in New York during a visit to promote London. “We need to reintroduce a celebration of wealth and jobs creators.”Political BattlesNot everyone agrees. The past few months have been characterized by running battles about the perceived risk of a bonfire of regulations  with critics accusing ministers of undermining regulators’ independence and wanting to dismantle safeguards put in place after 2008 to prevent future banking bailouts.Among the government’s more controversial proposals are a plan to water down the ring-fence that requires banks to separate capital for their high street lending operations and possibly easing penalties for senior executives when they make mistakes.The incoming requirement for regulators to consider the financial services sector’s international competitiveness as a secondary objective after stability and consumer protection is particularly problematic  according to John Vickers  warden of All Souls college at Oxford University and a former architect of Britain’s post-financial crisis reforms.Competitiveness objectives “tend to be vehicles for sectoral vested interests ” Vickers said. “In the case of financial services  sometimes the sector’s interests will be aligned with the rest of the country  and sometimes they will be opposed. The sector should not have privileged treatment relative to the rest of the economy.”Regulators’ RoleLeaving the EU gives regulators more scope to make rules that were previously overseen by European politicians. A debate about the best form of post-Brexit parliamentary oversight for the UK’s Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority descended into a row about a “call-in” power  that the government eventually dropped in the face of vocal opposition.Yet scrutiny is an important part of the setting the future agenda for the City of London  Hill said. “I don’t see how we can address that without looking at the role of the regulators and working out a system where both their independence and accountability are clear ” he said. Hill’s view is shared by others in the House of Lords  who want to ensure the accountability and competition provisions are not watered down further in finance bill before it becomes law next year.Brexit BeefAnother outstanding issue is the UK’s relationship with Europe. The City of London was sidelined for years after the Brexit referendum partly because of lingering public anger about the financial crisis and also because it was seen as a bastion of remainer sentiment.Sunak has denied a report he was exploring a Switzerland-style deal with the EU which would give greater access in return for adopting the bloc’s rules  but many in the City would like to see closer ties to ease the costs and logistics of maintaining large operations in the UK and on the Continent. Meanwhile  the EU still exerts sway as Brussels modernizes its rules to boost its own competitiveness  and the UK also has to contend with international regulations  such as the incoming Basel 3.1 banking capital rules.A big question for firms is whether Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s reforms — such as the plan to scrap the EU bankers’ bonus cap — will ever be enacted with the opposition Labour Party polling strongly and a general election required by law by January 2025.Whatever changes are ultimately enacted  their impact won’t be apparent immediately. The effect of Margaret Thatcher’s Big Bang reforms in turning London into an international finance center took time to crystallize  recalled Nigel Boardman  chairman of banking group Arbuthnot Latham and a former lawyer at Slaughter and May.“After Big Bang in 1986  I was on various panels that looked at which would be the dominant exchange in Europe ” Boardman said. “There was talk of Frankfurt  Paris and London. It was by no means clear it would be London.”–With assistance from Craig Gordon  Joe Easton  Francine Lacqua and William Shaw.Photograph: Commuters cross London Bridge in the City of London with a view of Tower Bridge in the background.

EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology  today announced that it has signed a contract to install a fully integrated X-ray irradiation solution at a ...,IBA SASignificant contract win for IBA’s Industrial Solutions;first time the division has sold a complete irradiation solutionLouvain-La-Neuve  Belgium  22 December 2022 – IBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.  EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology  today announced that it has signed a contract to install a fully integrated X-ray irradiation solution at a customer’s new service center site in France. The solution includes an IBA Rhodotron®  a Beagle® process control system  a safety access system  an overhead conveyor for pallets and automated pallet storage. The value of the contract for IBA is estimated at around EUR 20 million and a downpayment has been received.This latest contract further highlights the significant growth of IBA’s Industrial Solutions division  which has had a strong 2022 and recently passed the milestone of EUR 100 million order intake to date. The deal comes in the context of evolving industrial market dynamics  particularly sterilization  which has seen its growth rate increase from 7 to 10% annually1. Currently around 90% of the sterilization industry relies on ethylene oxide and Gamma radiation  derived from Cobalt-60. Both modalities are facing issues in terms of supply pressures and shortages  with ethylene oxide also being impacted by toxicity issues.Market challenges with incumbent sterilization technology have highlighted the need for high-quality alternative solutions such as X-ray and electron beam sterilization. IBA is the only manufacturer able to offer both X-ray and electron beam sterilization via its Rhodotron®  which has the largest power range of any accelerator on the market. Avoiding the use of toxic chemicals and radioactive materials  IBA’s solutions are also significantly safer for the environment than the current standard.Thomas Servais  Vice President of IBA Industrial Solutions  commented: “This new contract underlines the continued growth of our sterilization solutions business  with order volumes up strongly in 2022. There is a clear opportunity for the future growth of IBA Industrial within the global sterilization landscape as we capitalize on the growth of the market and the need for an alternative  environmentally conscious solution to address the increasing demand.”Story continues***About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.
