Summary On 9 November 2022  the Company announced that MADE.com Design Ltd (""MDL"")  MADE's operating subsidiary  had notified the Company that it had appointed Zelf Hussain  Peter David Dickens and Rachael Maria Wilkinson of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as administrators of MDL. The Company further announced that  following the suspension of the Company's Shares from trading on the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities on 1 November 2022  the Board expected that in due course the listing of the Company's Shares would be cancelled  any residual value would be distributed to the Company's Shareholders and the Company would be wound up. As at the date of this document  the Company's Shares remain suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange. After discussions with its advisers  and for the reasons further set out below  the Board is proposing that the Company is placed into Members' Voluntary Liquidation. This will enable liquidators appointed by the Company to realise the Company's remaining assets pending completion of the administration of MDL and for the Company to save the ongoing costs of a listed company in this period (as entry into the Members' Voluntary Liquidation will result in the listing of the Shares on the Official List being cancelled). Any residual value will then be distributed to Shareholders and the Company will be wound-up (the ""Proposal""). The purpose of this document is to provide Shareholders with further details of the Proposal and to convene a General Meeting at which Shareholders will be asked to approve the Proposal.

It will also allow both parties to maximise the full market potential of jefacture.com. This e-invoicing platform developed by Unifiedpost for ECMA enables French chartered accountants to help their clients in the transition towards mandatory B2B e-invoicing. Next to that  it facilitates the additional  direct market entry of the platform to tens of thousands of SMEs.As from 1 July 2024  all French companies should be able to receive e-invoices. This implies a significant implementation of calibrated technology by all businesses in order to comply with this VAT-based regulation. Already in 2020  ECMA therefore closed a partnership with Belgian listed e-invoicing provider Unifiedpost in order to provide French accountants with a platform to manage the e-invoicing flows of their clients. Today jefacture.com allows SMEs to dematerialize and route all purchase and sales invoices in Factur-X format and to integrate them in their management tools. In France  there are about 20.000 accountants serving 2 75 million of SMEs. More than 600 million B2B invoices are send out yearly in the country.Now this partnership is taken to the next level. As ECMA wants to invest heavily in the ongoing transformation and therefore wants to sustainable anchor the exploitation of jefacture.com  also to SMEs directly  the joint venture Facturel was created together with Unifiedpost.François Millo  Director of ECMA stated: ""Although mandatory e-invoicing will bring productivity gains for businesses  and in particular the smallest ones  it will nevertheless remain complex to implement. With jefacture.com  chartered accountants know that they can rely on a trusted e-invoicing platform in the context of this crucial reform. jefacture.com enables them to be at the heart of the invoicing flows  to assist their clients in passing this legislative milestone.”Story continuesHans Leybaert  CEO and founder of Unifiedpost Group stated: “Thanks to the joined expertise and experience of ECMA and Unifiedpost  accumulated by the jefacture.com platform since its launch in 2020  chartered accountants and companies have a functional and efficient tool that allows them to anticipate the transition to electronic invoicing without waiting until July 2024. With the creation of Facturel  we are sending a message to the market of a joint long-term collaboration. It shows the necessary commitment and allows the pooling of significant resources to meet the security requirements set by the public authorities.”<End>Investor Relations & MediaSarah Heuninck+32 491 15 05 09sarah.heuninck@unifiedpost.comFinancial Calendar 20236 March 2023 Publication FY 2022 Financial Results18 April 2023 Publication Annual Report 202216 May 2023 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders22 May 2023 Publication Q1 2023 Business Update29 August 2023 Publication H1 2023 Financial Results16 November 2023 Publication Q3 2023 Business UpdateAbout Unifiedpost GroupUnifiedpost is a leading cloud-based platform for SME business services built on “Documents”  “Identity” and “Payments”.

UCART22 has been developed to potentially offer a therapeutic alternative for patients with r/r B-ALL  including patients that have relapsed from or unable to receive CD19-directed therapy. The ability to have our manufacturing completely in-house maximizes the chances that eligible patients can be treated without delay.” said Mark Frattini  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer at Cellectis.“This is a transformational step forward for Cellectis: our in-house manufacturing capabilities would allow us to move product candidates like UCART22 from R&D to development to a finished UCART product on a timeline that would not have been possible working with a contract manufacturer ” said Steven Doares  Senior Vice President  US Manufacturing & Raleigh Site Head. “We believe that having this capability in-house is a great competitive advantage as it would give us the ability to swiftly version our product candidates as we monitor clinical responses  resulting in what we expect to be the best product possible.”UCART22 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate that targets CD22 and is evaluated in the BALLI-01 clinical study  a Phase 1/2a open-label dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of the product candidate in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL).Story continuesThree years ago  Cellectis made the decision to build its proprietary GMP manufacturing facilities in both Raleigh (North Carolina) and Paris to take control of its production and manufacturing timelines.

Each tranche is accompanied by the issue of warrants  the number of which is calculated in relation to a reference price of 14 euros according to the following formula : Number of warrants = Amount of the tranche / (14 x m) with m = 3.4 for tranche 1 and 3.7 for tranche 2.The first tranche has a maturity of six years and is therefore repayable in December 2028. It carries a capitalized annual interest rate of 9.0% and the issuance of 126 050 warrants  each giving the right to subscribe to one ordinary share of AB Science at 8.61 euros for 15 years. These warrants represent 0.24% of the current capital of the Company (if they were to be exercised in their entirety).The EIB also has a put option at intrinsic value (i.e. the difference between the stock market price and the exercise price) allowing it to require the Company to repurchase all or part of the warrants then exercisable but not yet exercised  under certain circumstances (for example in the event of a change of control or at the reimbursement date of the first tranche). In addition  the Company has a right of first refusal to redeem any warrants offered for sale to a third party  subject to certain exceptions.On the basis of 126 050 new shares of the Company that could be issued upon exercise of all of these warrants  the Company could potentially receive gross proceeds amounting to 1 085 290 euros. There is no guarantee that the EIB will exercise all or part of the warrants or that the Company will receive any proceeds from the exercise of these warrants.[1]: Press release of November 30  2020About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

It will also allow both parties to maximise the full market potential of jefacture.com. This e-invoicing platform developed by Unifiedpost for ECMA enables French chartered accountants to help their clients in the transition towards mandatory B2B e-invoicing. Next to that  it facilitates the additional  direct market entry of the platform to tens of thousands of SMEs.As from 1 July 2024  all French companies should be able to receive e-invoices. This implies a significant implementation of calibrated technology by all businesses in order to comply with this VAT-based regulation. Already in 2020  ECMA therefore closed a partnership with Belgian listed e-invoicing provider Unifiedpost in order to provide French accountants with a platform to manage the e-invoicing flows of their clients. Today jefacture.com allows SMEs to dematerialize and route all purchase and sales invoices in Factur-X format and to integrate them in their management tools. In France  there are about 20.000 accountants serving 2 75 million of SMEs. More than 600 million B2B invoices are send out yearly in the country.Now this partnership is taken to the next level. As ECMA wants to invest heavily in the ongoing transformation and therefore wants to sustainable anchor the exploitation of jefacture.com  also to SMEs directly  the joint venture Facturel was created together with Unifiedpost.François Millo  Director of ECMA stated: ""Although mandatory e-invoicing will bring productivity gains for businesses  and in particular the smallest ones  it will nevertheless remain complex to implement. With jefacture.com  chartered accountants know that they can rely on a trusted e-invoicing platform in the context of this crucial reform. jefacture.com enables them to be at the heart of the invoicing flows  to assist their clients in passing this legislative milestone.”Hans Leybaert  CEO and founder of Unifiedpost Group stated: “Thanks to the joined expertise and experience of ECMA and Unifiedpost  accumulated by the jefacture.com platform since its launch in 2020  chartered accountants and companies have a functional and efficient tool that allows them to anticipate the transition to electronic invoicing without waiting until July 2024. With the creation of Facturel  we are sending a message to the market of a joint long-term collaboration. It shows the necessary commitment and allows the pooling of significant resources to meet the security requirements set by the public authorities.”<End>Investor Relations & MediaSarah Heuninck+32 491 15 05 09sarah.heuninck@unifiedpost.comFinancial Calendar 20236 March 2023 Publication FY 2022 Financial Results18 April 2023 Publication Annual Report 202216 May 2023 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders22 May 2023 Publication Q1 2023 Business Update29 August 2023 Publication H1 2023 Financial Results16 November 2023 Publication Q3 2023 Business UpdateAbout Unifiedpost GroupUnifiedpost is a leading cloud-based platform for SME business services built on “Documents”  “Identity” and “Payments”.

Current Chancellor …,After a jarring six months marked by sweeping policy promises  U-turns and four Chancellors of the Exchequer  UK financiers head into 2023 uncertain that the coming year will finally usher in substantive reforms to the City of London.Current Chancellor Jeremy Hunt promised in this month’s Edinburgh Reforms to “turbocharge growth” for the country’s banks  insurers and asset managers. But his program replaced more ambitious plans for a Big Bang 2  a reference to Margaret Thatcher’s revolutionary 1980s financial deregulation  leaving bankers wondering how radical the government will be this time.Some fear 2023 will be dominated by a tangle of reviews rather than action  despite the UK’s vote to leave the European Union being seven years ago. Brexit dividends may remain as unclear as they were in the aftermath of the referendum  they fear.UK’s Post-Brexit Financial Services Reforms Fall Short of Promised ‘Big Bang’Those concerns are overly pessimistic  and it is possible to discern an emerging plan for Britain’s financial services after years of wrangling about Brexit  according to Jonathan Hill  the former EU commissioner for financial services who completed a company listings review for the government.“After three wasted years  we have finally started to get a direction of travel ” Hill said. “It is a bit like a Pointillist painting. Up close it looks like lots of dots  but if you step back you can start to see a clearer picture emerging.”By next summer  supporters say  the UK could have modern company listings rules  guidelines for the crypto sector and one of the world’s most modern trading hubs. All could be overseen by regulators exercising a keen eye for opportunities to make the UK’s financial services more internationally competitive.It is time to be bold  according to Rachel Kent  a senior partner at law firm Hogan Lovells and chair of the International Regulatory Strategy Group  which looks at UK regulation. “Now is our chance ” she said. “This is a golden opportunity to get our rules right in the interests of the whole of the UK.”Reform PackageEven supporters agree the direction under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak isn’t revolutionary  but argue that changes coming through the Financial Services and Markets Bill and the 30-point plan announced in Edinburgh should help make London a more modern financial center  with rules tailored for the UK economy rather than what was a 28-country bloc.The two programs together offer a mix of legal changes and reviews  with topics ranging from relaxing EU Solvency II insurance capital standards and MiFID II markets regulations  to the securitization market and short-selling. The aim is to stimulate trading in London  and to encourage a multi-billion-pound inflow of pensions money and individuals’ savings into investments.If the hard work is done during 2023’s tough economic times  the UK could be in a strong position to attract international investment and company listings in 2024  according to Mike Coombes  vice president of corporate affairs at PrimaryBid Ltd.  a platform which provides retail investors with access to share sales.“By the end of next year  we could see a world where there are a significant number of IPOs coming down the line for 2024 that will include a retail offering ” Coombes said. “It could be a scenario where capital markets in the UK are starting to function quite efficiently  particularly if issuers can tap the over £300 billion ($364 billion) currently inactive in cash ISAs.”Intense CompetitionThat won’t be easy  according to skeptics who point to stiff competition from the US and Asia and a growing regulatory pull from Europe. Banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are continuing to move senior staff with EU roles inside the bloc  while London recently lost its crown as Europe’s biggest stock market to Paris.“London used to be the largest financial center of the European Union  and everybody liked it ” Stephane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer of European exchange Euronext said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “Today  London is the largest financial center of the United Kingdom.”UK Should Avoid Hasty Financial Services Reforms Following Brexit: LawmakersThe English capital is still a stronghold for international finance and well-positioned to lead the world in fintech and green finance  according to Nicholas Lyons  a veteran investment banker and insurance executive now serving as Lord Mayor of London  an ambassadorial role.But there also needs to be a shift in attitude  Lyons believes. Since the financial crisis  “the UK lost its competitive edge ” he told Bloomberg News in New York during a visit to promote London. “We need to reintroduce a celebration of wealth and jobs creators.”Political BattlesNot everyone agrees. The past few months have been characterized by running battles about the perceived risk of a bonfire of regulations  with critics accusing ministers of undermining regulators’ independence and wanting to dismantle safeguards put in place after 2008 to prevent future banking bailouts.Among the government’s more controversial proposals are a plan to water down the ring-fence that requires banks to separate capital for their high street lending operations and possibly easing penalties for senior executives when they make mistakes.The incoming requirement for regulators to consider the financial services sector’s international competitiveness as a secondary objective after stability and consumer protection is particularly problematic  according to John Vickers  warden of All Souls college at Oxford University and a former architect of Britain’s post-financial crisis reforms.Competitiveness objectives “tend to be vehicles for sectoral vested interests ” Vickers said. “In the case of financial services  sometimes the sector’s interests will be aligned with the rest of the country  and sometimes they will be opposed. The sector should not have privileged treatment relative to the rest of the economy.”Regulators’ RoleLeaving the EU gives regulators more scope to make rules that were previously overseen by European politicians. A debate about the best form of post-Brexit parliamentary oversight for the UK’s Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority descended into a row about a “call-in” power  that the government eventually dropped in the face of vocal opposition.Yet scrutiny is an important part of the setting the future agenda for the City of London  Hill said. “I don’t see how we can address that without looking at the role of the regulators and working out a system where both their independence and accountability are clear ” he said. Hill’s view is shared by others in the House of Lords  who want to ensure the accountability and competition provisions are not watered down further in finance bill before it becomes law next year.Brexit BeefAnother outstanding issue is the UK’s relationship with Europe. The City of London was sidelined for years after the Brexit referendum partly because of lingering public anger about the financial crisis and also because it was seen as a bastion of remainer sentiment.Sunak has denied a report he was exploring a Switzerland-style deal with the EU which would give greater access in return for adopting the bloc’s rules  but many in the City would like to see closer ties to ease the costs and logistics of maintaining large operations in the UK and on the Continent. Meanwhile  the EU still exerts sway as Brussels modernizes its rules to boost its own competitiveness  and the UK also has to contend with international regulations  such as the incoming Basel 3.1 banking capital rules.A big question for firms is whether Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s reforms — such as the plan to scrap the EU bankers’ bonus cap — will ever be enacted with the opposition Labour Party polling strongly and a general election required by law by January 2025.Whatever changes are ultimately enacted  their impact won’t be apparent immediately. The effect of Margaret Thatcher’s Big Bang reforms in turning London into an international finance center took time to crystallize  recalled Nigel Boardman  chairman of banking group Arbuthnot Latham and a former lawyer at Slaughter and May.“After Big Bang in 1986  I was on various panels that looked at which would be the dominant exchange in Europe ” Boardman said. “There was talk of Frankfurt  Paris and London.

UCART22 has been developed to potentially offer a therapeutic alternative for patients with r/r B-ALL  including patients that have relapsed from or unable to receive CD19-directed therapy. The ability to have our manufacturing completely in-house maximizes the chances that eligible patients can be treated without delay.” said Mark Frattini  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer at Cellectis.“This is a transformational step forward for Cellectis: our in-house manufacturing capabilities would allow us to move product candidates like UCART22 from R&D to development to a finished UCART product on a timeline that would not have been possible working with a contract manufacturer ” said Steven Doares  Senior Vice President  US Manufacturing & Raleigh Site Head. “We believe that having this capability in-house is a great competitive advantage as it would give us the ability to swiftly version our product candidates as we monitor clinical responses  resulting in what we expect to be the best product possible.”UCART22 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate that targets CD22 and is evaluated in the BALLI-01 clinical study  a Phase 1/2a open-label dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of the product candidate in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL).Three years ago  Cellectis made the decision to build its proprietary GMP manufacturing facilities in both Raleigh (North Carolina) and Paris to take control of its production and manufacturing timelines. Cellectis’ facilities are fully operational  showcasing the Company’s transformation into an end-to-end cell and gene therapy company  from discovery & product development  transfer  and cGMP manufacturing to clinical development.As of now  Cellectis is one of the few end-to-end gene editing  allogeneic CAR T-cell companies that control its gene and cell therapy process from start to finish.BALLI-01 is actively enrolling patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL.For more information  eligibility criteria and trial locations  please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04150497) or contact clinicaltrials@cellectis.comAbout Acute Lymphoblastic LeukemiaAcute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a cancer of the lymphoid line of blood cells characterized by the development of large numbers of immature lymphocytes.

Valneva is seeking approval of its investigational chikungunya vaccine in persons aged 18 years and above.This BLA application follows final pivotal Phase 3 data reported in March 20221 and final lot-to-lot consistency results reported in May 20222. A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents is ongoing in Brazil3  which may support future regulatory submissions in this group if VLA1553 is initially approved in adults. The Company also recently reported positive antibody persistence data with a 99% seroresponse rate 12 months after a single-dose vaccination4.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “The completion of our BLA submission is extremely important as it takes us a step closer to potentially bringing a preventative solution to fight this debilitating disease. Chikungunya is a major public health threat transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes  and no vaccine or specific treatments for the disease are currently available. If the FDA approves the submission  our goal is to provide a tool to help curtail this growing  unmet medical need.”The FDA will now review the filing for acceptance  determine priority review eligibility and the action date which it targets to complete its evaluation. The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020  and Valneva plans to make regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in Europe in the second half of 2023.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat. As of September 2020  there were more than 3 million reported cases in the Americas5 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after three to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. It is estimated that over three quarters of the world’s population live in areas at-risk of CHIKV transmission6. High risk areas of infection are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are currently endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia.Story continuesAbout VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 100 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 20227 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20228.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15539. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201910  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology  today announced that it has signed a contract to install a fully integrated X-ray irradiation solution at a customer’s new service center site in France. The solution includes an IBA Rhodotron®  a Beagle® process control system  a safety access system  an overhead conveyor for pallets and automated pallet storage. The value of the contract for IBA is estimated at around EUR 20 million and a downpayment has been received.This latest contract further highlights the significant growth of IBA’s Industrial Solutions division  which has had a strong 2022 and recently passed the milestone of EUR 100 million order intake to date. The deal comes in the context of evolving industrial market dynamics  particularly sterilization  which has seen its growth rate increase from 7 to 10% annually1. Currently around 90% of the sterilization industry relies on ethylene oxide and Gamma radiation  derived from Cobalt-60. Both modalities are facing issues in terms of supply pressures and shortages  with ethylene oxide also being impacted by toxicity issues.Market challenges with incumbent sterilization technology have highlighted the need for high-quality alternative solutions such as X-ray and electron beam sterilization. IBA is the only manufacturer able to offer both X-ray and electron beam sterilization via its Rhodotron®  which has the largest power range of any accelerator on the market. Avoiding the use of toxic chemicals and radioactive materials  IBA’s solutions are also significantly safer for the environment than the current standard.Thomas Servais  Vice President of IBA Industrial Solutions  commented: “This new contract underlines the continued growth of our sterilization solutions business  with order volumes up strongly in 2022. There is a clear opportunity for the future growth of IBA Industrial within the global sterilization landscape as we capitalize on the growth of the market and the need for an alternative  environmentally conscious solution to address the increasing demand.”Story continues***About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology. The company is the leading supplier of equipment and services in the field of proton therapy  considered to be the most advanced form of radiation therapy available today.

With Wolters Kluwer’s CCH® CPELink  completing CPE requirements has never been easier  even for the 40% of CPAs who wait to complete a large number of credits in the last few weeks or days of the calendar year.CCH CPELink offers anywhere  anytime access to hundreds of on-demand  virtual webinars and online self-study courses  led by industry experts. The tool’s most popular courses tend to focus on technical tax and accounting issues and tax updates; however  users can also gain CPE credits by completing courses that help them learn how to maximize the features and benefits of Wolters Kluwer software tools  like CCH™ Axcess  CCH™ AnswerConnect  and more. Courses can be purchased as part of an annual subscription  or on a standalone basis – per course  per user. In addition to being interactive  they’re mobile-friendly  too.In 2022  courses focusing on federal tax updates and changes to the IRS 1099 form ranked among CCH CPELink’s most popular CPE courses – with courses focused on fraud review and GAAP updates closely following.Dean Sonderegger  Senior Vice President  General Manager for Canada and Research & Learning  Wolters Kluwer Tax and Accounting North America  said:“Wolters Kluwer is committed to making it as easy and convenient as possible for tax and accounting professionals to fulfill their CPE requirements by providing on-demand access to the most accurate  up-to-date training in the industry. If you’re a tax and accounting professional who still has CPE credits complete this year – it’s not too late! With CCH CPELink  Wolters Kluwer has you covered  with anywhere  anytime access to all the CPE credits you need.”An annual survey of accounting firms conducted by Wolters Kluwer Research and Learning recently found that nearly 94% of accounting firms expect their usage of online learning tools to either remain steady or increase over the next several years. That high demand for online CPE tools is just one reason why Sonderegger says Wolters Kluwer’s commitment to online learning is stronger than ever. The company is investing in the development of new tools to drive greater engagement for learners and is adding more than 500 new CCH CPELink courses in 2023.“Our Research and Learning team is committed to partnering with customers to ensure that our CCH CPELink content is fresh  engaging  and focused on the trends and issues that are most important to tax and accounting professionals ” he continued. “We're committed to continually investing in the development of new tools that drive greater engagement for learners and a turnkey experience for firm administrators.”About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (WKL) is a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services for healthcare; tax and accounting; governance  risk  and compliance; and legal and regulatory sectors.

""These bonds are convertible at a 30% premium to the current market price  and redeemable in shares at a maximum discount of 15% to the current market price  with the possibility of cash redemption. These conversion conditions strongly limit the risk of dilution for shareholders.""Purpose of the issuance and use of proceedsThe gross proceeds of the transaction will amount to €12 million.The net proceeds of the issuance  amounting to €10.8 million  will be used by the Company to (i) repay the balance of the bond issue with Kreos Capital VI (UK) Limited (""Kreos"") of €4.4 million (of which €3.9 million in principal) and (ii) develop its portfolio of gene therapy products for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases of the retina and central nervous system  and in particular LUMEVOQ® until its possible launch in Europe  scheduled for late 2023.Story continuesIn accordance with the credit facility signed with the European Investment Bank (""EIB "") on November 3  20221 (the ""Finance Contract"")  the disbursement of the first tranche of €8 million by the EIB for the benefit of the Company (""Tranche A"") is subject to  among other conditions:the entry into of a warrant agreement with the EIB (the "" Warrant Agreement "") the issue of the warrants under Tranche A the full repayment of the balance of the financing with Kreos of €4.4 million (of which €3.9 million in principal) the successful production of an Engineering batch of LUMEVOQ ® (condition fulfilled on September 19  2022 2 ) the decision by the Company to launch the validation batch production campaign (the "" PPQ "") (condition met)  anda cash injection of €10 million  in the form of equity  convertible bonds (to the extent that their repayment would be subordinated to the EIB's debt under the terms of a subordination agreement to be entered into) or license revenues.Upon the closing of the Financing  the Company announced it will have satisfied the last condition of cash contribution.In addition  the Company announces that it has entered into the Warrant Agreement providing for the issue of Warrants to the benefit of the EIB (the ""Warrants"") pursuant to the Article L. 225-138 of the French commercial Code  in varied amounts according to the relevant tranche and the exercise price based on the market conditions applicable at the time of issue (the exercise price for each Warrant will be equal to 95% of the volume-weighted average price of the Company's ordinary shares over the last five trading days preceding the decision of the competent body of the Company to issue the Warrants). The Warrants will only be exercisable under the conditions described in the press release published by the Company on November 4  2022.3 If the Tranche A Warrants were issued today under the conditions currently proposed  the potential dilution represented by the underlying shares would be approximately 2.49% of the Company's current share capital.In order to benefit from the disbursement of Tranche A of €8 million  the Company must satisfy the following conditions:the issuance of the Tranche A Warrants to the benefit of the EIB  scheduled for January 2023  andthe repayment in full of the balance of the financing with Kreos of €4.4 million (of which €3.9 million in principal)  scheduled to be completed before the end of 2022.Working capital requirementTo date  the Company does not have sufficient net working capital to meet its obligations over the next 12 months. Before the completion of the Financing  the Company's net cash requirement is estimated at €28.1 million for the next twelve months.As at September 30  2022  the Company's available cash amounted to €13.9 million. After the completion of the Financing  the Company expects to be able to meet its obligations until April 2023.To finance the continuation of its activities necessary for its development over the next twelve months  the drawdown of Tranche A of the EIB  to be possible upon the closing of the Financing and expected in January 2023  as well as the drawdown of Tranche B  conditional on the success of the PPQ campaign and expected in Q2 2023  constitute the Company's preferred solution.For the 12-month period following the date of this press release  taking into account the anticipated net proceeds of the Financing of €10.8 million  the repayment of the bond issue with Kreos for €4.4 million (of which €3.9 million in principal) expected before the end of 2022 and the expected upcoming disbursement of Tranche A for €8.0 million  the Company has sufficient net working capital to meet its obligations until May 2023  and the net working capital requirement is estimated at €9.3 million  in light of the Company's need to finance its ongoing activities  including the preparation of the possible launch of LUMEVOQ® in Europe in late 2023. With the addition of €12 million from the EIB Tranche B  the Company could meet its obligations until early 2024. The Company expects to seek other sources of debt or equity financing starting in 2023 to supplement its working capital needs and finance its operating expenses for 2024.Terms and conditions of the issue of the NotesThe Board of directors of GenSight  using the delegation granted to it under the 24th resolution of the shareholders' Meeting held on May 25  2022  decided to proceed with the issuance  without preferential subscription rights for shareholders  of notes convertible into new shares (the ""Notes"") reserved to category of investors.The Financing will be represented by 120 Notes with a nominal value of €100 000 million each  representing gross proceeds of the issuance of €12 million. The Notes will be subscribed for by CVI Investment Inc.  an entity advised by Heights Capital.The settlement and delivery of the Notes and receipt of the funds is expected to occur on December 28  2022. No application will be made for the Notes to be admitted to trading on any market. However  any ordinary shares issued pursuant to the terms of the Notes will be listed on the same line as the Company’s existing shares (ISIN code FR0013183985).The issuance is not subject to a prospectus requiring a visa from the AMF (French financial market authority).The Company will regularly publish on its website the number of new shares issued pursuant to the terms of the Notes.The Company has entered into a subordination agreement with Heights and the EIB (the ""Subordination Agreement"")  pursuant to which the Company undertakes to repay its indebtedness to Heights  the junior debt holder under the Note issuance agreement  only after the EIB  the senior debt holder under the Finance Contract  has been fully repaid in accordance with the terms of the Subordination Agreement.Main characteristics of the NotesThe Company intends to issue the Notes on December 28  2022 (the ""Issue Date"") at an issue price of €90 000 per Note  for a period of five years  i.e. until December 28  2027 (the ""Maturity Date""). The Notes will not bear interest.The Notes may be converted into new ordinary shares of the Company exclusively at the option of the holder between the Issue Date and the Maturity Date. Initially  the Notes will entitle the holder  upon conversion  to a maximum of 22 884 new ordinary shares per Note  i.e. a conversion price of 4.37 euros per Note (the ""Initial Conversion Price"").The Initial Conversion Price corresponds to a premium of 30% on the volume-weighted average price of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris during the last trading session preceding the determination of the terms of issuance (the ""Reference Price"")  thus complying with the price limits set by the 24th resolution of the Company’s combined general shareholders’ meeting held on May 25  2022 (the volume-weighted average of the prices of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris during the last five trading sessions preceding the determination of the price  less a maximum discount of 15%  i.e. €3.07) (the ""Price Limit"") it being specified that the Price Limit may be modified at a future general Meeting.Starting six months after the Issue Date  the Notes will amortize quarterly in an amount of €5 263 per Note  payable either (i) in new ordinary shares issued at a 10% discount to the market value of the Company's shares at the time of amortization (it being specified that any payments in shares will be in accordance with the Price Limit) or (ii) at the Company's option  in cash at 110% of the amount to be amortized.The number of shares that may be issued under the Notes will be between 2 746 108 (in the event of conversion of all the Notes at the Initial Conversion Price) and 3 915 171 (in the event of amortization of all the Notes at the Price Limit)  subject to redemption exclusively in shares.In the event of a capital increase by the Company (excluding any offer reserved for employees) of at least €5 million within 12 months of the Issue Date  the conversion price shall be adjusted (but only if such adjusted price is lower than the Initial Conversion Price) to correspond to 130% of the price per share in this capital increase and the Reference Price  in respect of the Price Limit.On the date of the eighteenth anniversary of the Issue Date (the ""18-Month Reset Date"")  the conversion price shall be adjusted (but only if such adjusted price is lower than the conversion price without taking into account such adjustment) to correspond to the share price on the 18-Month Reset Date  it being specified that the conversion price so adjusted shall be at least equal to the Reference Price and the Price Limit; and it being further specified that the conversion price may be adjusted upwards if the volume-weighted average of at least 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days in the 12-month period following the 18-month Reset Date exceeds 150% of the Initial Conversion Price.In accordance with the terms of the Notes  customary events of default (including in the event of non-payment on a due date  breach of the terms and conditions  delisting or cessation of business) will give Heights an option to request the early redemption of the Notes in cash at an amount equal to 110% of the principal amount of Notes outstanding. The Company has also given certain customary undertakings (in particular  not to grant any security interests  other than certain customary exceptions in this respect  and not to offer any shares for 30 days following the Issue Date  subject in particular to the issuance of the Warrants to the EIB and certain customary exceptions in this regard).

The Company must now submit its responses in March 2023.Following the successful production in September of two Engineering batches incorporating adjustments to the LUMEVOQ® manufacturing process  GenSight initiated in December the production of a GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) batch  identical and under the same conditions as the validation campaign (3 PPQ batches) required for the registration of LUMEVOQ® in Europe.

The updated protocol will be submitted to study sites for subsequent Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Ethics Committees (EC) approval.In the Partial Clinical Hold (PCH) letter  the FDA requested changes to certain elements of the VITESSE protocol with the intent for the trial to support a Biologics License Application (BLA). The FDA communication contained four protocol modifications: the redefinition of the minimal daily wear time  the addition of a statistical test for the patch adhesion assessment  the reclassification of certain adverse events (AEs) to adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and an increase in the number of trial participants on active treatment.Key design elements of VITESSE such as inclusion criteria  primary efficacy endpoint  responder criteria  efficacy assessment methodology and safety endpoints were not impacted by the PCH letter and have not changed.“We are pleased that the FDA has lifted the partial clinical hold on the VITESSE study and anticipate initiating patient screening in Q1 2023 ” said Daniel Tassé  Chief Executive Officer of DBV Technologies. “I am proud of our team for continuing to advance important pre-study activities these last several weeks so that we are prepared to act quickly to re-launch VITESSE following today’s announcement.”Story continuesFollowing receipt of the PCH letter  DBV and the FDA discussed how VITESSE protocol modifications could best support the Agency’s review of a potential BLA for Viaskin Peanut as a peanut allergy treatment.In lifting the PCH  the FDA confirmed DBV satisfactorily addressed all clinical hold issues identified in the PCH letter. The FDA stated that DBV may proceed with VITESSE with the following changes included in the revised protocol:The updated VITESSE Instructions for Use (IFU) will direct caregivers to apply one patch at approximately the same time each day  following removal of the previous day’s patch. The updated IFU now outlines that Viaskin Peanut 250 µg is to be worn for as close to a full day as possible (i.e.  24 hours) with a minimum daily wear time of 20 hours each day.Patch adhesion will be assessed in VITESSE to affirm the modified Viaskin Peanut patch performs adequately  which aligns with existing regulatory requirements for patch-based therapies. In post-PCH discussions  DBV and the FDA agreed a statistical test of adhesion will be included in the VITESSE statistical analysis plan and further considered patch adhesion data collection and interpretation in the context of the novel nature of the Viaskin patch platform.Four AEs will be classified as AESIs. These AEs – which include AEs leading to inhaled or systemic corticosteroid or epinephrine use  systemic allergic reactions  and Grade 4 local application site (skin) reactions – were collected and assessed in all previous Viaskin Peanut trials and included in the previous VITESSE protocol. Only the classification of these AEs has changed.DBV plans to initiate a separate safety study in approximately 275 additional subjects  randomized 3:1 active versus placebo. The additional safety data generated by this six-month study will supplement the safety data generated by the VITESSE trial  resulting in a safety database comprised of approximately 600 children ages 4 to 7 years treated with Viaskin Peanut. The protocol design of the safety study will be submitted to the FDA and is expected to be similar to the REALISE ( REA L L i fe Use and S afety of E PIT) safety study that DBV previously conducted with Viaskin Peanut in children ages 4 to 11 years.The Company does not expect the additional safety study to have an impact on the Company’s cash runway guidance as DBV had included a provision for a possible supplemental safety trial in its cash runway assumptions. The Company reiterates that cash on-hand is sufficient to fund operations through VITESSE topline data.“Following a very productive dialogue with the FDA  we have incorporated the Agency’s modifications to VITESSE into the study protocol and look forward to initiating patient treatments ” said Dr. Pharis Mohideen  Chief Medical Officer of DBV Technologies. “I am confident that the VITESSE study  when completed  will add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the ability of our novel drug-device immunotherapy platform  Viaskin Peanut  to address significant unmet needs among peanut-allergic children and their families.”DBV anticipates initiating VITESSE patient screening in the first quarter of 2023 with the last patient screened in 1H 2024 and topline results anticipated in 1H 2025.About VITESSEThe VITESSE trial will enroll 600 subjects  randomized 2:1 active versus placebo. The study will involve approximately 80 trial sites across the United States  Canada  Australia and Europe. Dr. David Fleischer  Children’s Hospital Colorado  will act as the principal investigator.The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of treatment responders in the active versus placebo arms at Month 12. The primary efficacy analysis includes the success criterion of a lower bound of the confidence interval of the difference in responder rates between active and placebo groups being greater than or equal to 15%.A treatment responder is defined as either a subject with a baseline eliciting dose (ED) ≤30 mg who reaches an ED ≥300 mg of peanut protein at Month 12  or a subject with a baseline ED = 100 mg who reaches an ED ≥600 mg of peanut protein at Month 12. A double-blind  placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) will be administered at baseline and Month 12 to determine a subject’s ED at both timepoints.During the screening period  subjects will undergo an initial visit with assessment for eligibility according to peanut skin prick test (SPT) and serum peanut IgE. Those meeting these criteria will proceed to a DBPCFC to confirm their peanut allergy and establish an entry peanut ED. The entry DBPCFC will be 1 mg peanut protein  and will escalate up to a highest single dose of 100 mg peanut protein. Subjects who react with an ED at or below the dose of 100 mg peanut protein are considered eligible. At Month 12  a post-treatment DBPCFC will be performed  with a starting dose of 3 mg peanut protein  escalating to a highest dose of 1 000 mg peanut protein according to the following schedule: 3  10  30  100  300  600  1 000 mg. Secondary efficacy endpoints include changes in Cumulative Reactive Dose  ED and severity of allergic reaction at Month 12 food challenge.About DBV TechnologiesDBV Technologies is developing Viaskin™  an investigational proprietary technology platform with broad potential applications in immunotherapy.

Valneva is seeking approval of its investigational chikungunya vaccine in persons aged 18 years and above.This BLA application follows final pivotal Phase 3 data reported in March 20221 and final lot-to-lot consistency results reported in May 20222. A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents is ongoing in Brazil3  which may support future regulatory submissions in this group if VLA1553 is initially approved in adults. The Company also recently reported positive antibody persistence data with a 99% seroresponse rate 12 months after a single-dose vaccination4.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “The completion of our BLA submission is extremely important as it takes us a step closer to potentially bringing a preventative solution to fight this debilitating disease. Chikungunya is a major public health threat transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes  and no vaccine or specific treatments for the disease are currently available. If the FDA approves the submission  our goal is to provide a tool to help curtail this growing  unmet medical need.”The FDA will now review the filing for acceptance  determine priority review eligibility and the action date which it targets to complete its evaluation. The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020  and Valneva plans to make regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in Europe in the second half of 2023.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat. As of September 2020  there were more than 3 million reported cases in the Americas5 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after three to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. It is estimated that over three quarters of the world’s population live in areas at-risk of CHIKV transmission6. High risk areas of infection are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are currently endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 100 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 20227 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20228.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15539. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201910  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to successfully commercialize two vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease  the chikungunya virus and COVID-19.Media & Investor ContactsLaëtitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to regulatory approval of VLA1553  timing and plans for clinical programs and product candidates and revenue forecasts.

With Wolters Kluwer’s CCH® CPELink  completing CPE requirements has never been easier  even for the 40% of CPAs who wait to complete a large number of credits in the last few weeks or days of the calendar year.CCH CPELink offers anywhere  anytime access to hundreds of on-demand  virtual webinars and online self-study courses  led by industry experts. The tool’s most popular courses tend to focus on technical tax and accounting issues and tax updates; however  users can also gain CPE credits by completing courses that help them learn how to maximize the features and benefits of Wolters Kluwer software tools  like CCH™ Axcess  CCH™ AnswerConnect  and more. Courses can be purchased as part of an annual subscription  or on a standalone basis – per course  per user. In addition to being interactive  they’re mobile-friendly  too.In 2022  courses focusing on federal tax updates and changes to the IRS 1099 form ranked among CCH CPELink’s most popular CPE courses – with courses focused on fraud review and GAAP updates closely following.Dean Sonderegger  Senior Vice President  General Manager for Canada and Research & Learning  Wolters Kluwer Tax and Accounting North America  said:“Wolters Kluwer is committed to making it as easy and convenient as possible for tax and accounting professionals to fulfill their CPE requirements by providing on-demand access to the most accurate  up-to-date training in the industry. If you’re a tax and accounting professional who still has CPE credits complete this year – it’s not too late! With CCH CPELink  Wolters Kluwer has you covered  with anywhere  anytime access to all the CPE credits you need.”An annual survey of accounting firms conducted by Wolters Kluwer Research and Learning recently found that nearly 94% of accounting firms expect their usage of online learning tools to either remain steady or increase over the next several years. That high demand for online CPE tools is just one reason why Sonderegger says Wolters Kluwer’s commitment to online learning is stronger than ever. The company is investing in the development of new tools to drive greater engagement for learners and is adding more than 500 new CCH CPELink courses in 2023.“Our Research and Learning team is committed to partnering with customers to ensure that our CCH CPELink content is fresh  engaging  and focused on the trends and issues that are most important to tax and accounting professionals ” he continued. “We're committed to continually investing in the development of new tools that drive greater engagement for learners and a turnkey experience for firm administrators.”About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (WKL) is a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services for healthcare; tax and accounting; governance  risk  and compliance; and legal and regulatory sectors.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER OF ANY OF THE SECURITIES DESCRIBED HEREIN.Aberdeen  21st December 2022Reference is made to the stock exchange release from Awilco Drilling Plc (“Awilco Drilling” or the “Company”) (Euronext Growth: AWDR) published on 21st December 2021 regarding a contemplated private placement of new Sponsored Norwegian Depository Receipts in the Company up to NOK 78 million (equivalent to USD 8 million) in gross proceeds (the “Private Placement”)The Company is pleased to announce that the Private Placement has been successfully completed  raising gross proceeds of c. NOK 78 million  equivalent to c. USD 8 million  by allocation of 3 922 880 new Sponsored Norwegian Depository Receipts (the “Offer Shares”) in the Private Placement at a price per Offer Share of NOK 20 (the “Offer Price”).The Private Placement took place through an accelerated bookbuilding process managed by Clarksons Securities AS as Sole Manager and Bookrunner (the “Manager”) after close of markets on 21 December 2021.The net proceeds from the Private Placement will be used to partly finance Awilco Drillings' two arbitration cases against Keppel FELS Limited to their conclusions which are expected to take place no earlier than 2Q 2023 and 4Q 2023 for the two rigs.Existing shareholders were allocated in total 3 785 060 Offer Shares amounting to the total of c. NOK 75.7 million (equivalent to USD 7.7 million).Notices of allocation of Offer Shares and payment instructions are expected to be distributed to the investors in the Private Placement through a notification from the Manager on 22nd December 2022 (T) (the ""Notification""). Any further settlement details will be stated in the Notification. The Offer Shares will be tradable upon allocation. The Offer Shares will be tradable upon allocation. Settlement of the Offer Shares is expected to take place on a delivery versus payment (DVP) basis on or about 28th December 2022 (the “Settlement Date”). The DvP settlement structure is facilitated by a pre-payment agreement (the “Pre-Payment Agreement”) between the Company and the Manager.Completion of the Private Placement is subject to  inter alia  the Pre-Payment Agreement remaining unmodified and in full force and effect and the Offer Shares having been fully paid and legally issued and delivered in VPS.Following the completion of the Private Placement  the Company will have a share capital of GBP 2 904 651.75 divided into 4 468 695 shares  each with a nominal value of GBP 0.65.The Company has considered the Private Placement in light of the equal treatment obligations under the rules on equal treatment under Euronext Growth Rule Book II and Oslo Børs' Guidelines for equal treatment  and is of the opinion that the Private Placement is in compliance with these requirements. The Company is in urgent need of new capital  and the delays involved in conducting a rights offering would have leaved the Company without the required funding for a sustained period. Further  the Board intends to carry out the Subsequent Offering (as defined below) following completion of the Private Placement that  if carried out  is expected to allow existing shareholders who are not offered to participate in the Private Placement the opportunity to maintain their pro rata ownership. As a consequence of the Private Placement structure  the shareholders' preferential rights to subscribe for the Offer Shares have been deviated from.The Board of Directors intends to conduct  subject to completion of the Private Placement and certain other conditions  a subsequent offering of new Sponsored Norwegian Depository Receipts raising gross proceeds of the NOK equivalent of up to USD 2 million at the same subscription price as the Offer Price in the Private Placement to existing shareholders in the Company as of 21st December 2022 (as registered in the VPS two trading days thereafter) who were not offered Offer Shares in the Private Placement and are not resident in a jurisdiction where such offering would be unlawful or would (in jurisdictions other than Norway) require any prospectus  filing  registration or similar action (the “Subsequent Offering”). Non-tradable subscription rights will be awarded. Completion of a Subsequent Offering is subject to approval by the Board  and the Board may at its discretion decide not to proceed with or cancel any Subsequent Offering. The subsequent offering is expected to be fully guaranteed by Awilhelmsen Offshore AS and QVT Family Office Fund LP. The Company reserves the right  in its sole discretion  to cancel the Subsequent Offering.A separate stock exchange notice will be made on key information for the Subsequent Offering.Advokatfirmaet Wiersholm AS is acting as Norwegian legal counsel to Awilco Drilling.For further information about the Private Placement please contact:Erik Jacobs  CEO of Awilco Drilling; Tel: +44 1224 737900Cathrine Haavind  Investor Relations of Awilco Drilling; Tel: +47 93 42 84 64  ch@awilcodrilling.comThe information in this announcement is considered to be inside information pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation for Awilco Drilling.

The updated protocol will be submitted to study sites for subsequent Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Ethics Committees (EC) approval.In the Partial Clinical Hold (PCH) letter  the FDA requested changes to certain elements of the VITESSE protocol with the intent for the trial to support a Biologics License Application (BLA). The FDA communication contained four protocol modifications: the redefinition of the minimal daily wear time  the addition of a statistical test for the patch adhesion assessment  the reclassification of certain adverse events (AEs) to adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and an increase in the number of trial participants on active treatment.Key design elements of VITESSE such as inclusion criteria  primary efficacy endpoint  responder criteria  efficacy assessment methodology and safety endpoints were not impacted by the PCH letter and have not changed.“We are pleased that the FDA has lifted the partial clinical hold on the VITESSE study and anticipate initiating patient screening in Q1 2023 ” said Daniel Tassé  Chief Executive Officer of DBV Technologies. “I am proud of our team for continuing to advance important pre-study activities these last several weeks so that we are prepared to act quickly to re-launch VITESSE following today’s announcement.”Following receipt of the PCH letter  DBV and the FDA discussed how VITESSE protocol modifications could best support the Agency’s review of a potential BLA for Viaskin Peanut as a peanut allergy treatment.In lifting the PCH  the FDA confirmed DBV satisfactorily addressed all clinical hold issues identified in the PCH letter. The FDA stated that DBV may proceed with VITESSE with the following changes included in the revised protocol:The updated VITESSE Instructions for Use (IFU) will direct caregivers to apply one patch at approximately the same time each day  following removal of the previous day’s patch. The updated IFU now outlines that Viaskin Peanut 250 µg is to be worn for as close to a full day as possible (i.e.  24 hours) with a minimum daily wear time of 20 hours each day.Patch adhesion will be assessed in VITESSE to affirm the modified Viaskin Peanut patch performs adequately  which aligns with existing regulatory requirements for patch-based therapies. In post-PCH discussions  DBV and the FDA agreed a statistical test of adhesion will be included in the VITESSE statistical analysis plan and further considered patch adhesion data collection and interpretation in the context of the novel nature of the Viaskin patch platform.Four AEs will be classified as AESIs. These AEs – which include AEs leading to inhaled or systemic corticosteroid or epinephrine use  systemic allergic reactions  and Grade 4 local application site (skin) reactions – were collected and assessed in all previous Viaskin Peanut trials and included in the previous VITESSE protocol. Only the classification of these AEs has changed.DBV plans to initiate a separate safety study in approximately 275 additional subjects  randomized 3:1 active versus placebo. The additional safety data generated by this six-month study will supplement the safety data generated by the VITESSE trial  resulting in a safety database comprised of approximately 600 children ages 4 to 7 years treated with Viaskin Peanut. The protocol design of the safety study will be submitted to the FDA and is expected to be similar to the REALISE ( REA L L i fe Use and S afety of E PIT) safety study that DBV previously conducted with Viaskin Peanut in children ages 4 to 11 years.The Company does not expect the additional safety study to have an impact on the Company’s cash runway guidance as DBV had included a provision for a possible supplemental safety trial in its cash runway assumptions. The Company reiterates that cash on-hand is sufficient to fund operations through VITESSE topline data.“Following a very productive dialogue with the FDA  we have incorporated the Agency’s modifications to VITESSE into the study protocol and look forward to initiating patient treatments ” said Dr. Pharis Mohideen  Chief Medical Officer of DBV Technologies. “I am confident that the VITESSE study  when completed  will add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the ability of our novel drug-device immunotherapy platform  Viaskin Peanut  to address significant unmet needs among peanut-allergic children and their families.”DBV anticipates initiating VITESSE patient screening in the first quarter of 2023 with the last patient screened in 1H 2024 and topline results anticipated in 1H 2025.About VITESSEThe VITESSE trial will enroll 600 subjects  randomized 2:1 active versus placebo. The study will involve approximately 80 trial sites across the United States  Canada  Australia and Europe. Dr. David Fleischer  Children’s Hospital Colorado  will act as the principal investigator.The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of treatment responders in the active versus placebo arms at Month 12. The primary efficacy analysis includes the success criterion of a lower bound of the confidence interval of the difference in responder rates between active and placebo groups being greater than or equal to 15%.A treatment responder is defined as either a subject with a baseline eliciting dose (ED) ≤30 mg who reaches an ED ≥300 mg of peanut protein at Month 12  or a subject with a baseline ED = 100 mg who reaches an ED ≥600 mg of peanut protein at Month 12. A double-blind  placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) will be administered at baseline and Month 12 to determine a subject’s ED at both timepoints.During the screening period  subjects will undergo an initial visit with assessment for eligibility according to peanut skin prick test (SPT) and serum peanut IgE. Those meeting these criteria will proceed to a DBPCFC to confirm their peanut allergy and establish an entry peanut ED. The entry DBPCFC will be 1 mg peanut protein  and will escalate up to a highest single dose of 100 mg peanut protein. Subjects who react with an ED at or below the dose of 100 mg peanut protein are considered eligible. At Month 12  a post-treatment DBPCFC will be performed  with a starting dose of 3 mg peanut protein  escalating to a highest dose of 1 000 mg peanut protein according to the following schedule: 3  10  30  100  300  600  1 000 mg. Secondary efficacy endpoints include changes in Cumulative Reactive Dose  ED and severity of allergic reaction at Month 12 food challenge.About DBV TechnologiesDBV Technologies is developing Viaskin™  an investigational proprietary technology platform with broad potential applications in immunotherapy.

The updated protocol will be submitted to study sites for subsequent Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Ethics Committees (EC) approval.In the Partial Clinical Hold (PCH) letter  the FDA requested changes to certain elements of the VITESSE protocol with the intent for the trial to support a Biologics License Application (BLA). The FDA communication contained four protocol modifications: the redefinition of the minimal daily wear time  the addition of a statistical test for the patch adhesion assessment  the reclassification of certain adverse events (AEs) to adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and an increase in the number of trial participants on active treatment.Key design elements of VITESSE such as inclusion criteria  primary efficacy endpoint  responder criteria  efficacy assessment methodology and safety endpoints were not impacted by the PCH letter and have not changed.“We are pleased that the FDA has lifted the partial clinical hold on the VITESSE study and anticipate initiating patient screening in Q1 2023 ” said Daniel Tassé  Chief Executive Officer of DBV Technologies. “I am proud of our team for continuing to advance important pre-study activities these last several weeks so that we are prepared to act quickly to re-launch VITESSE following today’s announcement.”Following receipt of the PCH letter  DBV and the FDA discussed how VITESSE protocol modifications could best support the Agency’s review of a potential BLA for Viaskin Peanut as a peanut allergy treatment.In lifting the PCH  the FDA confirmed DBV satisfactorily addressed all clinical hold issues identified in the PCH letter. The FDA stated that DBV may proceed with VITESSE with the following changes included in the revised protocol:The updated VITESSE Instructions for Use (IFU) will direct caregivers to apply one patch at approximately the same time each day  following removal of the previous day’s patch. The updated IFU now outlines that Viaskin Peanut 250 µg is to be worn for as close to a full day as possible (i.e.  24 hours) with a minimum daily wear time of 20 hours each day.Patch adhesion will be assessed in VITESSE to affirm the modified Viaskin Peanut patch performs adequately  which aligns with existing regulatory requirements for patch-based therapies. In post-PCH discussions  DBV and the FDA agreed a statistical test of adhesion will be included in the VITESSE statistical analysis plan and further considered patch adhesion data collection and interpretation in the context of the novel nature of the Viaskin patch platform.Four AEs will be classified as AESIs. These AEs – which include AEs leading to inhaled or systemic corticosteroid or epinephrine use  systemic allergic reactions  and Grade 4 local application site (skin) reactions – were collected and assessed in all previous Viaskin Peanut trials and included in the previous VITESSE protocol. Only the classification of these AEs has changed.DBV plans to initiate a separate safety study in approximately 275 additional subjects  randomized 3:1 active versus placebo. The additional safety data generated by this six-month study will supplement the safety data generated by the VITESSE trial  resulting in a safety database comprised of approximately 600 children ages 4 to 7 years treated with Viaskin Peanut. The protocol design of the safety study will be submitted to the FDA and is expected to be similar to the REALISE ( REA L L i fe Use and S afety of E PIT) safety study that DBV previously conducted with Viaskin Peanut in children ages 4 to 11 years.The Company does not expect the additional safety study to have an impact on the Company’s cash runway guidance as DBV had included a provision for a possible supplemental safety trial in its cash runway assumptions. The Company reiterates that cash on-hand is sufficient to fund operations through VITESSE topline data.“Following a very productive dialogue with the FDA  we have incorporated the Agency’s modifications to VITESSE into the study protocol and look forward to initiating patient treatments ” said Dr. Pharis Mohideen  Chief Medical Officer of DBV Technologies. “I am confident that the VITESSE study  when completed  will add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the ability of our novel drug-device immunotherapy platform  Viaskin Peanut  to address significant unmet needs among peanut-allergic children and their families.”DBV anticipates initiating VITESSE patient screening in the first quarter of 2023 with the last patient screened in 1H 2024 and topline results anticipated in 1H 2025.About VITESSEThe VITESSE trial will enroll 600 subjects  randomized 2:1 active versus placebo. The study will involve approximately 80 trial sites across the United States  Canada  Australia and Europe. Dr. David Fleischer  Children’s Hospital Colorado  will act as the principal investigator.The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of treatment responders in the active versus placebo arms at Month 12. The primary efficacy analysis includes the success criterion of a lower bound of the confidence interval of the difference in responder rates between active and placebo groups being greater than or equal to 15%.A treatment responder is defined as either a subject with a baseline eliciting dose (ED) ≤30 mg who reaches an ED ≥300 mg of peanut protein at Month 12  or a subject with a baseline ED = 100 mg who reaches an ED ≥600 mg of peanut protein at Month 12. A double-blind  placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) will be administered at baseline and Month 12 to determine a subject’s ED at both timepoints.During the screening period  subjects will undergo an initial visit with assessment for eligibility according to peanut skin prick test (SPT) and serum peanut IgE. Those meeting these criteria will proceed to a DBPCFC to confirm their peanut allergy and establish an entry peanut ED. The entry DBPCFC will be 1 mg peanut protein  and will escalate up to a highest single dose of 100 mg peanut protein. Subjects who react with an ED at or below the dose of 100 mg peanut protein are considered eligible. At Month 12  a post-treatment DBPCFC will be performed  with a starting dose of 3 mg peanut protein  escalating to a highest dose of 1 000 mg peanut protein according to the following schedule: 3  10  30  100  300  600  1 000 mg. Secondary efficacy endpoints include changes in Cumulative Reactive Dose  ED and severity of allergic reaction at Month 12 food challenge.About DBV TechnologiesDBV Technologies is developing Viaskin™  an investigational proprietary technology platform with broad potential applications in immunotherapy.
