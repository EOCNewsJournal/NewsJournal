Valneva is seeking approval of its investigational chikungunya vaccine in persons aged 18 years and above.This BLA application follows final pivotal Phase 3 data reported in March 20221 and final lot-to-lot consistency results reported in May 20222. A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents is ongoing in Brazil3  which may support future regulatory submissions in this group if VLA1553 is initially approved in adults. The Company also recently reported positive antibody persistence data with a 99% seroresponse rate 12 months after a single-dose vaccination4.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “The completion of our BLA submission is extremely important as it takes us a step closer to potentially bringing a preventative solution to fight this debilitating disease. Chikungunya is a major public health threat transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes  and no vaccine or specific treatments for the disease are currently available. If the FDA approves the submission  our goal is to provide a tool to help curtail this growing  unmet medical need.”The FDA will now review the filing for acceptance  determine priority review eligibility and the action date which it targets to complete its evaluation. The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020  and Valneva plans to make regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in Europe in the second half of 2023.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat. As of September 2020  there were more than 3 million reported cases in the Americas5 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after three to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. It is estimated that over three quarters of the world’s population live in areas at-risk of CHIKV transmission6. High risk areas of infection are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are currently endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia.Story continuesAbout VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 100 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 20227 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20228.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15539. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201910  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to successfully commercialize two vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease  the chikungunya virus and COVID-19.Media & Investor ContactsLaëtitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to regulatory approval of VLA1553  timing and plans for clinical programs and product candidates and revenue forecasts.

With Wolters Kluwer’s CCH® CPELink  completing CPE requirements has never been easier  even for the 40% of CPAs who wait to complete a large number of credits in the last few weeks or days of the calendar year.CCH CPELink offers anywhere  anytime access to hundreds of on-demand  virtual webinars and online self-study courses  led by industry experts.

Courses can be purchased as part of an annual subscription  or on a standalone basis – per course  per user.

The Warrants will only be exercisable under the conditions described in the press release published by the Company on November 4  2022.3 If the Tranche A Warrants were issued today under the conditions currently proposed  the potential dilution represented by the underlying shares would be approximately 2.49% of the Company's current share capital.In order to benefit from the disbursement of Tranche A of €8 million  the Company must satisfy the following conditions:the issuance of the Tranche A Warrants to the benefit of the EIB  scheduled for January 2023  andthe repayment in full of the balance of the financing with Kreos of €4.4 million (of which €3.9 million in principal)  scheduled to be completed before the end of 2022.Working capital requirementTo date  the Company does not have sufficient net working capital to meet its obligations over the next 12 months. Before the completion of the Financing  the Company's net cash requirement is estimated at €28.1 million for the next twelve months.As at September 30  2022  the Company's available cash amounted to €13.9 million. After the completion of the Financing  the Company expects to be able to meet its obligations until April 2023.To finance the continuation of its activities necessary for its development over the next twelve months  the drawdown of Tranche A of the EIB  to be possible upon the closing of the Financing and expected in January 2023  as well as the drawdown of Tranche B  conditional on the success of the PPQ campaign and expected in Q2 2023  constitute the Company's preferred solution.For the 12-month period following the date of this press release  taking into account the anticipated net proceeds of the Financing of €10.8 million  the repayment of the bond issue with Kreos for €4.4 million (of which €3.9 million in principal) expected before the end of 2022 and the expected upcoming disbursement of Tranche A for €8.0 million  the Company has sufficient net working capital to meet its obligations until May 2023  and the net working capital requirement is estimated at €9.3 million  in light of the Company's need to finance its ongoing activities  including the preparation of the possible launch of LUMEVOQ® in Europe in late 2023. With the addition of €12 million from the EIB Tranche B  the Company could meet its obligations until early 2024. The Company expects to seek other sources of debt or equity financing starting in 2023 to supplement its working capital needs and finance its operating expenses for 2024.Terms and conditions of the issue of the NotesThe Board of directors of GenSight  using the delegation granted to it under the 24th resolution of the shareholders' Meeting held on May 25  2022  decided to proceed with the issuance  without preferential subscription rights for shareholders  of notes convertible into new shares (the ""Notes"") reserved to category of investors.The Financing will be represented by 120 Notes with a nominal value of €100 000 million each  representing gross proceeds of the issuance of €12 million. The Notes will be subscribed for by CVI Investment Inc.  an entity advised by Heights Capital.The settlement and delivery of the Notes and receipt of the funds is expected to occur on December 28  2022. No application will be made for the Notes to be admitted to trading on any market. However  any ordinary shares issued pursuant to the terms of the Notes will be listed on the same line as the Company’s existing shares (ISIN code FR0013183985).The issuance is not subject to a prospectus requiring a visa from the AMF (French financial market authority).The Company will regularly publish on its website the number of new shares issued pursuant to the terms of the Notes.The Company has entered into a subordination agreement with Heights and the EIB (the ""Subordination Agreement"")  pursuant to which the Company undertakes to repay its indebtedness to Heights  the junior debt holder under the Note issuance agreement  only after the EIB  the senior debt holder under the Finance Contract  has been fully repaid in accordance with the terms of the Subordination Agreement.Main characteristics of the NotesThe Company intends to issue the Notes on December 28  2022 (the ""Issue Date"") at an issue price of €90 000 per Note  for a period of five years  i.e. until December 28  2027 (the ""Maturity Date""). The Notes will not bear interest.The Notes may be converted into new ordinary shares of the Company exclusively at the option of the holder between the Issue Date and the Maturity Date. Initially  the Notes will entitle the holder  upon conversion  to a maximum of 22 884 new ordinary shares per Note  i.e. a conversion price of 4.37 euros per Note (the ""Initial Conversion Price"").The Initial Conversion Price corresponds to a premium of 30% on the volume-weighted average price of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris during the last trading session preceding the determination of the terms of issuance (the ""Reference Price"")  thus complying with the price limits set by the 24th resolution of the Company’s combined general shareholders’ meeting held on May 25  2022 (the volume-weighted average of the prices of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris during the last five trading sessions preceding the determination of the price  less a maximum discount of 15%  i.e. €3.07) (the ""Price Limit"") it being specified that the Price Limit may be modified at a future general Meeting.Starting six months after the Issue Date  the Notes will amortize quarterly in an amount of €5 263 per Note  payable either (i) in new ordinary shares issued at a 10% discount to the market value of the Company's shares at the time of amortization (it being specified that any payments in shares will be in accordance with the Price Limit) or (ii) at the Company's option  in cash at 110% of the amount to be amortized.The number of shares that may be issued under the Notes will be between 2 746 108 (in the event of conversion of all the Notes at the Initial Conversion Price) and 3 915 171 (in the event of amortization of all the Notes at the Price Limit)  subject to redemption exclusively in shares.In the event of a capital increase by the Company (excluding any offer reserved for employees) of at least €5 million within 12 months of the Issue Date  the conversion price shall be adjusted (but only if such adjusted price is lower than the Initial Conversion Price) to correspond to 130% of the price per share in this capital increase and the Reference Price  in respect of the Price Limit.On the date of the eighteenth anniversary of the Issue Date (the ""18-Month Reset Date"")  the conversion price shall be adjusted (but only if such adjusted price is lower than the conversion price without taking into account such adjustment) to correspond to the share price on the 18-Month Reset Date  it being specified that the conversion price so adjusted shall be at least equal to the Reference Price and the Price Limit; and it being further specified that the conversion price may be adjusted upwards if the volume-weighted average of at least 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days in the 12-month period following the 18-month Reset Date exceeds 150% of the Initial Conversion Price.In accordance with the terms of the Notes  customary events of default (including in the event of non-payment on a due date  breach of the terms and conditions  delisting or cessation of business) will give Heights an option to request the early redemption of the Notes in cash at an amount equal to 110% of the principal amount of Notes outstanding.

15414,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dbv-technologies-announces-fda-lifted-063000565.html,DBV Technologies Announces FDA Has Lifted Partial Clinical Hold on VITESSE Phase 3 Pivotal Trial,Montrouge  France  December 23  2022 DBV Technologies Announces FDA Has Lifted Partial Clinical Hold on VITESSE Phase 3 Pivotal Trial DBV expects to initiate...,DBV Technologies S.A.Montrouge  France  December 23  2022DBV Technologies Announces FDA Has Lifted Partial Clinical Hold on VITESSE Phase 3 Pivotal TrialDBV expects to initiate patient screening in Q1 2023 with the last patient screened by 1H 2024 and topline results anticipated in 1H 2025Company reiterates that cash on-hand is sufficient to fund operations through VITESSE topline dataDBV Technologies (Euronext: DBV – ISIN: FR0010417345 – Nasdaq Stock Market: DBVT)  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company  today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has lifted the partial clinical hold on the Company’s VITESSE ( V i askin Peanut I mmunotherapy T rial to E valuate S afety  S implicity and E fficacy) Phase 3 clinical trial that will evaluate the modified Viaskin™ Peanut 250 μg patch (DBV712) in peanut-allergic children ages 4 to 7 years. The updated protocol will be submitted to study sites for subsequent Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Ethics Committees (EC) approval.In the Partial Clinical Hold (PCH) letter  the FDA requested changes to certain elements of the VITESSE protocol with the intent for the trial to support a Biologics License Application (BLA). The FDA communication contained four protocol modifications: the redefinition of the minimal daily wear time  the addition of a statistical test for the patch adhesion assessment  the reclassification of certain adverse events (AEs) to adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and an increase in the number of trial participants on active treatment.Key design elements of VITESSE such as inclusion criteria  primary efficacy endpoint  responder criteria  efficacy assessment methodology and safety endpoints were not impacted by the PCH letter and have not changed.“We are pleased that the FDA has lifted the partial clinical hold on the VITESSE study and anticipate initiating patient screening in Q1 2023 ” said Daniel Tassé  Chief Executive Officer of DBV Technologies. “I am proud of our team for continuing to advance important pre-study activities these last several weeks so that we are prepared to act quickly to re-launch VITESSE following today’s announcement.”Story continuesFollowing receipt of the PCH letter  DBV and the FDA discussed how VITESSE protocol modifications could best support the Agency’s review of a potential BLA for Viaskin Peanut as a peanut allergy treatment.In lifting the PCH  the FDA confirmed DBV satisfactorily addressed all clinical hold issues identified in the PCH letter. The FDA stated that DBV may proceed with VITESSE with the following changes included in the revised protocol:The updated VITESSE Instructions for Use (IFU) will direct caregivers to apply one patch at approximately the same time each day  following removal of the previous day’s patch. The updated IFU now outlines that Viaskin Peanut 250 µg is to be worn for as close to a full day as possible (i.e.  24 hours) with a minimum daily wear time of 20 hours each day.Patch adhesion will be assessed in VITESSE to affirm the modified Viaskin Peanut patch performs adequately  which aligns with existing regulatory requirements for patch-based therapies. In post-PCH discussions  DBV and the FDA agreed a statistical test of adhesion will be included in the VITESSE statistical analysis plan and further considered patch adhesion data collection and interpretation in the context of the novel nature of the Viaskin patch platform.Four AEs will be classified as AESIs. These AEs – which include AEs leading to inhaled or systemic corticosteroid or epinephrine use  systemic allergic reactions  and Grade 4 local application site (skin) reactions – were collected and assessed in all previous Viaskin Peanut trials and included in the previous VITESSE protocol. Only the classification of these AEs has changed.DBV plans to initiate a separate safety study in approximately 275 additional subjects  randomized 3:1 active versus placebo. The additional safety data generated by this six-month study will supplement the safety data generated by the VITESSE trial  resulting in a safety database comprised of approximately 600 children ages 4 to 7 years treated with Viaskin Peanut. The protocol design of the safety study will be submitted to the FDA and is expected to be similar to the REALISE ( REA L L i fe Use and S afety of E PIT) safety study that DBV previously conducted with Viaskin Peanut in children ages 4 to 11 years.The Company does not expect the additional safety study to have an impact on the Company’s cash runway guidance as DBV had included a provision for a possible supplemental safety trial in its cash runway assumptions. The Company reiterates that cash on-hand is sufficient to fund operations through VITESSE topline data.“Following a very productive dialogue with the FDA  we have incorporated the Agency’s modifications to VITESSE into the study protocol and look forward to initiating patient treatments ” said Dr. Pharis Mohideen  Chief Medical Officer of DBV Technologies. “I am confident that the VITESSE study  when completed  will add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the ability of our novel drug-device immunotherapy platform  Viaskin Peanut  to address significant unmet needs among peanut-allergic children and their families.”DBV anticipates initiating VITESSE patient screening in the first quarter of 2023 with the last patient screened in 1H 2024 and topline results anticipated in 1H 2025.About VITESSEThe VITESSE trial will enroll 600 subjects  randomized 2:1 active versus placebo. The study will involve approximately 80 trial sites across the United States  Canada  Australia and Europe. Dr. David Fleischer  Children’s Hospital Colorado  will act as the principal investigator.The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of treatment responders in the active versus placebo arms at Month 12. The primary efficacy analysis includes the success criterion of a lower bound of the confidence interval of the difference in responder rates between active and placebo groups being greater than or equal to 15%.A treatment responder is defined as either a subject with a baseline eliciting dose (ED) ≤30 mg who reaches an ED ≥300 mg of peanut protein at Month 12  or a subject with a baseline ED = 100 mg who reaches an ED ≥600 mg of peanut protein at Month 12. A double-blind  placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) will be administered at baseline and Month 12 to determine a subject’s ED at both timepoints.During the screening period  subjects will undergo an initial visit with assessment for eligibility according to peanut skin prick test (SPT) and serum peanut IgE. Those meeting these criteria will proceed to a DBPCFC to confirm their peanut allergy and establish an entry peanut ED. The entry DBPCFC will be 1 mg peanut protein  and will escalate up to a highest single dose of 100 mg peanut protein. Subjects who react with an ED at or below the dose of 100 mg peanut protein are considered eligible. At Month 12  a post-treatment DBPCFC will be performed  with a starting dose of 3 mg peanut protein  escalating to a highest dose of 1 000 mg peanut protein according to the following schedule: 3  10  30  100  300  600  1 000 mg. Secondary efficacy endpoints include changes in Cumulative Reactive Dose  ED and severity of allergic reaction at Month 12 food challenge.About DBV TechnologiesDBV Technologies is developing Viaskin™  an investigational proprietary technology platform with broad potential applications in immunotherapy.

Valneva is seeking approval of its investigational chikungunya vaccine in persons aged 18 years and above.This BLA application follows final pivotal Phase 3 data reported in March 20221 and final lot-to-lot consistency results reported in May 20222. A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents is ongoing in Brazil3  which may support future regulatory submissions in this group if VLA1553 is initially approved in adults. The Company also recently reported positive antibody persistence data with a 99% seroresponse rate 12 months after a single-dose vaccination4.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “The completion of our BLA submission is extremely important as it takes us a step closer to potentially bringing a preventative solution to fight this debilitating disease. Chikungunya is a major public health threat transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes  and no vaccine or specific treatments for the disease are currently available. If the FDA approves the submission  our goal is to provide a tool to help curtail this growing  unmet medical need.”The FDA will now review the filing for acceptance  determine priority review eligibility and the action date which it targets to complete its evaluation. The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020  and Valneva plans to make regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in Europe in the second half of 2023.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat. As of September 2020  there were more than 3 million reported cases in the Americas5 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after three to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. It is estimated that over three quarters of the world’s population live in areas at-risk of CHIKV transmission6. High risk areas of infection are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are currently endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 100 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 20227 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20228.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15539. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201910  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases.

With Wolters Kluwer’s CCH® CPELink  completing CPE requirements has never been easier  even for the 40% of CPAs who wait to complete a large number of credits in the last few weeks or days of the calendar year.CCH CPELink offers anywhere  anytime access to hundreds of on-demand  virtual webinars and online self-study courses  led by industry experts. The tool’s most popular courses tend to focus on technical tax and accounting issues and tax updates; however  users can also gain CPE credits by completing courses that help them learn how to maximize the features and benefits of Wolters Kluwer software tools  like CCH™ Axcess  CCH™ AnswerConnect  and more. Courses can be purchased as part of an annual subscription  or on a standalone basis – per course  per user. In addition to being interactive  they’re mobile-friendly  too.In 2022  courses focusing on federal tax updates and changes to the IRS 1099 form ranked among CCH CPELink’s most popular CPE courses – with courses focused on fraud review and GAAP updates closely following.Dean Sonderegger  Senior Vice President  General Manager for Canada and Research & Learning  Wolters Kluwer Tax and Accounting North America  said:“Wolters Kluwer is committed to making it as easy and convenient as possible for tax and accounting professionals to fulfill their CPE requirements by providing on-demand access to the most accurate  up-to-date training in the industry. If you’re a tax and accounting professional who still has CPE credits complete this year – it’s not too late! With CCH CPELink  Wolters Kluwer has you covered  with anywhere  anytime access to all the CPE credits you need.”An annual survey of accounting firms conducted by Wolters Kluwer Research and Learning recently found that nearly 94% of accounting firms expect their usage of online learning tools to either remain steady or increase over the next several years. That high demand for online CPE tools is just one reason why Sonderegger says Wolters Kluwer’s commitment to online learning is stronger than ever. The company is investing in the development of new tools to drive greater engagement for learners and is adding more than 500 new CCH CPELink courses in 2023.“Our Research and Learning team is committed to partnering with customers to ensure that our CCH CPELink content is fresh  engaging  and focused on the trends and issues that are most important to tax and accounting professionals ” he continued. “We're committed to continually investing in the development of new tools that drive greater engagement for learners and a turnkey experience for firm administrators.”About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (WKL) is a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services for healthcare; tax and accounting; governance  risk  and compliance; and legal and regulatory sectors.

The updated protocol will be submitted to study sites for subsequent Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Ethics Committees (EC) approval.In the Partial Clinical Hold (PCH) letter  the FDA requested changes to certain elements of the VITESSE protocol with the intent for the trial to support a Biologics License Application (BLA). The FDA communication contained four protocol modifications: the redefinition of the minimal daily wear time  the addition of a statistical test for the patch adhesion assessment  the reclassification of certain adverse events (AEs) to adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and an increase in the number of trial participants on active treatment.Key design elements of VITESSE such as inclusion criteria  primary efficacy endpoint  responder criteria  efficacy assessment methodology and safety endpoints were not impacted by the PCH letter and have not changed.“We are pleased that the FDA has lifted the partial clinical hold on the VITESSE study and anticipate initiating patient screening in Q1 2023 ” said Daniel Tassé  Chief Executive Officer of DBV Technologies. “I am proud of our team for continuing to advance important pre-study activities these last several weeks so that we are prepared to act quickly to re-launch VITESSE following today’s announcement.”Following receipt of the PCH letter  DBV and the FDA discussed how VITESSE protocol modifications could best support the Agency’s review of a potential BLA for Viaskin Peanut as a peanut allergy treatment.In lifting the PCH  the FDA confirmed DBV satisfactorily addressed all clinical hold issues identified in the PCH letter. The FDA stated that DBV may proceed with VITESSE with the following changes included in the revised protocol:The updated VITESSE Instructions for Use (IFU) will direct caregivers to apply one patch at approximately the same time each day  following removal of the previous day’s patch. The updated IFU now outlines that Viaskin Peanut 250 µg is to be worn for as close to a full day as possible (i.e.  24 hours) with a minimum daily wear time of 20 hours each day.Patch adhesion will be assessed in VITESSE to affirm the modified Viaskin Peanut patch performs adequately  which aligns with existing regulatory requirements for patch-based therapies. In post-PCH discussions  DBV and the FDA agreed a statistical test of adhesion will be included in the VITESSE statistical analysis plan and further considered patch adhesion data collection and interpretation in the context of the novel nature of the Viaskin patch platform.Four AEs will be classified as AESIs. These AEs – which include AEs leading to inhaled or systemic corticosteroid or epinephrine use  systemic allergic reactions  and Grade 4 local application site (skin) reactions – were collected and assessed in all previous Viaskin Peanut trials and included in the previous VITESSE protocol. Only the classification of these AEs has changed.DBV plans to initiate a separate safety study in approximately 275 additional subjects  randomized 3:1 active versus placebo. The additional safety data generated by this six-month study will supplement the safety data generated by the VITESSE trial  resulting in a safety database comprised of approximately 600 children ages 4 to 7 years treated with Viaskin Peanut. The protocol design of the safety study will be submitted to the FDA and is expected to be similar to the REALISE ( REA L L i fe Use and S afety of E PIT) safety study that DBV previously conducted with Viaskin Peanut in children ages 4 to 11 years.The Company does not expect the additional safety study to have an impact on the Company’s cash runway guidance as DBV had included a provision for a possible supplemental safety trial in its cash runway assumptions. The Company reiterates that cash on-hand is sufficient to fund operations through VITESSE topline data.“Following a very productive dialogue with the FDA  we have incorporated the Agency’s modifications to VITESSE into the study protocol and look forward to initiating patient treatments ” said Dr. Pharis Mohideen  Chief Medical Officer of DBV Technologies. “I am confident that the VITESSE study  when completed  will add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the ability of our novel drug-device immunotherapy platform  Viaskin Peanut  to address significant unmet needs among peanut-allergic children and their families.”DBV anticipates initiating VITESSE patient screening in the first quarter of 2023 with the last patient screened in 1H 2024 and topline results anticipated in 1H 2025.About VITESSEThe VITESSE trial will enroll 600 subjects  randomized 2:1 active versus placebo. The study will involve approximately 80 trial sites across the United States  Canada  Australia and Europe. Dr. David Fleischer  Children’s Hospital Colorado  will act as the principal investigator.The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of treatment responders in the active versus placebo arms at Month 12. The primary efficacy analysis includes the success criterion of a lower bound of the confidence interval of the difference in responder rates between active and placebo groups being greater than or equal to 15%.A treatment responder is defined as either a subject with a baseline eliciting dose (ED) ≤30 mg who reaches an ED ≥300 mg of peanut protein at Month 12  or a subject with a baseline ED = 100 mg who reaches an ED ≥600 mg of peanut protein at Month 12. A double-blind  placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) will be administered at baseline and Month 12 to determine a subject’s ED at both timepoints.During the screening period  subjects will undergo an initial visit with assessment for eligibility according to peanut skin prick test (SPT) and serum peanut IgE. Those meeting these criteria will proceed to a DBPCFC to confirm their peanut allergy and establish an entry peanut ED. The entry DBPCFC will be 1 mg peanut protein  and will escalate up to a highest single dose of 100 mg peanut protein. Subjects who react with an ED at or below the dose of 100 mg peanut protein are considered eligible. At Month 12  a post-treatment DBPCFC will be performed  with a starting dose of 3 mg peanut protein  escalating to a highest dose of 1 000 mg peanut protein according to the following schedule: 3  10  30  100  300  600  1 000 mg. Secondary efficacy endpoints include changes in Cumulative Reactive Dose  ED and severity of allergic reaction at Month 12 food challenge.About DBV TechnologiesDBV Technologies is developing Viaskin™  an investigational proprietary technology platform with broad potential applications in immunotherapy.

15456,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4566082-aperam-stock-guiding-long-term-eps-6-5-7-eur-per-share,Aperam Stock: Guiding For A Long-Term EPS Of 6.5-7 EUR Per Share (OTCMKTS:APEMY),Aperam is pretty cyclical but is actively taking steps to reduce its exposure to the sometimes violent cycles. See why we rate APEMY stock is a buy.,imamember/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionAperam (OTC:APEMY) (OTCPK:APMSF) is one of the world’s largest producers of stainless steel and specialty steel in the world. Originally spun off from steel giant ArcelorMittal (MT)  Aperam went its own way and has done so quite successfully. Despite its dependence on nickel and natural gas in the production process  Aperam has successfully been able to protect its margins – although we obviously have to be mindful of the downturn this cyclical sector is in.Yahoo FinanceAperam's main listing is on Euronext Amsterdam where the stock is trading with APAM as its ticker symbol. The average daily volume exceeds 200 000 shares  making it the most liquid listing. There are approximately 75.5M shares outstanding  resulting in a market cap of just around 2.25B EUR.The stainless steel market held up better than I had expectedDuring the third quarter  Aperam shipped just over 500 000 tonnes of steel. Not only is this a 20% decrease compared to the second quarter  it also is a 25% decrease compared to the first quarter of this year. It still is a step-up from the fourth quarter of last year thanks to the acquisition of ELG  but the stainless steel was sold at a lower margin.Aperam Investor RelationsThanks to the acquisition of ELG  Aperam has now further worked towards vertically integrating its production process.Aperam Investor RelationsThe total revenue in the third quarter was 1.82B EUR  a decrease of approximately a third compared to the second quarter. The total adjusted EBITDA was approximately 235M EUR and although this still sounds great in absolute numbers  it is a 40% decrease compared to the second quarter and even a 15% decrease compared to the third quarter of last year (which excludes the impact of the ELG acquisition).Aperam Investor RelationsThe pre-tax income was approximately 121M EUR resulting in a net income of 122M EUR thanks to a 1M EUR tax benefit. The attributable net income was 1.66 EUR per share as the net income attributable to the non-controlling interests was 1M EUR.One of the main reasons why I always liked Aperam is its ability to generate a positive operating and free cash flow. Despite the weaker results in the third quarter  Aperam was still cash flow positive. Its reported operating cash flow was 265M EUR. This does include a 36M EUR contribution from working capital changes  and the adjusted operating cash flow was 229M EUR.Aperam Investor RelationsThe total capex was 58M EUR  which means Aperam generated about 171M EUR in free cash flow. Divided over 75.5M shares outstanding  this means the underlying free cash flow 2.26 EUR per share. That’s higher than the reported net income mainly due to the high non-cash finance expenses during the quarter. This was entirely related to FX changes as Aperam’s net interest expense was close to zero as the interest payments were offset by the income on the cash in the treasury.As of the end of September  Aperam had about 467M EUR in cash  269M EUR in short-term debt and 680M EUR in long-term debt for a net debt of 482M EUR. Aperam continues to reduce its net debt with the incoming free cash flow and considering the YTD EBITDA came in at 1B EUR and even the Q3 adjusted EBITDA was 235M EUR  the debt ratio will likely be less than 0.5 by the end of this year.The 2022 capital markets day was enlighteningEarlier this year  Aperam organized a capital markets day. One of the main focus points was Aperam’s role in the circular economy and that’s another reason why the ELG acquisition was important for Aperam. The management’s long-term incentive plans are now also aligned with these targets.Aperam Investor RelationsThe company is also aiming to increase its normalized EBITDA by 300M EUR. Seeing how the adjusted EBITDA in 2016- 2017-2018 was respectively 503M EUR  559M EUR and 504M EUR for an average EBITDA of 522M EUR  the 2025 guidance implies a normalized adjusted EBITDA of 800-850M EUR.We know the annual depreciation expenses are about 200M  the net interest expenses should be zero which means the long-term guidance should result in a pre-tax income of 600-625M EUR. The effective tax rate should continue to be roughly 20-22% resulting in a reported net income of 468-500M EUR for an EPS of 6.5-7 EUR per share.We also know the maintenance capex + CO2 payments are just about 150M EUR per year  which means the free cash flow result should be slightly higher than the reported net income.Aperam Investor RelationsAperam also plans to pay a dividend of 2 EUR per share which will cost the company just over 150M EUR per year. The remainder will be spent on organic growth (with a minimum required Internal Rate of Return of about 15%). The remaining cash could the subsequently be used to buy back stock and/or a special dividend.Investment thesisI have no position in Aperam  as I already have a long position in Acerinox (OTCPK:ANIOY)  a Spain-based stainless steel producer. But seeing how well Aperam’s financial results are holding up (not unlike Acerinox’ results)  perhaps I should start buying Aperam as well.In any case  I think Aperam is a well-led producer of stainless steel and the acquisition of ELG will likely prove to be a good addition in the long run. I also like how Aperam is planning on improving its sales mix to get more exposure to the smaller customers where the EBIDA margins are higher. I also like the company’s plan to diversify away from being a pure stainless steel producer as its alloys and specialties EBITDA will double ‘till 2025’ which I interpret as ‘it will double every year’.I fully realize the steel and stainless steel sector are currently in a down-cycle. But I would like to initiate a long position within the next few months. I noticed the option premiums for Aperam are pretty solid with for instance the premium for a P25 expiring in March coming in at 0.90 EUR these days thanks to the elevated volatility levels.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

(the “Company”) (Nasdaq: SPTK  SPTKU  and SPTKW) announced today that the non-binding letter of intent with Metavisio (d/b/a Thomson Computing)  a French company specializing in building  marketing  and selling laptops  whose securities are listed on Euronext Growth in Paris  with respect to a proposed business combination transaction  has been mutually terminated by the parties.In addition  the Company announced today that the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) has elected to abandon and not implement the extension that was approved by stockholders on December 20  2022  because despite significant efforts to identify and complete an initial business combination  the Board does not believe that the Company will be able to complete an initial business combination on favorable terms even with the extension. In making its decision  the Board has carefully considered the costs  benefits  and risks of prolonging the Company’s life  including the current adverse market conditions and increased regulatory uncertainty around SPACs.As a result  the Company intends to dissolve and liquidate in accordance with the provisions of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and will redeem all of the outstanding shares of common stock that were included in the units issued in its initial public offering (the “Public Shares”).As of the close of business on December 27  2022  the Public Shares will be deemed cancelled and will represent only the right to receive the redemption amount.In order to provide for the disbursement of funds from the trust account  the Company has instructed the trustee of the trust account to take all necessary actions to immediately liquidate the trust account. The proceeds of the trust account will be held in a non-interest bearing account while awaiting disbursement to the holders of the Public Shares. Record holders may redeem their shares for their pro rata portion of the proceeds of the trust account by delivering their Public Shares to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“Continental”)  the Company’s transfer agent. Beneficial owners of Public Shares held in “street name ” however  will not need to take any action in order to receive the redemption amount. The redemption of the Public Shares is expected to be completed on or around December 27  2022. The per-share redemption price is being calculated by Continental. The Company expects to file a Current Report on Form 8-K to announce such information as soon as possible.The Company’s initial stockholders have waived their redemption rights with respect to its outstanding common stock issued prior to the Company’s initial public offering.There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company’s warrants  which will expire worthless.About SportsTekSportsTek is a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition  stock purchase  reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.

The CRL is related to the regulatory agency’s previous request for additional information on palovarotene clinical trial data communicated to Ipsen in October 2022  which is not a request for additional efficacy or safety data beyond existing studies. Ipsen anticipates responding to the request in the first quarter of 2023 with an expected six-month FDA review cycle. The FDA has not announced a rescheduled date for the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting for investigational palovarotene.“ Although this extends the review timeline for palovarotene  we continue to work with the FDA to provide the requested information and believe that investigational palovarotene has the potential to be an innovative treatment to reduce new abnormal bone formation to slow the progression of FOP ” said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. “ Currently  people living with FOP in the U.S. have no approved treatment option to slow the progression of the disease and this remains our reason for being steadfast in our pursuit of bringing this potential treatment option for FOP.”FOP is an ultra-rare disease that causes permanent and continuous bone formation in soft and connective tissues like muscles  tendons and ligaments  also known as heterotopic ossification or HO.1 As bone continuously accumulates over time in joints and other areas of the body with flare-up episodes causing rapid bone formation  FOP severely restricts mobility and function.2 FOP impacts the lives of fewer than an estimated 400 people in the U.S. and 900 people globally.3 Due to abnormal bone formation  in childhood and early adulthood people living with FOP may lose the permanent ability to move their neck  back  shoulders  chest  legs and arm joints.4 Without disease-modifying treatment  palliative care is the only treatment option and the median life expectancy is 56 years with untimely death caused by bone formation around the ribcage leading to breathing problems and cardiorespiratory failure.2About palovarotenePalovarotene is authorized for use in appropriate patients in Canada and United Arab Emirates where it is marketed as Sohonos™ (palovarotene capsules).4 Investigational palovarotene is under review with a number of regulatory authorities.ENDSAbout IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

For more information  visit ipsen.comIpsen’s Forward-Looking StatementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfill their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com.Disclaimer: Intended for international media and investor audiences only___________________________________1 Kaplan FS  et al.

Anxieties over the FOMC's planned hawkish trajectory continued to drive what little action there was. Treasuries were underwater from the get go and yields extended higher after the mix of data added to expectations the Fed will have to continue hiking rates in the new year. Yet the bond market continues to doubt policymakers will boost the funds rate to the 5.1% median dot. Upcoming supply also exacerbated the selloff  while the market is still feeling the impact of the BoJ's surprise extension of YCC. The long end of the curve was the ultimate underperformer in a bear steepener. The 30-year yield closed 8.5 bps cheaper at 3.823%. The 10-year rate rose 7 bps to 3.747%. The wi 5-year rose 5 bps to 4.280%  with the wi 5- and 7-year rates up 5.5 bps to 3.860% and 3.820%  respectively. The curve was at -57.8 bps. Wall Street was choppy through the day as it searched for direction  ultimately ending in the green and modestly unwinding recent losses. The S&P 500 rallied 0.59% with the Dow up 0.53%  while the NASDAQ rose 0.21%. But it was a third straight weekly decline for the indexes. The DXY dollar index waffled narrowly around the 104.324 area  ultimately finishing slightly weaker at 104.124. Oil prices were firmer with WTI climbing over 2% to finish at 79.56 after hitting a peak of $80.33. Declines in inventories and the big bomb cyclone that is putting much of the U.S. into a deep freeze were bullish for prices.

In addition  the Company announced today that the board of directors of the Company has elected to abandon and not implement the extension that was approved by stockholders on December 20  2022  because despite significant efforts to identify and complete an initial business combination  the Board does not believe that the Company will be able to complete an initial business combination on favorable terms even with the extension. In making its decision  the Board has carefully considered the costs  benefits  and risks of prolonging the Company's life  including the current adverse market conditions and increased regulatory uncertainty around SPACs.

Anxieties over the FOMC's planned hawkish trajectory continued to drive what little action there was. Treasuries were underwater from the get go and yields extended higher after the mix of data added to expectations the Fed will have to continue hiking rates in the new year. Yet the bond market continues to doubt policymakers will boost the funds rate to the 5.1% median dot. Upcoming supply also exacerbated the selloff  while the market is still feeling the impact of the BoJ's surprise extension of YCC. The long end of the curve was the ultimate underperformer in a bear steepener. The 30-year yield closed 8.5 bps cheaper at 3.823%. The 10-year rate rose 7 bps to 3.747%. The wi 5-year rose 5 bps to 4.280%  with the wi 5- and 7-year rates up 5.5 bps to 3.860% and 3.820%  respectively. The curve was at -57.8 bps. Wall Street was choppy through the day as it searched for direction  ultimately ending in the green and modestly unwinding recent losses. The S&P 500 rallied 0.59% with the Dow up 0.53%  while the NASDAQ rose 0.21%. But it was a third straight weekly decline for the indexes. The DXY dollar index waffled narrowly around the 104.324 area  ultimately finishing slightly weaker at 104.124. Oil prices were firmer with WTI climbing over 2% to finish at 79.56 after hitting a peak of $80.33. Declines in inventories and the big bomb cyclone that is putting much of the U.S. into a deep freeze were bullish for prices.

Valneva is seeking approval of its investigational chikungunya vaccine in persons aged 18 years and above.This BLA application follows final pivotal Phase 3 data reported in March 20221 and final lot-to-lot consistency results reported in May 20222. A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents is ongoing in Brazil3  which may support future regulatory submissions in this group if VLA1553 is initially approved in adults. The Company also recently reported positive antibody persistence data with a 99% seroresponse rate 12 months after a single-dose vaccination4.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “The completion of our BLA submission is extremely important as it takes us a step closer to potentially bringing a preventative solution to fight this debilitating disease. Chikungunya is a major public health threat transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes  and no vaccine or specific treatments for the disease are currently available. If the FDA approves the submission  our goal is to provide a tool to help curtail this growing  unmet medical need.”The FDA will now review the filing for acceptance  determine priority review eligibility and the action date which it targets to complete its evaluation. The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020  and Valneva plans to make regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in Europe in the second half of 2023.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat. As of September 2020  there were more than 3 million reported cases in the Americas5 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after three to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. It is estimated that over three quarters of the world’s population live in areas at-risk of CHIKV transmission6. High risk areas of infection are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are currently endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 100 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 20227 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20228.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15539. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201910  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to successfully commercialize two vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease  the chikungunya virus and COVID-19.Media & Investor ContactsLaëtitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to regulatory approval of VLA1553  timing and plans for clinical programs and product candidates and revenue forecasts.

The CRL is related to the regulatory agency's previous request for additional information on palovarotene clinical trial data communicated to Ipsen in October 2022  which is not a request for additional efficacy or safety data beyond existing studies. Ipsen anticipates responding to the request in the first quarter of 2023 with an expected six- month FDA review cycle. The FDA has not announced a rescheduled date for the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting for investigational palovarotene. ""Although this extends the review timeline for palovarotene  we continue to work with the FDA to provide the requested information and believe that investigational palovarotene has the potential to be an innovative treatment to reduce new abnormal bone formation to slow the progression of FOP "" said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. ""Currently  people living with FOP in the U.S. have no approved treatment option to slow the progression of the disease and this remains our reason for being steadfast in our pursuit of bringing this potential treatment option for FOP."" FOP is an ultra-rare disease that causes permanent and continuous bone formation in soft and connective tissues like muscles  tendons and ligaments  also known as heterotopic ossification or HO.1 As bone continuously accumulates over time in joints and other areas of the body with flare-up episodes causing rapid bone formation  FOP severely restricts mobility and function.2 FOP impacts the lives of fewer than an estimated 400 people in the U.S. and 900 people globally.3 Due to abnormal bone formation  in childhood and early adulthood people living with FOP may lose the permanent ability to move their neck  back  shoulders  chest  legs and arm joints.4 Without disease-modifying treatment  palliative care is the only treatment option and the median life expectancy is 56 years with untimely death caused by bone formation around the ribcage leading to breathing problems and cardiorespiratory failure.2 About palovarotene Palovarotene is authorized for use in appropriate patients in Canada and United Arab Emirates where it is marketed as SohonosTM (palovarotene capsules).4 Investigational palovarotene is under review with a number of regulatory authorities.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen's future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words 'believes'  'anticipates' and 'expects' and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen's expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums.

The FDA designated the resubmission as 'Class 2' with a six-month review period. The FDA action is expected in the second quarter of 2023.""The FDA acceptance of our resubmitted application for bimekizumab is positive news that moves us one step closer to providing the first dual IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitor to address the unmet needs of people with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in the U.S. We will continue to work with the FDA through the review process with the goal of bringing bimekizumab to the dermatology community in the U.S. as soon as possible "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB.In November 2022  UCB announced resubmission of the BLA for bimekizumab  for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis  following receipt of a complete response letter in May 2022.Notes to editors:About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.1In the U.S.  the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab have not been established for any indication and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).In August 2021  bimekizumab was approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in Great Britain  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.2 3 In January 2022  bimekizumab received marketing authorization in Japan for the treatment of plaque psoriasis  generalized pustular psoriasis and psoriatic erythroderma in patients who are not sufficiently responding to existing treatments.4In February and March 2022  bimekizumab received marketing authorization in Canada and Australia respectively  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.5 6 In July and October 2022  bimekizumab received marketing authorization in Saudi Arabia and Switzerland respectively  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.7 8BIMZELX®▼(bimekizumab) EU/EEA Important Safety Information in Psoriasis2The most frequently reported adverse reactions with bimekizumab were upper respiratory tract infections (14.5%) (most frequently nasopharyngitis) and oral candidiasis (7.3%). Common adverse reactions (≥1/100 to <1/10) were oral candidiasis  tinea infections  ear infections  herpes simplex infections  oropharyngeal candidiasis  gastroenteritis  folliculitis  headache  dermatitis and eczema  acne  injection site reactions and fatigue. Elderly may be more likely to experience certain adverse reactions such as oral candidiasis  dermatitis and eczema when using bimekizumab.Bimekizumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients and in patients with clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis).Bimekizumab may increase the risk of infections. Treatment with bimekizumab must not be administered in patients with any clinically important active infection. Patients treated with bimekizumab should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. Prior to initiating treatment with bimekizumab  patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Bimekizumab should not be given in patients with active TB and patients receiving bimekizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB.Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with bimekizumab. Bimekizumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease  bimekizumab should be discontinued and appropriate medical management should be initiated.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products.
