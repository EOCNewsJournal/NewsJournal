See why we rate APEMY stock is a buy.,imamember/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionAperam (OTC:APEMY) (OTCPK:APMSF) is one of the world’s largest producers of stainless steel and specialty steel in the world. Originally spun off from steel giant ArcelorMittal (MT)  Aperam went its own way and has done so quite successfully. Despite its dependence on nickel and natural gas in the production process  Aperam has successfully been able to protect its margins – although we obviously have to be mindful of the downturn this cyclical sector is in.Yahoo FinanceAperam's main listing is on Euronext Amsterdam where the stock is trading with APAM as its ticker symbol. The average daily volume exceeds 200 000 shares  making it the most liquid listing. There are approximately 75.5M shares outstanding  resulting in a market cap of just around 2.25B EUR.The stainless steel market held up better than I had expectedDuring the third quarter  Aperam shipped just over 500 000 tonnes of steel. Not only is this a 20% decrease compared to the second quarter  it also is a 25% decrease compared to the first quarter of this year. It still is a step-up from the fourth quarter of last year thanks to the acquisition of ELG  but the stainless steel was sold at a lower margin.Aperam Investor RelationsThanks to the acquisition of ELG  Aperam has now further worked towards vertically integrating its production process.Aperam Investor RelationsThe total revenue in the third quarter was 1.82B EUR  a decrease of approximately a third compared to the second quarter. The total adjusted EBITDA was approximately 235M EUR and although this still sounds great in absolute numbers  it is a 40% decrease compared to the second quarter and even a 15% decrease compared to the third quarter of last year (which excludes the impact of the ELG acquisition).Aperam Investor RelationsThe pre-tax income was approximately 121M EUR resulting in a net income of 122M EUR thanks to a 1M EUR tax benefit. The attributable net income was 1.66 EUR per share as the net income attributable to the non-controlling interests was 1M EUR.One of the main reasons why I always liked Aperam is its ability to generate a positive operating and free cash flow. Despite the weaker results in the third quarter  Aperam was still cash flow positive. Its reported operating cash flow was 265M EUR. This does include a 36M EUR contribution from working capital changes  and the adjusted operating cash flow was 229M EUR.Aperam Investor RelationsThe total capex was 58M EUR  which means Aperam generated about 171M EUR in free cash flow. Divided over 75.5M shares outstanding  this means the underlying free cash flow 2.26 EUR per share. That’s higher than the reported net income mainly due to the high non-cash finance expenses during the quarter. This was entirely related to FX changes as Aperam’s net interest expense was close to zero as the interest payments were offset by the income on the cash in the treasury.As of the end of September  Aperam had about 467M EUR in cash  269M EUR in short-term debt and 680M EUR in long-term debt for a net debt of 482M EUR. Aperam continues to reduce its net debt with the incoming free cash flow and considering the YTD EBITDA came in at 1B EUR and even the Q3 adjusted EBITDA was 235M EUR  the debt ratio will likely be less than 0.5 by the end of this year.The 2022 capital markets day was enlighteningEarlier this year  Aperam organized a capital markets day. One of the main focus points was Aperam’s role in the circular economy and that’s another reason why the ELG acquisition was important for Aperam. The management’s long-term incentive plans are now also aligned with these targets.Aperam Investor RelationsThe company is also aiming to increase its normalized EBITDA by 300M EUR. Seeing how the adjusted EBITDA in 2016- 2017-2018 was respectively 503M EUR  559M EUR and 504M EUR for an average EBITDA of 522M EUR  the 2025 guidance implies a normalized adjusted EBITDA of 800-850M EUR.We know the annual depreciation expenses are about 200M  the net interest expenses should be zero which means the long-term guidance should result in a pre-tax income of 600-625M EUR. The effective tax rate should continue to be roughly 20-22% resulting in a reported net income of 468-500M EUR for an EPS of 6.5-7 EUR per share.We also know the maintenance capex + CO2 payments are just about 150M EUR per year  which means the free cash flow result should be slightly higher than the reported net income.Aperam Investor RelationsAperam also plans to pay a dividend of 2 EUR per share which will cost the company just over 150M EUR per year. The remainder will be spent on organic growth (with a minimum required Internal Rate of Return of about 15%). The remaining cash could the subsequently be used to buy back stock and/or a special dividend.Investment thesisI have no position in Aperam  as I already have a long position in Acerinox (OTCPK:ANIOY)  a Spain-based stainless steel producer. But seeing how well Aperam’s financial results are holding up (not unlike Acerinox’ results)  perhaps I should start buying Aperam as well.In any case  I think Aperam is a well-led producer of stainless steel and the acquisition of ELG will likely prove to be a good addition in the long run. I also like how Aperam is planning on improving its sales mix to get more exposure to the smaller customers where the EBIDA margins are higher. I also like the company’s plan to diversify away from being a pure stainless steel producer as its alloys and specialties EBITDA will double ‘till 2025’ which I interpret as ‘it will double every year’.I fully realize the steel and stainless steel sector are currently in a down-cycle. But I would like to initiate a long position within the next few months. I noticed the option premiums for Aperam are pretty solid with for instance the premium for a P25 expiring in March coming in at 0.90 EUR these days thanks to the elevated volatility levels.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

In 2023  drug companies will introduce the first vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus -- known as RSV -- and could roll out the first flu vaccine based on messenger RNA  or mRNA. It will also be a significant year for COVID-19 shots  which are expected to make their debut on the commercial market  the author notes. 2023 should be a big year for vaccine makers; Pfizer (PFE)  Moderna (MRNA)  GSK (GSK)  and Sanofi (SNY) are the to watch  the publication adds.

Anxieties over the FOMC's planned hawkish trajectory continued to drive what little action there was. Treasuries were underwater from the get go and yields extended higher after the mix of data added to expectations the Fed will have to continue hiking rates in the new year. Yet the bond market continues to doubt policymakers will boost the funds rate to the 5.1% median dot. Upcoming supply also exacerbated the selloff  while the market is still feeling the impact of the BoJ's surprise extension of YCC. The long end of the curve was the ultimate underperformer in a bear steepener. The 30-year yield closed 8.5 bps cheaper at 3.823%. The 10-year rate rose 7 bps to 3.747%. The wi 5-year rose 5 bps to 4.280%  with the wi 5- and 7-year rates up 5.5 bps to 3.860% and 3.820%  respectively. The curve was at -57.8 bps. Wall Street was choppy through the day as it searched for direction  ultimately ending in the green and modestly unwinding recent losses. The S&P 500 rallied 0.59% with the Dow up 0.53%  while the NASDAQ rose 0.21%. But it was a third straight weekly decline for the indexes. The DXY dollar index waffled narrowly around the 104.324 area  ultimately finishing slightly weaker at 104.124. Oil prices were firmer with WTI climbing over 2% to finish at 79.56 after hitting a peak of $80.33. Declines in inventories and the big bomb cyclone that is putting much of the U.S. into a deep freeze were bullish for prices.

In addition  the Company announced today that the board of directors of the Company has elected to abandon and not implement the extension that was approved by stockholders on December 20  2022  because despite significant efforts to identify and complete an initial business combination  the Board does not believe that the Company will be able to complete an initial business combination on favorable terms even with the extension. In making its decision  the Board has carefully considered the costs  benefits  and risks of prolonging the Company's life  including the current adverse market conditions and increased regulatory uncertainty around SPACs. As a result  the Company intends to dissolve and liquidate in accordance with the provisions of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and will redeem all of the outstanding shares of common stock that were included in the units issued in its initial public offering. As of the close of business on December 27  2022  the Public Shares will be deemed cancelled and will represent only the right to receive the redemption amount.

In 2023  drug companies will introduce the first vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus -- known as RSV -- and could roll out the first flu vaccine based on messenger RNA  or mRNA. It will also be a significant year for COVID-19 shots  which are expected to make their debut on the commercial market  the author notes. 2023 should be a big year for vaccine makers; Pfizer (PFE)  Moderna (MRNA)  GSK (GSK)  and Sanofi (SNY) are the to watch  the publication adds.

Anxieties over the FOMC's planned hawkish trajectory continued to drive what little action there was. Treasuries were underwater from the get go and yields extended higher after the mix of data added to expectations the Fed will have to continue hiking rates in the new year. Yet the bond market continues to doubt policymakers will boost the funds rate to the 5.1% median dot. Upcoming supply also exacerbated the selloff  while the market is still feeling the impact of the BoJ's surprise extension of YCC. The long end of the curve was the ultimate underperformer in a bear steepener. The 30-year yield closed 8.5 bps cheaper at 3.823%. The 10-year rate rose 7 bps to 3.747%. The wi 5-year rose 5 bps to 4.280%  with the wi 5- and 7-year rates up 5.5 bps to 3.860% and 3.820%  respectively. The curve was at -57.8 bps. Wall Street was choppy through the day as it searched for direction  ultimately ending in the green and modestly unwinding recent losses. The S&P 500 rallied 0.59% with the Dow up 0.53%  while the NASDAQ rose 0.21%. But it was a third straight weekly decline for the indexes. The DXY dollar index waffled narrowly around the 104.324 area  ultimately finishing slightly weaker at 104.124. Oil prices were firmer with WTI climbing over 2% to finish at 79.56 after hitting a peak of $80.33. Declines in inventories and the big bomb cyclone that is putting much of the U.S. into a deep freeze were bullish for prices.

In addition  the Company announced today that the board of directors of the Company has elected to abandon and not implement the extension that was approved by stockholders on December 20  2022  because despite significant efforts to identify and complete an initial business combination  the Board does not believe that the Company will be able to complete an initial business combination on favorable terms even with the extension. In making its decision  the Board has carefully considered the costs  benefits  and risks of prolonging the Company's life  including the current adverse market conditions and increased regulatory uncertainty around SPACs. As a result  the Company intends to dissolve and liquidate in accordance with the provisions of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and will redeem all of the outstanding shares of common stock that were included in the units issued in its initial public offering. As of the close of business on December 27  2022  the Public Shares will be deemed cancelled and will represent only the right to receive the redemption amount.

The CRL is related to the regulatory agency's previous request for additional information on palovarotene clinical trial data communicated to Ipsen in October 2022  which is not a request for additional efficacy or safety data beyond existing studies. Ipsen anticipates responding to the request in the first quarter of 2023 with an expected six- month FDA review cycle. The FDA has not announced a rescheduled date for the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting for investigational palovarotene. ""Although this extends the review timeline for palovarotene  we continue to work with the FDA to provide the requested information and believe that investigational palovarotene has the potential to be an innovative treatment to reduce new abnormal bone formation to slow the progression of FOP "" said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. ""Currently  people living with FOP in the U.S. have no approved treatment option to slow the progression of the disease and this remains our reason for being steadfast in our pursuit of bringing this potential treatment option for FOP."" FOP is an ultra-rare disease that causes permanent and continuous bone formation in soft and connective tissues like muscles  tendons and ligaments  also known as heterotopic ossification or HO.1 As bone continuously accumulates over time in joints and other areas of the body with flare-up episodes causing rapid bone formation  FOP severely restricts mobility and function.2 FOP impacts the lives of fewer than an estimated 400 people in the U.S. and 900 people globally.3 Due to abnormal bone formation  in childhood and early adulthood people living with FOP may lose the permanent ability to move their neck  back  shoulders  chest  legs and arm joints.4 Without disease-modifying treatment  palliative care is the only treatment option and the median life expectancy is 56 years with untimely death caused by bone formation around the ribcage leading to breathing problems and cardiorespiratory failure.2 About palovarotene Palovarotene is authorized for use in appropriate patients in Canada and United Arab Emirates where it is marketed as SohonosTM (palovarotene capsules).4 Investigational palovarotene is under review with a number of regulatory authorities.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen's future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words 'believes'  'anticipates' and 'expects' and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen's expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development ",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.01,0.02,0.97,True,English,"['Other news releases', 'Inside Information', 'Ipsen', 'Investors Craig Marks Adrien Dupin de Saint-Cyr Vice President', 'Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program', 'Media Anna Gibbins Rachel Reiff Global Head', 'Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting', 'Investor Relations Investor Relations Manager', 'six- month FDA review cycle', 'global, mid-sized biopharmaceutical company', 'Executive Vice President', 'palovarotene clinical trial data', 'new abnormal bone formation', 'Rare U.S. Head', 'The U.S. Food', 'New Drug Application', 'continuous bone formation', 'rapid bone formation', 'Complete Response Letter', 'median life expectancy', 'United Arab Emirates', 'differentiated technological platforms', 'reasonable macroeconomic conditions', 'Specialty Care sales', 'U.S. FDA', 'Portfolio Communications Disease', 'early adulthood people', 'potential treatment option', 'international media', 'investor audiences', 'safety data', 'Rare Disease', 'The FDA', 'review timeline', 'U.K.', 'Drug Administration', 'palliative care', 'Franchise Communications', 'palovarotene Palovarotene', 'The CRL', 'investigational treatment', 'disease-modifying treatment', 'investigational palovarotene', 'palovarotene capsules', 'fibrodysplasia ossificans', 'first quarter', 'heterotopic ossification', 'regulatory agency', 'additional efficacy', 'existing studies', 'Howard Mayer', 'connective tissues', 'other areas', 'flare-up episodes', 'untimely death', 'breathing problems', 'cardiorespiratory failure', 'appropriate patients', 'regulatory authorities', 'external-innovation strategy', 'leading biotechnological', 'life-science hubs', 'Forward-Looking Statements', 'management strategy', 'current views', 'Such statements', 'actual results', 'future ability', 'similar expressions', 'regulatory filings', 'external growth', 'innovative treatment', 'permanent ability', 'arm joints', 'transformative medicines', 'development efforts', 'unknown risks', 'future events', 'previous request', 'additional information', 'financial targets', 'Ipsen Ipsen', '400 people', '900 people', 'Disclaimer', 'PARIS', 'FRANCE', 'reduction', 'FOP', 'October', 'date', 'Endocrinologic', 'progression', 'Research', 'pursuit', 'soft', 'muscles', 'tendons', 'ligaments', 'body', 'mobility', 'function', 'lives', 'fewer', 'childhood', 'neck', 'back', 'shoulders', 'chest', 'legs', '56 years', 'ribcage', 'use', 'Canada', 'SohonosTM', 'number', 'ENDS', 'Oncology', 'Neuroscience', '100 countries', 'heart', 'Oxford', 'Cambridge', 'Shanghai', 'China', '5,000 colleagues', 'Euronext', 'IPN', 'IPSEY', 'Contacts', 'objectives', 'assumptions', 'uncertainties', 'performance', 'words', 'believes', 'expects', 'expectations', 'determinations', 'document', 'account']",2022-12-24,2022-12-25,marketscreener.com
