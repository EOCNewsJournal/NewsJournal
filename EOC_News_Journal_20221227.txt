Dec. 27  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext : NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced the first patient in the United States has been randomized in NANORAY-312  a global Phase 3 registrational trial evaluating NBTXR3 for the treatment of elderly patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (“LA-HNSCC”) who are ineligible for platinum-based chemotherapy. NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy will be evaluated alone or in combination with cetuximab. NBTXR3 is a potentially first-in-class radioenhancer with broad application across solid tumors  with prioritized focus in head and neck cancer.“Our pivotal  global Phase 3 NANORAY-312 trial for lead candidate NBTXR3 continues to build momentum with sites now active in the United States  Europe and Asia ” said Laurent Levy  co-founder of Nanobiotix and chairman of the executive board. “NANORAY-312 is the first of our prioritized registrational trials in head and neck cancer and is designed to prove that our innovation can make a difference for elderly patients around the world  a growing patient population with high unmet medical need. We believe data on survival and anti-tumoral response in our proof-of-concept Phase 1 Study 102 continue to support the potential of NBTXR3 as a single agent activated by radiotherapy for the treatment of elderly patients with head and neck cancer and we look forward to reporting additional milestones from our head and neck cancer franchise studies in 2023.”The first patient in NANORAY-312 was randomized in Europe by Nanobiotix in January of 2022  followed by randomization of the first patient in Asia by Nanobiotix’ strategic collaborator LianBio in August of 2022. The addition of the first patient in the United States completes the Company’s planned study initiation milestones in 2022. Nanobiotix remains focused on expanding the trial’s site footprint  building on the 80 sites currently activated; driving patient recruitment; and preparing for planned milestone reporting in 2023.About NANORAY-312NANORAY-312 is a global  two-arm  randomized  Investigator’s Choice Phase 3 registrational study that is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 with or without cetuximab versus radiotherapy with or without cetuximab in high-risk  platinum-based chemotherapy-ineligible elderly patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HSNCC). Eligible participants will be treated with NBTXR3 at a 1:1 ratio after an Investigator’s Choice of radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy in combination with cetuximab. This pivotal trial is expected to enroll 500 patients globally  with the United States  Europe  and Asia as its major regions. NANORAY-312 is co-led by principal investigators Sue Yom  MD  PhD  Professor and Vice Chair  Strategic Advisory Department of Radiation Oncology; Professor  Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at The University of California  San Francisco  and Christophe Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  senior medical oncologist and head of the Department of Drug Development and Innovation (D3i) at Institut Curie (Paris).NANORAY-312 is being conducted in partnership with LianBio. LianBio is leading clinical development in Asia and holds exclusive rights to develop and commercialize NBTXR3 in Greater China  South Korea  Singapore and Thailand. Nanobiotix is leading clinical and commercial development in all other regions.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy; a phase III global registrational study was launched in 2021; and all major regions planned for the study are currently active and enrolling patients. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the phase III study.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program—beginning with a Company-sponsored phase I clinical study evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/metastatic HNSCC and lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a strategic collaboration strategy with world class partners to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity. The company’s philosophy is rooted in the concept of pushing past the boundaries of what is known to expand possibilities for human life.Incorporated in 2003  Nanobiotix is headquartered in Paris  France.

This represents another important step in our progress and commitment to provide a new treatment option to ALS patients internationally”.About amyotrophic lateral sclerosisAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disorder that is characterized by progressive loss of the upper and lower motor neurons at the spinal or bulbar level. The disease belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases  which are characterized by the gradual degeneration and death of motor neurons. In ALS  both the upper motor neurons and the lower motor neurons degenerate or die  and stop sending messages to muscles.The prevalence of ALS in western countries is fairly uniform at 6 per 100 000 persons  corresponding to around 30 000 cases in Europe and 20 000 in the USA.About masitinibMasitinib is an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets mast cells and macrophages  important cells for immunity  through inhibiting a limited number of kinases. Based on its unique mechanism of action  masitinib can be developed in a large number of conditions in oncology  in inflammatory diseases  and in certain diseases of the central nervous system. In oncology due to its immunotherapy effect  masitinib can have an effect on survival  alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Through its activity on mast cells and microglia and consequently the inhibition of the activation of the inflammatory process  masitinib can have an effect on the symptoms associated with some inflammatory and central nervous system diseases and the degeneration of these diseases.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

Dec. 27  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext : NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced the first patient in the United States has been randomized in NANORAY-312  a global Phase 3 registrational trial evaluating NBTXR3 for the treatment of elderly patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (“LA-HNSCC”) who are ineligible for platinum-based chemotherapy. NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy will be evaluated alone or in combination with cetuximab. NBTXR3 is a potentially first-in-class radioenhancer with broad application across solid tumors  with prioritized focus in head and neck cancer.“Our pivotal  global Phase 3 NANORAY-312 trial for lead candidate NBTXR3 continues to build momentum with sites now active in the United States  Europe and Asia ” said Laurent Levy  co-founder of Nanobiotix and chairman of the executive board. “NANORAY-312 is the first of our prioritized registrational trials in head and neck cancer and is designed to prove that our innovation can make a difference for elderly patients around the world  a growing patient population with high unmet medical need. We believe data on survival and anti-tumoral response in our proof-of-concept Phase 1 Study 102 continue to support the potential of NBTXR3 as a single agent activated by radiotherapy for the treatment of elderly patients with head and neck cancer and we look forward to reporting additional milestones from our head and neck cancer franchise studies in 2023.”The first patient in NANORAY-312 was randomized in Europe by Nanobiotix in January of 2022  followed by randomization of the first patient in Asia by Nanobiotix’ strategic collaborator LianBio in August of 2022. The addition of the first patient in the United States completes the Company’s planned study initiation milestones in 2022. Nanobiotix remains focused on expanding the trial’s site footprint  building on the 80 sites currently activated; driving patient recruitment; and preparing for planned milestone reporting in 2023.About NANORAY-312NANORAY-312 is a global  two-arm  randomized  Investigator’s Choice Phase 3 registrational study that is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 with or without cetuximab versus radiotherapy with or without cetuximab in high-risk  platinum-based chemotherapy-ineligible elderly patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HSNCC). Eligible participants will be treated with NBTXR3 at a 1:1 ratio after an Investigator’s Choice of radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy in combination with cetuximab. This pivotal trial is expected to enroll 500 patients globally  with the United States  Europe  and Asia as its major regions. NANORAY-312 is co-led by principal investigators Sue Yom  MD  PhD  Professor and Vice Chair  Strategic Advisory Department of Radiation Oncology; Professor  Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at The University of California  San Francisco  and Christophe Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  senior medical oncologist and head of the Department of Drug Development and Innovation (D3i) at Institut Curie (Paris).NANORAY-312 is being conducted in partnership with LianBio. LianBio is leading clinical development in Asia and holds exclusive rights to develop and commercialize NBTXR3 in Greater China  South Korea  Singapore and Thailand. Nanobiotix is leading clinical and commercial development in all other regions.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy; a phase III global registrational study was launched in 2021; and all major regions planned for the study are currently active and enrolling patients. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the phase III study.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program—beginning with a Company-sponsored phase I clinical study evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/metastatic HNSCC and lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a strategic collaboration strategy with world class partners to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

This is meant to be added to Intercos Group’s portfolio of more than 550 international clients.Made in Switzerland  the DF18+ lineup aims to simplify the skin care routine by offering high performance and technology through its plant-based formulations blending 18 active ingredients. These include patented technological actives  such as Allure Vita  Bionymph Peptide  Cell Pulse and Vita Freeze with antiaging properties  to name a few.The company claims to be the first in the market to boast eight stem cell patented actives for skin care application as well as to source active ingredients from plant cell tissue and extracts via sustainable technology that minimizes natural impact  waste and water consumption.The assortment includes six items that retail from $46 for the Halo Skintranslucent gel-like powder that can act as a primer  makeup base and fixing product to $168 for the Intensive Cream aimed at skin’s cellular rejuvenation.Other products include the antiaging Original Serum  the hydrating and pore refining Velvet Serum  the brightening Silk Serum and the lifting and replumping Balm Serum. The full line comes in minimal white bottles  mostly available in a 30-ml. size.The DF18+ brand already has an e-commerce platform and quietly opened a physical outpost in Milan’s tony Via Santo Spirito  which the company dubbed as its clubhouse.Adorned with displays designed in collaboration with creative director JoAnn Tan and an original Andy Warhol flower series hailing from Ferrari’s private art collection  the flagship offers the full product assortment and services such as a skin analysis test enabling customers to assess their skin condition and personalize their beauty treatment. Aimed at monitoring the skin condition over time  the in-store device has dedicated programs for different areas and offers customized reports  statistics and images to visualize the progress before and after the DF18+ treatment. A skin analysis service is also offered remotely with an online test.Ten years in the making  DF18+ was inspired by Ferrari’s mother  doctor Nadja Avalle. A cosmetic innovator and entrepreneur  she moved to Switzerland and started a career in cosmetic formulation  creating products for luxury brands. For one  she was a pioneer in repurposing flower residues from the perfume industry as raw materials for skin care in the ‘70s  and in 1979 she was elected president of IFCC  the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine. In 1983  Avalle created CRB  a specialist in skin care development and manufacturing  which was acquired by Intercos Group in 2006.According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera  which first reported on the launch on Tuesday  DF18+ leverages technologies Intercos implemented with Arterra Bioscience through their joint venture Vitalab  which dates back to 2010 and is dedicated to the research and development of active ingredients and naturally-derived ingredients based on stem cells  plants and algae  among others.Both Intercos Group and Arterra are listed on the Italian Bourse  with the former debuting on Euronext Milan last year  a few months after inking a five-year agreement with the University of Milano-Bicocca to jointly conduct scientific research on new raw materials  formulations and sustainable processes aimed at developing innovative beauty products.In the first nine months of 2022 ended Sept. 30  Intercos Group’s revenues grew 23 percent to 597.1 million euros compared to the same period last year and were up 15 percent versus the same period in 2019.

This represents another important step in our progress and commitment to provide a new treatment option to ALS patients internationally”.About amyotrophic lateral sclerosisAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disorder that is characterized by progressive loss of the upper and lower motor neurons at the spinal or bulbar level. The disease belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases  which are characterized by the gradual degeneration and death of motor neurons. In ALS  both the upper motor neurons and the lower motor neurons degenerate or die  and stop sending messages to muscles.The prevalence of ALS in western countries is fairly uniform at 6 per 100 000 persons  corresponding to around 30 000 cases in Europe and 20 000 in the USA.Story continuesAbout masitinibMasitinib is an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets mast cells and macrophages  important cells for immunity  through inhibiting a limited number of kinases. Based on its unique mechanism of action  masitinib can be developed in a large number of conditions in oncology  in inflammatory diseases  and in certain diseases of the central nervous system. In oncology due to its immunotherapy effect  masitinib can have an effect on survival  alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Through its activity on mast cells and microglia and consequently the inhibition of the activation of the inflammatory process  masitinib can have an effect on the symptoms associated with some inflammatory and central nervous system diseases and the degeneration of these diseases.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.
