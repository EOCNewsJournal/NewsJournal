This mainly affected claims on counterparties from so-called ‘unfriendly’ states and payments on bonds that were stuck in the international clearing systems Euroclear and Clearstream.A number of banks also had their funds blocked in Russia’s National Settlement Depository (NSD) due to Western sanctions imposed against the NSD earlier this year  the regulator said  expressing doubt that these assets could be recovered.The central bank proposed providing banks with a ten-year extension until 2032 to create reserves to replenish possible losses on the blocked funds. It also added that Russian lenders may ignore the factor of the frozen assets when assessing credit risks.Both the EU and US authorities are currently working on a way to legally confiscate Russian assets frozen as part of Ukraine-related sanctions.The Russian government has described the move as “theft.”For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.04,0.87,0.09,negative,0.0,0.15,0.85,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'Russia', 'chances', 'international clearing systems', 'National Settlement Depository', 'central bank', 'The Bank', 'Western countries', 'unfriendly’ states', 'ten-year extension', 'possible losses', 'Russian lenders', 'credit risks', 'US authorities', 'Russian government', 'business section', 'Western sanctions', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'Russian assets', 'frozen assets', 'Russian banks', 'time', 'reserves', 'event', 'funds', 'Tuesday', 'chances', 'fact', 'regulator', 'portion', 'claims', 'counterparties', 'payments', 'bonds', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'number', 'NSD', 'doubt', 'way', 'move', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2022-12-27,2022-12-28,rt.com

Dec. 27  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext : NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced the first patient in the United States has been randomized in NANORAY-312  a global Phase 3 registrational trial evaluating NBTXR3 for the treatment of elderly patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (“LA-HNSCC”) who are ineligible for platinum-based chemotherapy. NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy will be evaluated alone or in combination with cetuximab. NBTXR3 is a potentially first-in-class radioenhancer with broad application across solid tumors  with prioritized focus in head and neck cancer.“Our pivotal  global Phase 3 NANORAY-312 trial for lead candidate NBTXR3 continues to build momentum with sites now active in the United States  Europe and Asia ” said Laurent Levy  co-founder of Nanobiotix and chairman of the executive board. “NANORAY-312 is the first of our prioritized registrational trials in head and neck cancer and is designed to prove that our innovation can make a difference for elderly patients around the world  a growing patient population with high unmet medical need. We believe data on survival and anti-tumoral response in our proof-of-concept Phase 1 Study 102 continue to support the potential of NBTXR3 as a single agent activated by radiotherapy for the treatment of elderly patients with head and neck cancer and we look forward to reporting additional milestones from our head and neck cancer franchise studies in 2023.”The first patient in NANORAY-312 was randomized in Europe by Nanobiotix in January of 2022  followed by randomization of the first patient in Asia by Nanobiotix’ strategic collaborator LianBio in August of 2022. The addition of the first patient in the United States completes the Company’s planned study initiation milestones in 2022. Nanobiotix remains focused on expanding the trial’s site footprint  building on the 80 sites currently activated; driving patient recruitment; and preparing for planned milestone reporting in 2023.About NANORAY-312NANORAY-312 is a global  two-arm  randomized  Investigator’s Choice Phase 3 registrational study that is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 with or without cetuximab versus radiotherapy with or without cetuximab in high-risk  platinum-based chemotherapy-ineligible elderly patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HSNCC). Eligible participants will be treated with NBTXR3 at a 1:1 ratio after an Investigator’s Choice of radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy in combination with cetuximab. This pivotal trial is expected to enroll 500 patients globally  with the United States  Europe  and Asia as its major regions. NANORAY-312 is co-led by principal investigators Sue Yom  MD  PhD  Professor and Vice Chair  Strategic Advisory Department of Radiation Oncology; Professor  Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at The University of California  San Francisco  and Christophe Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  senior medical oncologist and head of the Department of Drug Development and Innovation (D3i) at Institut Curie (Paris).NANORAY-312 is being conducted in partnership with LianBio. LianBio is leading clinical development in Asia and holds exclusive rights to develop and commercialize NBTXR3 in Greater China  South Korea  Singapore and Thailand. Nanobiotix is leading clinical and commercial development in all other regions.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy; a phase III global registrational study was launched in 2021; and all major regions planned for the study are currently active and enrolling patients. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the phase III study.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program—beginning with a Company-sponsored phase I clinical study evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/metastatic HNSCC and lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a strategic collaboration strategy with world class partners to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity. The company’s philosophy is rooted in the concept of pushing past the boundaries of what is known to expand possibilities for human life.Incorporated in 2003  Nanobiotix is headquartered in Paris  France.

This represents another important step in our progress and commitment to provide a new treatment option to ALS patients internationally”.About amyotrophic lateral sclerosisAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disorder that is characterized by progressive loss of the upper and lower motor neurons at the spinal or bulbar level. The disease belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases  which are characterized by the gradual degeneration and death of motor neurons. In ALS  both the upper motor neurons and the lower motor neurons degenerate or die  and stop sending messages to muscles.The prevalence of ALS in western countries is fairly uniform at 6 per 100 000 persons  corresponding to around 30 000 cases in Europe and 20 000 in the USA.About masitinibMasitinib is an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets mast cells and macrophages  important cells for immunity  through inhibiting a limited number of kinases. Based on its unique mechanism of action  masitinib can be developed in a large number of conditions in oncology  in inflammatory diseases  and in certain diseases of the central nervous system. In oncology due to its immunotherapy effect  masitinib can have an effect on survival  alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Through its activity on mast cells and microglia and consequently the inhibition of the activation of the inflammatory process  masitinib can have an effect on the symptoms associated with some inflammatory and central nervous system diseases and the degeneration of these diseases.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

Dec. 27  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext : NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced the first patient in the United States has been randomized in NANORAY-312  a global Phase 3 registrational trial evaluating NBTXR3 for the treatment of elderly patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (“LA-HNSCC”) who are ineligible for platinum-based chemotherapy. NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy will be evaluated alone or in combination with cetuximab. NBTXR3 is a potentially first-in-class radioenhancer with broad application across solid tumors  with prioritized focus in head and neck cancer.“Our pivotal  global Phase 3 NANORAY-312 trial for lead candidate NBTXR3 continues to build momentum with sites now active in the United States  Europe and Asia ” said Laurent Levy  co-founder of Nanobiotix and chairman of the executive board. “NANORAY-312 is the first of our prioritized registrational trials in head and neck cancer and is designed to prove that our innovation can make a difference for elderly patients around the world  a growing patient population with high unmet medical need. We believe data on survival and anti-tumoral response in our proof-of-concept Phase 1 Study 102 continue to support the potential of NBTXR3 as a single agent activated by radiotherapy for the treatment of elderly patients with head and neck cancer and we look forward to reporting additional milestones from our head and neck cancer franchise studies in 2023.”The first patient in NANORAY-312 was randomized in Europe by Nanobiotix in January of 2022  followed by randomization of the first patient in Asia by Nanobiotix’ strategic collaborator LianBio in August of 2022. The addition of the first patient in the United States completes the Company’s planned study initiation milestones in 2022. Nanobiotix remains focused on expanding the trial’s site footprint  building on the 80 sites currently activated; driving patient recruitment; and preparing for planned milestone reporting in 2023.About NANORAY-312NANORAY-312 is a global  two-arm  randomized  Investigator’s Choice Phase 3 registrational study that is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 with or without cetuximab versus radiotherapy with or without cetuximab in high-risk  platinum-based chemotherapy-ineligible elderly patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HSNCC). Eligible participants will be treated with NBTXR3 at a 1:1 ratio after an Investigator’s Choice of radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy in combination with cetuximab. This pivotal trial is expected to enroll 500 patients globally  with the United States  Europe  and Asia as its major regions. NANORAY-312 is co-led by principal investigators Sue Yom  MD  PhD  Professor and Vice Chair  Strategic Advisory Department of Radiation Oncology; Professor  Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at The University of California  San Francisco  and Christophe Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  senior medical oncologist and head of the Department of Drug Development and Innovation (D3i) at Institut Curie (Paris).NANORAY-312 is being conducted in partnership with LianBio. LianBio is leading clinical development in Asia and holds exclusive rights to develop and commercialize NBTXR3 in Greater China  South Korea  Singapore and Thailand. Nanobiotix is leading clinical and commercial development in all other regions.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy; a phase III global registrational study was launched in 2021; and all major regions planned for the study are currently active and enrolling patients. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the phase III study.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program—beginning with a Company-sponsored phase I clinical study evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/metastatic HNSCC and lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a strategic collaboration strategy with world class partners to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

15522,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/skin-care/dario-ferrari-launches-skin-care-brand-df18-1235456407/,Dario Ferrari Launches Skin Care Brand DF18+,The personal venture of Intercos Group's founder  the brand aims to simplify the skin care routine with highly efficient formulations based on blends of 18 plant actives.,MILAN — Intercos Group’s founder and president Dario Ferrari has launched a new skin care brand  dubbed DF18+.The entrepreneur  who built an empire supplying beauty products to multinationals and emerging brands for the past 50 years  has quietly introduced his personal venture. This is meant to be added to Intercos Group’s portfolio of more than 550 international clients.Made in Switzerland  the DF18+ lineup aims to simplify the skin care routine by offering high performance and technology through its plant-based formulations blending 18 active ingredients. These include patented technological actives  such as Allure Vita  Bionymph Peptide  Cell Pulse and Vita Freeze with antiaging properties  to name a few.The company claims to be the first in the market to boast eight stem cell patented actives for skin care application as well as to source active ingredients from plant cell tissue and extracts via sustainable technology that minimizes natural impact  waste and water consumption.The assortment includes six items that retail from $46 for the Halo Skintranslucent gel-like powder that can act as a primer  makeup base and fixing product to $168 for the Intensive Cream aimed at skin’s cellular rejuvenation.Other products include the antiaging Original Serum  the hydrating and pore refining Velvet Serum  the brightening Silk Serum and the lifting and replumping Balm Serum. The full line comes in minimal white bottles  mostly available in a 30-ml. size.The DF18+ brand already has an e-commerce platform and quietly opened a physical outpost in Milan’s tony Via Santo Spirito  which the company dubbed as its clubhouse.Adorned with displays designed in collaboration with creative director JoAnn Tan and an original Andy Warhol flower series hailing from Ferrari’s private art collection  the flagship offers the full product assortment and services such as a skin analysis test enabling customers to assess their skin condition and personalize their beauty treatment. Aimed at monitoring the skin condition over time  the in-store device has dedicated programs for different areas and offers customized reports  statistics and images to visualize the progress before and after the DF18+ treatment. A skin analysis service is also offered remotely with an online test.Ten years in the making  DF18+ was inspired by Ferrari’s mother  doctor Nadja Avalle. A cosmetic innovator and entrepreneur  she moved to Switzerland and started a career in cosmetic formulation  creating products for luxury brands. For one  she was a pioneer in repurposing flower residues from the perfume industry as raw materials for skin care in the ‘70s  and in 1979 she was elected president of IFCC  the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine. In 1983  Avalle created CRB  a specialist in skin care development and manufacturing  which was acquired by Intercos Group in 2006.According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera  which first reported on the launch on Tuesday  DF18+ leverages technologies Intercos implemented with Arterra Bioscience through their joint venture Vitalab  which dates back to 2010 and is dedicated to the research and development of active ingredients and naturally-derived ingredients based on stem cells  plants and algae  among others.Both Intercos Group and Arterra are listed on the Italian Bourse  with the former debuting on Euronext Milan last year  a few months after inking a five-year agreement with the University of Milano-Bicocca to jointly conduct scientific research on new raw materials  formulations and sustainable processes aimed at developing innovative beauty products.In the first nine months of 2022 ended Sept. 30  Intercos Group’s revenues grew 23 percent to 597.1 million euros compared to the same period last year and were up 15 percent versus the same period in 2019.

A number of banks had their funds blocked in the NSD due to EU sanctions imposed against the depository earlier this year.“Short deadlines  vague wording in permits and the complexity of the unblocking procedure do not give confidence that Western regulators are ready to ensure the right of Russian investors to dispose of their property ” the regulator said  and advised investors to wait for notifications from their brokers or custodians on the results of the unblocking process.Euroclear and Clearstream ceased transactions with NSD's accounts on February 28 and blocked them on June 3  following the inclusion of the depository on the Ukraine-related EU sanctions list.In September  the Russian depository applied to the Belgian and Luxembourg finance ministries for general licenses  seeking to unlock the assets. On Tuesday  the Bank of Russia assessed the chances of Western countries returning Russian assets as “extremely low” despite the fact that they haven’t been legally confiscated.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,negative,0.02,0.35,0.63,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,True,English,"['Non-sanctioned Russians', 'central bank', 'assets', 'EU', 'Ukraine-related EU sanctions list', 'international clearing systems', 'Luxembourg finance ministries', 'certain frozen funds', 'National Settlement Depository', 'sanctioned Russian investors', 'Western institutions', 'investors’ rights', 'unblocked funds', 'economic resources', 'general license', 'Short deadlines', 'vague wording', 'unblocking procedure', 'Western regulators', 'unblocking process', 'Western countries', 'business section', 'Russian depository', 'Russian regulator', 'central bank', 'Russian assets', 'confidence', 'Permits', 'Clearstream', 'NSD', 'country', 'statement', 'Wednesday', 'Belgian', 'release', 'number', 'banks', 'complexity', 'property', 'notifications', 'brokers', 'custodians', 'results', 'Euroclear', 'transactions', 'accounts', 'February', 'June', 'inclusion', 'September', 'Tuesday', 'chances', 'fact', 'stories', 'economy']",2022-12-28,2022-12-28,rt.com

Under the terms of the agreement  Néovacs could become a reference shareholder of Pharnext as of January 1  2024.This new financing agreement is a partial or total complement to the OCEANE-BSA financing granted by Global Tech Opportunities 13 (""GTO 13""). As a reminder  Pharnext SA and GTO 13 entered into an Agreement for the issuance of and subscription to warrants giving access to notes convertible into new and/or existing shares with share subscription warrants attached (""Bons d'émission d'obligations convertibles ou echangeables en actions nouvelles et/ou existantes avec bons de souscription d'actions attachés"") dated June 4  2021. According to this agreement  as subsequently amended and described in the press release published on October 3rd  2022  GTO 13 has undertaken to subscribe in cash for tranches of OCEANE-BSAs for a net amount of €2 million per month  starting in December 2022 and ending in December 2023 inclusive (i.e. thirteen tranches for a maximum total of €26 million).Story continuesThe subscription undertaking for each tranche is subject to certain conditions (including  in addition to certain customary conditions  Pharnext's market capitalization not dropping below €2 million over a period of ten days preceding the payment of each tranche and GTO 13's holding of Pharnext securities being below 400% of the market capitalization as a result of the payment of the tranche). The GTO 13 Investment Committee did not approve the disbursement of the 12th tranche of €2 million  planned for the end of December 2022  noting that the agreed conditions precedent had not been met. However  Néovacs  through the trust managing its financing contract with Pharnext  has agreed to subscribe to the €1 million tranche scheduled for late December.In this context  Néovacs has committed to compensate for the non-drawing of the 12th tranche with a cash injection of up to €2 million by the end of January. This contribution will be made in the form of a current-account contribution of associates  the terms of which have yet to be defined according to actual needs for the month of January  and which are currently being studied. Pharnext expects to re-engage the financing agreement with GTO 13 once the conditions precedent would be met again.In parallel  Pharnext and GTO 13 have initiated discussions with a view to amicably terminating their previous agreements in the event of the signature of an agreement with a strategic industrial partner (see below).Appointment of Hugo Brugière as Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerTo underscore Néovacs' strong commitment  the Board of Directors of Pharnext has unanimously decided to appoint Hugo Brugière as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to replace Joshua Schafer  who remains a Director of the Company.Hugo is a graduate of the Saint-Cyr Special Military School and Sciences Po Paris. A serial entrepreneur with more than twenty companies to his credit  he has specialized for several years in stock market and restructuring/turnarounds with listed companies. Notably  he is an executive of Boostheat  Cybergun  Néovacs and Verney-Carron  all of which are listed on Euronext in Paris  and of the investment funds HBR Investment Group and Dionae Investment.Hugo Brugière will ensure the continuity of the development of the Company and PXT3003  which is currently in development in a pivotal Phase III clinical study in patients with CMT1A  the PREMIER trial  with results expected in Q4 2023. He will focus on optimizing the operational structure and investments in order to control cash flow and related financing needs.Search for a strategic industrial partnerThis increased support from Néovacs is intended to allow Pharnext to begin a search for a strategic industrial partner at a time when the Board of Directors considers that the Company has reached a sufficient degree of maturity to develop its assets and commercial potential. Indeed  if the topline results of the current study are positive  they will form the basis of a marketing authorization application for the treatment of CMT1A with the FDA in the United States and the EMA in Europe.This valuation could be done in the context of a capital transaction that could eventually lead to a takeover of the Company. Pharnext currently favors an agreement with a player in the pharmaceutical industry.In order to optimize this search  Pharnext's Board of Directors have decided to form an ad hoc committee  consisting of Joshua Schafer  Director  James Kuo  Director  Rob Quinn  CFO and Xavier Paoli  COO. Joshua has led successful M&A transactions in excess of $16 billion. James has raised several rounds of financing as Managing Director and led HealthCare Ventures  a $378 million venture capital fund. Rob has raised over €200 million in financing to date and Xavier will bring his knowledge of PXT3003 after working 9 years at the Company.In this context  Pharnext plans to have an independent financial analysis performed by a recognized research firm in order to determine the intrinsic value and the target price.Pharnext will inform the market of any progress in respect of its financial communication obligations and of any confidentiality agreements signed with potential partners.Hugo Bruguière  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pharnext  declared: ""In my opinion  for the time being  Pharnext is one of the French biotech companies with the greatest potential. It was unbelievable that the Company would find itself in difficulty and that is why Néovacs decided to support it. It is now time for Pharnext to turn the page on convertible bond financing and to find a leading industrial partner which will allow us to potentially obtain marketing authorization for our treatment  PXT3003 in CMT1A  and to launch its commercialization as soon as possible. I am convinced that Pharnext is now on the right track.""About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases that currently lack curative and/or disease-modifying treatments. Pharnext has two lead products in clinical development. PXT3003 completed an international Phase III trial with positive topline results for the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (‘CMT1A') and benefits from orphan drug status in Europe and the United States. An international pivotal Phase III study of PXT3003 in CMT1A  the PREMIER trial  is currently ongoing. PXT864 has generated encouraging Phase II results in Alzheimer's disease and will be advanced through partnerships. Both of Pharnext's lead assets originated from the Pleotherapy™ R&D approach.

(renamed Vivani Medical  Inc.) following the latter's withdrawal from the proposed business combination between the two companies1 on April 2  2021.In the judgment delivered on December 8  2022  the Paris Commercial Court held that Second Sight Medical Products had breached its contractual obligations under the memorandum of understanding (MoU) entered into between the two companies on January 5  2021  by requesting that an investment banking firm carry out a transaction in competition with the transaction contemplated under the MoU. As a result  the Paris Commercial Court ordered the termination of the MoU on the grounds of Second Sight Medical Products’ sole breach.Pursuant to this judgment  which may be provisionally enforced  the Paris Commercial Court granted Pixium Vision’s main claims and ordered Second Sight Medical Products to pay Pixium Vision:the sum of €2 000 000 for expenses Pixium Vision incurred in connection with the proposed business combination;the sum of €500 000 for the image and reputational damage sustained by Pixium Vision due to Second Sight Medical Products’ withdrawal from this transaction; andthe sum of €30 000 pursuant to Article 700 of the French Code of Civil Procedure  as well as all costs of the suit.The Paris Commercial Court also decided that this total amount of €2 530 000 is to be reduced by US$1 000 000 (converted into euros at the exchange rate on December 8  2022  i.e.  approximately €950 000) that Pixium Vision had already received from Second Sight Medical Products in April 2021.Pixium Vision is pleased with the decision of the Paris Commercial Court  which is subject to appeal.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.
