A number of banks had their funds blocked in the NSD due to EU sanctions imposed against the depository earlier this year.“Short deadlines  vague wording in permits and the complexity of the unblocking procedure do not give confidence that Western regulators are ready to ensure the right of Russian investors to dispose of their property ” the regulator said  and advised investors to wait for notifications from their brokers or custodians on the results of the unblocking process.Euroclear and Clearstream ceased transactions with NSD's accounts on February 28 and blocked them on June 3  following the inclusion of the depository on the Ukraine-related EU sanctions list.In September  the Russian depository applied to the Belgian and Luxembourg finance ministries for general licenses  seeking to unlock the assets. On Tuesday  the Bank of Russia assessed the chances of Western countries returning Russian assets as “extremely low” despite the fact that they haven’t been legally confiscated.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,negative,0.02,0.35,0.63,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,True,English,"['Non-sanctioned Russians', 'central bank', 'assets', 'EU', 'Ukraine-related EU sanctions list', 'international clearing systems', 'Luxembourg finance ministries', 'certain frozen funds', 'National Settlement Depository', 'sanctioned Russian investors', 'Western institutions', 'investors’ rights', 'unblocked funds', 'economic resources', 'general license', 'Short deadlines', 'vague wording', 'unblocking procedure', 'Western regulators', 'unblocking process', 'Western countries', 'business section', 'Russian depository', 'Russian regulator', 'central bank', 'Russian assets', 'confidence', 'Permits', 'Clearstream', 'NSD', 'country', 'statement', 'Wednesday', 'Belgian', 'release', 'number', 'banks', 'complexity', 'property', 'notifications', 'brokers', 'custodians', 'results', 'Euroclear', 'transactions', 'accounts', 'February', 'June', 'inclusion', 'September', 'Tuesday', 'chances', 'fact', 'stories', 'economy']",2022-12-28,2022-12-29,rt.com

Under the terms of the agreement  Néovacs could become a reference shareholder of Pharnext as of January 1  2024.This new financing agreement is a partial or total complement to the OCEANE-BSA financing granted by Global Tech Opportunities 13 (""GTO 13""). As a reminder  Pharnext SA and GTO 13 entered into an Agreement for the issuance of and subscription to warrants giving access to notes convertible into new and/or existing shares with share subscription warrants attached (""Bons d'émission d'obligations convertibles ou echangeables en actions nouvelles et/ou existantes avec bons de souscription d'actions attachés"") dated June 4  2021. According to this agreement  as subsequently amended and described in the press release published on October 3rd  2022  GTO 13 has undertaken to subscribe in cash for tranches of OCEANE-BSAs for a net amount of €2 million per month  starting in December 2022 and ending in December 2023 inclusive (i.e. thirteen tranches for a maximum total of €26 million).Story continuesThe subscription undertaking for each tranche is subject to certain conditions (including  in addition to certain customary conditions  Pharnext's market capitalization not dropping below €2 million over a period of ten days preceding the payment of each tranche and GTO 13's holding of Pharnext securities being below 400% of the market capitalization as a result of the payment of the tranche). The GTO 13 Investment Committee did not approve the disbursement of the 12th tranche of €2 million  planned for the end of December 2022  noting that the agreed conditions precedent had not been met. However  Néovacs  through the trust managing its financing contract with Pharnext  has agreed to subscribe to the €1 million tranche scheduled for late December.In this context  Néovacs has committed to compensate for the non-drawing of the 12th tranche with a cash injection of up to €2 million by the end of January. This contribution will be made in the form of a current-account contribution of associates  the terms of which have yet to be defined according to actual needs for the month of January  and which are currently being studied. Pharnext expects to re-engage the financing agreement with GTO 13 once the conditions precedent would be met again.In parallel  Pharnext and GTO 13 have initiated discussions with a view to amicably terminating their previous agreements in the event of the signature of an agreement with a strategic industrial partner (see below).Appointment of Hugo Brugière as Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerTo underscore Néovacs' strong commitment  the Board of Directors of Pharnext has unanimously decided to appoint Hugo Brugière as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to replace Joshua Schafer  who remains a Director of the Company.Hugo is a graduate of the Saint-Cyr Special Military School and Sciences Po Paris. A serial entrepreneur with more than twenty companies to his credit  he has specialized for several years in stock market and restructuring/turnarounds with listed companies. Notably  he is an executive of Boostheat  Cybergun  Néovacs and Verney-Carron  all of which are listed on Euronext in Paris  and of the investment funds HBR Investment Group and Dionae Investment.Hugo Brugière will ensure the continuity of the development of the Company and PXT3003  which is currently in development in a pivotal Phase III clinical study in patients with CMT1A  the PREMIER trial  with results expected in Q4 2023. He will focus on optimizing the operational structure and investments in order to control cash flow and related financing needs.Search for a strategic industrial partnerThis increased support from Néovacs is intended to allow Pharnext to begin a search for a strategic industrial partner at a time when the Board of Directors considers that the Company has reached a sufficient degree of maturity to develop its assets and commercial potential. Indeed  if the topline results of the current study are positive  they will form the basis of a marketing authorization application for the treatment of CMT1A with the FDA in the United States and the EMA in Europe.This valuation could be done in the context of a capital transaction that could eventually lead to a takeover of the Company. Pharnext currently favors an agreement with a player in the pharmaceutical industry.In order to optimize this search  Pharnext's Board of Directors have decided to form an ad hoc committee  consisting of Joshua Schafer  Director  James Kuo  Director  Rob Quinn  CFO and Xavier Paoli  COO. Joshua has led successful M&A transactions in excess of $16 billion. James has raised several rounds of financing as Managing Director and led HealthCare Ventures  a $378 million venture capital fund. Rob has raised over €200 million in financing to date and Xavier will bring his knowledge of PXT3003 after working 9 years at the Company.In this context  Pharnext plans to have an independent financial analysis performed by a recognized research firm in order to determine the intrinsic value and the target price.Pharnext will inform the market of any progress in respect of its financial communication obligations and of any confidentiality agreements signed with potential partners.Hugo Bruguière  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pharnext  declared: ""In my opinion  for the time being  Pharnext is one of the French biotech companies with the greatest potential. It was unbelievable that the Company would find itself in difficulty and that is why Néovacs decided to support it. It is now time for Pharnext to turn the page on convertible bond financing and to find a leading industrial partner which will allow us to potentially obtain marketing authorization for our treatment  PXT3003 in CMT1A  and to launch its commercialization as soon as possible. I am convinced that Pharnext is now on the right track.""About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases that currently lack curative and/or disease-modifying treatments. Pharnext has two lead products in clinical development. PXT3003 completed an international Phase III trial with positive topline results for the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (‘CMT1A') and benefits from orphan drug status in Europe and the United States. An international pivotal Phase III study of PXT3003 in CMT1A  the PREMIER trial  is currently ongoing. PXT864 has generated encouraging Phase II results in Alzheimer's disease and will be advanced through partnerships. Both of Pharnext's lead assets originated from the Pleotherapy™ R&D approach. Pharnext draws the attention of investors to the financial and other risk factors detailed in its financial reports.

A number of banks had their funds blocked in the NSD due to EU sanctions imposed against the depository earlier this year.“Short deadlines  vague wording in permits and the complexity of the unblocking procedure do not give confidence that Western regulators are ready to ensure the right of Russian investors to dispose of their property ” the regulator said  and advised investors to wait for notifications from their brokers or custodians on the results of the unblocking process.Euroclear and Clearstream ceased transactions with NSD's accounts on February 28 and blocked them on June 3  following the inclusion of the depository on the Ukraine-related EU sanctions list.In September  the Russian depository applied to the Belgian and Luxembourg finance ministries for general licenses  seeking to unlock the assets. On Tuesday  the Bank of Russia assessed the chances of Western countries returning Russian assets as “extremely low” despite the fact that they haven’t been legally confiscated.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,negative,0.02,0.35,0.63,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,True,English,"['Non-sanctioned Russians', 'central bank', 'assets', 'EU', 'Ukraine-related EU sanctions list', 'international clearing systems', 'Luxembourg finance ministries', 'certain frozen funds', 'National Settlement Depository', 'sanctioned Russian investors', 'Western institutions', 'investors’ rights', 'unblocked funds', 'economic resources', 'general license', 'Short deadlines', 'vague wording', 'unblocking procedure', 'Western regulators', 'unblocking process', 'Western countries', 'business section', 'Russian depository', 'Russian regulator', 'central bank', 'Russian assets', 'confidence', 'Permits', 'Clearstream', 'NSD', 'country', 'statement', 'Wednesday', 'Belgian', 'release', 'number', 'banks', 'complexity', 'property', 'notifications', 'brokers', 'custodians', 'results', 'Euroclear', 'transactions', 'accounts', 'February', 'June', 'inclusion', 'September', 'Tuesday', 'chances', 'fact', 'stories', 'economy']",2022-12-28,2022-12-29,rt.com

As part of our ‘Mission 2027’ plan launched in November 2022 we plan to double our revenue. The various crises having occurred since the beginning of 2020 require us to pay particular attention to the financial resources needed to reduce operational risks and ramp up the marketing of our innovations. The €2.4 million raised in ‘quasi-equity’ supplements long-term debt financing currently under negotiation  which will cover the needs of our current and future growth.”Main features of the bond issuesThe issue of the convertible bonds was decided today by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  using the sub-delegation granted to him on 27 December 2022 by the Board of Directors  itself using the delegation granted to it by the Company’s General Shareholders’ Meeting of 31 August 2022[2] under the 19th resolution with regard to the issue of convertible bonds.The convertible bonds and simple bonds were subscribed at 92% and 100% of their nominal value  respectively. They will not bear interest and will mature on 28 December 2024.The amount of cash related to the issue of convertible bonds is €2.4 million and will be paid in full on 30/12/2022.The amount of cash related to the issue of simple bonds will be €2.6 million  paid in one instalment at the time of the lifting (or waiver) of the conditions precedent  before the end of September 2023.The conversion price of the convertible bonds will depend on the stock market price at the time of conversion[3] in accordance with the price rule and the ceiling set by the General Meeting.In the event that the bonds have not been fully converted and/or redeemed at maturity  they will be repaid in full by the Company for 100% of their nominal value.For information purposes  if all the convertible bonds were converted on the basis of the 2CRSi share price at the close of 27 December 2022[4]  the stake of a shareholder holding 1.00% of the capital of 2CRSi before implementation would become 0.95% of the capital on an undiluted basis and 0.90% of the capital on a diluted basis (taking into account existing dilutive instruments).The new shares resulting from the conversion of convertible bonds will be subject to all the provisions set out in the articles of association  will be fully assimilated to the old ordinary shares  and will enjoy the same rights.The bonds will not be the subject of any request for admission to trading on Euronext Growth.This transaction does not require the drafting of a prospectus to be submitted for approval to the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority).The deal was advised and structured by Vester Finance  which also subscribed to the two bond issues.RISK FACTORSThe risk factors affecting the Company are detailed in paragraph 5.2 of the 2021-2022 Universal Registration Document as published by the Company on 7 September 2022 and available on the Company’s website (at https://investors.2crsi.com/fr/rapports-annuels-et-prospectus/).About 2CRSiFounded in Strasbourg (France)  the 2CRSi Group develops  produces and sells customised  high-performance and environmentally-friendly servers.

This is a randomized  double-blind  Phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) or non-active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (nSPMS).The study will enroll 800 patients from numerous study centers with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 3.0 to 6.0 and absence of T1 Gadolinium-enhancing brain lesions. The primary endpoint of the study is the effect of masitinib on time to confirmed disability progression. The objective of this study is to confirm positive results from the phase 2B/3 study (AB07002). [1]Masitinib is positioned in progressive forms of the disease (PPMS or nSPMS). Currently  there is only one approved treatment for primary progressive forms and none for non-active secondary progressive forms  which account for approximately 15% and 35% of MS cases respectively  approximately 500 000 patients in the US and Europe.Masitinib targets microglia and mast cells  which are two cells of the innate immune system associated with the pathology of progressive MS. The mechanism of action of masitinib is different from and potentially complementary to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors being developed in multiple sclerosis  such as BTK inhibitors  which target B cells.Professor Patrick Vermersch  MD  principal investigator of the study and Professor of Neurology at the University of Lille  France said: “We are very pleased to receive FDA approval for this confirmatory study. This demonstrates interest from the health authorities in the masitinib program in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis and more broadly in neurodegenerative diseases  and also their acknowledgement that masitinib has viable neuroprotective role via its mechanism of action  which we believe is supported by the scientific and clinical data”.[1] Vermersch P  Brieva-Ruiz L  Fox RJ  et al. Efficacy and Safety of Masitinib in Progressive Forms of Multiple Sclerosis: A Randomized  Phase 3  Clinical Trial. Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm 2022;9:e1148. doi:10.1212/NXI.0000000000001148About the results of the previous phase 2B/3 study AB07002The study AB07002 met its primary analysis endpoint  demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in cumulative change on EDSS with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day (p=0.0256). This treatment-effect was consistent for PPMS and nSPMS. In addition  masitinib significantly reduced the risk of first disability progression by 42% and the risk of confirmed (3 months) disability progression by 37%. Masitinib also significantly reduced the risk of reaching an EDSS score of 7.0  corresponding to disability severe enough that the patient is restricted to a wheelchair (p=0.0093). The product's safety was consistent with the known risk profile of masitinib  with no elevated risk of infection  which may be an advantage over other drugs used in multiple sclerosis  many of which carry an increased risk of infectious complications.About multiple sclerosisMultiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system and the leading cause of non-traumatic neurological disability in young and middle-aged adults. Multiple sclerosis affects approximately 2.5 million people worldwide  including more than 100 000 people in France. It is characterized by a progressive degradation of the nerve cells of the central nervous system by the patient's immune system and comes in two main forms.The relapsing-remitting form characterized by relapses of the disease. Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis includes secondary progressive active multiple sclerosis. During these relapses  patients experience the onset of new symptoms or the worsening of symptoms already present. These flare-ups are usually followed by recovery periods of varying length  after which some symptoms may persist. The relapsing-remitting forms of multiple sclerosis are mostly associated with dysfunctions of adaptive immunity (B cells and T cells).The progressive form   characterized by a constant and regular worsening of the symptoms of the disease  without a distinct relapse or period of recovery. Progressive multiple sclerosis includes non-active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis The rate of onset of severe  disabling  and irreversible disability is much higher in the progressive forms of the disease than in the relapsing remitting forms. In progressive multiple sclerosis  innate immune cells such as macrophages  microglia or mast cells have been shown to probably play a major role.A high medical need in progressive forms of multiple sclerosisPatients with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis have a reduced life expectancy compared to the general population. The progressive worsening of neurological disability since the onset of the disease is associated with a significant reduction in quality of life and usually requires the use of a wheelchair for a large part of the patient's life. There is currently no cure for multiple sclerosis. The vast majority of registered therapies for multiple sclerosis that affect the course of the disease are only effective in relapsing forms of the disease (relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis or active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis) and have not been shown to be effective in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (primary progressive multiple sclerosis or non-active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis). There are currently no approved therapies for the population targeted by studies AB07002 and AB20009  i.e. non-active progressive MS.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

BioChaperone Lispro was compared with Humalog (insulin lispro) and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of BioChaperone Lispro were significantly faster. Moreover  BioChaperone Lispro confirmed its good tolerability and safety profiles. ""These results confirm once again the robustness of our technology and the advantages of our product in comparison to the global market leader of mealtime insulin""  said Olivier Soula  Adocia's Deputy CEO. ""We would like to thank our partner Tonghua Dongbao for its rigorous execution of the clinical development plan  including on ongoing Phase 3 studies."" Conducted in parallel of the Phases 3  this Phase 1 study was conducted in an open label  positive control  randomized  crossover trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single dose of BioChaperone Lispro in healthy Chinese volunteers. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate whether a BioChaperone Lispro injection has a faster absorption and onset of action compared to an insulin Lispro injection.Adocia licensed BioChaperone Lispro to Tonghua Dongbao for China and major Asian territories that represents 200 million people suffering from diabetes1  with an estimated 20 million using insulin daily for their survival. In 2021  the Chinese insulin market represented more than US$5 billion2. About BioChaperone® Lispro BioChaperone® (BC) Lispro is an Ultra-Rapid Insulin obtained by combining Adocia's proprietary BioChaperone technology with the rapid-acting market leader insulin lispro (as contained in the commercial product Humalog®). Distributed more rapidly into the bloodstream than previous generations of insulins  BC Lispro reduces post-meal hyperglycemic excursions that are responsible for long-term comorbidities such as retinopathy  diabetic foot ulcer  and kidney failure. Moreover  as BC Lispro is eliminated faster from the body  it may also reduce the risk of hypoglycemic events that are caused when insulin remains too long in the bloodstream after the post-meal hyperglycemia peak has declined. On top of its direct clinical benefits  the onset of action of BC Lispro results in improved quality of life with more dose-timing flexibility at mealtime. A mealtime injection  or even right-after-mealtime  enables patients to better determine the appropriate insulin dose as the exact timing and contents of their meal are known. This avoids overdosing or delayed dosing  which can lead to hypo- or hyperglycemia respectively  and prevents the severe short and long-term consequences. It significantly reduces the stress and the mental load of those affected by insulin-dependent diabetes and their caretakers which is important in day-to-day life. Currently  the only drugs providing similar effects in the world are Fiasp® from Novo Nordisk Co. and Lyumjev® from Eli Lilly and Company. Fiasp® and Lyumjev® are not marketed in China. Since licensing BC Lispro to Tonghua Dongbao in 2018  Adocia has already received $15 million in upfront fees and a milestone payment for the first patient dosed in Phase 3. The agreement also includes up to $30 million additional development milestones and double-digit royalties on sales to be paid to Adocia by Tonghua Dongbao. BC Lispro is currently being studied in a large Phase 3 program that consists of two studies treating people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in more than 100 clinical centers across China and will enroll a total of c. 1 300 patients. The aim of this program is to demonstrate safety and efficacy of BC Lispro in comparison to standard of care (Humalog®). Results of this program will then be submitted to the Chinese Regulatory Authorities by Tonghua Dongbao to obtain marketing authorization. BC Lispro is patent protected until 2033.

Ce…,NEW YORK  Dec. 29  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Following the formation of Mayflower Bioventures  a cell and gene therapy accelerator stood up from Hibiscus BioVentures and Mayo Clinic  comes the launch of their first start-up  Primera Therapeutics  Inc. (Primera). Cellectis (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - Nasdaq: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its gene editing platform to deliver life-saving cell and gene therapies  and Primera announced today the execution of a Collaboration Agreement under which the Parties will work collaboratively to edit mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in vivo to treat the root cause of associated diseases.Inherited mitochondrial diseases caused by genetic changes in the mtDNA have very limited to no treatment options  and often result in early childhood death. An estimated 1 in 5 000 people worldwide suffer from mtDNA – associated diseases. Primera is advancing pioneering mtDNA gene editing therapies developed in the Mayo Clinic lab of Drs. Steven Ekker and Karl Clark to precisely fix a patient’s mutated mtDNA and potentially achieve a cure for the disease. Primera’s initial clinical focus is on rare mitochondrial diseases for which there are no approved treatments. Mayo Clinic excels in delivering and developing advanced care for complex diseases including the interdisciplinary research and clinical treatment through its Mitochondrial Care Research Center.“We are thrilled to launch Primera through Mayflower Bioventures and power it with the research and treatment expertise at Mayo Clinic and through collaborations with leading industry partners such as Cellectis  alongside a wonderful group of academic centers and nonprofit partners ” noted Dr. Stephen Ekker  Dean of the Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and a key scientific inventor and thought leader for Primera. “It requires a team effort to drive this program forward into the clinic and for patients who are suffering with these dreadful diseases.”Primera  together with Cellectis  will be co-developing a mtDNA engineering toolbox that could enable effective therapies for mitochondrial diseases. The experience Cellectis brings in groundbreaking gene editing research  technology  manufacturing and clinical development will be invaluable in moving quickly to advance these programs and mitochondrial research forward.The Collaboration Agreement should be supplemented by other agreements to be concluded between the Parties  under which Cellectis would receive a 19% equity ownership stake in Primera and would take a seat on Primera’s Board of Directors.Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement  Primera has a right to exercise an exclusive worldwide option for a license from Cellectis on up to five product candidates developed under the collaboration (the “partnership products”). Upon Primera exercising the option  Cellectis will be eligible for up to $750 million of development and sales milestones for the partnership products  as well as high single-digit royalty payments on the net sales of partnership products.“Our partnership with Primera further showcases and expands the application of our gene-editing capabilities into a previously unexplored space. This partnership is very much in line with Cellectis’ mission to leverage its gene editing technologies to develop potentially life-saving product candidates to address unmet medical needs ” said André Choulika  Ph.D.  CEO of Cellectis.Along with Cellectis and Mayo Clinic  Primera is collaborating with patient advocacy groups including the United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation (UMDF). UMDF  the largest source of funding for mitochondrial disease research outside of the government  promotes research and education for the diagnosis  treatment and cure of mitochondrial disorders and supports affected individuals and families. “UMDF is proud to partner with Primera. We are closely aligned in our vision of driving the development and application of technologies to address the needs of those currently suffering from mitochondrial genetic diseases ” noted Philip Yeske  PhD.  Science and Alliance Officer for UMDF.Marni Falk  MD  Executive Director of the Mitochondrial Medicine Frontier Program at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia  Professor of Pediatrics at University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine  and Clinical Geneticist serves as a Clinical and Scientific Research Advisor to Primera and sees the Cellectis and Primera collaboration as providing new hope for mitochondrial disease patients. “I have dedicated my career to building a team focused on research  development  translation  clinical development and patient management of mitochondrial disease  encompassing novel diagnostics and treatments. As there currently are no highly effective treatments  we are largely limited to offering supportive therapy. We see over 1 300 patients from around the world in our mitochondrial medicine clinic each year  including both adults and children suffering from these devastating multi-system diseases. Through an interdisciplinary approach  we collaborate in performing groundbreaking research and development of technologies  such as Primera’s  that may have the potential to be disease-modifying and address the needs of those currently battling energy deficiency from genetic-based primary mitochondrial diseases.”Primera is dedicated to advancing its programs to be first into the clinic that will apply gene editing technologies directly to mitochondrial mutations that drive mitochondrial disease and in the future  potentially broader diseases with central components of mitochondrial dysfunction.About Mitochondrial Disease (CHOP.edu)It is estimated that every 30 minutes  a child is born who will develop a mitochondrial disorder by age 10. Overall  approximately 1 in every 4 300 individuals in the United States has a mitochondrial disease. Mitochondrial diseases are a group of disorders that affect the mitochondria  which are small organelles found in almost every cell of the body responsible for energy production. When the number or function of mitochondria in the cell are disrupted  less energy is produced and organ dysfunction results. Depending on which cells within the body have disrupted mitochondria  different symptoms may occur. Mitochondrial disease can cause a vast array of health concerns  including fatigue  weakness  metabolic strokes  seizures  cardiomyopathy  arrhythmias  developmental or cognitive disabilities  diabetes mellitus  impairment of hearing  vision  growth  liver  gastrointestinal  or kidney function  and more. These symptoms can present at any age from infancy up until late adulthood. Currently there is no highly effective treatment that addresses the root cause of mitochondrial disorders. The management of mitochondrial disease is supportive therapy  which may include nutritional management  exercise and/or vitamin or amino acid supplements.About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

As part of our 'Mission 2027' plan launched in November 2022 we plan to double our revenue. The various crises having occurred since the beginning of 2020 require us to pay particular attention to the financial resources needed to reduce operational risks and ramp up the marketing of our innovations. The EUR2.4 million raised in 'quasi-equity' supplements long-term debt financing currently under negotiation  which will cover the needs of our current and future growth.""Main features of the bond issuesThe issue of the convertible bonds was decided today by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  using the sub-delegation granted to him on 27 December 2022 by the Board of Directors  itself using the delegation granted to it by the Company's General Shareholders' Meeting of 31 August 2022[2] under the 19th resolution with regard to the issue of convertible bonds.The convertible bonds and simple bonds were subscribed at 92% and 100% of their nominal value  respectively.

Moreover  BioChaperone Lispro confirmed its good tolerability and safety profiles.""These results confirm once again the robustness of our technology and the advantages of our product in comparison to the global market leader of mealtime insulin""  said Olivier Soula  Adocia's Deputy CEO. ""We would like to thank our partner Tonghua Dongbao for its rigorous execution of the clinical development plan  including on ongoing Phase 3 studies.""Conducted in parallel of the Phases 3  this Phase 1 study was conducted in an open label  positive control  randomized  crossover trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single dose of BioChaperone Lispro in healthy Chinese volunteers. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate whether a BioChaperone Lispro injection has a faster absorption and onset of action compared to an insulin Lispro injection.Story continuesAdocia licensed BioChaperone Lispro to Tonghua Dongbao for China and major Asian territories that represents 200 million people suffering from diabetes1  with an estimated 20 million using insulin daily for their survival.In 2021  the Chinese insulin market represented more than US$5 billion2.About BioChaperone® LisproBioChaperone® (BC) Lispro is an Ultra-Rapid Insulin obtained by combining Adocia’s proprietary BioChaperone technology with the rapid-acting market leader insulin lispro (as contained in the commercial product Humalog®).Distributed more rapidly into the bloodstream than previous generations of insulins  BC Lispro reduces post-meal hyperglycemic excursions that are responsible for long-term comorbidities such as retinopathy  diabetic foot ulcer  and kidney failure. Moreover  as BC Lispro is eliminated faster from the body  it may also reduce the risk of hypoglycemic events that are caused when insulin remains too long in the bloodstream after the post-meal hyperglycemia peak has declined.On top of its direct clinical benefits  the onset of action of BC Lispro results in improved quality of life with more dose-timing flexibility at mealtime. A mealtime injection  or even right-after-mealtime  enables patients to better determine the appropriate insulin dose as the exact timing and contents of their meal are known. This avoids overdosing or delayed dosing  which can lead to hypo- or hyperglycemia respectively  and prevents the severe short and long-term consequences. It significantly reduces the stress and the mental load of those affected by insulin-dependent diabetes and their caretakers which is important in day-to-day life.Currently  the only drugs providing similar effects in the world are Fiasp® from Novo Nordisk Co. and Lyumjev® from Eli Lilly and Company. Fiasp® and Lyumjev® are not marketed in China.Since licensing BC Lispro to Tonghua Dongbao in 2018  Adocia has already received $15 million in upfront fees and a milestone payment for the first patient dosed in Phase 3. The agreement also includes up to $30 million additional development milestones and double-digit royalties on sales to be paid to Adocia by Tonghua Dongbao.BC Lispro is currently being studied in a large Phase 3 program that consists of two studies treating people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in more than 100 clinical centers across China and will enroll a total of c. 1 300 patients. The aim of this program is to demonstrate safety and efficacy of BC Lispro in comparison to standard of care (Humalog®). Results of this program will then be submitted to the Chinese Regulatory Authorities by Tonghua Dongbao to obtain marketing authorization.BC Lispro is patent protected until 2033.About Tonghua DongbaoTonghua Dongbao Pharmaceutical Co.
