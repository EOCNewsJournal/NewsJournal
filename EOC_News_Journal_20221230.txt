As part of our ‘Mission 2027’ plan launched in November 2022 we plan to double our revenue. The various crises having occurred since the beginning of 2020 require us to pay particular attention to the financial resources needed to reduce operational risks and ramp up the marketing of our innovations. The €2.4 million raised in ‘quasi-equity’ supplements long-term debt financing currently under negotiation  which will cover the needs of our current and future growth.”Main features of the bond issuesThe issue of the convertible bonds was decided today by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  using the sub-delegation granted to him on 27 December 2022 by the Board of Directors  itself using the delegation granted to it by the Company’s General Shareholders’ Meeting of 31 August 2022[2] under the 19th resolution with regard to the issue of convertible bonds.The convertible bonds and simple bonds were subscribed at 92% and 100% of their nominal value  respectively. They will not bear interest and will mature on 28 December 2024.The amount of cash related to the issue of convertible bonds is €2.4 million and will be paid in full on 30/12/2022.The amount of cash related to the issue of simple bonds will be €2.6 million  paid in one instalment at the time of the lifting (or waiver) of the conditions precedent  before the end of September 2023.The conversion price of the convertible bonds will depend on the stock market price at the time of conversion[3] in accordance with the price rule and the ceiling set by the General Meeting.In the event that the bonds have not been fully converted and/or redeemed at maturity  they will be repaid in full by the Company for 100% of their nominal value.For information purposes  if all the convertible bonds were converted on the basis of the 2CRSi share price at the close of 27 December 2022[4]  the stake of a shareholder holding 1.00% of the capital of 2CRSi before implementation would become 0.95% of the capital on an undiluted basis and 0.90% of the capital on a diluted basis (taking into account existing dilutive instruments).The new shares resulting from the conversion of convertible bonds will be subject to all the provisions set out in the articles of association  will be fully assimilated to the old ordinary shares  and will enjoy the same rights.The bonds will not be the subject of any request for admission to trading on Euronext Growth.This transaction does not require the drafting of a prospectus to be submitted for approval to the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority).The deal was advised and structured by Vester Finance  which also subscribed to the two bond issues.RISK FACTORSThe risk factors affecting the Company are detailed in paragraph 5.2 of the 2021-2022 Universal Registration Document as published by the Company on 7 September 2022 and available on the Company’s website (at https://investors.2crsi.com/fr/rapports-annuels-et-prospectus/).About 2CRSiFounded in Strasbourg (France)  the 2CRSi Group develops  produces and sells customised  high-performance and environmentally-friendly servers.

This is a randomized  double-blind  Phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) or non-active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (nSPMS).The study will enroll 800 patients from numerous study centers with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 3.0 to 6.0 and absence of T1 Gadolinium-enhancing brain lesions. The primary endpoint of the study is the effect of masitinib on time to confirmed disability progression. The objective of this study is to confirm positive results from the phase 2B/3 study (AB07002). [1]Masitinib is positioned in progressive forms of the disease (PPMS or nSPMS). Currently  there is only one approved treatment for primary progressive forms and none for non-active secondary progressive forms  which account for approximately 15% and 35% of MS cases respectively  approximately 500 000 patients in the US and Europe.Masitinib targets microglia and mast cells  which are two cells of the innate immune system associated with the pathology of progressive MS. The mechanism of action of masitinib is different from and potentially complementary to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors being developed in multiple sclerosis  such as BTK inhibitors  which target B cells.Professor Patrick Vermersch  MD  principal investigator of the study and Professor of Neurology at the University of Lille  France said: “We are very pleased to receive FDA approval for this confirmatory study. This demonstrates interest from the health authorities in the masitinib program in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis and more broadly in neurodegenerative diseases  and also their acknowledgement that masitinib has viable neuroprotective role via its mechanism of action  which we believe is supported by the scientific and clinical data”.[1] Vermersch P  Brieva-Ruiz L  Fox RJ  et al. Efficacy and Safety of Masitinib in Progressive Forms of Multiple Sclerosis: A Randomized  Phase 3  Clinical Trial. Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm 2022;9:e1148. doi:10.1212/NXI.0000000000001148About the results of the previous phase 2B/3 study AB07002The study AB07002 met its primary analysis endpoint  demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in cumulative change on EDSS with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day (p=0.0256). This treatment-effect was consistent for PPMS and nSPMS. In addition  masitinib significantly reduced the risk of first disability progression by 42% and the risk of confirmed (3 months) disability progression by 37%. Masitinib also significantly reduced the risk of reaching an EDSS score of 7.0  corresponding to disability severe enough that the patient is restricted to a wheelchair (p=0.0093). The product's safety was consistent with the known risk profile of masitinib  with no elevated risk of infection  which may be an advantage over other drugs used in multiple sclerosis  many of which carry an increased risk of infectious complications.About multiple sclerosisMultiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system and the leading cause of non-traumatic neurological disability in young and middle-aged adults. Multiple sclerosis affects approximately 2.5 million people worldwide  including more than 100 000 people in France. It is characterized by a progressive degradation of the nerve cells of the central nervous system by the patient's immune system and comes in two main forms.The relapsing-remitting form characterized by relapses of the disease. Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis includes secondary progressive active multiple sclerosis. During these relapses  patients experience the onset of new symptoms or the worsening of symptoms already present. These flare-ups are usually followed by recovery periods of varying length  after which some symptoms may persist. The relapsing-remitting forms of multiple sclerosis are mostly associated with dysfunctions of adaptive immunity (B cells and T cells).The progressive form   characterized by a constant and regular worsening of the symptoms of the disease  without a distinct relapse or period of recovery. Progressive multiple sclerosis includes non-active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis The rate of onset of severe  disabling  and irreversible disability is much higher in the progressive forms of the disease than in the relapsing remitting forms. In progressive multiple sclerosis  innate immune cells such as macrophages  microglia or mast cells have been shown to probably play a major role.A high medical need in progressive forms of multiple sclerosisPatients with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis have a reduced life expectancy compared to the general population. The progressive worsening of neurological disability since the onset of the disease is associated with a significant reduction in quality of life and usually requires the use of a wheelchair for a large part of the patient's life. There is currently no cure for multiple sclerosis. The vast majority of registered therapies for multiple sclerosis that affect the course of the disease are only effective in relapsing forms of the disease (relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis or active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis) and have not been shown to be effective in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (primary progressive multiple sclerosis or non-active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis). There are currently no approved therapies for the population targeted by studies AB07002 and AB20009  i.e. non-active progressive MS.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

BioChaperone Lispro was compared with Humalog (insulin lispro) and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of BioChaperone Lispro were significantly faster. Moreover  BioChaperone Lispro confirmed its good tolerability and safety profiles. ""These results confirm once again the robustness of our technology and the advantages of our product in comparison to the global market leader of mealtime insulin""  said Olivier Soula  Adocia's Deputy CEO. ""We would like to thank our partner Tonghua Dongbao for its rigorous execution of the clinical development plan  including on ongoing Phase 3 studies."" Conducted in parallel of the Phases 3  this Phase 1 study was conducted in an open label  positive control  randomized  crossover trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single dose of BioChaperone Lispro in healthy Chinese volunteers. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate whether a BioChaperone Lispro injection has a faster absorption and onset of action compared to an insulin Lispro injection.Adocia licensed BioChaperone Lispro to Tonghua Dongbao for China and major Asian territories that represents 200 million people suffering from diabetes1  with an estimated 20 million using insulin daily for their survival. In 2021  the Chinese insulin market represented more than US$5 billion2. About BioChaperone® Lispro BioChaperone® (BC) Lispro is an Ultra-Rapid Insulin obtained by combining Adocia's proprietary BioChaperone technology with the rapid-acting market leader insulin lispro (as contained in the commercial product Humalog®). Distributed more rapidly into the bloodstream than previous generations of insulins  BC Lispro reduces post-meal hyperglycemic excursions that are responsible for long-term comorbidities such as retinopathy  diabetic foot ulcer  and kidney failure. Moreover  as BC Lispro is eliminated faster from the body  it may also reduce the risk of hypoglycemic events that are caused when insulin remains too long in the bloodstream after the post-meal hyperglycemia peak has declined. On top of its direct clinical benefits  the onset of action of BC Lispro results in improved quality of life with more dose-timing flexibility at mealtime. A mealtime injection  or even right-after-mealtime  enables patients to better determine the appropriate insulin dose as the exact timing and contents of their meal are known. This avoids overdosing or delayed dosing  which can lead to hypo- or hyperglycemia respectively  and prevents the severe short and long-term consequences. It significantly reduces the stress and the mental load of those affected by insulin-dependent diabetes and their caretakers which is important in day-to-day life. Currently  the only drugs providing similar effects in the world are Fiasp® from Novo Nordisk Co. and Lyumjev® from Eli Lilly and Company. Fiasp® and Lyumjev® are not marketed in China. Since licensing BC Lispro to Tonghua Dongbao in 2018  Adocia has already received $15 million in upfront fees and a milestone payment for the first patient dosed in Phase 3. The agreement also includes up to $30 million additional development milestones and double-digit royalties on sales to be paid to Adocia by Tonghua Dongbao. BC Lispro is currently being studied in a large Phase 3 program that consists of two studies treating people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in more than 100 clinical centers across China and will enroll a total of c. 1 300 patients. The aim of this program is to demonstrate safety and efficacy of BC Lispro in comparison to standard of care (Humalog®). Results of this program will then be submitted to the Chinese Regulatory Authorities by Tonghua Dongbao to obtain marketing authorization. BC Lispro is patent protected until 2033.

Ce…,NEW YORK  Dec. 29  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Following the formation of Mayflower Bioventures  a cell and gene therapy accelerator stood up from Hibiscus BioVentures and Mayo Clinic  comes the launch of their first start-up  Primera Therapeutics  Inc. (Primera). Cellectis (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - Nasdaq: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its gene editing platform to deliver life-saving cell and gene therapies  and Primera announced today the execution of a Collaboration Agreement under which the Parties will work collaboratively to edit mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in vivo to treat the root cause of associated diseases.Inherited mitochondrial diseases caused by genetic changes in the mtDNA have very limited to no treatment options  and often result in early childhood death. An estimated 1 in 5 000 people worldwide suffer from mtDNA – associated diseases. Primera is advancing pioneering mtDNA gene editing therapies developed in the Mayo Clinic lab of Drs. Steven Ekker and Karl Clark to precisely fix a patient’s mutated mtDNA and potentially achieve a cure for the disease. Primera’s initial clinical focus is on rare mitochondrial diseases for which there are no approved treatments. Mayo Clinic excels in delivering and developing advanced care for complex diseases including the interdisciplinary research and clinical treatment through its Mitochondrial Care Research Center.“We are thrilled to launch Primera through Mayflower Bioventures and power it with the research and treatment expertise at Mayo Clinic and through collaborations with leading industry partners such as Cellectis  alongside a wonderful group of academic centers and nonprofit partners ” noted Dr. Stephen Ekker  Dean of the Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and a key scientific inventor and thought leader for Primera. “It requires a team effort to drive this program forward into the clinic and for patients who are suffering with these dreadful diseases.”Primera  together with Cellectis  will be co-developing a mtDNA engineering toolbox that could enable effective therapies for mitochondrial diseases. The experience Cellectis brings in groundbreaking gene editing research  technology  manufacturing and clinical development will be invaluable in moving quickly to advance these programs and mitochondrial research forward.The Collaboration Agreement should be supplemented by other agreements to be concluded between the Parties  under which Cellectis would receive a 19% equity ownership stake in Primera and would take a seat on Primera’s Board of Directors.Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement  Primera has a right to exercise an exclusive worldwide option for a license from Cellectis on up to five product candidates developed under the collaboration (the “partnership products”). Upon Primera exercising the option  Cellectis will be eligible for up to $750 million of development and sales milestones for the partnership products  as well as high single-digit royalty payments on the net sales of partnership products.“Our partnership with Primera further showcases and expands the application of our gene-editing capabilities into a previously unexplored space. This partnership is very much in line with Cellectis’ mission to leverage its gene editing technologies to develop potentially life-saving product candidates to address unmet medical needs ” said André Choulika  Ph.D.  CEO of Cellectis.Along with Cellectis and Mayo Clinic  Primera is collaborating with patient advocacy groups including the United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation (UMDF). UMDF  the largest source of funding for mitochondrial disease research outside of the government  promotes research and education for the diagnosis  treatment and cure of mitochondrial disorders and supports affected individuals and families. “UMDF is proud to partner with Primera. We are closely aligned in our vision of driving the development and application of technologies to address the needs of those currently suffering from mitochondrial genetic diseases ” noted Philip Yeske  PhD.  Science and Alliance Officer for UMDF.Marni Falk  MD  Executive Director of the Mitochondrial Medicine Frontier Program at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia  Professor of Pediatrics at University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine  and Clinical Geneticist serves as a Clinical and Scientific Research Advisor to Primera and sees the Cellectis and Primera collaboration as providing new hope for mitochondrial disease patients. “I have dedicated my career to building a team focused on research  development  translation  clinical development and patient management of mitochondrial disease  encompassing novel diagnostics and treatments. As there currently are no highly effective treatments  we are largely limited to offering supportive therapy. We see over 1 300 patients from around the world in our mitochondrial medicine clinic each year  including both adults and children suffering from these devastating multi-system diseases. Through an interdisciplinary approach  we collaborate in performing groundbreaking research and development of technologies  such as Primera’s  that may have the potential to be disease-modifying and address the needs of those currently battling energy deficiency from genetic-based primary mitochondrial diseases.”Primera is dedicated to advancing its programs to be first into the clinic that will apply gene editing technologies directly to mitochondrial mutations that drive mitochondrial disease and in the future  potentially broader diseases with central components of mitochondrial dysfunction.About Mitochondrial Disease (CHOP.edu)It is estimated that every 30 minutes  a child is born who will develop a mitochondrial disorder by age 10. Overall  approximately 1 in every 4 300 individuals in the United States has a mitochondrial disease. Mitochondrial diseases are a group of disorders that affect the mitochondria  which are small organelles found in almost every cell of the body responsible for energy production. When the number or function of mitochondria in the cell are disrupted  less energy is produced and organ dysfunction results. Depending on which cells within the body have disrupted mitochondria  different symptoms may occur. Mitochondrial disease can cause a vast array of health concerns  including fatigue  weakness  metabolic strokes  seizures  cardiomyopathy  arrhythmias  developmental or cognitive disabilities  diabetes mellitus  impairment of hearing  vision  growth  liver  gastrointestinal  or kidney function  and more. These symptoms can present at any age from infancy up until late adulthood. Currently there is no highly effective treatment that addresses the root cause of mitochondrial disorders. The management of mitochondrial disease is supportive therapy  which may include nutritional management  exercise and/or vitamin or amino acid supplements.About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

The company's oncology-focusedpipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma's approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-linedata from the NOX-A12three dose-escalationcohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12 radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy has received orphan drug designation for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-linedata with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in combination with Merck's Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-linetherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial is in discussion with regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe. The company's second clinical-stagedrug candidate  NOX-E36 is designed to target the innate immune system. TME Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

However  in this study  an additional booster dose of VLA2001 elicited only a marginally increased neutralizing antibody response. The Company previously reported positive heterologous booster results following primary vaccination with ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca) in August 20223 and positive homologous booster results at the end of December 20214.Valneva is currently seeking regulatory approval for VLA2001 as a homologous booster as well as heterologous booster in ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca) primed individuals which may support the Company in deploying its inventory in international markets5.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Valneva’s Chief Medical Officer  commented  “While these latest booster results are not aligned with the encouraging homologous and heterologous booster results seen previously  we are pleased to once again confirm the favorable safety and tolerability profile of VLA2001  which was important for EMA and MHRA approval.”About Trial VLA2001-307VLA2001-307 is a multicenter  open-label clinical study investigating the safety  tolerability and immunogenicity of a VLA2001 booster vaccination in participants aged 18 years and older. Approximately 275 participants  either generally healthy or with a stable medical condition  were planned to be enrolled in the trial. The VLA2001 booster will be given to adults at least 6 months after vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine  with or without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection  or to unvaccinated adults at least four months after confirmation of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.Story continuesAbout VLA2001VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).VLA2001 was the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe6 and the only whole virus  inactivated  COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom7 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates8 and Kingdom of Bahrain9. Valneva signed agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States2 and the Kingdom of Bahrain10. In August 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations for use of VLA200111. In light of current order levels and existing inventories  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine and is continuing discussions on potential additional supply agreements with various other governments around the world to deploy remaining inventory. VLA2001’s shelf life is expected to be extended to up to 24 months  compared to 18 months currently.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to commercialize three vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease and the chikungunya virus.Valneva Investor and Media ContactsLaetitia Bachelot-FontaineVP  Global Communications and European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099investors@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP  Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to the development and commercialization plans for VLA2001 and agreements with potential partners and purchasers.

15660,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/12/30/2581277/0/en/Valneva-Reports-Further-Heterologous-Booster-Data-for-its-inactivated-COVID-19-vaccine.html,Valneva Reports Further Heterologous Booster Data for its inactivated COVID-19 vaccine,Saint-Herblain (France)  December 30  2022 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today reported further heterologous booster data from an exploratory  small clinical study for its inactivated COVID-19 vaccine  VLA2001.,"English FrenchSaint-Herblain (France)  December 30  2022 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today reported further heterologous booster data from an exploratory  small clinical study for its inactivated COVID-19 vaccine  VLA2001.In study VLA2001-3071  a subset of participants (three out of nine groups) received VLA2001 following two or three doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine  with or without break-through infection (25-50 participants per group).The data show that a booster dose of VLA2001 was well tolerated in previously BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech)- or mRNA 1273 (Moderna)-vaccinated participants  confirming the favorable safety profile of VLA2001 seen across all studies – including in homologous or heterologous booster settings2. However  in this study  an additional booster dose of VLA2001 elicited only a marginally increased neutralizing antibody response. The Company previously reported positive heterologous booster results following primary vaccination with ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca) in August 20223 and positive homologous booster results at the end of December 20214.Valneva is currently seeking regulatory approval for VLA2001 as a homologous booster as well as heterologous booster in ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca) primed individuals which may support the Company in deploying its inventory in international markets5.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Valneva’s Chief Medical Officer  commented  “While these latest booster results are not aligned with the encouraging homologous and heterologous booster results seen previously  we are pleased to once again confirm the favorable safety and tolerability profile of VLA2001  which was important for EMA and MHRA approval.”About Trial VLA2001-307VLA2001-307 is a multicenter  open-label clinical study investigating the safety  tolerability and immunogenicity of a VLA2001 booster vaccination in participants aged 18 years and older. Approximately 275 participants  either generally healthy or with a stable medical condition  were planned to be enrolled in the trial. The VLA2001 booster will be given to adults at least 6 months after vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine  with or without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection  or to unvaccinated adults at least four months after confirmation of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.About VLA2001VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).VLA2001 was the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe6 and the only whole virus  inactivated  COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom7 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates8 and Kingdom of Bahrain9. Valneva signed agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States2 and the Kingdom of Bahrain10. In August 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations for use of VLA200111. In light of current order levels and existing inventories  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine and is continuing discussions on potential additional supply agreements with various other governments around the world to deploy remaining inventory. VLA2001’s shelf life is expected to be extended to up to 24 months  compared to 18 months currently.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases.

The company's oncology-focusedpipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma's approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-linedata from the NOX-A12three dose-escalationcohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12 radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy has received orphan drug designation for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-linedata with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in combination with Merck's Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-linetherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial is in discussion with regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe. The company's second clinical-stagedrug candidate  NOX-E36 is designed to target the innate immune system. TME Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

The company has been listed on Euronext since 2007 (Stock Code: MLEAS). Over the past 20 years  EASSON has evolved from being a telecommunication service provider in education  to online cross-border service provider  in global immigration  international travel and offshore company services  etc.The Top Talent Pass Scheme launched by the HK Government to bring in top talents will attract a large number of global talents to Hong Kong. EASSON will be committed to introducing top talents coming to Hong Kong.About TTPS:Top Talent Pass Scheme for a period of two years. Eligible talents will include individuals whose annual salary reached HK$2.5 million or above in the past year  and individuals graduated from the world's top 100 universities with at least three years of work experience over the past five years. These two categories of talents will be issued a two-year pass for exploring opportunities in Hong Kong and are not subject to any quota. Individuals who graduated from the world's top 100 universities in the past five years and have yet to fulfil the work experience requirement will also be eligible  subject to an annual quota of 10 000. The scheme will be reviewed after the first year of implementation.ADVANTAGES:All other work visa applicants are required to find a job before they can submit their applications. One of the advantages of the Top Talent Pass program is that applicants do not need a job offer when applying for a visa  and if granted a visa  will be free to work in Hong Kong for at least two years.However  if you plan to stay in Hong Kong for a long time  current legislation requires you to renew your visa until you have lived in the Hong Kong SAR for seven consecutive years before you can apply to become a permanent resident.****ABOUT EASSONEasson Holdings focuses on cross-border professional services for Mainland China residents and Chinese companies.Easson Holdings Limited was established in 2002 and is based in Hong Kong.

Keen to play a key role in this transformation  Accor has committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and increasing energy efficiency in the short and long term.Given the effects of climate change and the current energy crisis  finding concrete  pragmatic  inventive solutions is a priority for people and planet. As awareness of what is at stake grows  customers expect companies to have increasingly high environmental standards and  in hospitality  are looking for sustainability-committed hotels. An expectation that aligns with and shapes Accor’s global strategy. Early 2021  Accor was the first international hotel group to make a long-term commitment to decarbonize all its operations and achieve net zero by 2050 – including a 46% emission reduction by 2030  validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative. Given that 63% of the Group’s carbon footprint is energy related  accelerating energy transition is central to this commitment and depends on a low-energy  low-carbon approach:Promote a low-carbon mindset in hotel operations and with all its supply chain  including its suppliersFully transitioning to smart  sustainably designed hotelsAccelerate the use of green energyDesigning Low-energy BuildingsAccor signs an average of one new hotel every day worldwide. Every year  several hundred establishments are also renovated. For construction and major renovation projects  Accor has long been committed to transitioning to low-energy buildings with the double benefit of reducing carbon emissions and operating costs. Securing the future also means continuing to innovate by choosing low-carbon building materials that can be recycled  including high-performance insulation that significantly reduces energy consumption. It also means accelerating the purchase  production and use of low-carbon energy sources and  when possible  generating renewable energy directly on site.Opened in 2013  the Sofitel Dubai The Palm was designed with roof tiles made from a insulating  sun-reflecting material  double glazing  energy-efficient air conditioning  a heat recovery system  presence detectors for corridor lighting and 530m2 of solar panels that cover 45% of the hotel’s hot water needs. It was the first hotel in Palm Jumeirah and the first Sofitel in the Middle East-North Africa region to receive Green Globe certification.was designed with roof tiles made from a insulating  sun-reflecting material  double glazing  energy-efficient air conditioning  a heat recovery system  presence detectors for corridor lighting and 530m2 of solar panels that cover 45% of the hotel’s hot water needs. It was the first hotel in Palm Jumeirah and the first Sofitel in the Middle East-North Africa region to receive Green Globe certification. Opened in 2017  the JO&JOE Gentilly  near Paris  is a low-carbon building and our first hotel to achieve the BBCA label based on 4 criteria: reasoned construction  controlled use  carbon storage and circular economy. This relaxed open-house destination brings together locals and travelers  and even has fruit trees in the garden.Embracing Energy SufficiencyIn recent months  as energy prices spiral  particularly in Europe  the term ""energy sufficiency"" has been increasingly used by governments and institutions. With the aim of only using the energy you need  in France  the government has called on companies and citizens to turn off little-used appliances and implement behavior changes to use energy more sparingly. In this context  Accor has contributed to a national energy-saving plan for the hotel industry. To go even further  the Group recently announced that it was implementing an ambitious and sustainable energy sufficiency approach in France covering four main areas:Reduce air conditioning heating and cooling intensityUse hot water moderately and intelligently by closing external pools and reducing availability of energy-intensive facilities  such as steam rooms and saunasReduce electricity consumption including shutting down over 50 000 minibarsAdapt behaviors and optimize maintenance in the kitchens to use less energy for cooking and coolingAccor has a responsibility to lead and inspire the transformation of the hospitality industry to offer experiences that respect the environment  as well as local communities. By accelerating this transition and building a responsible model as a major group  Accor leads by example to help make the world more welcoming  respectful and caring.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

In study VLA2001-3071…,"Saint-Herblain (France)  December 30  2022 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today reported further heterologous booster data from an exploratory  small clinical study for its inactivated COVID-19 vaccine  VLA2001.In study VLA2001-3071  a subset of participants (three out of nine groups) received VLA2001 following two or three doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine  with or without break-through infection (25-50 participants per group).The data show that a booster dose of VLA2001 was well tolerated in previously BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech)- or mRNA 1273 (Moderna)-vaccinated participants  confirming the favorable safety profile of VLA2001 seen across all studies – including in homologous or heterologous booster settings2. However  in this study  an additional booster dose of VLA2001 elicited only a marginally increased neutralizing antibody response. The Company previously reported positive heterologous booster results following primary vaccination with ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca) in August 20223 and positive homologous booster results at the end of December 20214.Valneva is currently seeking regulatory approval for VLA2001 as a homologous booster as well as heterologous booster in ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca) primed individuals which may support the Company in deploying its inventory in international markets5.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Valneva’s Chief Medical Officer  commented  “While these latest booster results are not aligned with the encouraging homologous and heterologous booster results seen previously  we are pleased to once again confirm the favorable safety and tolerability profile of VLA2001  which was important for EMA and MHRA approval.”About Trial VLA2001-307VLA2001-307 is a multicenter  open-label clinical study investigating the safety  tolerability and immunogenicity of a VLA2001 booster vaccination in participants aged 18 years and older. Approximately 275 participants  either generally healthy or with a stable medical condition  were planned to be enrolled in the trial. The VLA2001 booster will be given to adults at least 6 months after vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine  with or without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection  or to unvaccinated adults at least four months after confirmation of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.About VLA2001VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).VLA2001 was the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe6 and the only whole virus  inactivated  COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom7 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates8 and Kingdom of Bahrain9. Valneva signed agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States2 and the Kingdom of Bahrain10. In August 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations for use of VLA200111. In light of current order levels and existing inventories  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine and is continuing discussions on potential additional supply agreements with various other governments around the world to deploy remaining inventory. VLA2001’s shelf life is expected to be extended to up to 24 months  compared to 18 months currently.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to commercialize three vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease and the chikungunya virus.Valneva Investor and Media ContactsLaetitia Bachelot-FontaineVP  Global Communications and European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099investors@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP  Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to the development and commercialization plans for VLA2001 and agreements with potential partners and purchasers.
