The company's oncology-focusedpipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma's approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-linedata from the NOX-A12three dose-escalationcohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12 radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy has received orphan drug designation for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-linedata with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in combination with Merck's Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-linetherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial is in discussion with regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe. The company's second clinical-stagedrug candidate  NOX-E36 is designed to target the innate immune system. TME Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

However  in this study  an additional booster dose of VLA2001 elicited only a marginally increased neutralizing antibody response. The Company previously reported positive heterologous booster results following primary vaccination with ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca) in August 20223 and positive homologous booster results at the end of December 20214.Valneva is currently seeking regulatory approval for VLA2001 as a homologous booster as well as heterologous booster in ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca) primed individuals which may support the Company in deploying its inventory in international markets5.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Valneva’s Chief Medical Officer  commented  “While these latest booster results are not aligned with the encouraging homologous and heterologous booster results seen previously  we are pleased to once again confirm the favorable safety and tolerability profile of VLA2001  which was important for EMA and MHRA approval.”About Trial VLA2001-307VLA2001-307 is a multicenter  open-label clinical study investigating the safety  tolerability and immunogenicity of a VLA2001 booster vaccination in participants aged 18 years and older. Approximately 275 participants  either generally healthy or with a stable medical condition  were planned to be enrolled in the trial. The VLA2001 booster will be given to adults at least 6 months after vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine  with or without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection  or to unvaccinated adults at least four months after confirmation of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.Story continuesAbout VLA2001VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).VLA2001 was the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe6 and the only whole virus  inactivated  COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom7 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates8 and Kingdom of Bahrain9. Valneva signed agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States2 and the Kingdom of Bahrain10. In August 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations for use of VLA200111. In light of current order levels and existing inventories  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine and is continuing discussions on potential additional supply agreements with various other governments around the world to deploy remaining inventory. VLA2001’s shelf life is expected to be extended to up to 24 months  compared to 18 months currently.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases.

However  in this study  an additional booster dose of VLA2001 elicited only a marginally increased neutralizing antibody response. The Company previously reported positive heterologous booster results following primary vaccination with ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca) in August 20223 and positive homologous booster results at the end of December 20214.Valneva is currently seeking regulatory approval for VLA2001 as a homologous booster as well as heterologous booster in ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca) primed individuals which may support the Company in deploying its inventory in international markets5.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Valneva’s Chief Medical Officer  commented  “While these latest booster results are not aligned with the encouraging homologous and heterologous booster results seen previously  we are pleased to once again confirm the favorable safety and tolerability profile of VLA2001  which was important for EMA and MHRA approval.”About Trial VLA2001-307VLA2001-307 is a multicenter  open-label clinical study investigating the safety  tolerability and immunogenicity of a VLA2001 booster vaccination in participants aged 18 years and older. Approximately 275 participants  either generally healthy or with a stable medical condition  were planned to be enrolled in the trial. The VLA2001 booster will be given to adults at least 6 months after vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine  with or without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection  or to unvaccinated adults at least four months after confirmation of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.About VLA2001VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).VLA2001 was the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe6 and the only whole virus  inactivated  COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom7 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates8 and Kingdom of Bahrain9. Valneva signed agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States2 and the Kingdom of Bahrain10. In August 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations for use of VLA200111. In light of current order levels and existing inventories  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine and is continuing discussions on potential additional supply agreements with various other governments around the world to deploy remaining inventory. VLA2001’s shelf life is expected to be extended to up to 24 months  compared to 18 months currently.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases.

The company's oncology-focusedpipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma's approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-linedata from the NOX-A12three dose-escalationcohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12 radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy has received orphan drug designation for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-linedata with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in combination with Merck's Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-linetherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial is in discussion with regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe. The company's second clinical-stagedrug candidate  NOX-E36 is designed to target the innate immune system. TME Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

The company has been listed on Euronext since 2007 (Stock Code: MLEAS). Over the past 20 years  EASSON has evolved from being a telecommunication service provider in education  to online cross-border service provider  in global immigration  international travel and offshore company services  etc.The Top Talent Pass Scheme launched by the HK Government to bring in top talents will attract a large number of global talents to Hong Kong. EASSON will be committed to introducing top talents coming to Hong Kong.About TTPS:Top Talent Pass Scheme for a period of two years. Eligible talents will include individuals whose annual salary reached HK$2.5 million or above in the past year  and individuals graduated from the world's top 100 universities with at least three years of work experience over the past five years. These two categories of talents will be issued a two-year pass for exploring opportunities in Hong Kong and are not subject to any quota. Individuals who graduated from the world's top 100 universities in the past five years and have yet to fulfil the work experience requirement will also be eligible  subject to an annual quota of 10 000. The scheme will be reviewed after the first year of implementation.ADVANTAGES:All other work visa applicants are required to find a job before they can submit their applications. One of the advantages of the Top Talent Pass program is that applicants do not need a job offer when applying for a visa  and if granted a visa  will be free to work in Hong Kong for at least two years.However  if you plan to stay in Hong Kong for a long time  current legislation requires you to renew your visa until you have lived in the Hong Kong SAR for seven consecutive years before you can apply to become a permanent resident.****ABOUT EASSONEasson Holdings focuses on cross-border professional services for Mainland China residents and Chinese companies.Easson Holdings Limited was established in 2002 and is based in Hong Kong.

Keen to play a key role in this transformation  Accor has committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and increasing energy efficiency in the short and long term.Given the effects of climate change and the current energy crisis  finding concrete  pragmatic  inventive solutions is a priority for people and planet. As awareness of what is at stake grows  customers expect companies to have increasingly high environmental standards and  in hospitality  are looking for sustainability-committed hotels. An expectation that aligns with and shapes Accor’s global strategy. Early 2021  Accor was the first international hotel group to make a long-term commitment to decarbonize all its operations and achieve net zero by 2050 – including a 46% emission reduction by 2030  validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative. Given that 63% of the Group’s carbon footprint is energy related  accelerating energy transition is central to this commitment and depends on a low-energy  low-carbon approach:Promote a low-carbon mindset in hotel operations and with all its supply chain  including its suppliersFully transitioning to smart  sustainably designed hotelsAccelerate the use of green energyDesigning Low-energy BuildingsAccor signs an average of one new hotel every day worldwide. Every year  several hundred establishments are also renovated. For construction and major renovation projects  Accor has long been committed to transitioning to low-energy buildings with the double benefit of reducing carbon emissions and operating costs. Securing the future also means continuing to innovate by choosing low-carbon building materials that can be recycled  including high-performance insulation that significantly reduces energy consumption. It also means accelerating the purchase  production and use of low-carbon energy sources and  when possible  generating renewable energy directly on site.Opened in 2013  the Sofitel Dubai The Palm was designed with roof tiles made from a insulating  sun-reflecting material  double glazing  energy-efficient air conditioning  a heat recovery system  presence detectors for corridor lighting and 530m2 of solar panels that cover 45% of the hotel’s hot water needs. It was the first hotel in Palm Jumeirah and the first Sofitel in the Middle East-North Africa region to receive Green Globe certification.was designed with roof tiles made from a insulating  sun-reflecting material  double glazing  energy-efficient air conditioning  a heat recovery system  presence detectors for corridor lighting and 530m2 of solar panels that cover 45% of the hotel’s hot water needs. It was the first hotel in Palm Jumeirah and the first Sofitel in the Middle East-North Africa region to receive Green Globe certification. Opened in 2017  the JO&JOE Gentilly  near Paris  is a low-carbon building and our first hotel to achieve the BBCA label based on 4 criteria: reasoned construction  controlled use  carbon storage and circular economy. This relaxed open-house destination brings together locals and travelers  and even has fruit trees in the garden.Embracing Energy SufficiencyIn recent months  as energy prices spiral  particularly in Europe  the term ""energy sufficiency"" has been increasingly used by governments and institutions. With the aim of only using the energy you need  in France  the government has called on companies and citizens to turn off little-used appliances and implement behavior changes to use energy more sparingly. In this context  Accor has contributed to a national energy-saving plan for the hotel industry. To go even further  the Group recently announced that it was implementing an ambitious and sustainable energy sufficiency approach in France covering four main areas:Reduce air conditioning heating and cooling intensityUse hot water moderately and intelligently by closing external pools and reducing availability of energy-intensive facilities  such as steam rooms and saunasReduce electricity consumption including shutting down over 50 000 minibarsAdapt behaviors and optimize maintenance in the kitchens to use less energy for cooking and coolingAccor has a responsibility to lead and inspire the transformation of the hospitality industry to offer experiences that respect the environment  as well as local communities. By accelerating this transition and building a responsible model as a major group  Accor leads by example to help make the world more welcoming  respectful and caring.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

In study VLA2001-3071…,"Saint-Herblain (France)  December 30  2022 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today reported further heterologous booster data from an exploratory  small clinical study for its inactivated COVID-19 vaccine  VLA2001.In study VLA2001-3071  a subset of participants (three out of nine groups) received VLA2001 following two or three doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine  with or without break-through infection (25-50 participants per group).The data show that a booster dose of VLA2001 was well tolerated in previously BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech)- or mRNA 1273 (Moderna)-vaccinated participants  confirming the favorable safety profile of VLA2001 seen across all studies – including in homologous or heterologous booster settings2. However  in this study  an additional booster dose of VLA2001 elicited only a marginally increased neutralizing antibody response. The Company previously reported positive heterologous booster results following primary vaccination with ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca) in August 20223 and positive homologous booster results at the end of December 20214.Valneva is currently seeking regulatory approval for VLA2001 as a homologous booster as well as heterologous booster in ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca) primed individuals which may support the Company in deploying its inventory in international markets5.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Valneva’s Chief Medical Officer  commented  “While these latest booster results are not aligned with the encouraging homologous and heterologous booster results seen previously  we are pleased to once again confirm the favorable safety and tolerability profile of VLA2001  which was important for EMA and MHRA approval.”About Trial VLA2001-307VLA2001-307 is a multicenter  open-label clinical study investigating the safety  tolerability and immunogenicity of a VLA2001 booster vaccination in participants aged 18 years and older. Approximately 275 participants  either generally healthy or with a stable medical condition  were planned to be enrolled in the trial. The VLA2001 booster will be given to adults at least 6 months after vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine  with or without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection  or to unvaccinated adults at least four months after confirmation of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.About VLA2001VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).VLA2001 was the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe6 and the only whole virus  inactivated  COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom7 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates8 and Kingdom of Bahrain9. Valneva signed agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States2 and the Kingdom of Bahrain10. In August 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations for use of VLA200111. In light of current order levels and existing inventories  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine and is continuing discussions on potential additional supply agreements with various other governments around the world to deploy remaining inventory. VLA2001’s shelf life is expected to be extended to up to 24 months  compared to 18 months currently.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to commercialize three vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease and the chikungunya virus.Valneva Investor and Media ContactsLaetitia Bachelot-FontaineVP  Global Communications and European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099investors@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP  Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to the development and commercialization plans for VLA2001 and agreements with potential partners and purchasers.

15712,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4566506-solvay-could-split-itself-in-two-plenty-of-upside-likely,Solvay Could Split Itself In 2  Plenty Of Upside Likely At Just 4.5x EBITDA,Solvay is a large chemical company considering splitting itself in an EssentialCo and SpecialtyCo. See why I'm bullish on the stock.,Ruediger Fessel/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionI try not to have too many regrets in life  but not picking up Solvay (OTCQX:SVYSF) (OTCQX:SOLVY) during the COVID-crisis now almost three years ago is one of them. The share price didn’t fall as deep as the share prices of competitors did and even in 2022  the year the European energy crisis was an important theme  Solvay performed much better than its peers in the European chemical sector.Yahoo FinanceThat being said  the share price is currently trading 15% lower than the last time I discussed Solvay here on Seeking Alpha  and it is trading pretty much at the same level it was at when I published an update article in 2019.Solvay’s primary listing is in Belgium  where it belongs to the BEL20 index of Euronext Brussels. The ticker symbol in Brussels is SOLB and the average daily volume exceeds 200 000 shares for a total dollar value of approximately $20M per day. As that clearly is the most liquid trading venue  I strongly recommend to use the Euronext Brussels listing.On track for a very strong yearSolvay’s focus points are relatively easy to explain. The company’s financial performance is dominated by two specific business segments: ‘EssentialCo’ and ‘SpecialtyCo’ which is again separated into a materials and consumer & resources subdivision. Solvay is considering splitting itself up in two  with EssentialCo and SpecialtyCo operating as two separate entities. Nothing has been decided yet  but we will likely see and hear more about this in 2023.Solvay Investor RelationsAnd throughout both divisions  there is one common theme: Solvay is either the market leader or ranks second in that specific market.Solvay Investor RelationsAs about 70% of its revenue (in 2021  but I’m not expecting huge changes) was generated outside of Europe and as Solvay has activities all over the world  it is pretty shielded from the fall-out from the Ukraine-Russia war  although it definitely does notice the impact as the cost of energy has not only gone up in Europe this year.2022 will be an excellent year for Solvay  in my opinion  as the company was able to hike its full-year guidance again when it published its Q3 results.The company’s Q3 revenue came in at 3.6B EUR  which resulted in a 9M 2022 revenue of 10.1B EUR. That already equals the total revenue generated in the entire financial year 2021. While a large portion of the revenue increase is caused by the impact of inflation  let’s keep in mind Solvay has been able to hike prices faster than the cost of the inputs has increased  which really shows how advantageous its position as number 1 or 2 in pretty much every market is.Solvay Investor RelationsOne element that sometimes makes Solvay difficult to understand it its reporting standard: it reports its results in an IFRS-compliant way  but it also publishes the ‘underlying’ results which adjust the company’s financial results for non-cash purchase price allocation accounting impacts. As Solvay continuously refers to its underlying results  I will include this in the financial discussion here  and the income statement below shows the adjustments made to the IFRS results to end up with the underlying result.Solvay Investor RelationsWhile reported EPS for the third quarter was 4.34 EUR per share  the underlying EPS was actually 3.90 EUR per share as the 137M expense related to legacy remediation and major litigations was added back to the equation.Looking at the 9M 2022 income statement  we see the underlying result was actually lower than the reported net income as the underlying EPS was 12.99 EUR per share versus the reported earnings of 14.39 EUR per share.Solvay Investor RelationsThe main culprit was that although the underlying pre-tax income was lower (1.75B EUR underlying versus 1.82B EUR reported)  the tax bill was higher (378M EUR versus 298M EUR) due to certain adjustments and corrections in the financial results.As I mainly like to judge a company based on its free cash flow result  it goes without saying I had a closer look at Solvay’s cash flows as well. I like how the company was able to scale up its capex as Solvay realizes it is on track for a very strong year (cash flow wise). This paves the way to increase the capital expenditures while still posting about a billion euro in free cash flow this year.Solvay Investor RelationsIn the first nine months of this year  Solvay generated 1.36B EUR in operating cash flow. Keep in mind this includes a 787M EUR investment in the working capital position  and it also includes just 179M EUR in cash taxes versus the 298M EUR the company owes based on its results.We should also deduct the 17M EUR dividend payment to non-controlling interests and the 148M EUR in lease and interest payments (including the coupons paid on perpetual hybrid bonds).This means that on an adjusted basis  the operating cash flow was 1.87B EUR. The total capex was just 482M EUR  resulting in a free cash flow result of approximately 1.4B EUR.Looking ahead: 2023 and 2024 will be weaker than 20222022 clearly will be an excellent year for Solvay  but there’s very little doubt the Belgian company will not be able to repeat its excellent performance in 2023. And that’s fine: Solvay will already have made a very big step forward as the net debt is decreasing fast and creates a strong set-up for next year.But first things first. When Solvay announced its Q3 2022 results  it hiked its full-year capex guidance to 1B EUR  and it mentioned it expected to report 1B EUR in free cash flow (which includes working capital changes).This means the Q4 capex will be pretty high at roughly half a billion Euro  but this will all be ‘money well spent’: Solvay is simply pulling forward some of its anticipated growth investments. As the cash is pouring anyway  the company may as well spend it on projects it was already budgeting for  further down the road.This means two things: first of all  the underlying free cash flow result adjusted for working capital changes will likely be higher than the 1B EUR in FCF Solvay is guiding for  and secondly  the total capex may be lower in the next few years. Perhaps not yet in 2023  but from 2024 on the capex will likely decrease again. But that’s the theory. If Solvay continues to find growth investments that meet its internal IRR and return hurdles  I see no reason why Solvay shouldn’t simply continue to invest in itself.Solvay Investor RelationsThe consensus estimate for the 2023 EBITDA is 2.6B EUR. That would be a 15% decrease compared to the 3-3.1B EUR Solvay’s EBITDA guidance implies. And that’s fine as this would still imply an EPS of approximately 10 EUR per share while the free cash flow result will be slightly lower  assuming Solvay will spend 1B EUR on capital expenditures next year as well.The sustaining capex is likely substantially lower  which means the underlying sustaining free cash flow is likely closer to 1.2-1.3B EUR (based on a sustaining capex of 80% of the depreciation expenses).Investment thesisI don’t think there’s any rush to get into Solvay  but I do regret not picking up the stock in 2020 and even earlier this year. I think I have learned my lesson and will take advantage of the next weak moment. Keep in mind the EBITDA and net income in both 2023 and 2024 will likely be lower than in 2022  so perhaps the market may be negatively surprised by the 2023 guidance if it comes in below the 2022 performance.In any case  Solvay appears to be attractively priced at less than 10 times earnings on a normalized EBITDA from next year on while the debt ratio will likely come in below 0.7 by the end of this year  resulting in Solvay trading at an EV/EBITDA ratio of approximately 4.5.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

So not including them seems a little harsh  particularly when you're talking about 'the crown' of 'Europe's biggest stock market' ' New Financial said.Brokers and investment bankers have dismissed fears that the UK is losing its relevance. 'It definitely doesn't feel like the other bourses are pulling ahead of the LSE ' said Julian Morse  chief executive of Cenkos Securities.Steven Fine  boss of broker Peel Hunt  pointed out several deals which hinted at growing international interest in the UK market.Microsoft has bought 4 per cent of the LSE  and French investment bank Societe Generale has taken a 51 per cent stake in an equities research venture with Alliance Bernstein  which has a strong presence in London.Reform key to London staying top Reform is desperately needed to ensure London remains Europe's foremost financial market  experts claim. Changes from tax adjustments to a shake-up of the listing rules are among ideas to improve the stock market.

So not including them seems a little harsh  particularly when you're talking about 'the crown' of 'Europe's biggest stock market' ' New Financial said.Brokers and investment bankers have dismissed fears that the UK is losing its relevance. 'It definitely doesn't feel like the other bourses are pulling ahead of the LSE ' said Julian Morse  chief executive of Cenkos Securities.Steven Fine  boss of broker Peel Hunt  pointed out several deals which hinted at growing international interest in the UK market.Microsoft has bought 4 per cent of the LSE  and French investment bank Societe Generale has taken a 51 per cent stake in an equities research venture with Alliance Bernstein  which has a strong presence in London.Reform key to London staying top Reform is desperately needed to ensure London remains Europe's foremost financial market  experts claim. Changes from tax adjustments to a shake-up of the listing rules are among ideas to improve the stock market.
