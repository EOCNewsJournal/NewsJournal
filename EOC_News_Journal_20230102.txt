15728,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4567231-befesa-expect-self-funded-50-percent-ebitda-growth-by-2027,Befesa: Expect A Self-Funded 50% EBITDA Growth By 2027 (OTCMKTS:BFSAF),Befesa is a world leader in steel dust recycling. Read why BFSAF may be in a good position to perform well between now and the end of the decade.,Elena Bionysheva-Abramova/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionBefesa (OTCPK:BFSAF) is one of the most important companies offering recycling services to the aluminum and steel industries in the USA and certain European countries as it is active in Spain  France  Germany and Sweden. It also has exposure to China  South Korea and Turkey and its total annual capacity is approximately 2.5 million tonnes of EAF steel dust  salt slags and secondary aluminum. It operates 23 recycling plants where the hazardous dust and waste is processed. The company receives a fee for its recycling services and is able to recover and sell zinc as a by-product credit.Befesa Investor RelationsDuring 2021  the company processed only about 1.6 million tonnes of residue yet its utilization rate was about 83% as the US-based capacity was only added during 2021 (and contributed for just 4.5 months to the financial result) and it took some time to ramp up operations and utilisation rates should increase. Unfortunately  it looks like 2022 may be a bit of a ‘lost year’ as especially in China the zero covid policy had an impact on the activities. On top of that  in Europe  the higher energy prices obviously also had a noticeable impact.Yahoo FinanceAlthough Befesa has its main listing in Germany on the Deutsche Boerse  keep in mind the company is actually Luxembourg-based and as such  dividends are subject to the standard 15% Luxembourg dividend withholding tax. There are 40M shares outstanding  resulting in a current market capitalization of approximately 1.8B EUR. The company’s most liquid listing is in Germany where it is trading with BFSA as its ticker symbol. The average daily volume exceeds 80 000 shares  resulting in a total monetary value of approximately 3.5M EUR per day. I will use the EUR as base currency throughout this article.The 9M 2022 results were interesting  and provide a clear path for further growthAs mentioned in the introduction  I had high hopes for volumes and utilisation rates to pick up in 2022 but this may be a transitional year. Nonetheless  the EBITDA and operating cash flow will remain strong and this should enable Befesa to complete its expansion plans.The total revenue in the first nine months of the year was approximately 858M EUR  a 49% increase compared to 9M 2021. But despite the strong revenue increase  the EBITDA increased by just 19.8 to 164M EUR. While that still is a nice increase compared to the first nine months of last year with a 137M EUR EBITDA  the FY EBITDA result is coming in slightly below expectations and this forced Befesa to update its EBITDA guidance to ‘more than 220M EUR’.Befesa Investor RelationsThe company remains very profitable as its bottom line shows a net income of 88.4M EUR for an EPS of approximately 2.2 EUR per share. That’s fine  especially when we look at 2022 as a transitional year.The cash flows were also very strong. The company reported an operating cash flow of 78.3M EUR but this included a 23.2M EUR investment in the working capital and includes a 20.5M EUR tax payment  although only 17.1M EUR would be due based on the 9M 2022 income statement. There should also be a 7M EUR lease payment included in the financing liabilities  so on an adjusted basis  the operating cash flow was approximately 98M EUR.Befesa Investor RelationsThe total capex was 75.2M EUR  but this includes growth capex. The total maintenance capex was just over 50M EUR in 9M 2022 as Befesa was catching up on some maintenance  and the annual sustaining capex should actually be less than 40M EUR. So if I would use the normalized sustaining capex and pro-rata it for three quarters  Befesa’s sustaining free cash flow would be around 56M EUR in the first nine months of the year.That’s lower than the reported net income  and the difference is easy to explain: the income statement included a 44M EUR ‘other operating income’ and 40.6M EUR of that amount was deducted again in the cash flow statement and was related to the lower than anticipated acquisition cost of the a zinc refining asset.In any case  we should expect the annualized operating cash flow to be approximately 130M EUR  likely increasing to 150-160M EUR in 2023. The cash flow will be useful to fund the company’s ambitious 5-year growth plan as it wants to invest 400-450M EUR in new capacity and assets.The next image  from the capital markets day presentation was very important for me.Befesa Investor RelationsWith a total investment of just 410-450M EUR  Befesa expects it will be able to boost its EBITDA by 110-135M EUR per year  resulting in IRRs exceeding 20%.The very first element has now been completed with the acquisition of the zinc refining asset in the USA. This means the cumulative 2023-2027 growth capex will likely be just 60-70M EUR per year. This  in combination with the sustaining capex and the planned dividends should be fully covered by the incoming operating cash flows.Befesa Investor RelationsAnd as you can see above  this should result in an EBITDA run rate of 350-380M EUR. After deducting interest expenses (20M EUR  as I anticipate the gross debt to decrease  despite the growth capex)  80M EUR in depreciation and applying a 25% tax rate  the net income run rate by the end of 2027 should be 200M EUR or 5 EUR per share. And assuming the sustaining capex will continue to track at about 70% of the depreciation expenses  the free cash flow per share will be 5.5-5.75 EUR per share. And this should all be achieved without requiring a single Euro of external funding.Where will the growth come from?I think the future for recycling looks great  and I think I should cut Befesa some slack as 2022 wasn’t the easiest year to work in. I expect more from 2023 as the end of China’s tough zero covid policy and the easing of the European energy prices should boost Befesa’s performance. With EBITDA tracking at the lower end of the 2022 guidance and the company likely missing its expectations to push the debt ratio below two times the EBITDA  all eyes should be on 2023 and beyond.Befesa is the number 1 for steel dust recycling in the world and it’s easy to understand the large steel producers will want to continue to work with a reputable counterparty.Befesa Investor RelationsBefesa should grow in line with the acceleration of the conversion to Electric Arc Furnaces in the world  a cleaner way to produce steel. Between now and 2030  a total of 13-14 million tonnes of steel production will be converted to EAF  requiring the need for an additional 300 000 tonnes per year of dust handling capacity.Befesa Investor RelationsWe see a similar conversion plan in Europe  driving the need for an additional 350 000 tonnes in dust handling capacity by the end of this decade.Befesa Investor RelationsSo with its current expansion plan  Befesa is simply planning to retain market share and isn’t even budgeting gaining additional market share.The real unknown is China where about 60 million tonnes of steel production is expected to be converted to Electric Arc Furnaces. This should create the demand for an additional 1 million tonnes of dust handling capacity. Befesa plans to grow its market share from 10% to 15-20% in China and its current expansion plans will provide 330 000 tonnes of additional handling capacity.Befesa Investor RelationsInvestment thesisWhile the EBITDA will likely come in at just over 220M EUR this year  I expect a double-digit EBITDA increase in 2023 as China is reopening and Befesa will commission additional capacity.I also like the company’s 5-year growth plan which should increase the EBITDA by in excess of 50%. All these expansions can easily be self-funded with the incoming operating cash flow the next few years. I think the company’s expansion plans are credible  realistic and achievable. Applying a multiple of 10 times EBITDA (which I think is fair given Befesa’s leadership in the space and the fact that I can only see the demand for recycling going up)  the lower end of the 2027 run rate EBITDA guidance would result in an enterprise value of 3.5B EUR and an equity value of approximately 3B EUR (assuming 500M EUR in net debt by the end of that year). That represents a share price of 75 EUR. Reaching that target price would represent an annual return of 13.6% over four years (assuming the market will price the company based on its expectations for FY 2027 at the start of 2027).The combination of all elements means I’m planning to have a very close look at Befesa as the company’s EBITDA should gradually increase from here on.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Among the subjects dealt with was a technical provision  aimed at ratifying the conclusion of an amendment to the trust agreement.As a reminder  on September 15  2022  the Corporation established a management trust (the ""Trust"") as part of the equitization of simple bonds. The Trust is managed by the management company Equitis Gestion in its capacity as trustee (the ""Trustee"") under a trust agreement entered on the same day between the Trustee and the Company (the ""Trust Agreement"").The recent evolution of the Company's share price makes it necessary to do certain technical adjustments to the terms and conditions of the E warrants in order to enable the Trust to be able to carry out its mission. Thus  in accordance with the delegation of authority conferred on it by the Combined Shareholders' Meeting dated December 27  2021 under the terms of the 7th resolution to modify the characteristics of the E warrants and to adopt accordingly the amended terms and conditions of the E warrants  the Board of Directors of the Company today authorized the conclusion of an amendment relating to these adjustments concerning the release of the new shares to be issued as part of the exercise of BSA E : (i) in the event that the Exercise Price is higher than the nominal value of the Company's share  the release of the New Shares issued upon exercise of the warrants will take place by offsetting certain claims  liquid and payable  and (ii) in the event that the Exercise Price is lower than the par value of the Company's share  the release of the New Shares issued upon exercise of the E warrants will take place (a) by offsetting against certain  liquid and payable claims up to the Exercise Price  and (b) by incorporation of reserves  profits or premiums of the Company up to the difference between the par value of the Company's share and the Exercise Price.Story continuesAs a reminder  the exercise price of the E warrants will be equal to 90% of the lowest daily volume-weighted average price of the company's share  observed on trading days during which the holder of E warrants has not sold shares of the company among the fifteen (15) trading days immediately preceding the applicable exercise date  without being less than the minimum issue price of the new shares authorized by the applicable resolution.The detailed characteristics of the BSA E are published on the Company's website.About Delta Drone : The Delta Drone Group is a recognized international player in the civil drone sector for professional use.

As stated in several press releases issued in 2022  GTT is involved in Russia in the tank design of 15 ice-breaking LNG carriers under construction by the Zvezda Shipbuilding Complex (Zvezda)  as well as in the design of three GBSs1 for Saren B.V2.As of October 1  2022  revenues of €74 million remained to be recognised for the ice-breaking LNG carriers by 2025 and €12 million for the GBSs by 2027  i.e. a total exposure representing less than 6% of the order book.Following an in-depth analysis of European sanction packages N° 8 and 9 notably prohibiting engineering services with Russian companies  the Group announces that it is ceasing its activities in Russia.As of January 8  2023  the contract with Zvezda will be suspended and GTT's interventions will be limited  on the two most advanced LNG carriers  to ensuring the safety of the projects and the integrity of the technology  in compliance with the international sanctions in force.With regards to the GBS projects  the terms of GTT's departure are currently being finalised.These elements will have a financial impact mainly from 2023. GTT's order book will no longer include projects in Russia in the future. In addition  from 2023 onwards  the Group's annual targets will exclude the revenues and EBITDA that would be generated by the last services in progress in Russia.As a reminder  other orders under construction in Asian shipyards  relating to six ice-breaking LNG carriers and two FSUs3  are intended specifically for Russian Arctic projects. To date  these projects are proceeding normally. As of October 1  2022  these orders represented a total revenue of €31 million for GTT  to be recognised by 2024. Finally  eight conventional LNG carriers ordered by international shipowners  under construction in Asian shipyards  are also intended for Russian Arctic projects  but can operate in all types of conditions.The Group remains sensitive to the evolution of the situation and is taking all necessary measures to protect its employees and stakeholders  in compliance with international sanctions.About GTTGTT is a technological expert in containment systems with cryogenic membranes used to transport and store liquefied gases.

As stated in several press releases issued in 2022  GTT is involved in Russia in the tank design of 15 ice-breaking LNG carriers under construction by the Zvezda Shipbuilding Complex (Zvezda)  as well as in the design of three GBSs1 for Saren B.V2.As of October 1  2022  revenues of €74 million remained to be recognised for the ice-breaking LNG carriers by 2025 and €12 million for the GBSs by 2027  i.e. a total exposure representing less than 6% of the order book.Following an in-depth analysis of European sanction packages N° 8 and 9 notably prohibiting engineering services with Russian companies  the Group announces that it is ceasing its activities in Russia.As of January 8  2023  the contract with Zvezda will be suspended and GTT's interventions will be limited  on the two most advanced LNG carriers  to ensuring the safety of the projects and the integrity of the technology  in compliance with the international sanctions in force.With regards to the GBS projects  the terms of GTT's departure are currently being finalised.These elements will have a financial impact mainly from 2023. GTT's order book will no longer include projects in Russia in the future. In addition  from 2023 onwards  the Group's annual targets will exclude the revenues and EBITDA that would be generated by the last services in progress in Russia.As a reminder  other orders under construction in Asian shipyards  relating to six ice-breaking LNG carriers and two FSUs3  are intended specifically for Russian Arctic projects. To date  these projects are proceeding normally. As of October 1  2022  these orders represented a total revenue of €31 million for GTT  to be recognised by 2024. Finally  eight conventional LNG carriers ordered by international shipowners  under construction in Asian shipyards  are also intended for Russian Arctic projects  but can operate in all types of conditions.The Group remains sensitive to the evolution of the situation and is taking all necessary measures to protect its employees and stakeholders  in compliance with international sanctions.About GTTGTT is a technological expert in containment systems with cryogenic membranes used to transport and store liquefied gases.

The Group anticipate…,"Dutch Green Business Group N.V. (""DGB"" or ""the Group"") (Euronext: DGB: NL0009169515)  a leading carbon project developer and ecosystem restoration company  issues financial guidance with expected gross carbon credit sales from project operations for the coming years. The Group anticipates gross credit sales for the next ten years to range from € 79.8 million to € 160.8 million and upwards of € 327 million over the lifetime of its project pipeline.DGB is a project developer of nature-based projects to originate high-integrity carbon credits known as Verified Emission Reduction credits (""VER credits""). VER credits are also commonly known as carbon offsets or carbon credits  and each VER credit equals one tonne of verified emission reduction. Carbon reduction markets are rapidly expanding. There is near-universal consensus from governments and private companies that the market needs to grow to match global net-zero needs.Two years ago  DGB started its first project and now has seven large-scale projects under management and in operation. The operational team is conducting feasibility studies on 10 more projects. Projects need 2 to 6 years of financing before they start to originate VER credits.In 2022  the Group expanded its project development pipeline to 11.1 million VER credits in development  with an upside of an additional 27 million VER credits through the ability to scale its existing afforestation and reforestation operations in Cameroon and Kenya.""We have a varied mix of projects under development  leading to a strong and balanced pipeline of carbon credits to be delivered.""- Thomas Donia  Director of OperationsThe Group bases its financial outlook on its current project pipeline and does explicitly not take potential new projects into account. The expected carbon credit issuance profile of its projects under development is:Year Minimal Delivery Volume (in tCO2e) Maximum Delivery Volume (in tCO2e) 2023 25 000 25 000 2024 131 000 131 000 2025 563 000 633 000 2026 538 000 538 000 2027 693 000 693 000 2028 1 305 000 2 554 000 2029 441 000 441 000 2030 439 000 439 000 2031 439 000 439 000 2032 913 000 2 677 000 2033 - 2062 5.453 000 29 407 000 Total 10 940 000 37 977 000DGB's gross carbon credit salesfor the next ten years are expected to range from € 79.8 million to € 160.8 million. The Group anticipates gross carbon credit sales of upwards of € 327 million over the lifetime of its project pipeline.The financial outlook is based on currently available project documentation  its carbon credit generation projections and current market transactions  working with an illustrative sale price of $ 10.00 per credit from a cookstove project  $ 11.00 per credit of a REDD+ project and $ 18.00 per credit of an AR project. The Board of Directors foresees a price increment in accordance with the EY Net Zero Centre (1). It forecasts a verified emission reduction price rise of 9.5% to 15.0% per year towards 2035 and 4.0% to 6.0% price increase from 2035 to 2050.For clarity  all credit sale prices are only illustrative  and the price of VER credits on the market may be higher or lower at the time of sale. DGB continues to participate in the global discussion around the best way to value emission reduction projects under development - alongside leading accountancy firms - including their impact in contributing towards biodiversity and societal impact on the ground where reforestation projects are being developed.Project FinanceDGB finances its operations and projects by entering into long-term offtake agreements for carbon credits to be verified later in the coming years. Forward selling of VER credits currently under development is an important part of its financing  sales and distribution strategy.In Q3 2021 DGB entered into its first binding offtake agreements and in Q1 2022 the Group completed the first significant offtake agreement worth € 1.1 million with a major international energy company. In 2022  DGB completed forward sales of € 2.9 million. The Board of Directors expects an increase in forward sales of VER credits for 2023.Subsequently  DGB has raised over € 2.5 million with the issue of (convertible) green bonds to finance the development of its projects. The Board of Directors is exploring several options to finance its project development further.CEO Duijvestijn stated: ""The outlook for DGB is robust  driven by increasing global demand for verified emission reduction credits as the world moves towards its net zero goals and by an expanding project pipeline. DGB delivered on its strategic and operational objectives in 2022 and plans to expand its project pipeline further in the coming years- this will enable our Group to offer more credits to a broader range of corporate clients with binding offtake agreements. I am confident we will achieve our financial outlook as we maintain our high-growth pace.""DGB GROUP NVpress@dgb.earth+31108080126 (NL)+442080640936 (EN)DGB is a project developer of high-quality large-scale carbon and biodiversity projects accredited by third parties.
