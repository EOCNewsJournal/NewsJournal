If you’re in the market for a new career (and  let’s face it  who isn’t right now?)  your timing couldn’t be more perfect—January is actually one of the best months to get a new job.Surprised? You’re not alone. Most people presume looking for a job early in the new year is futile  but that’s a myth. Hiring is a year-round process  and there’s never a bad time to apply for a job. What’s more  right now is actually one of the best times to apply. Here’s why:Hit the ground runningFor one  companies want to hit the ground running in the new year and employ the right people to take them through 2023 and beyond. Leadership needs to move quickly on the recruitment front  thanks to the war-for-talent environment.No doubt there are openings that have been left unfilled for months. Imagine a job was posted in November  a handful of people were interviewed  and then it got lost in the lead-up to the festive period. They now need to get that filled  and fast.Secondly  hiring managers are likely to receive their new budgets and targets in January  and are ready to spend. And thirdly  a lot of companies see a spike in resignations in January  following those year-end employee bonuses which were handed out in December. This is typically anticipated by companies  and a strong factor in why a hiring push is probably needed.So  to get a jump on the competition  start by checking out The House of Talent Job Board for lots of amazing opportunities. Once you’ve found what you’re looking for  it’s time to dust off that resume  especially if it’s been sitting stale since you last looked for a job. Think of it as a marketing document or even a story that you carefully craft to convince the reader—aka  the hiring manager—you have what they need.Now  write your cover letter. Even if only one in two gets read  there’s still a 50% chance that including one could help you. Start with a clear  concise opening line to catch the reader’s attention  and make sure the entire letter is no more than one page. Also  if you can  skip the “To whom it may concern” and try to address your letter to someone specific by name.Then  once you get the opportunity to interview  whether that’s remotely or in person; prepare  prepare  prepare. Find out as much as possible about the company—from its culture to its history. Research the industry  familiarizing yourself with any trends and challenges. And practice those go-to interview questions; like “Tell me about yourself” and “What’s your greatest weakness?”Finally  don’t lose sight of the fact that the interview process is also an opportunity for you to evaluate the company and make sure it’s a right fit for you. Ask about the culture and pay close attention to how the hiring manager treats you throughout the interview process. Never ignore your instincts and always do your research.Speaking of research  we’ve done some of it for you (you’re welcome). Here are three fantastic companies hiring now.

The circa-$30M acquisition was first revealed in October last year  giving the acquisitive French powerhouse control of an 8 000-hour catalog including factual hits such as Highway Thru Hell  Heavy Rescue: 401  Massive Engineering Mistakes  Halifax: Retribution and Deadly Women. The move leaves distributor Banijay Rights  which shops the likes of MasterChef and Big Brother  with a circa-130 000 hour catalog. Today  Banijay took full control and a spokeswoman said the intention is that “[Beyond’s] distribution activities will fall under Banijay Rights’ name.” The acquisition was carried out via a Scheme Implementation Deed which  once implemented  means Beyond ceases to be publicly traded. Beyond Managing Director and CEO Mikael Borglund is remaining in his current role. Banijay itself is part of FL Entertainment  which formed last July and is listed on Euronext Amsterdam through an agreement with SPAC investment group.‘Bridgerton’ star to narrate BBC doc ‘Serengeti’Bridgerton star Adjoa Andoh is to take over from Lupita Nyong’o narrating the third season of BBC natural history doc Serengeti.

This technology  PathsDx Test  was shown to be robust  rapid and sensitive for the diagnosis of infectious diseases.The paper is titled  “Towards a rapid-turnaround low-depth unbiased metagenomics sequencing workflow on the Illumina platforms” has been published online in Medrxiv  which can be downloaded at the following website address: https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.01.02.22283504v1.Dr Clark Cheng  Chief Medical Officer of Aptorum Group Limited commented  “We are pleased to announce the exceptional performance of PathsDx for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. The PathsDx Test has achieved so far over 95% for both sensitivity and specificity. Our clinical validation also shows that at least 93% of plasma samples agreed with the standard of care clinical diagnostic test results (compared to reported industry liquid biopsy test of 92.9%1). These results are remarkable as an initial stage of clinical validation. The remaining 7% are viruses with very small genome (5kb)  which is a common challenge across the genomic industry  we have a workflow development plan currently to strive towards detecting these small genome viruses  eventually targeting close to full agreement. The trend of our validation results so far also suggests further improvement of our validation statistics (including the comparison of agreement with standard of case diagnostics) based on increases in further clinical validation samples. The effect of different sequencing times was evaluated with the 19-hour iSeq 100 paired end run  a more clinically palatable simulated iSeq 100 truncated run and the rapid 7-hour MiniSeq platform. Significantly  our results demonstrate the ability to detect both DNA and RNA pathogens with low-depth sequencing. In conclusion  it was demonstrated that iSeq 100 and MiniSeq platforms are compatible with unbiased low-depth metagenomics identification with the PathsDx Test workflow and its library preparation kits and can be chosen based on required turnaround times. We are also pleased to now have built up a pathogen genomic database of close to 20 000 species to support our software analytics in identifying  on an unbiased metagenomic basis  the pathogenic composition in the patient sample. With these remarkable results  we are actively expanding our validation sites in Singapore  Hong Kong and United States. We would also like to express our heartfelt appreciation of Illumina for supporting this project via intellectual  mechanical and technical input.”References1. https://kariusdx.com/karius-test/clinical-and-analytical-validationAbout Aptorum’s PathsDx ProgramPathsDx Test (formerly known as “RPIDD”) is an innovative liquid biopsy-driven rapid pathogen molecular diagnostics technology. PathsDx Test  through proprietary and patented technologies  is developed with the aim to  cost effectively through patient blood samples  enrich pathogenic DNA and RNA for pathogenic genome sequencing analysis through harnessing the power of Next-Generation Sequencing platforms and proprietary artificial intelligence-based software analytics with the goal to rapidly identify and detect any foreign pathogens (virus  bacteria  fungus  parasites) without bias through its genome composition and to identify other unknown pathogens and novel mutated pathogens. PathsDx Test is comprised of two proprietary metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS) components: (i) HostEL for depletion of human background to enrich both pathogen DNA and RNA; (ii) AmpRE for one pot DNA/RNA library preparation for overall cost effective amplification. PathsDx Test has been and continues to be validated in human clinical samples and so far  such testing has been able to detect pathogens – ranging from bacteria  fungi and both DNA and RNA based viruses in an unbiased manner.About Aptorum GroupAptorum Group Limited (Nasdaq: APM  Euronext Paris: APM) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutic assets to treat diseases with unmet medical needs  particularly in oncology (including orphan oncology indications)  autoimmune and infectious diseases.

With a range of 100 miles  Midnight is optimized for back-to-back short distance trips of around 20 miles  with a charging time of approximately 10 minutes in-between.This unique partnership in the urban air mobility industry will leverage each company’s respective strengths and competencies to bring the Midnight aircraft to market. Archer brings its world-class team of eVTOL  electric powertrain and certification experts while Stellantis will contribute advanced manufacturing technology and expertise  experienced personnel and capital to the partnership. This combination is intended to enable the rapid scaling of aircraft production to meet Archer’s commercialization plans  while allowing Archer to strengthen its path to commercialization by helping it avoid hundreds of millions of dollars of spending during the manufacturing ramp up phase.

Stellantis also intends to increase its strategic shareholding through future purchases of Archer stock in the open market. These actions  along with the other elements of this expanded partnership  will enable Stellantis to become a long-term  cornerstone investor in Archer.“We’ve been working closely with Archer for the past two years  and I am continually impressed by their ingenuity and unwavering commitment to deliver ” said Carlos Tavares  Stellantis CEO. “Deepening our partnership with Archer as a strategic investor with plans for growing our shareholding demonstrates how Stellantis is pushing the boundaries to provide sustainable freedom of mobility  from the road to the sky. Supporting Archer with our manufacturing expertise is another example of how Stellantis will lead the way the world moves.”“Stellantis’ continued recognition of Archer’s progress toward commercialization  and today’s commitment of significant resources to build the Midnight aircraft with us  places Archer in a strong position to be first to market ” said Adam Goldstein  founder and CEO of Archer. “Our two companies are taking these important steps together to realize a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine urban transportation.”Stellantis has been a strategic partner to Archer since 2020 through various collaboration initiatives  and as an investor since 2021.

Full and final detailed consolidated financial figures will be published by mid-March 2023.Campine’s 2022 total consolidated revenues are expected to be approximately 315 M€  up 40% from the 226 M€ in 2021. The increased sales are related to the high metal prices in 2022 and the consolidation of 6 months of sales from the 2 new battery breaker plants in France and plastics recycling company C2P.The 2022 EBITDA is forecasted to amount to approximately 27 M€  up roughly 20% from the22.6 M€ in 2021. The EBITDA is impacted by a positive non-recurring non-cash effect of 8 M€ resulting from the valuation of assets and liabilities of the new French plants in accordance with IFRS 3 and IFRS 13 regulations.For further information you can contact Karin Leysen (tel. no +32 14 60 15 49)(email: Karin.Leysen@campine.com)Attachment,neutral,0.46,0.53,0.01,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,True,English,"['Campine', '2022 profits', 'final detailed consolidated financial figures', 'Recylex S.A. group', 'positive non-recurring non-cash effect', '2 new battery breaker plants', '2022 total consolidated revenues', 'new French plants', 'specialty chemicals company', 'high metal prices', 'plastics recycling company', 'new factories', 'metals recycling', 'Euronext Brussels', 'higher profits', 'successful integration', 'Karin Leysen', 'Karin.Leysen', 'IFRS 13 regulations', 'Regulated information', 'Campine NV', 'January', 'Beerse', 'Belgium', 'France', 'Full', 'mid-March', '315 M', '226 M', 'increased', 'sales', 'consolidation', '6 months', 'C2P', 'The', '2022 EBITDA', '27 M', '8 M', 'assets', 'liabilities', 'accordance', 'Attachment']",2023-01-04,2023-01-04,marketscreener.com

(the Company)  a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) listed on Euronext Amsterdam  publishes its consolidated financial statements for the financial year ending 31 December 2022 (the Consolidated Financial Statements) and its annual report 2022  including the report of its management board and the report of its supervisory board (the Annual Report).The Company furthermore announces that it currently believes that the consummation of a suitable Business Combination is highly improbable. Since its IPO  the Company has reviewed more than a hundred potential targets  and had advanced discussions with multiple of them. Despite extensive efforts to date  none of these discussions has resulted in the consummation of a Business Combination. Certain prospective targets were  through investigation  found not to meet the Company's target business criteria  or otherwise would not result in a Business Combination at an acceptable valuation  while others elected to pursue other strategic avenues like a stand-alone IPO or full or partial private sale. Some targets seemed hesitant to pursue a Business Combination due to macro-economic events impacting valuations and disappointing stock price performance in capital markets generally.Although ít is highly probable that the Company will not be able to complete a suitable Business Combination before the Business Combination Deadline  being 16 February 2023  the Company is continuing its search process in earnest  in a disciplined manner  up until the Business Combination Deadline  but will in parallel prepare for its dissolution and liquidation  such that the amount held in the Escrow Account can be returned to shareholders as soon as possible after the Business Combination Deadline. Should the search process result in a suitable Business Combination target being identified  an extension of the Business Combination Deadline would be required  and as such a general meeting would be convened and the corresponding Business Combination put to shareholder vote.In accordance with the Prospectus  if no Business Combination is completed by the Business Combination Deadline  the Company shall  within three months after the Business Combination Deadline  convene a general meeting for the purpose of adopting a resolution to (i) dissolve and liquidate the Company and (ii) pursue delisting of the Ordinary Shares and Market Warrants. To this end  the Company convenes the AGM (as defined below) such that it will take place on 16 February 2023  to also facilitate voting on the dissolution and liquidation of the Company in accordance with its articles of association and article 2:19 of the Dutch Civil Code as further set out in the agenda  explanatory notes and convocation for the AGM  which are published today as well.Following adoption of the relevant resolution(s) by the AGM and commencement of the liquidation  the Management Board  under supervision by the Supervisory Board  shall assume control of the affairs of the Company until close of the liquidation proceedings  taking into account a statutory creditor opposition period of two months. The amount per share that shareholders will receive as liquidation distributions is expected to be announced by press release on 19 April 2023  and the amount per share is expected to be EUR 10. The last day to trade shares is expected to be 19 April 2023  and payment of liquidation distributions is expected to take place on 24 April 2023. There will be no distribution of proceeds or otherwise from the Escrow Account with respect to any of the Market Warrants or the Founder Warrants  which will automatically expire without value upon the failure by the Company to complete a Business Combination. The last day to trade Market Warrants is expected to be 16 February 2023.The costs relating to a potential liquidation and dissolution of the Company are expected to be covered by the proceeds that were raised with the issuance of the Founder Warrants.Indicative TimetableThe timetable below sets forth certain expected key dates for the AGM and the liquidation:Event Time (CET) and date Notice of AGM to shareholders 08:00 CET 4 January 2023 Record date to attend AGM 19 January 2023 AGM 10:00 CET 16 February 2023 Liquidation process commences1 17 February 2023 Expected delisting of the Ordinary Shares1 20 April 2023 Expected payment of liquidation distributions1 24 April 2023 Liquidation complete  Company ceases to exist1 25 April 20231 Presumes that resolutions lor liquidation are approved at the AGM.Annual General MeetingThe Company invites its shareholders to its Annual General Meeting of Shareholders formally held at the head office of the Company (Oldenzaalsestraat 500  7524 AE Enschede) on Thursday 16 February 2023 at 10:00 (CET) (the AGM).

Inventiva’s request for a consultation with the FDA followed a public communication by the FDA1 suggesting that an alternative approach to seek full approval in patients with NASH could be considered upon submission of positive results of a Phase III trial using a histology surrogate endpoint in patients with NASH and a Phase III clinical outcome trial in patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis. The Company’s proposed changes to the NATiV3 trial are designed to align with the alternative regulatory approach and are expected to be beneficial to the overall lanifibranor clinical program by 1) reducing the number of biopsies a patient undergoes during the trial from three to two  2) reducing the trial duration a patient has to consent to from 7 years to 72 weeks  3) offering all patients in the trial access to a lanifibranor treatment for at least 48 weeks by allowing them to enter into a new active treatment extension study  and 4) potentially expanding the addressable patient population to include patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis.Story continuesThe Company continues to anticipate submission of a new drug application (“NDA”) to the FDA for accelerated approval with such planned submission based on liver histological endpoints of approximately 900 patients treated over a 72-week period. A placebo-controlled exploratory cohort is anticipated to be added in parallel to Part 1 of the NATiV3 trial and will include approximately 200 patients with NASH and fibrosis who are not eligible for Part 1 (screen failures). The Company anticipates that this exploratory cohort may allow the generation of additional results using non-invasive tests and contribute to the safety database requirement to support the planned submission for potential accelerated approval.Under the newly planned trial design  the original Part 2 of the NATiV3 trial  a clinical outcome trial that was previously planned to be conducted in approximately 2 000 patients with F2 and F3 fibrosis for a maximum period of seven years will be replaced by a placebo-controlled Phase III outcome trial which will be event driven and is expected to last approximately three years. The Phase III outcome trial is expected to randomize approximately 800 patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis.If the results of the outcome trial in patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis are positive  the Company anticipates they will support the submission of an NDA to the FDA for full approval and the potential expansion of the addressable patient population beyond patients with F2 and F3 fibrosis to include patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis  a patient population at an increased risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality and for which the anti-fibrotic properties of lanifibranor could potentially prevent worsening of the disease. Lanifibranor has been granted both Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations for the treatment of NASH  and the FDA confirmed last year that the Fast Track designation is also applicable to the treatment of NASH for patients with compensated cirrhosis.The Company does not expect these trial design changes to have a significant impact on the funds originally anticipated to be needed to potentially secure accelerated approval in the U.S. or conditional approval in the EU based on the new trial design.Michael Cooreman  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Inventiva  commented: “This is a promising evolution for our lanifibranor clinical development program. Not only are Inventiva’s changes to the trial design expected to provide an opportunity for patients enrolled in the placebo arm to access a lanifibranor treatment arm  but also the changes are designed to reduce the number of biopsies. We believe these changes provide an opportunity to support the anticipated timeline to seek accelerated approval and potentially bring a treatment option to a larger population which could include patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis.”Prof. Arun Sanyal  M.D.  Director of the Stravitz-Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease and Metabolic Health  Virginia Commonwealth University and co-principal investigator of the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial  stated: “This revised clinical trial design has been built on the latest thinking in the field. I believe that these changes to the program with an amended NATiV3 and Phase III trial in patients with compensated cirrhosis will reinforce the scientific rigour of the development program as it will now include a broader patient population in dire need of treatment options.”Prof. Sven Francque  M.D.  Ph.D.  Antwerp University Hospital and co-principal investigator of the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial  said: “Lanifibranor has demonstrated a significant effect on the composite histological endpoint in the NATIVE Phase IIb trial. Given lanifibranor’s mechanism of action and the effects demonstrated on the broad spectrum of the disease  including its anti-fibrotic effect  I believe including patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis in the program is extremely relevant.”Donna Cryer  President and CEO of the Global Liver Institute  said: “Patients and caregivers commend Inventiva for making these changes in consultation with regulators. We believe limiting the number of biopsies and giving patients  both randomized and placebo  access to a treatment arm are invaluable measures for patients suffering with NASH and who still do not have access to any approved treatment options today.”Enrolment for Part 1 of the NATiV3 trial remains on track  with the last patient first visit expected to take place in the second half of 2023.About lanifibranorLanifibranor  Inventiva’s lead product candidate  is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce anti-fibrotic  anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (“PPAR”) isoforms  which are well-characterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well-balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the most-advanced pan-PPAR agonist in clinical development for the treatment of NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan-PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre-clinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH  MPS and other diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva is currently advancing one clinical candidate  has a pipeline of two preclinical programs and continues to explore other development opportunities to add to its pipeline.Inventiva’s lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.Inventiva’s pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult MPS VI patients. As part of Inventiva’s decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended its clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is also in the process of selecting an oncology development candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 80 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development.

The company  which has won numerous innovation awards  is a pioneer in radio frequency energy collection and storage technology that allows tags to operate without batteries and with a reduced infrastructure  a real revolution in the field of traceability. The energy harvesting technology allows the deployment of systems with batteryless Ultra-Wideband (UWB) tags  which are less expensive to deploy and more environmentally friendly. The solution offers the possibility of tracking a wide range of assets (materials  tools  manufactured parts  bins  etc.) while limiting inventory costs.Uwinloc has developed  in collaboration with major industrial groups  a real-time location solution  called MahVis  which is integrated in boxes fixed to forklifts  and therefore eliminating the need for a fixed infrastructure. The company already works with more than 30 customers and is present in five countries (including a subsidiary in the US).Objective: to reduce the deployment and usage costs of real-time traceability technologiesParagon ID launched its Real Time Locating Systems (RTLS) business in 2018 with the acquisition of RFiD Discovery in the UK  for the provision of real-time tracking of equipment in industrial and medical environments  including more than 100 hospitals as well as numerous industrial and logistics companies  both in the UK and France.The acquisition of the French start-up Apitrak in May 2021 accelerated the development of RTLS solutions in the cloud  facilitating the international development of a multi-technology Software as a Service (SaaS) platform aimed at industrial and healthcare companies.In July 2022  the acquisition of Tracktio allowed Paragon ID to expand its solutions to further technologies such as GPS  LoRa  UWB  Quuppa and optical identification  and to strengthen its offering with the TrackSphereTM software platform (SaaS)  for the industrial  mining and logistics sectors.With this new acquisition  Paragon ID continues to expand its solutions available to the industrial sector with a battery-free RTLS system - a more ecological and less expensive alternative without compromising the level of accuracy.The MahVis system perfectly complements the existing offer for the sector. The objective is to merge the MahVis solution with the TrackSphereTM software to create a complete RTLS platform capable of integrating all technologies currently available on the market and providing the most suitable solutions for a wide range of industrial applications.Clem Garvey  CEO of Paragon ID  said:""The acquisition of the assets of Uwinloc is an opportunity to expand our RTLS offering with a revolutionary patented technology. The RFiD Discovery teams are looking forward to offer real-time tracking solutions without the need for battery-powered tags  taking away cost barriers to expanding systems and making our solutions more sustainable.

This survey  covering 11 425 sq km  will broaden the region's 3D coverage and deliver additional high-quality data essential for the exploration efforts in the basin.Existing 2D data and adjacent 3D data indicate the presence of reservoir depositional fairways in this location which overlies a source interval contemporaneous with the Guyana Basin petroleum system. Basin model studies predict a mature Early Cretaceous petroleum system with extensive regional reservoir distribution. The nearby Zaedyus discovery in French Guiana and the Narina and Venus wildcat discoveries on the conjugate margins of Liberia and Sierra Leone support resource potential in the Foz do Amazonas Basin.Sophie Zurquiyah  CGG CEO  said: “With our established leadership in geoscience solutions and unmatched experience in the Equatorial Margin  spanning Guyana  Suriname and Brazil  our geoscientists will apply their deep regional insight and cutting-edge imaging technologies such as time-lag FWI and least-squares migration to provide the high-resolution  high-fidelity data and images necessary to better understand this frontier basin.”Kristian Johansen  CEO at TGS  commented  “We’re pleased to announce the Foz do Amazonas 3D Phase II project with our partner CGG.

""EU exports of soft wheat stood at 16.71 Mt on 1 January  up 6% compared to the previous campaign  at 15.79 Mt. France is the leading European exporter with 6.83 Mt  followed by Romania with 1.96 Mt and Germany with 1.88 Mt.""Russian Rivalry: Some of wheat's downward pressure is also coming from an onslaught of foreign competitors at a time when demand may be weakening as the Federal Reserve pursues higher interest rates to cool down the economy. Terry Reilly at Futures International attributes wheat's price-declines this week to ""ongoing Russia competition and strong December Western Australia wheat exports.

The company  which has won numerous innovation awards  is a pioneer in radio frequency energy collection and storage technology that allows tags to operate without batteries and with a reduced infrastructure  a real revolution in the field of traceability. The energy harvesting technology allows the deployment of systems with batteryless Ultra-Wideband (UWB) tags  which are less expensive to deploy and more environmentally friendly. The solution offers the possibility of tracking a wide range of assets (materials  tools  manufactured parts  bins  etc.) while limiting inventory costs.Uwinloc has developed  in collaboration with major industrial groups  a real-time location solution  called MahVis  which is integrated in boxes fixed to forklifts  and therefore eliminating the need for a fixed infrastructure. The company already works with more than 30 customers and is present in five countries (including a subsidiary in the US).Objective: to reduce the deployment and usage costs of real-time traceability technologiesParagon ID launched its Real Time Locating Systems (RTLS) business in 2018 with the acquisition of RFiD Discovery in the UK  for the provision of real-time tracking of equipment in industrial and medical environments  including more than 100 hospitals as well as numerous industrial and logistics companies  both in the UK and France.The acquisition of the French start-up Apitrak in May 2021 accelerated the development of RTLS solutions in the cloud  facilitating the international development of a multi-technology Software as a Service (SaaS) platform aimed at industrial and healthcare companies.In July 2022  the acquisition of Tracktio allowed Paragon ID to expand its solutions to further technologies such as GPS  LoRa  UWB  Quuppa and optical identification  and to strengthen its offering with the TrackSphereTM software platform (SaaS)  for the industrial  mining and logistics sectors.With this new acquisition  Paragon ID continues to expand its solutions available to the industrial sector with a battery-free RTLS system - a more ecological and less expensive alternative without compromising the level of accuracy.The MahVis system perfectly complements the existing offer for the sector. The objective is to merge the MahVis solution with the TrackSphereTM software to create a complete RTLS platform capable of integrating all technologies currently available on the market and providing the most suitable solutions for a wide range of industrial applications.Clem Garvey  CEO of Paragon ID  said:""The acquisition of the assets of Uwinloc is an opportunity to expand our RTLS offering with a revolutionary patented technology. The RFiD Discovery teams are looking forward to offer real-time tracking solutions without the need for battery-powered tags  taking away cost barriers to expanding systems and making our solutions more sustainable.
