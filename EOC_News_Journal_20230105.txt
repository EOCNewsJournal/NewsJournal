If you’re in the market for a new career (and  let’s face it  who isn’t right now?)  your timing couldn’t be more perfect—January is actually one of the best months to get a new job. Surprised? You’re not alone. Most people presume look…,An award-winning editor  writer and speaker  Susan Armstrong has been connecting with audiences through her unique brand of storytelling fo (show all) An award-winning editor  writer and speaker  Susan Armstrong has been connecting with audiences through her unique brand of storytelling for over 25 years.Happy New Year to you! If you’re in the market for a new career (and  let’s face it  who isn’t right now?)  your timing couldn’t be more perfect—January is actually one of the best months to get a new job.Surprised? You’re not alone. Most people presume looking for a job early in the new year is futile  but that’s a myth. Hiring is a year-round process  and there’s never a bad time to apply for a job. What’s more  right now is actually one of the best times to apply. Here’s why:Hit the ground runningFor one  companies want to hit the ground running in the new year and employ the right people to take them through 2023 and beyond. Leadership needs to move quickly on the recruitment front  thanks to the war-for-talent environment.No doubt there are openings that have been left unfilled for months. Imagine a job was posted in November  a handful of people were interviewed  and then it got lost in the lead-up to the festive period. They now need to get that filled  and fast.Secondly  hiring managers are likely to receive their new budgets and targets in January  and are ready to spend. And thirdly  a lot of companies see a spike in resignations in January  following those year-end employee bonuses which were handed out in December. This is typically anticipated by companies  and a strong factor in why a hiring push is probably needed.So  to get a jump on the competition  start by checking out The House of Talent Job Board for lots of amazing opportunities. Once you’ve found what you’re looking for  it’s time to dust off that resume  especially if it’s been sitting stale since you last looked for a job. Think of it as a marketing document or even a story that you carefully craft to convince the reader—aka  the hiring manager—you have what they need.Now  write your cover letter. Even if only one in two gets read  there’s still a 50% chance that including one could help you. Start with a clear  concise opening line to catch the reader’s attention  and make sure the entire letter is no more than one page. Also  if you can  skip the “To whom it may concern” and try to address your letter to someone specific by name.Then  once you get the opportunity to interview  whether that’s remotely or in person; prepare  prepare  prepare. Find out as much as possible about the company—from its culture to its history. Research the industry  familiarizing yourself with any trends and challenges. And practice those go-to interview questions; like “Tell me about yourself” and “What’s your greatest weakness?”Finally  don’t lose sight of the fact that the interview process is also an opportunity for you to evaluate the company and make sure it’s a right fit for you. Ask about the culture and pay close attention to how the hiring manager treats you throughout the interview process. Never ignore your instincts and always do your research.Speaking of research  we’ve done some of it for you (you’re welcome). Here are three fantastic companies hiring now.

This technology  PathsDx Test  was shown to be robust  rapid and sensitive for the diagnosis of infectious diseases.The paper is titled  “Towards a rapid-turnaround low-depth unbiased metagenomics sequencing workflow on the Illumina platforms” has been published online in Medrxiv  which can be downloaded at the following website address: https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.01.02.22283504v1.Dr Clark Cheng  Chief Medical Officer of Aptorum Group Limited commented  “We are pleased to announce the exceptional performance of PathsDx for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. The PathsDx Test has achieved so far over 95% for both sensitivity and specificity. Our clinical validation also shows that at least 93% of plasma samples agreed with the standard of care clinical diagnostic test results (compared to reported industry liquid biopsy test of 92.9%1). These results are remarkable as an initial stage of clinical validation. The remaining 7% are viruses with very small genome (5kb)  which is a common challenge across the genomic industry  we have a workflow development plan currently to strive towards detecting these small genome viruses  eventually targeting close to full agreement. The trend of our validation results so far also suggests further improvement of our validation statistics (including the comparison of agreement with standard of case diagnostics) based on increases in further clinical validation samples. The effect of different sequencing times was evaluated with the 19-hour iSeq 100 paired end run  a more clinically palatable simulated iSeq 100 truncated run and the rapid 7-hour MiniSeq platform. Significantly  our results demonstrate the ability to detect both DNA and RNA pathogens with low-depth sequencing. In conclusion  it was demonstrated that iSeq 100 and MiniSeq platforms are compatible with unbiased low-depth metagenomics identification with the PathsDx Test workflow and its library preparation kits and can be chosen based on required turnaround times. We are also pleased to now have built up a pathogen genomic database of close to 20 000 species to support our software analytics in identifying  on an unbiased metagenomic basis  the pathogenic composition in the patient sample. With these remarkable results  we are actively expanding our validation sites in Singapore  Hong Kong and United States. We would also like to express our heartfelt appreciation of Illumina for supporting this project via intellectual  mechanical and technical input.”References1. https://kariusdx.com/karius-test/clinical-and-analytical-validationAbout Aptorum’s PathsDx ProgramPathsDx Test (formerly known as “RPIDD”) is an innovative liquid biopsy-driven rapid pathogen molecular diagnostics technology. PathsDx Test  through proprietary and patented technologies  is developed with the aim to  cost effectively through patient blood samples  enrich pathogenic DNA and RNA for pathogenic genome sequencing analysis through harnessing the power of Next-Generation Sequencing platforms and proprietary artificial intelligence-based software analytics with the goal to rapidly identify and detect any foreign pathogens (virus  bacteria  fungus  parasites) without bias through its genome composition and to identify other unknown pathogens and novel mutated pathogens. PathsDx Test is comprised of two proprietary metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS) components: (i) HostEL for depletion of human background to enrich both pathogen DNA and RNA; (ii) AmpRE for one pot DNA/RNA library preparation for overall cost effective amplification. PathsDx Test has been and continues to be validated in human clinical samples and so far  such testing has been able to detect pathogens – ranging from bacteria  fungi and both DNA and RNA based viruses in an unbiased manner.About Aptorum GroupAptorum Group Limited (Nasdaq: APM  Euronext Paris: APM) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutic assets to treat diseases with unmet medical needs  particularly in oncology (including orphan oncology indications)  autoimmune and infectious diseases.

(the Company)  a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) listed on Euronext Amsterdam  publishes its consolidated financial statements for the financial year ending 31 December 2022 (the Consolidated Financial Statements) and its annual report 2022  including the report of its management board and the report of its supervisory board (the Annual Report).The Company furthermore announces that it currently believes that the consummation of a suitable Business Combination is highly improbable. Since its IPO  the Company has reviewed more than a hundred potential targets  and had advanced discussions with multiple of them. Despite extensive efforts to date  none of these discussions has resulted in the consummation of a Business Combination. Certain prospective targets were  through investigation  found not to meet the Company's target business criteria  or otherwise would not result in a Business Combination at an acceptable valuation  while others elected to pursue other strategic avenues like a stand-alone IPO or full or partial private sale. Some targets seemed hesitant to pursue a Business Combination due to macro-economic events impacting valuations and disappointing stock price performance in capital markets generally.Although ít is highly probable that the Company will not be able to complete a suitable Business Combination before the Business Combination Deadline  being 16 February 2023  the Company is continuing its search process in earnest  in a disciplined manner  up until the Business Combination Deadline  but will in parallel prepare for its dissolution and liquidation  such that the amount held in the Escrow Account can be returned to shareholders as soon as possible after the Business Combination Deadline. Should the search process result in a suitable Business Combination target being identified  an extension of the Business Combination Deadline would be required  and as such a general meeting would be convened and the corresponding Business Combination put to shareholder vote.In accordance with the Prospectus  if no Business Combination is completed by the Business Combination Deadline  the Company shall  within three months after the Business Combination Deadline  convene a general meeting for the purpose of adopting a resolution to (i) dissolve and liquidate the Company and (ii) pursue delisting of the Ordinary Shares and Market Warrants. To this end  the Company convenes the AGM (as defined below) such that it will take place on 16 February 2023  to also facilitate voting on the dissolution and liquidation of the Company in accordance with its articles of association and article 2:19 of the Dutch Civil Code as further set out in the agenda  explanatory notes and convocation for the AGM  which are published today as well.Following adoption of the relevant resolution(s) by the AGM and commencement of the liquidation  the Management Board  under supervision by the Supervisory Board  shall assume control of the affairs of the Company until close of the liquidation proceedings  taking into account a statutory creditor opposition period of two months. The amount per share that shareholders will receive as liquidation distributions is expected to be announced by press release on 19 April 2023  and the amount per share is expected to be EUR 10. The last day to trade shares is expected to be 19 April 2023  and payment of liquidation distributions is expected to take place on 24 April 2023. There will be no distribution of proceeds or otherwise from the Escrow Account with respect to any of the Market Warrants or the Founder Warrants  which will automatically expire without value upon the failure by the Company to complete a Business Combination. The last day to trade Market Warrants is expected to be 16 February 2023.The costs relating to a potential liquidation and dissolution of the Company are expected to be covered by the proceeds that were raised with the issuance of the Founder Warrants.Indicative TimetableThe timetable below sets forth certain expected key dates for the AGM and the liquidation:Event Time (CET) and date Notice of AGM to shareholders 08:00 CET 4 January 2023 Record date to attend AGM 19 January 2023 AGM 10:00 CET 16 February 2023 Liquidation process commences1 17 February 2023 Expected delisting of the Ordinary Shares1 20 April 2023 Expected payment of liquidation distributions1 24 April 2023 Liquidation complete  Company ceases to exist1 25 April 20231 Presumes that resolutions lor liquidation are approved at the AGM.Annual General MeetingThe Company invites its shareholders to its Annual General Meeting of Shareholders formally held at the head office of the Company (Oldenzaalsestraat 500  7524 AE Enschede) on Thursday 16 February 2023 at 10:00 (CET) (the AGM).

Inventiva’s request for a consultation with the FDA followed a public communication by the FDA1 suggesting that an alternative approach to seek full approval in patients with NASH could be considered upon submission of positive results of a Phase III trial using a histology surrogate endpoint in patients with NASH and a Phase III clinical outcome trial in patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis. The Company’s proposed changes to the NATiV3 trial are designed to align with the alternative regulatory approach and are expected to be beneficial to the overall lanifibranor clinical program by 1) reducing the number of biopsies a patient undergoes during the trial from three to two  2) reducing the trial duration a patient has to consent to from 7 years to 72 weeks  3) offering all patients in the trial access to a lanifibranor treatment for at least 48 weeks by allowing them to enter into a new active treatment extension study  and 4) potentially expanding the addressable patient population to include patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis.Story continuesThe Company continues to anticipate submission of a new drug application (“NDA”) to the FDA for accelerated approval with such planned submission based on liver histological endpoints of approximately 900 patients treated over a 72-week period. A placebo-controlled exploratory cohort is anticipated to be added in parallel to Part 1 of the NATiV3 trial and will include approximately 200 patients with NASH and fibrosis who are not eligible for Part 1 (screen failures). The Company anticipates that this exploratory cohort may allow the generation of additional results using non-invasive tests and contribute to the safety database requirement to support the planned submission for potential accelerated approval.Under the newly planned trial design  the original Part 2 of the NATiV3 trial  a clinical outcome trial that was previously planned to be conducted in approximately 2 000 patients with F2 and F3 fibrosis for a maximum period of seven years will be replaced by a placebo-controlled Phase III outcome trial which will be event driven and is expected to last approximately three years. The Phase III outcome trial is expected to randomize approximately 800 patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis.If the results of the outcome trial in patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis are positive  the Company anticipates they will support the submission of an NDA to the FDA for full approval and the potential expansion of the addressable patient population beyond patients with F2 and F3 fibrosis to include patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis  a patient population at an increased risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality and for which the anti-fibrotic properties of lanifibranor could potentially prevent worsening of the disease. Lanifibranor has been granted both Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations for the treatment of NASH  and the FDA confirmed last year that the Fast Track designation is also applicable to the treatment of NASH for patients with compensated cirrhosis.The Company does not expect these trial design changes to have a significant impact on the funds originally anticipated to be needed to potentially secure accelerated approval in the U.S. or conditional approval in the EU based on the new trial design.Michael Cooreman  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Inventiva  commented: “This is a promising evolution for our lanifibranor clinical development program. Not only are Inventiva’s changes to the trial design expected to provide an opportunity for patients enrolled in the placebo arm to access a lanifibranor treatment arm  but also the changes are designed to reduce the number of biopsies. We believe these changes provide an opportunity to support the anticipated timeline to seek accelerated approval and potentially bring a treatment option to a larger population which could include patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis.”Prof. Arun Sanyal  M.D.  Director of the Stravitz-Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease and Metabolic Health  Virginia Commonwealth University and co-principal investigator of the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial  stated: “This revised clinical trial design has been built on the latest thinking in the field. I believe that these changes to the program with an amended NATiV3 and Phase III trial in patients with compensated cirrhosis will reinforce the scientific rigour of the development program as it will now include a broader patient population in dire need of treatment options.”Prof. Sven Francque  M.D.  Ph.D.  Antwerp University Hospital and co-principal investigator of the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial  said: “Lanifibranor has demonstrated a significant effect on the composite histological endpoint in the NATIVE Phase IIb trial. Given lanifibranor’s mechanism of action and the effects demonstrated on the broad spectrum of the disease  including its anti-fibrotic effect  I believe including patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis in the program is extremely relevant.”Donna Cryer  President and CEO of the Global Liver Institute  said: “Patients and caregivers commend Inventiva for making these changes in consultation with regulators. We believe limiting the number of biopsies and giving patients  both randomized and placebo  access to a treatment arm are invaluable measures for patients suffering with NASH and who still do not have access to any approved treatment options today.”Enrolment for Part 1 of the NATiV3 trial remains on track  with the last patient first visit expected to take place in the second half of 2023.About lanifibranorLanifibranor  Inventiva’s lead product candidate  is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce anti-fibrotic  anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (“PPAR”) isoforms  which are well-characterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well-balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the most-advanced pan-PPAR agonist in clinical development for the treatment of NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan-PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre-clinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH  MPS and other diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva is currently advancing one clinical candidate  has a pipeline of two preclinical programs and continues to explore other development opportunities to add to its pipeline.Inventiva’s lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.Inventiva’s pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult MPS VI patients. As part of Inventiva’s decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended its clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is also in the process of selecting an oncology development candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 80 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240 000 pharmacologically relevant molecules  approximately 60% of which are proprietary  as well as a wholly-owned research and development facility.Inventiva is a public company listed on compartment C of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA  ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA). www.inventivapharma.comContactsInventivaPascaline ClercVP of Global External Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 240 620 9175 Brunswick GroupLaurence Frost /Tristan Roquet Montegon /Aude LepreuxMedia relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83 Westwicke  an ICR CompanyPatricia L.

The company  which has won numerous innovation awards  is a pioneer in radio frequency energy collection and storage technology that allows tags to operate without batteries and with a reduced infrastructure  a real revolution in the field of traceability. The energy harvesting technology allows the deployment of systems with batteryless Ultra-Wideband (UWB) tags  which are less expensive to deploy and more environmentally friendly. The solution offers the possibility of tracking a wide range of assets (materials  tools  manufactured parts  bins  etc.) while limiting inventory costs.Uwinloc has developed  in collaboration with major industrial groups  a real-time location solution  called MahVis  which is integrated in boxes fixed to forklifts  and therefore eliminating the need for a fixed infrastructure. The company already works with more than 30 customers and is present in five countries (including a subsidiary in the US).Objective: to reduce the deployment and usage costs of real-time traceability technologiesParagon ID launched its Real Time Locating Systems (RTLS) business in 2018 with the acquisition of RFiD Discovery in the UK  for the provision of real-time tracking of equipment in industrial and medical environments  including more than 100 hospitals as well as numerous industrial and logistics companies  both in the UK and France.The acquisition of the French start-up Apitrak in May 2021 accelerated the development of RTLS solutions in the cloud  facilitating the international development of a multi-technology Software as a Service (SaaS) platform aimed at industrial and healthcare companies.In July 2022  the acquisition of Tracktio allowed Paragon ID to expand its solutions to further technologies such as GPS  LoRa  UWB  Quuppa and optical identification  and to strengthen its offering with the TrackSphereTM software platform (SaaS)  for the industrial  mining and logistics sectors.With this new acquisition  Paragon ID continues to expand its solutions available to the industrial sector with a battery-free RTLS system - a more ecological and less expensive alternative without compromising the level of accuracy.The MahVis system perfectly complements the existing offer for the sector. The objective is to merge the MahVis solution with the TrackSphereTM software to create a complete RTLS platform capable of integrating all technologies currently available on the market and providing the most suitable solutions for a wide range of industrial applications.Clem Garvey  CEO of Paragon ID  said:""The acquisition of the assets of Uwinloc is an opportunity to expand our RTLS offering with a revolutionary patented technology. The RFiD Discovery teams are looking forward to offer real-time tracking solutions without the need for battery-powered tags  taking away cost barriers to expanding systems and making our solutions more sustainable.

This survey  covering 11 425 sq km  will broaden the region's 3D coverage and deliver additional high-quality data essential for the exploration efforts in the basin.Existing 2D data and adjacent 3D data indicate the presence of reservoir depositional fairways in this location which overlies a source interval contemporaneous with the Guyana Basin petroleum system. Basin model studies predict a mature Early Cretaceous petroleum system with extensive regional reservoir distribution. The nearby Zaedyus discovery in French Guiana and the Narina and Venus wildcat discoveries on the conjugate margins of Liberia and Sierra Leone support resource potential in the Foz do Amazonas Basin.Sophie Zurquiyah  CGG CEO  said: “With our established leadership in geoscience solutions and unmatched experience in the Equatorial Margin  spanning Guyana  Suriname and Brazil  our geoscientists will apply their deep regional insight and cutting-edge imaging technologies such as time-lag FWI and least-squares migration to provide the high-resolution  high-fidelity data and images necessary to better understand this frontier basin.”Kristian Johansen  CEO at TGS  commented  “We’re pleased to announce the Foz do Amazonas 3D Phase II project with our partner CGG.

This survey  covering 11 425 sq km  will broaden the region's 3D coverage and deliver additional high-quality data essential for the exploration efforts in the basin.Existing 2D data and adjacent 3D data indicate the presence of reservoir depositional fairways in this location which overlies a source interval contemporaneous with the Guyana Basin petroleum system. Basin model studies predict a mature Early Cretaceous petroleum system with extensive regional reservoir distribution. The nearby Zaedyus discovery in French Guiana and the Narina and Venus wildcat discoveries on the conjugate margins of Liberia and Sierra Leone support resource potential in the Foz do Amazonas Basin.Sophie Zurquiyah  CGG CEO  said: “With our established leadership in geoscience solutions and unmatched experience in the Equatorial Margin  spanning Guyana  Suriname and Brazil  our geoscientists will apply their deep regional insight and cutting-edge imaging technologies such as time-lag FWI and least-squares migration to provide the high-resolution  high-fidelity data and images necessary to better understand this frontier basin.”Kristian Johansen  CEO at TGS  commented  “We’re pleased to announce the Foz do Amazonas 3D Phase II project with our partner CGG. For TGS  this project further strengthens our data library position in the Equatorial Margin and will be instrumental in enabling exploration companies to have a robust subsurface understanding in advance of future Permanent Offer rounds.”Early-out PSDM products will be available in Q4 2023  with final products available from Q3 2024.The project is supported by industry funding.About CGGCGG (www.cgg.com) is a global technology and HPC leader that provides data  products  services and solutions in Earth science  data science  sensing and monitoring.

""EU exports of soft wheat stood at 16.71 Mt on 1 January  up 6% compared to the previous campaign  at 15.79 Mt. France is the leading European exporter with 6.83 Mt  followed by Romania with 1.96 Mt and Germany with 1.88 Mt.""Russian Rivalry: Some of wheat's downward pressure is also coming from an onslaught of foreign competitors at a time when demand may be weakening as the Federal Reserve pursues higher interest rates to cool down the economy. Terry Reilly at Futures International attributes wheat's price-declines this week to ""ongoing Russia competition and strong December Western Australia wheat exports. Three import tenders were announced overnight.""U.S. Crops Healthy: Beyond the bearish knock-on effects from Europe's lower prices  U.S. grains markets are also facing downward price pressure because many regions' crops are doing quite well  meaning supplies aren't a concern  Agritel added. It said that while Kansas wheat crops are struggling a bit compared to late November  ""the decline in Kansas crop rating is offset by significant improvements in other regions  such as Colorado.""INSIGHTPressure-Cooked Corn: ""Corn started the year under pressure "" said Doug Bergman at RCM Alternatives in an early-morning note that correctly predicted more follow-through to the downside in today's trading action  as the market corrected from overbought conditions.

General The Notes. The notes: • will be general unsecured  senior obligations of the Issuer; • will constitute two new series of debt securities issued under the Indenture that will initially consist of $750 000 000 aggregate principal amount of 2026 notes and $1 000 000 000 aggregate principal amount of 2033 notes; • with respect to the 2026 notes  will mature on January 10  2026  and with respect to the 2033 notes  will mature on January 31  2033; • will be issued in denominations of $1 000 and integral multiples of $1 000 in excess thereof; • initially will be issued only in book-entry form represented by one or more notes in global form registered in the name of Cede & Co.  as nominee of DTC  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC  and deposited with the Series Trustee as custodian for DTC; and • will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured  unsubordinated basis by the Parent Guarantor  and in certain circumstances may be guaranteed in the future on the same basis by one or more Subsidiary Guarantors. 2 Interest. Interest on the notes will: • with respect to the 2026 notes  accrue at the rate of 5.05% per annum  and with respect to the 2033 notes  accrue at the rate of 5.35% per annum  in each case from January 10  2023 or the most recent interest payment date; • with respect to the 2026 notes  be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on January 10 and July 10 of each year  beginning on July 10  2023  and with respect to the 2033 notes  be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on January 31 and July 31 of each year  beginning on July 31  2023; • with respect to the 2026 notes  be payable to holders of record on the December 26 and June 25 immediately preceding the related interest payment dates  and with respect to the 2033 notes  be payable to holders of record on the January 15 and July 15 immediately preceding the related interest payment dates; and • be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Payment and Transfer. Initially  the notes will be issued only in global form. Beneficial interests in notes in global form will be shown on  and transfers of interests in notes in global form will be made only through  records maintained by DTC and its participants. Notes in definitive form  if any  may be presented for registration of transfer or exchange at the office or agency maintained by us for such purpose (which initially will be the corporate trust office of the Series Trustee located at 111 Fillmore Avenue East  St. Paul  Minnesota 55107-1402). Payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on notes in global form registered in the name of DTC's nominee will be made in immediately available funds to DTC's nominee  as the registered holder of such global notes. If any of the notes is no longer represented by a global note  payment of interest on the notes in definitive form may  at our option  be made at the corporate trust office of the Series Trustee indicated above or by check mailed directly to holders at their respective registered addresses or by wire transfer to an account designated by a holder to an account in the United States. If any interest payment date  maturity date or redemption date falls on a day that is not a business day  the payment due on the notes on such date will be made on the next business day with the same force and effect as if made on the relevant interest payment date  maturity date or redemption date. No interest will accrue on such payment for the period from and after the applicable interest payment date  maturity date or redemption date  as the case may be  to the date of such payment on the next business day. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of notes  but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. We are not required to register the transfer of or exchange any note selected for redemption or for a period of 15 days before mailing or furnishing a notice of redemption of the notes. The registered holder of a note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes  and all references in this ""Description of the Notes"" to ""holders"" mean holders of record  unless otherwise indicated. Investors may hold interests in the notes outside the United States through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (""Euroclear"") or Clearstream Banking S.A. (""Clearstream "" formerly Cedelbank) if they are participants in those systems  or indirectly through organizations which are participants in those systems. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests on behalf of their participants through customers' securities accounts in Euroclear's and Clearstream's names on the books of their respective depositaries which in turn will hold such positions in 3 customers' securities accounts in the names of the nominees of the depositaries on the books of DTC. All securities in Euroclear or Clearstream are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. Transfers of notes by persons holding through Euroclear or Clearstream participants will be effected through DTC  in accordance with DTC's rules  on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system by its depositaries; however  such transactions will require delivery of exercise instructions to the relevant European international clearing system by the participant in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will  if the exercise meets its requirements  deliver instructions to its depositaries to take action to effect exercise of the notes on its behalf by delivering notes through DTC and receiving payment in accordance with its normal procedures for next-day funds settlement. Payments with respect to the notes held through Euroclear or Clearstream will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear participants in accordance with the relevant system's rules and procedures  to the extent received by its depositaries. Replacement of Notes. We will replace any mutilated  destroyed  stolen or lost notes at the expense of the holder upon surrender of the mutilated notes to the Series Trustee or evidence of destruction  loss or theft of a note satisfactory to us and the Series Trustee. In the case of a destroyed  lost or stolen note  we may require an indemnity satisfactory to the Series Trustee and to us before a replacement note will be issued. Further Issuances We may from time to time  without notice or the consent of the holders of the notes of any series  create and issue further notes of the same series ranking equally and ratably with the original notes of that series in all respects (or in all respects except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such further notes  the first interest payment date  the public offering price and the issue date)  so that such further notes form a single series with the original notes of that series and have the same terms as to status  redemption or otherwise as the original notes of that series; provided  however  that such further notes must be fungible with the original notes of that series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Optional Redemption Prior to their maturity  in the case of the 2026 notes  and prior to October 31  2032  in the case of the 2033 notes (such date  the ""2033 notes Par Call Date"")  we may redeem the notes of each series at our option  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of: (1) (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming the notes of the series to be redeemed matured on the 2026 notes maturity date  in the case of the 2026 notes  or on the 2033 notes Par Call Date  in the case of the 2033 notes (such date  as applicable  the ""Relevant Date"")) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points  in the case of the 2026 notes  or 25 basis points  in the case of the 2033 notes less (b) interest accrued to the date of redemption  and (2) 100% of the principal amount of the notes of such series to be redeemed  plus  in either case  accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. On or after the 2033 notes Par Call Date  we may redeem the 2033 notes at our option  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2033 notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. 4 ""Treasury Rate"" means  with respect to any redemption date for the notes of any series  the yield determined by us in accordance with the following two paragraphs. The Treasury Rate shall be determined by us after 4:15 p.m.  New York City time (or after such time as yields on U.S. government securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System)  on the third business day preceding the redemption date based upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as ""Selected Interest Rates (Daily)-H.15"" (or any successor designation or publication) (""H.15"") under the caption ""U.S. government securities-Treasury constant maturities-Nominal"" (or any successor caption or heading) (""H.15 TCM""). In determining the Treasury Rate  we shall select  as applicable: (1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the period from the redemption date to the Relevant Date with respect to the notes to be redeemed (the ""Remaining Life""); or (2) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the Remaining Life  the two yields - one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately longer than the Remaining Life - and shall interpolate to the applicable Relevant Date on a straight-line basis (using the actual number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places; or (3) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life  the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15 closest to the Remaining Life. For purposes of this paragraph  the applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15 shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months or years  as applicable  of such Treasury constant maturity from the redemption date. If on the third business day preceding the redemption date H.15 TCM is no longer published  we shall calculate the Treasury Rate based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time  on the second business day preceding such redemption date of the United States Treasury security maturing on  or with a maturity that is closest to  the applicable Relevant Date. If there is no United States Treasury security maturing on the applicable Relevant Date but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally distant from the applicable Relevant Date  one with a maturity date preceding the applicable Relevant Date and one with a maturity date following the applicable Relevant Date  we shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date preceding the applicable Relevant Date. If there are two or more United States Treasury securities maturing on the applicable Relevant Date or two or more United States Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence  we shall select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States Treasury security that is trading closest to par based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time. In determining the Treasury Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph  the semi-annual yield to maturity of the applicable United States Treasury security shall be based upon the average of the bid and asked prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time  of such United States Treasury security  and rounded to three decimal places. Our actions and determinations in determining the redemption price shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes  absent manifest error. Notes called for redemption become due on the redemption date. Notices of optional redemption will be mailed (or electronically delivered in accordance with applicable procedures of DTC) at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the notes to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of optional redemption for the notes will state  among other things  the amount of notes to be redeemed  the redemption date  the method of calculating the redemption price and each place that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of notes to be redeemed. If less than all of the notes of any series are redeemed at any time  the Series Trustee will select the notes to be redeemed on a pro rata basis  by lot  or by any other method the Series Trustee deems fair and appropriate  and when the notes are in book entry form  in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC. Unless we default in payment of the redemption price  interest will cease to accrue on the redemption date with respect to any notes called for optional redemption. 5 Ranking The notes will be unsecured  unless we are required to secure them pursuant to the limitations on liens covenant described in the accompanying prospectus under ""Description of Debt Securities-Certain Covenants-Limitations on Liens."" The notes will also be the unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer and will rank equally with all other existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer. Each guarantee of the notes will be an unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the Guarantor and will rank equally with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Guarantor. The notes and each guarantee will effectively rank junior to any future indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantor that is both secured and unsubordinated to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness  and the notes will effectively rank junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities of the Issuer's subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors. On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to this senior notes offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom  at September 30  2022  the Issuer had approximately $29.5 billion principal amount of consolidated indebtedness  including $26.3 billion in senior notes and $2.3 billion of junior subordinated notes outstanding under the Base Indenture and a similar indenture  and $921 million in short-term commercial paper notes  and the Parent Guarantor had no indebtedness (excluding guarantees totaling $29.5 billion)  in each case excluding intercompany loans. Please read ""Capitalization."" Parent Guarantee The Parent Guarantor will fully and unconditionally guarantee to each holder and the Series Trustee  on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis  the full and prompt payment of principal of  premium  if any  and interest on the notes  when and as the same become due and payable  whether at stated maturity  upon redemption  by declaration of acceleration or otherwise. Potential Guarantee of Notes by Subsidiaries Initially  the notes will not be guaranteed by any of our Subsidiaries. In the future  however  if our Subsidiaries become guarantors or co-obligors of our Funded Debt (as defined below)  then those Subsidiaries will jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally  guarantee our payment obligations under the notes. We refer to any such Subsidiaries as ""Subsidiary Guarantors"" and sometimes to such guarantees as ""Subsidiary Guarantees."" Each Subsidiary Guarantor will execute a supplement to the Indenture to effect its guarantee. The obligations of each Guarantor under its guarantee of the notes will be limited to the maximum amount that will not result in the obligations of the Guarantor under the guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal or state law  after giving effect to: • all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor; and • any collection from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under its guarantee. ""Funded Debt"" means all Indebtedness maturing one year or more from the date of the creation thereof  all Indebtedness directly or indirectly renewable or extendible  at the option of the debtor  by its terms or by the terms of any instrument or agreement relating thereto  to a date one year or more from the date of the creation thereof  and all Indebtedness under a revolving credit or similar agreement obligating the lender or lenders to extend credit over a period of one year or more. Addition and Release of Subsidiary Guarantors The guarantee of any Guarantor may be released under certain circumstances. If we exercise our legal or covenant defeasance option with respect to debt securities of any series as described in the accompanying 6 prospectus under ""Description of Debt Securities-Defeasance and Discharge "" then any guarantee will be released with respect to that series. Further  if no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture  a Subsidiary Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from its guarantee: • automatically upon any sale  exchange or transfer  whether by way of merger or otherwise  to any person that is not our affiliate  of all of the Parent Guarantor's direct or indirect limited partnership or other equity interests in the Subsidiary Guarantor; • automatically upon the merger of the Subsidiary Guarantor into us or any other Guarantor or the liquidation and dissolution of the Subsidiary Guarantor; or • following delivery of a written notice by us to the Series Trustee  upon the release of all guarantees or other obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to any Funded Debt of ours  except the notes and any other series of debt securities issued under the Indenture. If at any time following any release of a Subsidiary Guarantor from its initial guarantee of the notes pursuant to the third bullet point in the preceding paragraph  the Subsidiary Guarantor again guarantees or co-issues any of our Funded Debt (other than our obligations under the Indenture)  then the Parent Guarantor will cause the Subsidiary Guarantor to again guarantee the notes in accordance with the Indenture. No Sinking Fund We are not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the notes of any series. 7 DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES In this Description of Debt Securities references to the ""Issuer"" mean only Enterprise Products Operating LLC (successor to Enterprise Products Operating L.P.) and not its subsidiaries. References to the ""Guarantor"" mean only Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and not its subsidiaries. References to ""we"" and ""us"" mean the Issuer and the Guarantor collectively. The debt securities will be issued under an Indenture dated as of October 4  2004  as amended and supplemented by the Tenth Supplemental Indenture  dated as of June 30  2007  and by the Thirty-Sixth Supplemental Indenture  dated as of September 15  2021  and as further amended by one or more additional supplemental indentures (collectively  the ""Indenture"")  among the Issuer  the Guarantor  Wells Fargo Bank  National Association  as original trustee  and by U.S. Bank National Association  as series trustee for the 3.300% Senior Notes due 2053 issued on September 15  2021 and any series of debt securities issued after such notes (the ""Trustee""). The terms of the debt securities will include those expressly set forth in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939  as amended (the ""Trust Indenture Act""). Capitalized terms used in this Description of Debt Securities have the meanings specified in the Indenture. This Description of Debt Securities is intended to be a useful overview of the material provisions of the debt securities and the Indenture. Since this Description of Debt Securities is only a summary  you should refer to the Indenture for a complete description of our obligations and your rights. General The Indenture does not limit the amount of debt securities that may be issued thereunder. Debt securities may be issued under the Indenture from time to time in separate series  each up to the aggregate amount authorized for such series. The debt securities will be general obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantor and may be subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantor. See ""-Subordination.""

At our option  we may make interest payments  by check mailed to the registered holders thereof or  if so stated in the applicable prospectus supplement  at the option of a holder by wire transfer to an account designated by the holder. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement  no payment on a Bearer Security will be made by mail to an address in the United States or by wire transfer to an account in the United States. Registered Securities may be transferred or exchanged  and they may be presented for payment  at the office of the Trustee or the Trustee's agent in New York City indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement  subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture  without the payment of any service charge  other than any applicable tax or governmental charge. Bearer Securities will be transferable only by delivery. Provisions with respect to the exchange of Bearer Securities will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement. Any funds we pay to a paying agent for the payment of amounts due on any debt securities that remain unclaimed for two years will be returned to us  and the holders of the debt securities must thereafter look only to us for payment thereof. Guarantee The Guarantor will unconditionally guarantee to each holder and the Trustee the full and prompt payment of principal of  premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities  when and as the same become due and payable  whether at maturity  upon redemption or repurchase  by declaration of acceleration or otherwise.

The Indenture does not require the maintenance of any financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. In addition  the Indenture does not contain any provisions that would require the Issuer to repurchase or redeem or otherwise modify the terms of any of the debt securities upon a change in control or other events involving the Issuer which may adversely affect the creditworthiness of the debt securities. Limitations on Liens.

Notwithstanding the preceding  under the Indenture  the Guarantor may  and may permit any Subsidiary to  create  assume  incur  or suffer to exist any lien (other than a Permitted Lien) upon any Principal Property or capital stock of a Restricted Subsidiary to secure debt of the Guarantor  the Issuer or any other person (other than the debt securities)  without securing the debt securities  provided that the aggregate principal amount of all debt then outstanding secured by such lien and all similar liens  together with all Attributable Indebtedness from Sale-Leaseback Transactions (excluding Sale-Leaseback Transactions permitted by clauses (1) through (4)  inclusive  of the first paragraph of the restriction on sale-leasebacks covenant described below) does not exceed 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets. Restriction on Sale-Leasebacks. The Indenture provides that the Guarantor will not  and will not permit any Subsidiary to  engage in the sale or transfer by the Guarantor or any Subsidiary of any Principal Property to a person (other than the Issuer or a Subsidiary) and the taking back by the Guarantor or any Subsidiary  as the case may be  of a lease of such Principal Property (a ""Sale-Leaseback Transaction"")  unless: (1) such Sale-Leaseback Transaction occurs within one year from the date of completion of the acquisition of the Principal Property subject thereto or the date of the completion of construction  development or substantial repair or improvement  or commencement of full operations on such Principal Property  whichever is later; (2) the Sale-Leaseback Transaction involves a lease for a period  including renewals  of not more than three years; (3) the Guarantor or such Subsidiary would be entitled to incur debt secured by a lien on the Principal Property subject thereto in a principal amount equal to or exceeding the Attributable Indebtedness from such Sale-Leaseback Transaction without equally and ratably securing the debt securities; or (4) the Guarantor or such Subsidiary  within a one-year period after such Sale-Leaseback Transaction  applies or causes to be applied an amount not less than the Attributable Indebtedness from such Sale-Leaseback Transaction to (a) the prepayment  repayment  redemption  reduction or retirement of any debt of the Guarantor or any Subsidiary that is not subordinated to the debt securities  or (b) the expenditure or expenditures for Principal Property used or to be used in the ordinary course of business of the Guarantor or its Subsidiaries. ""Attributable Indebtedness "" when used with respect to any Sale-Leaseback Transaction  means  as at the time of determination  the present value (discounted at the rate set forth or implicit in the terms of the lease included in such transaction) of the total obligations of the lessee for rental payments (other than amounts required to be paid on account of property taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance  assessments  utilities  operating and labor costs and other items that do not constitute payments for property rights) during the remaining term of the lease included in such Sale-Leaseback Transaction (including any period for which such lease has been extended). In the case of any lease that is terminable by the lessee upon the payment of a penalty or other termination payment  such amount shall be the lesser of the amount determined assuming termination upon the first date such lease may be terminated (in which case the amount shall also include the amount of the penalty or termination payment  but no rent shall be considered as required to be paid under such lease subsequent to the first date upon which it may be so terminated) or the amount determined assuming no such termination. Notwithstanding the preceding  under the Indenture the Guarantor may  and may permit any Subsidiary to  effect any Sale-Leaseback Transaction that is not excepted by clauses (1) through (4)  inclusive  of the first paragraph under ""-Restrictions on Sale-Leasebacks "" provided that the Attributable Indebtedness from such Sale-Leaseback Transaction  together with the aggregate principal amount of all other such Attributable 12 Indebtedness deemed to be outstanding in respect of all Sale-Leaseback Transactions and all outstanding debt (other than the debt securities) secured by liens (other than Permitted Liens) upon Principal Properties or upon capital stock of any Restricted Subsidiary  do not exceed 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets. Merger  Consolidation or Sale of Assets. The Indenture provides that each of the Guarantor and the Issuer may  without the consent of the holders of any of the debt securities  consolidate with or sell  lease  convey all or substantially all of its assets to  or merge with or into  any partnership  limited liability company or corporation if: (1) the entity surviving any such consolidation or merger or to which such assets shall have been transferred (the ""successor"") is either the Guarantor or the Issuer  as applicable  or the successor is a domestic partnership  limited liability company or corporation and expressly assumes all the Guarantor's or the Issuer's  as the case may be  obligations and liabilities under the Indenture and the debt securities (in the case of the Issuer) and the Guarantee (in the case of the Guarantor); (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and (3) the Issuer and the Guarantor have delivered to the Trustee an officers' certificate and an opinion of counsel  each stating that such consolidation  merger or transfer complies with the Indenture. The successor will be substituted for the Guarantor or the Issuer  as the case may be  in the Indenture with the same effect as if it had been an original party to the Indenture. Thereafter  the successor may exercise the rights and powers of the Guarantor or the Issuer  as the case may be  under the Indenture  in its name or in its own name. If the Guarantor or the Issuer sells or transfers all or substantially all of its assets  it will be released from all liabilities and obligations under the Indenture and under the debt securities (in the case of the Issuer) and the Guarantee (in the case of the Guarantor) except that no such release will occur in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets. Events of Default Each of the following will be an Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to a series of debt securities: (1) default in any payment of interest on any debt securities of that series when due  continued for 30 days; (2) default in the payment of principal of or premium  if any  on any debt securities of that series when due at its stated maturity  upon optional redemption  upon declaration or otherwise; (3) failure by the Guarantor or the Issuer to comply for 60 days after notice with its other agreements contained in the Indenture; (4) certain events of bankruptcy  insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer or the Guarantor (the ""bankruptcy provisions""); or (5) the Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect or is declared null and void in a judicial proceeding or the Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under the Indenture or the Guarantee. However  a default under clause (3) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series notify the Issuer and the Guarantor of the default such default is not cured within the time specified in clause (3) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice. An Event of Default for a particular series of debt securities will not necessarily constitute an Event of Default for any other series of debt securities that may be issued under the Indenture. If an Event of Default 13 (other than an Event of Default described in clause (4) above) occurs and is continuing  the Trustee by notice to the Issuer  or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series by notice to the Issuer and the Trustee  may  and the Trustee at the request of such holders shall  declare the principal of  premium  if any  and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on all the debt securities of that series to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration  such principal  premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default described in clause (4) above occurs and is continuing  the principal of  premium  if any  and accrued and unpaid interest on all the debt securities will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders. However  the effect of such provision may be limited by applicable law. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of a series may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the debt securities of that series and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and all existing Events of Default with respect to that series  other than the nonpayment of the principal of  premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities of that series that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration  have been cured or waived. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee  if an Event of Default with respect to a series of debt securities occurs and is continuing  the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders of debt securities of that series  unless such holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity or security against any loss  liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal  premium  if any  or interest when due  no holder of debt securities of any series may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the debt securities of that series unless: (1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default with respect to the debt securities of that series is continuing; (2) holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such holders have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss  liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series have not given the Trustee a direction that  in the opinion of the Trustee  is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions  the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series have the right to direct the time  method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to that series of debt securities. The Trustee  however  may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder of debt securities of that series or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Indenture provides that if a Default (that is  an event that is  or after notice or the passage of time would be  an Event of Default) with respect to the debt securities of a particular series occurs and is continuing and is known to the Trustee  the Trustee must mail to each holder of debt securities of that series notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of  premium  if any  or interest on the debt securities of that series  the Trustee may withhold notice  but only if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the holders of debt securities of that series. In addition  the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee  within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year  an officers' certificate as to compliance with all covenants in the Indenture and indicating whether the 14 signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer also is required to deliver to the Trustee  within 30 days after the occurrence thereof  an officers' certificate specifying any Default or Event of Default  its status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. Amendments and Waivers Amendments of the Indenture may be made by the Issuer  the Guarantor and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of all debt securities of each series affected thereby then outstanding under the Indenture (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the debt securities). However  without the consent of each holder of outstanding debt securities affected thereby  no amendment may  among other things: (1) reduce the percentage in principal amount of debt securities whose holders must consent to an amendment; (2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any debt securities; (3) reduce the principal of or extend the stated maturity of any debt securities; (4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any debt securities or change the time at which any debt securities may be redeemed; (5) make any debt securities payable in money other than that stated in the debt securities; (6) impair the right of any holder to receive payment of  premium  if any  principal of and interest on such holder's debt securities on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder's debt securities; (7) make any change in the amendment provisions which require each holder's consent or in the waiver provisions; (8) release any security that may have been granted in respect of the debt securities; or (9) release the Guarantor or modify the Guarantee in any manner adverse to the holders. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series affected thereby  may waive compliance by the Issuer and the Guarantor with certain restrictive covenants on behalf of all holders of debt securities of such series  including those described under ""-Certain Covenants-Limitations on Liens"" and ""-Certain Covenants-Restriction on Sale-Leasebacks."" The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series affected thereby  on behalf of all such holders  may waive any past Default or Event of Default with respect to that series (including any such waiver obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the debt securities)  except a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal  premium or interest or in respect of a provision that under the Indenture that cannot be amended without the consent of all holders of the series of debt securities that is affected. Without the consent of any holder  the Issuer  the Guarantor and the Trustee may amend the Indenture to: (1) cure any ambiguity  omission  defect or inconsistency; (2) provide for the assumption by a successor of the obligations of the Guarantor or the Issuer under the Indenture; (3) provide for uncertificated debt securities in addition to or in place of certificated debt securities (provided that the uncertificated debt securities are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended (the ""Internal Revenue Code"")  or in a manner such that the uncertificated debt securities are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code); 15 (4) add or release guarantees by any Subsidiary with respect to the debt securities  in either case as provided in the Indenture; (5) secure the debt securities or a guarantee; (6) add to the covenants of the Guarantor or the Issuer for the benefit of the holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Guarantor or the Issuer; (7) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder; (8) comply with any requirement of the Commission in connection with the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act; and (9) issue any other series of debt securities under the Indenture. The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. After an amendment requiring consent of the holders becomes effective  the Issuer is required to mail to the holders of an affected series a notice briefly describing such amendment. However  the failure to give such notice to all such holders  or any defect therein  will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment. Defeasance and Discharge The Issuer at any time may terminate all its obligations under the Indenture as they relate to a series of debt securities (""legal defeasance"")  except for certain obligations  including those respecting the defeasance trust and obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the debt securities of that series  to replace mutilated  destroyed  lost or stolen debt securities of that series and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of such debt securities. The Issuer at any time may terminate its obligations under covenants described under ""-Certain Covenants"" (other than ""Merger  Consolidation or Sale of Assets"") and the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Guarantor  and the Guarantee provision  described under ""-Events of Default"" above with respect to a series of debt securities (""covenant defeasance""). The Issuer may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option  payment of the defeased series of debt securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option  payment of the affected series of debt securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3)  (4)  (with respect only to the Guarantor) or (5) under ""-Events of Default"" above. If the Issuer exercises either its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option  each guarantee will terminate with respect to the debt securities of the defeased series and any security that may have been granted with respect to such debt securities will be released. In order to exercise either defeasance option  the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the ""defeasance trust"") with the Trustee money  U.S. Government Obligations (as defined in the Indenture) or a combination thereof for the payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on the relevant series of debt securities to redemption or maturity  as the case may be  and must comply with certain other conditions  including delivery to the Trustee of an opinion of counsel (subject to customary exceptions and exclusions) to the effect that holders of that series of debt securities will not recognize income  gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred. In the case of legal defeasance only  such opinion of counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") or other change in applicable federal income tax law. 16 In the event of any legal defeasance  holders of the debt securities of the relevant series would be entitled to look only to the trust fund for payment of principal of and any premium and interest on their debt securities until maturity. Although the amount of money and U.S. Government Obligations on deposit with the Trustee would be intended to be sufficient to pay amounts due on the debt securities of a defeased series at the time of their stated maturity  if the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option for the debt securities of any series and the debt securities are declared due and payable because of the occurrence of an Event of Default  such amount may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the debt securities of that series at the time of the acceleration resulting from such Event of Default. The Issuer would remain liable for such payments  however. In addition  the Issuer may discharge all its obligations under the Indenture with respect to debt securities of any series  other than its obligation to register the transfer of and exchange notes of that series  provided that it either: • delivers all outstanding debt securities of that series to the Trustee for cancellation; or • all such debt securities not so delivered for cancellation have either become due and payable or will become due and payable at their stated maturity within one year or are called for redemption within one year  and in the case of this bullet point the Issuer has deposited with the Trustee in trust an amount of cash sufficient to pay the entire indebtedness of such debt securities  including interest to the stated maturity or applicable redemption date. Subordination Debt securities of a series may be subordinated to our Senior Indebtedness  which we define generally to include all notes or other evidences of indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer  including guarantees  that are not expressly subordinate or junior in right of payment to any other indebtedness of the Issuer. Subordinated debt securities and the Guarantor's guarantee thereof will be subordinate in right of payment  to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture and the prospectus supplement relating to such series  to the prior payment of all indebtedness of the Issuer and Guarantor that is designated as ""Senior Indebtedness"" with respect to the series. The holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer will receive payment in full of the Senior Indebtedness before holders of subordinated debt securities will receive any payment of principal  premium or interest with respect to the subordinated debt securities: • upon any payment of distribution of our assets of the Issuer to its creditors; • upon a total or partial liquidation or dissolution of the Issuer; or • in a bankruptcy  receivership or similar proceeding relating to the Issuer or its property. Until the Senior Indebtedness is paid in full  any distribution to which holders of subordinated debt securities would otherwise be entitled will be made to the holders of Senior Indebtedness  except that such holders may receive units representing limited partner interests and any debt securities that are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness to at least the same extent as the subordinated debt securities. If the Issuer does not pay any principal  premium or interest with respect to Senior Indebtedness within any applicable grace period (including at maturity)  or any other default on Senior Indebtedness occurs and the maturity of the Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms  the Issuer may not: • make any payments of principal  premium  if any  or interest with respect to subordinated debt securities; • make any deposit for the purpose of defeasance of the subordinated debt securities; or 17 • repurchase  redeem or otherwise retire any subordinated debt securities  except that in the case of subordinated debt securities that provide for a mandatory sinking fund  we may deliver subordinated debt securities to the Trustee in satisfaction of our sinking fund obligation  unless  in either case  • the default has been cured or waived and the declaration of acceleration has been rescinded; • the Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash; or • the Issuer and the Trustee receive written notice approving the payment from the representatives of each issue of ""Designated Senior Indebtedness."" Generally  ""Designated Senior Indebtedness"" will include: • indebtedness for borrowed money under a bank credit agreement  called ""Bank Indebtedness""; and • any specified issue of Senior Indebtedness of at least $100 million. During the continuance of any default  other than a default described in the immediately preceding paragraph  that may cause the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness to be accelerated immediately without further notice  other than any notice required to effect such acceleration  or the expiration of any applicable grace periods  the Issuer may not pay the subordinated debt securities for a period called the ""Payment Blockage Period."" A Payment Blockage Period will commence on the receipt by us and the Trustee of written notice of the default  called a ""Blockage Notice "" from the representative of any Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period. The Payment Blockage Period may be terminated before its expiration: • by written notice from the person or persons who gave the Blockage Notice; • by repayment in full in cash of the Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Blockage Notice was given; or • if the default giving rise to the Payment Blockage Period is no longer continuing. Unless the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of the Senior Indebtedness  we may resume payments on the subordinated debt securities after the expiration of the Payment Blockage Period. Generally  not more than one Blockage Notice may be given in any period of 360 consecutive days unless the first Blockage Notice within the 360-day period is given by holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness  other than Bank Indebtedness  in which case the representative of the Bank Indebtedness may give another Blockage Notice within the period. The total number of days during which any one or more Payment Blockage Periods are in effect  however  may not exceed an aggregate of 179 days during any period of 360 consecutive days. After all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full and until the subordinated debt securities are paid in full  holders of the subordinated debt securities shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness. By reason of the subordination  in the event of insolvency  our creditors who are holders of Senior Indebtedness  as well as certain of our general creditors  may recover more  ratably  than the holders of the subordinated debt securities. Form and Denomination Unless otherwise indicated in a prospectus supplement  the debt securities of a series will be issued as Registered Securities in denominations of $1 000 and any integral multiple thereof. 18 Book-Entry System Unless otherwise indicated in a prospectus supplement  we will issue the debt securities in the form of one or more global securities in fully registered form initially in the name of Cede & Co.  as nominee of The Depository Trust Company (""DTC"")  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. Unless otherwise indicated in a prospectus supplement  the global securities will be deposited with the Trustee as custodian for DTC and may not be transferred except as a whole by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC or by DTC or any nominee to a successor of DTC or a nominee of such successor. DTC has advised us as follows: • DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law  a ""banking organization"" within the meaning of the New York Banking Law  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a ""clearing corporation"" within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code  and a ""clearing agency"" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  as amended (the ""Exchange Act""). • DTC holds securities that its participants deposit with DTC and facilitates the post-trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities  such as transfers and pledges  through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants' accounts  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. • Direct participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations and certain other organizations. • DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (""DTCC""). DTCC is the holding company for DTC  National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation  all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. • Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant  either directly or indirectly. • The rules applicable to DTC and its direct and indirect participants are on file with the Commission. Purchases of debt securities under the DTC system must be made by or through direct participants  which will receive a credit for the debt securities on DTC's records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of debt securities is in turn to be recorded on the direct and indirect participants' records. Beneficial owners of the debt securities will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase  but beneficial owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction  as well as periodic statements of their holdings  from the direct or indirect participant through which the beneficial owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the debt securities are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of direct and indirect participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners. Beneficial owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in the debt securities  except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the debt securities is discontinued. To facilitate subsequent transfers  all debt securities deposited by direct participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC's partnership nominee  Cede & Co.  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of debt securities with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the debt securities; DTC's records reflect only the identity of the direct participants to whose accounts such debt securities are credited  which may or may not be the beneficial owners. The direct and indirect participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. 19 Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to direct participants  by  direct participants to indirect participants  and by direct participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among them  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the global securities. Under its usual procedures  DTC mails an omnibus proxy to the issuer as soon as possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy assigns Cede & Co.'s consenting or voting rights to those direct participants to whose accounts the debt securities are credited on the record date (identified in the listing attached to the omnibus proxy). All payments on the global securities will be made to Cede & Co.  as holder of record  or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC's practice is to credit direct participants' accounts upon DTC's receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from us or the Trustee on payment dates in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC's records. Payments by participants to beneficial owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices  as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in ""street name "" and will be the responsibility of such participant and not of DTC  us or the Trustee  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) shall be the responsibility of us or the Trustee. Disbursement of such payments to direct participants shall be the responsibility of DTC  and disbursement of such payments to the beneficial owners shall be the responsibility of direct and indirect participants. DTC may discontinue providing its service as securities depositary with respect to the debt securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to us or the Trustee. In addition  we may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depositary). Under such circumstances  in the event that a successor securities depositary is not obtained  note certificates in fully registered form are required to be printed and delivered to beneficial owners of the global securities representing such debt securities. Neither we nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or obligation to direct or indirect participants  or the persons for whom they act as nominees  with respect to the accuracy of the records of DTC  its nominee or any participant with respect to any ownership interest in the debt securities  or payments to  or the providing of notice to participants or beneficial owners. So long as the debt securities are in DTC's book-entry system  secondary market trading activity in the debt securities will settle in immediately available funds. All payments on the debt securities issued as global securities will be made by us in immediately available funds. The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC's book-entry system has been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable  but we take no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Limitations on Issuance of Bearer Securities The debt securities of a series may be issued as Registered Securities (which will be registered as to principal and interest in the register maintained by the registrar for the debt securities) or Bearer Securities (which will be transferable only by delivery). If the debt securities are issuable as Bearer Securities  certain special limitations and conditions will apply. In compliance with United States federal income tax laws and regulations  we and any underwriter  agent or dealer participating in an offering of Bearer Securities will agree that  in connection with the original issuance of the Bearer Securities and during the period ending 40 days after the issue date  they will not offer  sell or deliver any such Bearer Securities  directly or indirectly  to a United States Person (as defined below) or to any person within the United States  except to the extent permitted under United States Treasury regulations. 20 Bearer Securities will bear a legend to the following effect: ""Any United States person who holds this obligation will be subject to limitations under the United States federal income tax laws  including the limitations provided in Sections 165(j) and 1287(a) of the Internal Revenue Code."" The sections referred to in the legend provide that  with certain exceptions  a United States taxpayer who holds Bearer Securities will not be allowed to deduct any loss with respect to  and will not be eligible for capital gain treatment with respect to any gain realized on the sale  exchange  redemption or other disposition of  the Bearer Securities. For this purpose  ""United States"" includes the United States of America and its possessions  and ""United States person"" means a citizen or resident of the United States  a corporation  partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States  or an estate or trust the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source. Pending the availability of a definitive global security or individual Bearer Securities  as the case may be  debt securities that are issuable as Bearer Securities may initially be represented by a single temporary global security  without interest coupons  to be deposited with a common depositary for the Euroclear System as operated by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (""Euroclear"") and Clearstream Banking S.A. (""Clearstream""  formerly Cedelbank)  for credit to the accounts designated by or on behalf of the purchasers thereof. Following the availability of a definitive global security in bearer form  without coupons attached  or individual Bearer Securities and subject to any further limitations described in the applicable prospectus supplement  the temporary global security will be exchangeable for interests in the definitive global security or for the individual Bearer Securities  respectively  only upon receipt of a ""Certificate of Non-U.S. Beneficial Ownership "" which is a certificate to the effect that a beneficial interest in a temporary global security is owned by a person that is not a United States Person or is owned by or through a financial institution in compliance with applicable United States Treasury regulations. No Bearer Security will be delivered in or to the United States. If so specified in the applicable prospectus supplement  interest on a temporary global security will be paid to each of Euroclear and Clearstream with respect to that portion of the temporary global security held for its account  but only upon receipt as of the relevant interest payment date of a Certificate of Non-U.S. Beneficial Ownership. No Recourse Against General Partner The Guarantor's general partner and its directors  officers  employees and members  as such  shall have no liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantor under the debt securities  the Indenture or the guarantee or for any claim based on  in respect of  or by reason of  such obligations or their creation. Each holder by accepting a note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the debt securities. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws  and it is the view of the Commission that such a waiver is against public policy. Concerning the Trustee The Indenture contains certain limitations on the right of the Trustee  should it become our creditor  to obtain payment of claims in certain cases  or to realize for its own account on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee is permitted to engage in certain other transactions. However  if it acquires any conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act  it must eliminate the conflict or resign as Trustee. The holders of a majority in principal amount of all outstanding debt securities (or if more than one series of debt securities under the Indenture is affected thereby  all series so affected  voting as a single class) will have the right to direct the time  method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy or power available to the Trustee for the debt securities or all such series so affected. If an Event of Default occurs and is not cured under the Indenture and is known to the Trustee  the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by the Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill 21 in its exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions  the Trustee will not be under any obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any of the holders of debt securities unless they shall have offered to such Trustee reasonable security and indemnity. U.S. Bank National Association is the Trustee under the Indenture for the 3.300% Senior Notes due 2053 issued on September 15  2021 and any series of debt securities issued after such notes and has been appointed by the Issuer as Registrar and Paying Agent with regard to such debt securities. U.S. Bank National Association is a lender under the Issuer's credit facilities. Governing Law The Indenture  the debt securities and the guarantee are governed by  and will be construed in accordance with  the laws of the State of New York. 22 Attachments Original LinkOriginal DocumentPermalink Disclaimer Enterprise Products Partners LP published this content on 05 January 2023 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

General The Notes. The notes: • will be general unsecured  senior obligations of the Issuer; • will constitute two new series of debt securities issued under the Indenture that will initially consist of $750 000 000 aggregate principal amount of 2026 notes and $1 000 000 000 aggregate principal amount of 2033 notes; • with respect to the 2026 notes  will mature on January 10  2026  and with respect to the 2033 notes  will mature on January 31  2033; • will be issued in denominations of $1 000 and integral multiples of $1 000 in excess thereof; • initially will be issued only in book-entry form represented by one or more notes in global form registered in the name of Cede & Co.  as nominee of DTC  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC  and deposited with the Series Trustee as custodian for DTC; and • will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured  unsubordinated basis by the Parent Guarantor  and in certain circumstances may be guaranteed in the future on the same basis by one or more Subsidiary Guarantors. 2 Interest. Interest on the notes will: • with respect to the 2026 notes  accrue at the rate of 5.05% per annum  and with respect to the 2033 notes  accrue at the rate of 5.35% per annum  in each case from January 10  2023 or the most recent interest payment date; • with respect to the 2026 notes  be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on January 10 and July 10 of each year  beginning on July 10  2023  and with respect to the 2033 notes  be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on January 31 and July 31 of each year  beginning on July 31  2023; • with respect to the 2026 notes  be payable to holders of record on the December 26 and June 25 immediately preceding the related interest payment dates  and with respect to the 2033 notes  be payable to holders of record on the January 15 and July 15 immediately preceding the related interest payment dates; and • be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Payment and Transfer. Initially  the notes will be issued only in global form. Beneficial interests in notes in global form will be shown on  and transfers of interests in notes in global form will be made only through  records maintained by DTC and its participants. Notes in definitive form  if any  may be presented for registration of transfer or exchange at the office or agency maintained by us for such purpose (which initially will be the corporate trust office of the Series Trustee located at 111 Fillmore Avenue East  St. Paul  Minnesota 55107-1402). Payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on notes in global form registered in the name of DTC's nominee will be made in immediately available funds to DTC's nominee  as the registered holder of such global notes. If any of the notes is no longer represented by a global note  payment of interest on the notes in definitive form may  at our option  be made at the corporate trust office of the Series Trustee indicated above or by check mailed directly to holders at their respective registered addresses or by wire transfer to an account designated by a holder to an account in the United States. If any interest payment date  maturity date or redemption date falls on a day that is not a business day  the payment due on the notes on such date will be made on the next business day with the same force and effect as if made on the relevant interest payment date  maturity date or redemption date. No interest will accrue on such payment for the period from and after the applicable interest payment date  maturity date or redemption date  as the case may be  to the date of such payment on the next business day. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of notes  but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. We are not required to register the transfer of or exchange any note selected for redemption or for a period of 15 days before mailing or furnishing a notice of redemption of the notes. The registered holder of a note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes  and all references in this ""Description of the Notes"" to ""holders"" mean holders of record  unless otherwise indicated. Investors may hold interests in the notes outside the United States through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (""Euroclear"") or Clearstream Banking S.A. (""Clearstream "" formerly Cedelbank) if they are participants in those systems  or indirectly through organizations which are participants in those systems. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests on behalf of their participants through customers' securities accounts in Euroclear's and Clearstream's names on the books of their respective depositaries which in turn will hold such positions in 3 customers' securities accounts in the names of the nominees of the depositaries on the books of DTC. All securities in Euroclear or Clearstream are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. Transfers of notes by persons holding through Euroclear or Clearstream participants will be effected through DTC  in accordance with DTC's rules  on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system by its depositaries; however  such transactions will require delivery of exercise instructions to the relevant European international clearing system by the participant in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will  if the exercise meets its requirements  deliver instructions to its depositaries to take action to effect exercise of the notes on its behalf by delivering notes through DTC and receiving payment in accordance with its normal procedures for next-day funds settlement. Payments with respect to the notes held through Euroclear or Clearstream will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear participants in accordance with the relevant system's rules and procedures  to the extent received by its depositaries. Replacement of Notes. We will replace any mutilated  destroyed  stolen or lost notes at the expense of the holder upon surrender of the mutilated notes to the Series Trustee or evidence of destruction  loss or theft of a note satisfactory to us and the Series Trustee. In the case of a destroyed  lost or stolen note  we may require an indemnity satisfactory to the Series Trustee and to us before a replacement note will be issued. Further Issuances We may from time to time  without notice or the consent of the holders of the notes of any series  create and issue further notes of the same series ranking equally and ratably with the original notes of that series in all respects (or in all respects except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such further notes  the first interest payment date  the public offering price and the issue date)  so that such further notes form a single series with the original notes of that series and have the same terms as to status  redemption or otherwise as the original notes of that series; provided  however  that such further notes must be fungible with the original notes of that series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Optional Redemption Prior to their maturity  in the case of the 2026 notes  and prior to October 31  2032  in the case of the 2033 notes (such date  the ""2033 notes Par Call Date"")  we may redeem the notes of each series at our option  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of: (1) (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming the notes of the series to be redeemed matured on the 2026 notes maturity date  in the case of the 2026 notes  or on the 2033 notes Par Call Date  in the case of the 2033 notes (such date  as applicable  the ""Relevant Date"")) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points  in the case of the 2026 notes  or 25 basis points  in the case of the 2033 notes less (b) interest accrued to the date of redemption  and (2) 100% of the principal amount of the notes of such series to be redeemed  plus  in either case  accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. On or after the 2033 notes Par Call Date  we may redeem the 2033 notes at our option  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2033 notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. 4 ""Treasury Rate"" means  with respect to any redemption date for the notes of any series  the yield determined by us in accordance with the following two paragraphs. The Treasury Rate shall be determined by us after 4:15 p.m.  New York City time (or after such time as yields on U.S. government securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System)  on the third business day preceding the redemption date based upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as ""Selected Interest Rates (Daily)-H.15"" (or any successor designation or publication) (""H.15"") under the caption ""U.S. government securities-Treasury constant maturities-Nominal"" (or any successor caption or heading) (""H.15 TCM""). In determining the Treasury Rate  we shall select  as applicable: (1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the period from the redemption date to the Relevant Date with respect to the notes to be redeemed (the ""Remaining Life""); or (2) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the Remaining Life  the two yields - one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately longer than the Remaining Life - and shall interpolate to the applicable Relevant Date on a straight-line basis (using the actual number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places; or (3) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life  the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15 closest to the Remaining Life. For purposes of this paragraph  the applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15 shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months or years  as applicable  of such Treasury constant maturity from the redemption date. If on the third business day preceding the redemption date H.15 TCM is no longer published  we shall calculate the Treasury Rate based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time  on the second business day preceding such redemption date of the United States Treasury security maturing on  or with a maturity that is closest to  the applicable Relevant Date. If there is no United States Treasury security maturing on the applicable Relevant Date but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally distant from the applicable Relevant Date  one with a maturity date preceding the applicable Relevant Date and one with a maturity date following the applicable Relevant Date  we shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date preceding the applicable Relevant Date. If there are two or more United States Treasury securities maturing on the applicable Relevant Date or two or more United States Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence  we shall select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States Treasury security that is trading closest to par based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time. In determining the Treasury Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph  the semi-annual yield to maturity of the applicable United States Treasury security shall be based upon the average of the bid and asked prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time  of such United States Treasury security  and rounded to three decimal places. Our actions and determinations in determining the redemption price shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes  absent manifest error. Notes called for redemption become due on the redemption date. Notices of optional redemption will be mailed (or electronically delivered in accordance with applicable procedures of DTC) at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the notes to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of optional redemption for the notes will state  among other things  the amount of notes to be redeemed  the redemption date  the method of calculating the redemption price and each place that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of notes to be redeemed. If less than all of the notes of any series are redeemed at any time  the Series Trustee will select the notes to be redeemed on a pro rata basis  by lot  or by any other method the Series Trustee deems fair and appropriate  and when the notes are in book entry form  in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC. Unless we default in payment of the redemption price  interest will cease to accrue on the redemption date with respect to any notes called for optional redemption. 5 Ranking The notes will be unsecured  unless we are required to secure them pursuant to the limitations on liens covenant described in the accompanying prospectus under ""Description of Debt Securities-Certain Covenants-Limitations on Liens."" The notes will also be the unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer and will rank equally with all other existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer. Each guarantee of the notes will be an unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the Guarantor and will rank equally with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Guarantor. The notes and each guarantee will effectively rank junior to any future indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantor that is both secured and unsubordinated to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness  and the notes will effectively rank junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities of the Issuer's subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors. On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to this senior notes offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom  at September 30  2022  the Issuer had approximately $29.5 billion principal amount of consolidated indebtedness  including $26.3 billion in senior notes and $2.3 billion of junior subordinated notes outstanding under the Base Indenture and a similar indenture  and $921 million in short-term commercial paper notes  and the Parent Guarantor had no indebtedness (excluding guarantees totaling $29.5 billion)  in each case excluding intercompany loans. Please read ""Capitalization."" Parent Guarantee The Parent Guarantor will fully and unconditionally guarantee to each holder and the Series Trustee  on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis  the full and prompt payment of principal of  premium  if any  and interest on the notes  when and as the same become due and payable  whether at stated maturity  upon redemption  by declaration of acceleration or otherwise. Potential Guarantee of Notes by Subsidiaries Initially  the notes will not be guaranteed by any of our Subsidiaries. In the future  however  if our Subsidiaries become guarantors or co-obligors of our Funded Debt (as defined below)  then those Subsidiaries will jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally  guarantee our payment obligations under the notes. We refer to any such Subsidiaries as ""Subsidiary Guarantors"" and sometimes to such guarantees as ""Subsidiary Guarantees."" Each Subsidiary Guarantor will execute a supplement to the Indenture to effect its guarantee. The obligations of each Guarantor under its guarantee of the notes will be limited to the maximum amount that will not result in the obligations of the Guarantor under the guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal or state law  after giving effect to: • all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor; and • any collection from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under its guarantee. ""Funded Debt"" means all Indebtedness maturing one year or more from the date of the creation thereof  all Indebtedness directly or indirectly renewable or extendible  at the option of the debtor  by its terms or by the terms of any instrument or agreement relating thereto  to a date one year or more from the date of the creation thereof  and all Indebtedness under a revolving credit or similar agreement obligating the lender or lenders to extend credit over a period of one year or more. Addition and Release of Subsidiary Guarantors The guarantee of any Guarantor may be released under certain circumstances. If we exercise our legal or covenant defeasance option with respect to debt securities of any series as described in the accompanying 6 prospectus under ""Description of Debt Securities-Defeasance and Discharge "" then any guarantee will be released with respect to that series. Further  if no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture  a Subsidiary Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from its guarantee: • automatically upon any sale  exchange or transfer  whether by way of merger or otherwise  to any person that is not our affiliate  of all of the Parent Guarantor's direct or indirect limited partnership or other equity interests in the Subsidiary Guarantor; • automatically upon the merger of the Subsidiary Guarantor into us or any other Guarantor or the liquidation and dissolution of the Subsidiary Guarantor; or • following delivery of a written notice by us to the Series Trustee  upon the release of all guarantees or other obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to any Funded Debt of ours  except the notes and any other series of debt securities issued under the Indenture. If at any time following any release of a Subsidiary Guarantor from its initial guarantee of the notes pursuant to the third bullet point in the preceding paragraph  the Subsidiary Guarantor again guarantees or co-issues any of our Funded Debt (other than our obligations under the Indenture)  then the Parent Guarantor will cause the Subsidiary Guarantor to again guarantee the notes in accordance with the Indenture. No Sinking Fund We are not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the notes of any series. 7 DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES In this Description of Debt Securities references to the ""Issuer"" mean only Enterprise Products Operating LLC (successor to Enterprise Products Operating L.P.) and not its subsidiaries. References to the ""Guarantor"" mean only Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and not its subsidiaries. References to ""we"" and ""us"" mean the Issuer and the Guarantor collectively. The debt securities will be issued under an Indenture dated as of October 4  2004  as amended and supplemented by the Tenth Supplemental Indenture  dated as of June 30  2007  and by the Thirty-Sixth Supplemental Indenture  dated as of September 15  2021  and as further amended by one or more additional supplemental indentures (collectively  the ""Indenture"")  among the Issuer  the Guarantor  Wells Fargo Bank  National Association  as original trustee  and by U.S. Bank National Association  as series trustee for the 3.300% Senior Notes due 2053 issued on September 15  2021 and any series of debt securities issued after such notes (the ""Trustee""). The terms of the debt securities will include those expressly set forth in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939  as amended (the ""Trust Indenture Act""). Capitalized terms used in this Description of Debt Securities have the meanings specified in the Indenture. This Description of Debt Securities is intended to be a useful overview of the material provisions of the debt securities and the Indenture. Since this Description of Debt Securities is only a summary  you should refer to the Indenture for a complete description of our obligations and your rights. General The Indenture does not limit the amount of debt securities that may be issued thereunder. Debt securities may be issued under the Indenture from time to time in separate series  each up to the aggregate amount authorized for such series. The debt securities will be general obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantor and may be subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantor. See ""-Subordination.""

These terms will include some or all of the following: • the form and title of the debt securities; • the total principal amount of the debt securities; • the portion of the principal amount which will be payable if the maturity of the debt securities is accelerated; • the currency or currency unit in which the debt securities will be paid  if not U.S. dollars; • any right we may have to defer payments of interest by extending the dates payments are due whether interest on those deferred amounts will be payable as well; • the dates on which the principal of the debt securities will be payable; • the interest rate which the debt securities will bear and the interest payment dates for the debt securities; • any optional redemption provisions; • any sinking fund or other provisions that would obligate us to repurchase or otherwise redeem the debt securities; • any changes to or additional Events of Default or covenants; • whether the debt securities are to be issued as Registered Securities or Bearer Securities or both; and any special provisions for Bearer Securities; 8 • the subordination  if any  of the debt securities and any changes to the subordination provisions of the Indenture; and • any other terms of the debt securities. The prospectus supplement will also describe any material United States federal income tax consequences or other special considerations applicable to the applicable series of debt securities  including those applicable to: • Bearer Securities; • debt securities with respect to which payments of principal  premium or interest are determined with reference to an index or formula  including changes in prices of particular securities  currencies or commodities; • debt securities with respect to which principal  premium or interest is payable in a foreign or composite currency; • debt securities that are issued at a discount below their stated principal amount  bearing no interest or interest at a rate that at the time of issuance is below market rates; and • variable rate debt securities that are exchangeable for fixed rate debt securities. At our option  we may make interest payments  by check mailed to the registered holders thereof or  if so stated in the applicable prospectus supplement  at the option of a holder by wire transfer to an account designated by the holder. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement  no payment on a Bearer Security will be made by mail to an address in the United States or by wire transfer to an account in the United States. Registered Securities may be transferred or exchanged  and they may be presented for payment  at the office of the Trustee or the Trustee's agent in New York City indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement  subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture  without the payment of any service charge  other than any applicable tax or governmental charge. Bearer Securities will be transferable only by delivery. Provisions with respect to the exchange of Bearer Securities will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement. Any funds we pay to a paying agent for the payment of amounts due on any debt securities that remain unclaimed for two years will be returned to us  and the holders of the debt securities must thereafter look only to us for payment thereof. Guarantee The Guarantor will unconditionally guarantee to each holder and the Trustee the full and prompt payment of principal of  premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities  when and as the same become due and payable  whether at maturity  upon redemption or repurchase  by declaration of acceleration or otherwise. Certain Covenants Except as set forth below or as may be provided in a prospectus supplement and supplemental indenture  neither the Issuer nor the Guarantor is restricted by the Indenture from incurring any type of indebtedness or other obligation  from paying dividends or making distributions on its partnership interests or capital stock or purchasing or redeeming its partnership interests or capital stock. The Indenture does not require the maintenance of any financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. In addition  the Indenture does not contain any provisions that would require the Issuer to repurchase or redeem or otherwise modify the terms of any of the debt securities upon a change in control or other events involving the Issuer which may adversely affect the creditworthiness of the debt securities. Limitations on Liens. The Indenture provides that the Guarantor will not  nor will it permit any Subsidiary to  create  assume  incur or suffer to exist any mortgage  lien  security interest  pledge  charge or other 9 encumbrance (""liens"") other than Permitted Liens (as defined below) upon any Principal Property (as defined below) or upon any shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary owning or leasing  either directly or through ownership in another Subsidiary  any Principal Property (a ""Restricted Subsidiary"")  whether owned or leased on the date of the Indenture or thereafter acquired  to secure any indebtedness for borrowed money (""debt"") of the Guarantor or the Issuer or any other person (other than the debt securities)  without in any such case making effective provision whereby all of the debt securities outstanding shall be secured equally and ratably with  or prior to  such debt so long as such debt shall be so secured.

or any lien upon any property or assets to secure all or part of the cost of construction  development  repair or improvements thereon or to secure debt incurred prior to  at the time of  or within one year after completion of such construction  development  repair or improvements or the commencement of full operations thereof (whichever is later)  to provide funds for any such purpose;

""Subsidiary"" means: (1) the Issuer; or (2) any corporation  association or other business entity of which more than 50% of the total voting power of the equity interests entitled (without regard to the occurrence of any contingency) to vote in the 11 election of directors  managers or trustees thereof or any partnership of which more than 50% of the partners' equity interests (considering all partners' equity interests as a single class) is  in each case  at the time owned or controlled  directly or indirectly  by the Guarantor  the Issuer or one or more of the other Subsidiaries of the Guarantor or the Issuer or combination thereof. Notwithstanding the preceding  under the Indenture  the Guarantor may  and may permit any Subsidiary to  create  assume  incur  or suffer to exist any lien (other than a Permitted Lien) upon any Principal Property or capital stock of a Restricted Subsidiary to secure debt of the Guarantor  the Issuer or any other person (other than the debt securities)  without securing the debt securities  provided that the aggregate principal amount of all debt then outstanding secured by such lien and all similar liens  together with all Attributable Indebtedness from Sale-Leaseback Transactions (excluding Sale-Leaseback Transactions permitted by clauses (1) through (4)  inclusive  of the first paragraph of the restriction on sale-leasebacks covenant described below) does not exceed 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets. Restriction on Sale-Leasebacks. The Indenture provides that the Guarantor will not  and will not permit any Subsidiary to  engage in the sale or transfer by the Guarantor or any Subsidiary of any Principal Property to a person (other than the Issuer or a Subsidiary) and the taking back by the Guarantor or any Subsidiary  as the case may be  of a lease of such Principal Property (a ""Sale-Leaseback Transaction"")  unless: (1) such Sale-Leaseback Transaction occurs within one year from the date of completion of the acquisition of the Principal Property subject thereto or the date of the completion of construction  development or substantial repair or improvement  or commencement of full operations on such Principal Property  whichever is later; (2) the Sale-Leaseback Transaction involves a lease for a period  including renewals  of not more than three years; (3) the Guarantor or such Subsidiary would be entitled to incur debt secured by a lien on the Principal Property subject thereto in a principal amount equal to or exceeding the Attributable Indebtedness from such Sale-Leaseback Transaction without equally and ratably securing the debt securities; or (4) the Guarantor or such Subsidiary  within a one-year period after such Sale-Leaseback Transaction  applies or causes to be applied an amount not less than the Attributable Indebtedness from such Sale-Leaseback Transaction to (a) the prepayment  repayment  redemption  reduction or retirement of any debt of the Guarantor or any Subsidiary that is not subordinated to the debt securities  or (b) the expenditure or expenditures for Principal Property used or to be used in the ordinary course of business of the Guarantor or its Subsidiaries. ""Attributable Indebtedness "" when used with respect to any Sale-Leaseback Transaction  means  as at the time of determination  the present value (discounted at the rate set forth or implicit in the terms of the lease included in such transaction) of the total obligations of the lessee for rental payments (other than amounts required to be paid on account of property taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance  assessments  utilities  operating and labor costs and other items that do not constitute payments for property rights) during the remaining term of the lease included in such Sale-Leaseback Transaction (including any period for which such lease has been extended). In the case of any lease that is terminable by the lessee upon the payment of a penalty or other termination payment  such amount shall be the lesser of the amount determined assuming termination upon the first date such lease may be terminated (in which case the amount shall also include the amount of the penalty or termination payment  but no rent shall be considered as required to be paid under such lease subsequent to the first date upon which it may be so terminated) or the amount determined assuming no such termination. Notwithstanding the preceding  under the Indenture the Guarantor may  and may permit any Subsidiary to  effect any Sale-Leaseback Transaction that is not excepted by clauses (1) through (4)  inclusive  of the first paragraph under ""-Restrictions on Sale-Leasebacks "" provided that the Attributable Indebtedness from such Sale-Leaseback Transaction  together with the aggregate principal amount of all other such Attributable 12 Indebtedness deemed to be outstanding in respect of all Sale-Leaseback Transactions and all outstanding debt (other than the debt securities) secured by liens (other than Permitted Liens) upon Principal Properties or upon capital stock of any Restricted Subsidiary  do not exceed 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets. Merger  Consolidation or Sale of Assets. The Indenture provides that each of the Guarantor and the Issuer may  without the consent of the holders of any of the debt securities  consolidate with or sell  lease  convey all or substantially all of its assets to  or merge with or into  any partnership  limited liability company or corporation if: (1) the entity surviving any such consolidation or merger or to which such assets shall have been transferred (the ""successor"") is either the Guarantor or the Issuer  as applicable  or the successor is a domestic partnership  limited liability company or corporation and expressly assumes all the Guarantor's or the Issuer's  as the case may be  obligations and liabilities under the Indenture and the debt securities (in the case of the Issuer) and the Guarantee (in the case of the Guarantor); (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and (3) the Issuer and the Guarantor have delivered to the Trustee an officers' certificate and an opinion of counsel  each stating that such consolidation  merger or transfer complies with the Indenture. The successor will be substituted for the Guarantor or the Issuer  as the case may be  in the Indenture with the same effect as if it had been an original party to the Indenture. Thereafter  the successor may exercise the rights and powers of the Guarantor or the Issuer  as the case may be  under the Indenture  in its name or in its own name. If the Guarantor or the Issuer sells or transfers all or substantially all of its assets  it will be released from all liabilities and obligations under the Indenture and under the debt securities (in the case of the Issuer) and the Guarantee (in the case of the Guarantor) except that no such release will occur in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets. Events of Default Each of the following will be an Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to a series of debt securities: (1) default in any payment of interest on any debt securities of that series when due  continued for 30 days; (2) default in the payment of principal of or premium  if any  on any debt securities of that series when due at its stated maturity  upon optional redemption  upon declaration or otherwise; (3) failure by the Guarantor or the Issuer to comply for 60 days after notice with its other agreements contained in the Indenture; (4) certain events of bankruptcy  insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer or the Guarantor (the ""bankruptcy provisions""); or (5) the Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect or is declared null and void in a judicial proceeding or the Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under the Indenture or the Guarantee. However  a default under clause (3) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series notify the Issuer and the Guarantor of the default such default is not cured within the time specified in clause (3) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice. An Event of Default for a particular series of debt securities will not necessarily constitute an Event of Default for any other series of debt securities that may be issued under the Indenture. If an Event of Default 13 (other than an Event of Default described in clause (4) above) occurs and is continuing  the Trustee by notice to the Issuer  or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series by notice to the Issuer and the Trustee  may  and the Trustee at the request of such holders shall  declare the principal of  premium  if any  and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on all the debt securities of that series to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration  such principal  premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default described in clause (4) above occurs and is continuing  the principal of  premium  if any  and accrued and unpaid interest on all the debt securities will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders. However  the effect of such provision may be limited by applicable law. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of a series may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the debt securities of that series and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and all existing Events of Default with respect to that series  other than the nonpayment of the principal of  premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities of that series that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration  have been cured or waived. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee  if an Event of Default with respect to a series of debt securities occurs and is continuing  the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders of debt securities of that series  unless such holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity or security against any loss  liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal  premium  if any  or interest when due  no holder of debt securities of any series may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the debt securities of that series unless: (1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default with respect to the debt securities of that series is continuing; (2) holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such holders have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss  liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series have not given the Trustee a direction that  in the opinion of the Trustee  is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions  the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series have the right to direct the time  method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to that series of debt securities. The Trustee  however  may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder of debt securities of that series or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Indenture provides that if a Default (that is  an event that is  or after notice or the passage of time would be  an Event of Default) with respect to the debt securities of a particular series occurs and is continuing and is known to the Trustee  the Trustee must mail to each holder of debt securities of that series notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of  premium  if any  or interest on the debt securities of that series  the Trustee may withhold notice  but only if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the holders of debt securities of that series. In addition  the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee  within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year  an officers' certificate as to compliance with all covenants in the Indenture and indicating whether the 14 signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer also is required to deliver to the Trustee  within 30 days after the occurrence thereof  an officers' certificate specifying any Default or Event of Default  its status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. Amendments and Waivers Amendments of the Indenture may be made by the Issuer  the Guarantor and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of all debt securities of each series affected thereby then outstanding under the Indenture (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the debt securities). However  without the consent of each holder of outstanding debt securities affected thereby  no amendment may  among other things: (1) reduce the percentage in principal amount of debt securities whose holders must consent to an amendment; (2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any debt securities; (3) reduce the principal of or extend the stated maturity of any debt securities; (4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any debt securities or change the time at which any debt securities may be redeemed; (5) make any debt securities payable in money other than that stated in the debt securities; (6) impair the right of any holder to receive payment of  premium  if any  principal of and interest on such holder's debt securities on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder's debt securities; (7) make any change in the amendment provisions which require each holder's consent or in the waiver provisions; (8) release any security that may have been granted in respect of the debt securities; or (9) release the Guarantor or modify the Guarantee in any manner adverse to the holders. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series affected thereby  may waive compliance by the Issuer and the Guarantor with certain restrictive covenants on behalf of all holders of debt securities of such series  including those described under ""-Certain Covenants-Limitations on Liens"" and ""-Certain Covenants-Restriction on Sale-Leasebacks."" The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series affected thereby  on behalf of all such holders  may waive any past Default or Event of Default with respect to that series (including any such waiver obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the debt securities)  except a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal  premium or interest or in respect of a provision that under the Indenture that cannot be amended without the consent of all holders of the series of debt securities that is affected. Without the consent of any holder  the Issuer  the Guarantor and the Trustee may amend the Indenture to: (1) cure any ambiguity  omission  defect or inconsistency; (2) provide for the assumption by a successor of the obligations of the Guarantor or the Issuer under the Indenture; (3) provide for uncertificated debt securities in addition to or in place of certificated debt securities (provided that the uncertificated debt securities are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended (the ""Internal Revenue Code"")  or in a manner such that the uncertificated debt securities are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code); 15 (4) add or release guarantees by any Subsidiary with respect to the debt securities  in either case as provided in the Indenture; (5) secure the debt securities or a guarantee; (6) add to the covenants of the Guarantor or the Issuer for the benefit of the holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Guarantor or the Issuer; (7) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder; (8) comply with any requirement of the Commission in connection with the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act; and (9) issue any other series of debt securities under the Indenture. The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. After an amendment requiring consent of the holders becomes effective  the Issuer is required to mail to the holders of an affected series a notice briefly describing such amendment. However  the failure to give such notice to all such holders  or any defect therein  will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment. Defeasance and Discharge The Issuer at any time may terminate all its obligations under the Indenture as they relate to a series of debt securities (""legal defeasance"")  except for certain obligations  including those respecting the defeasance trust and obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the debt securities of that series  to replace mutilated  destroyed  lost or stolen debt securities of that series and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of such debt securities. The Issuer at any time may terminate its obligations under covenants described under ""-Certain Covenants"" (other than ""Merger  Consolidation or Sale of Assets"") and the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Guarantor  and the Guarantee provision  described under ""-Events of Default"" above with respect to a series of debt securities (""covenant defeasance""). The Issuer may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option  payment of the defeased series of debt securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option  payment of the affected series of debt securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3)  (4)  (with respect only to the Guarantor) or (5) under ""-Events of Default"" above. If the Issuer exercises either its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option  each guarantee will terminate with respect to the debt securities of the defeased series and any security that may have been granted with respect to such debt securities will be released. In order to exercise either defeasance option  the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the ""defeasance trust"") with the Trustee money  U.S. Government Obligations (as defined in the Indenture) or a combination thereof for the payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on the relevant series of debt securities to redemption or maturity  as the case may be  and must comply with certain other conditions  including delivery to the Trustee of an opinion of counsel (subject to customary exceptions and exclusions) to the effect that holders of that series of debt securities will not recognize income  gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred. In the case of legal defeasance only  such opinion of counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") or other change in applicable federal income tax law. 16 In the event of any legal defeasance  holders of the debt securities of the relevant series would be entitled to look only to the trust fund for payment of principal of and any premium and interest on their debt securities until maturity. Although the amount of money and U.S. Government Obligations on deposit with the Trustee would be intended to be sufficient to pay amounts due on the debt securities of a defeased series at the time of their stated maturity  if the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option for the debt securities of any series and the debt securities are declared due and payable because of the occurrence of an Event of Default  such amount may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the debt securities of that series at the time of the acceleration resulting from such Event of Default. The Issuer would remain liable for such payments  however. In addition  the Issuer may discharge all its obligations under the Indenture with respect to debt securities of any series  other than its obligation to register the transfer of and exchange notes of that series  provided that it either: • delivers all outstanding debt securities of that series to the Trustee for cancellation; or • all such debt securities not so delivered for cancellation have either become due and payable or will become due and payable at their stated maturity within one year or are called for redemption within one year  and in the case of this bullet point the Issuer has deposited with the Trustee in trust an amount of cash sufficient to pay the entire indebtedness of such debt securities  including interest to the stated maturity or applicable redemption date. Subordination Debt securities of a series may be subordinated to our Senior Indebtedness  which we define generally to include all notes or other evidences of indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer  including guarantees  that are not expressly subordinate or junior in right of payment to any other indebtedness of the Issuer. Subordinated debt securities and the Guarantor's guarantee thereof will be subordinate in right of payment  to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture and the prospectus supplement relating to such series  to the prior payment of all indebtedness of the Issuer and Guarantor that is designated as ""Senior Indebtedness"" with respect to the series. The holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer will receive payment in full of the Senior Indebtedness before holders of subordinated debt securities will receive any payment of principal  premium or interest with respect to the subordinated debt securities: • upon any payment of distribution of our assets of the Issuer to its creditors; • upon a total or partial liquidation or dissolution of the Issuer; or • in a bankruptcy  receivership or similar proceeding relating to the Issuer or its property. Until the Senior Indebtedness is paid in full  any distribution to which holders of subordinated debt securities would otherwise be entitled will be made to the holders of Senior Indebtedness  except that such holders may receive units representing limited partner interests and any debt securities that are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness to at least the same extent as the subordinated debt securities. If the Issuer does not pay any principal  premium or interest with respect to Senior Indebtedness within any applicable grace period (including at maturity)  or any other default on Senior Indebtedness occurs and the maturity of the Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms  the Issuer may not: • make any payments of principal  premium  if any  or interest with respect to subordinated debt securities; • make any deposit for the purpose of defeasance of the subordinated debt securities; or 17 • repurchase  redeem or otherwise retire any subordinated debt securities  except that in the case of subordinated debt securities that provide for a mandatory sinking fund  we may deliver subordinated debt securities to the Trustee in satisfaction of our sinking fund obligation  unless  in either case  • the default has been cured or waived and the declaration of acceleration has been rescinded; • the Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash; or • the Issuer and the Trustee receive written notice approving the payment from the representatives of each issue of ""Designated Senior Indebtedness."" Generally  ""Designated Senior Indebtedness"" will include: • indebtedness for borrowed money under a bank credit agreement  called ""Bank Indebtedness""; and • any specified issue of Senior Indebtedness of at least $100 million. During the continuance of any default  other than a default described in the immediately preceding paragraph  that may cause the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness to be accelerated immediately without further notice  other than any notice required to effect such acceleration  or the expiration of any applicable grace periods  the Issuer may not pay the subordinated debt securities for a period called the ""Payment Blockage Period."" A Payment Blockage Period will commence on the receipt by us and the Trustee of written notice of the default  called a ""Blockage Notice "" from the representative of any Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period. The Payment Blockage Period may be terminated before its expiration: • by written notice from the person or persons who gave the Blockage Notice; • by repayment in full in cash of the Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Blockage Notice was given; or • if the default giving rise to the Payment Blockage Period is no longer continuing. Unless the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of the Senior Indebtedness  we may resume payments on the subordinated debt securities after the expiration of the Payment Blockage Period. Generally  not more than one Blockage Notice may be given in any period of 360 consecutive days unless the first Blockage Notice within the 360-day period is given by holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness  other than Bank Indebtedness  in which case the representative of the Bank Indebtedness may give another Blockage Notice within the period. The total number of days during which any one or more Payment Blockage Periods are in effect  however  may not exceed an aggregate of 179 days during any period of 360 consecutive days. After all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full and until the subordinated debt securities are paid in full  holders of the subordinated debt securities shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness. By reason of the subordination  in the event of insolvency  our creditors who are holders of Senior Indebtedness  as well as certain of our general creditors  may recover more  ratably  than the holders of the subordinated debt securities. Form and Denomination Unless otherwise indicated in a prospectus supplement  the debt securities of a series will be issued as Registered Securities in denominations of $1 000 and any integral multiple thereof. 18 Book-Entry System Unless otherwise indicated in a prospectus supplement  we will issue the debt securities in the form of one or more global securities in fully registered form initially in the name of Cede & Co.  as nominee of The Depository Trust Company (""DTC"")  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. Unless otherwise indicated in a prospectus supplement  the global securities will be deposited with the Trustee as custodian for DTC and may not be transferred except as a whole by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC or by DTC or any nominee to a successor of DTC or a nominee of such successor. DTC has advised us as follows: • DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law  a ""banking organization"" within the meaning of the New York Banking Law  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a ""clearing corporation"" within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code  and a ""clearing agency"" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  as amended (the ""Exchange Act""). • DTC holds securities that its participants deposit with DTC and facilitates the post-trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities  such as transfers and pledges  through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants' accounts  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. • Direct participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations and certain other organizations. • DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (""DTCC""). DTCC is the holding company for DTC  National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation  all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. • Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant  either directly or indirectly. • The rules applicable to DTC and its direct and indirect participants are on file with the Commission. Purchases of debt securities under the DTC system must be made by or through direct participants  which will receive a credit for the debt securities on DTC's records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of debt securities is in turn to be recorded on the direct and indirect participants' records. Beneficial owners of the debt securities will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase  but beneficial owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction  as well as periodic statements of their holdings  from the direct or indirect participant through which the beneficial owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the debt securities are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of direct and indirect participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners. Beneficial owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in the debt securities  except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the debt securities is discontinued. To facilitate subsequent transfers  all debt securities deposited by direct participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC's partnership nominee  Cede & Co.  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of debt securities with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the debt securities; DTC's records reflect only the identity of the direct participants to whose accounts such debt securities are credited  which may or may not be the beneficial owners. The direct and indirect participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. 19 Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to direct participants  by  direct participants to indirect participants  and by direct participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among them  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the global securities. Under its usual procedures  DTC mails an omnibus proxy to the issuer as soon as possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy assigns Cede & Co.'s consenting or voting rights to those direct participants to whose accounts the debt securities are credited on the record date (identified in the listing attached to the omnibus proxy). All payments on the global securities will be made to Cede & Co.  as holder of record  or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC's practice is to credit direct participants' accounts upon DTC's receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from us or the Trustee on payment dates in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC's records. Payments by participants to beneficial owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices  as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in ""street name "" and will be the responsibility of such participant and not of DTC  us or the Trustee  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) shall be the responsibility of us or the Trustee. Disbursement of such payments to direct participants shall be the responsibility of DTC  and disbursement of such payments to the beneficial owners shall be the responsibility of direct and indirect participants. DTC may discontinue providing its service as securities depositary with respect to the debt securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to us or the Trustee. In addition  we may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depositary). Under such circumstances  in the event that a successor securities depositary is not obtained  note certificates in fully registered form are required to be printed and delivered to beneficial owners of the global securities representing such debt securities. Neither we nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or obligation to direct or indirect participants  or the persons for whom they act as nominees  with respect to the accuracy of the records of DTC  its nominee or any participant with respect to any ownership interest in the debt securities  or payments to  or the providing of notice to participants or beneficial owners. So long as the debt securities are in DTC's book-entry system  secondary market trading activity in the debt securities will settle in immediately available funds. All payments on the debt securities issued as global securities will be made by us in immediately available funds. The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC's book-entry system has been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable  but we take no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Limitations on Issuance of Bearer Securities The debt securities of a series may be issued as Registered Securities (which will be registered as to principal and interest in the register maintained by the registrar for the debt securities) or Bearer Securities (which will be transferable only by delivery). If the debt securities are issuable as Bearer Securities  certain special limitations and conditions will apply. In compliance with United States federal income tax laws and regulations  we and any underwriter  agent or dealer participating in an offering of Bearer Securities will agree that  in connection with the original issuance of the Bearer Securities and during the period ending 40 days after the issue date  they will not offer  sell or deliver any such Bearer Securities  directly or indirectly  to a United States Person (as defined below) or to any person within the United States  except to the extent permitted under United States Treasury regulations. 20 Bearer Securities will bear a legend to the following effect: ""Any United States person who holds this obligation will be subject to limitations under the United States federal income tax laws  including the limitations provided in Sections 165(j) and 1287(a) of the Internal Revenue Code."" The sections referred to in the legend provide that  with certain exceptions  a United States taxpayer who holds Bearer Securities will not be allowed to deduct any loss with respect to  and will not be eligible for capital gain treatment with respect to any gain realized on the sale  exchange  redemption or other disposition of  the Bearer Securities. For this purpose  ""United States"" includes the United States of America and its possessions  and ""United States person"" means a citizen or resident of the United States  a corporation  partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States  or an estate or trust the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source. Pending the availability of a definitive global security or individual Bearer Securities  as the case may be  debt securities that are issuable as Bearer Securities may initially be represented by a single temporary global security  without interest coupons  to be deposited with a common depositary for the Euroclear System as operated by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (""Euroclear"") and Clearstream Banking S.A. (""Clearstream""  formerly Cedelbank)  for credit to the accounts designated by or on behalf of the purchasers thereof. Following the availability of a definitive global security in bearer form  without coupons attached  or individual Bearer Securities and subject to any further limitations described in the applicable prospectus supplement  the temporary global security will be exchangeable for interests in the definitive global security or for the individual Bearer Securities  respectively  only upon receipt of a ""Certificate of Non-U.S. Beneficial Ownership "" which is a certificate to the effect that a beneficial interest in a temporary global security is owned by a person that is not a United States Person or is owned by or through a financial institution in compliance with applicable United States Treasury regulations. No Bearer Security will be delivered in or to the United States. If so specified in the applicable prospectus supplement  interest on a temporary global security will be paid to each of Euroclear and Clearstream with respect to that portion of the temporary global security held for its account  but only upon receipt as of the relevant interest payment date of a Certificate of Non-U.S. Beneficial Ownership. No Recourse Against General Partner The Guarantor's general partner and its directors  officers  employees and members  as such  shall have no liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantor under the debt securities  the Indenture or the guarantee or for any claim based on  in respect of  or by reason of  such obligations or their creation. Each holder by accepting a note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the debt securities. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws  and it is the view of the Commission that such a waiver is against public policy. Concerning the Trustee The Indenture contains certain limitations on the right of the Trustee  should it become our creditor  to obtain payment of claims in certain cases  or to realize for its own account on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee is permitted to engage in certain other transactions. However  if it acquires any conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act  it must eliminate the conflict or resign as Trustee. The holders of a majority in principal amount of all outstanding debt securities (or if more than one series of debt securities under the Indenture is affected thereby  all series so affected  voting as a single class) will have the right to direct the time  method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy or power available to the Trustee for the debt securities or all such series so affected. If an Event of Default occurs and is not cured under the Indenture and is known to the Trustee  the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by the Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill 21 in its exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions  the Trustee will not be under any obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any of the holders of debt securities unless they shall have offered to such Trustee reasonable security and indemnity. U.S. Bank National Association is the Trustee under the Indenture for the 3.300% Senior Notes due 2053 issued on September 15  2021 and any series of debt securities issued after such notes and has been appointed by the Issuer as Registrar and Paying Agent with regard to such debt securities. U.S. Bank National Association is a lender under the Issuer's credit facilities. Governing Law The Indenture  the debt securities and the guarantee are governed by  and will be construed in accordance with  the laws of the State of New York. 22 Attachments Original LinkOriginal DocumentPermalink Disclaimer Enterprise Products Partners LP published this content on 05 January 2023 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)° is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)° is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

This technology  PathsDx Test  was shown to be robust  rapid and sensitive for the diagnosis of infectious diseases.The paper is titled  “Towards a rapid-turnaround low-depth unbiased metagenomics sequencing workflow on the Illumina platforms” has been published online in Medrxiv  which can be downloaded at the following website address: https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.01.02.22283504v1.Dr Clark Cheng  Chief Medical Officer of Aptorum Group Limited commented  “We are pleased to announce the exceptional performance of PathsDx for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. The PathsDx Test has achieved so far over 95% for both sensitivity and specificity. Our clinical validation also shows that at least 93% of plasma samples agreed with the standard of care clinical diagnostic test results (compared to reported industry liquid biopsy test of 92.9%1). These results are remarkable as an initial stage of clinical validation. The remaining 7% are viruses with very small genome (5kb)  which is a common challenge across the genomic industry  we have a workflow development plan currently to strive towards detecting these small genome viruses  eventually targeting close to full agreement. The trend of our validation results so far also suggests further improvement of our validation statistics (including the comparison of agreement with standard of case diagnostics) based on increases in further clinical validation samples. The effect of different sequencing times was evaluated with the 19-hour iSeq 100 paired end run  a more clinically palatable simulated iSeq 100 truncated run and the rapid 7-hour MiniSeq platform. Significantly  our results demonstrate the ability to detect both DNA and RNA pathogens with low-depth sequencing. In conclusion  it was demonstrated that iSeq 100 and MiniSeq platforms are compatible with unbiased low-depth metagenomics identification with the PathsDx Test workflow and its library preparation kits and can be chosen based on required turnaround times. We are also pleased to now have built up a pathogen genomic database of close to 20 000 species to support our software analytics in identifying  on an unbiased metagenomic basis  the pathogenic composition in the patient sample. With these remarkable results  we are actively expanding our validation sites in Singapore  Hong Kong and United States. We would also like to express our heartfelt appreciation of Illumina for supporting this project via intellectual  mechanical and technical input.”References1. https://kariusdx.com/karius-test/clinical-and-analytical-validationAbout Aptorum’s PathsDx ProgramPathsDx Test (formerly known as “RPIDD”) is an innovative liquid biopsy-driven rapid pathogen molecular diagnostics technology. PathsDx Test  through proprietary and patented technologies  is developed with the aim to  cost effectively through patient blood samples  enrich pathogenic DNA and RNA for pathogenic genome sequencing analysis through harnessing the power of Next-Generation Sequencing platforms and proprietary artificial intelligence-based software analytics with the goal to rapidly identify and detect any foreign pathogens (virus  bacteria  fungus  parasites) without bias through its genome composition and to identify other unknown pathogens and novel mutated pathogens. PathsDx Test is comprised of two proprietary metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS) components: (i) HostEL for depletion of human background to enrich both pathogen DNA and RNA; (ii) AmpRE for one pot DNA/RNA library preparation for overall cost effective amplification. PathsDx Test has been and continues to be validated in human clinical samples and so far  such testing has been able to detect pathogens – ranging from bacteria  fungi and both DNA and RNA based viruses in an unbiased manner.About Aptorum GroupAptorum Group Limited (Nasdaq: APM  Euronext Paris: APM) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutic assets to treat diseases with unmet medical needs  particularly in oncology (including orphan oncology indications)  autoimmune and infectious diseases.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has accepted the Biologics License Application (BLA) for nirsevimab for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants entering or during their first RSV season and for children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season.Nirsevimab is being developed jointly by Sanofi and AstraZeneca and  if approved  would be the first protective option for the broad infant population  including those born healthy  at term or preterm  or with specific health conditions. The FDA has indicated they will work to expedite their review. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act date  the FDA target action date for their decision  is in the third quarter of 2023.Thomas TriompheExecutive Vice President  Vaccines  Sanofi“This is a landmark file acceptance in the US as it brings us one step closer to offering the first and only broadly protective option against RSV disease designed for all infants. Given the unprecedented number of otherwise healthy infants who have been hospitalized with RSV this year in the US and the recurrent pattern of RSV epidemics year after year  it is our intention to make nirsevimab available  if approved in time  for the 2023/2024 season to help alleviate the burden of RSV on families and the healthcare system.”RSV is a very contagious virus that can lead to serious respiratory illness  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).10 In the US  RSV is the leading cause of hospitalisation for babies under one.11 Any infant can be hospitalized in their first RSV season: about 75% of infants hospitalized for RSV in the U.S. are born at term  with no underlying conditions.12-14 The current 2022/23 RSV season has placed a particularly high burden on infants and families in the United Stated with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) requesting the White House declare an emergency to support the national response to the alarming surge of pediatric hospitalizations due to RSV and influenza.Story continuesDr William MullerAssociate Professor  Pediatrics  Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Scientific Director  Clinical and Community Trials  Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago  Illinois""A substantial burden of disease from RSV affects infants  families  and healthcare providers every year. Effective interventions to prevent RSV are a critical need. This year in the US  we’ve seen first-hand how frightening the impact of this respiratory disease is on our patients and how stressful it is on the healthcare system  highlighting the urgency of addressing this problem.""The submission was based on results from the Phase 3 MELODY  Phase 2/3 MEDLEY and Phase2b trials.1-8 Results across the MELODY and Phase 2b trials showed that nirsevimab demonstrated consistent protection of approximately 80%  against medically attended RSV disease with a single dose.1-5In these trials  nirsevimab helped protect an all-infant population (including healthy term  late preterm  and preterm infants  as well as infants with specific health conditions) against RSV disease requiring medical care  including physician office  urgent care  emergency room visits and hospitalizations  through the duration of the RSV season.1-8 The safety profile of nirsevimab was similar to placebo. Nirsevimab also demonstrated a comparable safety and tolerability profile to palivizumab in the Phase 2/3 MEDLEY trial.7-9About nirsevimabIn the U.S.  nirsevimab is an investigational single-dose long-acting antibody designed to help protect all infants from birth through their first RSV season and for children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season.Nirsevimab has been developed to offer newborns and infants direct RSV protection via an antibody to help prevent lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused by RSV. Monoclonal antibodies do not require the activation of the immune system to help offer timely  rapid and direct protection against disease.15In March 2017  Sanofi and AstraZeneca announced an agreement to develop and commercialize nirsevimab. Under the terms of the agreement  AstraZeneca leads all development and manufacturing activities and Sanofi leads commercialization activities and records revenues. Under the terms of the global agreement  Sanofi made an upfront payment of €120m  has paid a development milestone of €30m and will pay up to a further €465m upon achievement of certain development and sales-related milestones. The two companies share all costs and profits.Nirsevimab has been granted designations to facilitate expedited development by several regulatory agencies around the world. These include Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the China Center for Drug Evaluation under the National Medical Products Administration; Breakthrough Therapy Designati on from the FDA; access granted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIority MEdicines scheme; Promising Innovative Medicine designation by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; and named “a medicine for prioritized development” under the Project for Drug Selection to Promote New Drug Development in Pediatrics by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED). Nirsevimab was approved by the European Commission in October 2022  and by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in November 2022.16 17About the clinical trialsThe Phase 2b trial was a randomized  placebo-controlled trial designed to measure the efficacy of nirsevimab against medically attended LRTI through 150 days post-dose. Healthy preterm infants of 29–<35 weeks’ gestation (n= 1 453) were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50mg intramuscular injection of nirsevimab (n= 969) or placebo (n= 484) at the RSV season start.3 4 The primary endpoint was met  significantly reducing the incidence of medically attended LRTI caused by RSV by 70.1% (95% CI: 52.3  81.2) compared to placebo.3 4 The proposed dosing regimen was recommended based on further exploration of the Phase 2b data.3 When considering the dosing regimen recommended for approval in this study  nirsevimab reduced the incidence of medically attended LRTI caused by RSV by 86.2% (95% CI: 68.0  94.0) in gestational age ≥29 to <35 weeks. 3 4 The subsequent Phase 3 study  MELODY  applied the recommended dosing regimen.1 2The Phase 3 MELODY (primary cohort) trial was a randomized  placebo-controlled trial conducted across 21 countries designed to determine efficacy of nirsevimab against medically attended LRTI due to RSV confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing through 150 days after dosing  versus placebo  in healthy late preterm and term infants (35 weeks gestational age or greater) entering their first RSV season.1 2 The primary endpoint was met  significantly reducing the incidence of medically attended LRTI  such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia  caused by RSV compared to placebo.1 2 Infants were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50mg (in infants weighing <5kg) or 100mg (in infants weighing ≥5kg) intramuscular injection of nirsevimab or placebo.1 2Following the analysis of the initial 1 490 infants within the MELODY primary cohort additional infants continued to be enrolled. A total of 3 012 healthy late preterm and term infants (35 weeks gestational age or greater) entering their first RSV season were randomized to receive nirsevimab (n=2 009) or placebo (n=1 003). In the exploratory analysis  a single 50mg (in infants weighing <5kg) or 100mg (in infants weighing ≥5kg) intramuscular injection of nirsevimab reduced the incidence of medically attended LRTI caused by RSV through 150 days after dosing by 76.4% (95%: CI 62.3  85.2) compared to placebo  with an acceptable safety profile. Further  nirsevimab demonstrated a 76.8% (95%: CI 49.4  89.4) reduction in the risk of RSV LRTI with hospitalization through 150 days after dosing compared to placebo.MEDLEY was a Phase 2/3  randomized  double-blind  palivizumab-controlled trial with the primary objective of assessing safety and tolerability for nirsevimab in preterm infants and infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) and/or chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) eligible to receive palivizumab.7 8 Between July 2019 and May 2021  approximately 918 infants entering their first RSV season were randomized to receive a single 50mg (in infants weighing <5kg) or 100mg (in infants weighing ≥5kg) intramuscular injection of nirsevimab or palivizumab. Safety was assessed by monitoring the occurrence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment emergent severe adverse events (TESAEs) through 360 days post-dose.7 8 Serum levels of nirsevimab following dosing (on day 151) in this trial were comparable with those observed in the Phase 3 MELODY trial  indicating similar protection in this population to that in the healthy term and late preterm infants is likely.7The safety profile of nirsevimab was similar to palivizumab in the MEDLEY Phase 2/3 and consistent with the safety profile in term and preterm infants studied in the MELODY Phase 3 trial compared to placebo.1-4 7 8 The most commonly reported adverse reactions were: rash 14 days post-dose  (the majority of which were mild to moderate); pyrexia (fever) within 7 days post-dose; non-serious injection site reactions within 7 days post-dose.16Findings from the nirsevimab clinical trial program included a pre-specified pooled analysis of the Phase 3 MELODY trial (primary cohort) and the recommended dose from the Phase 2b trial  in which a relative risk reduction of 79.5% versus placebo (95% CI 65.9  87.7; P<0.0001) was seen against medically attended LRTI  such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia  caused by RSV in infants born at term or preterm entering their first RSV season.5 This analysis also showed a relative risk reduction of 77.3% (95% CI 50.3  89.7; P<0.001) against RSV LRTI hospitalizations.5About RSVRSV is a very contagious virus that can lead to serious respiratory illness for infants  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).10 In the U.S.  RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants under 12 months.11 Approximately 75% of infants hospitalized for RSV are born at term with no underlying conditions.12-14 RSV symptoms can include runny nose  coughing  sneezing  fever  decrease in appetite  and wheezing.10 Each year RSV infection leads to approximately 500 000 emergency department visits by children under 5 years of age  which represents 1 in 4 of all RSV-related doctor visits  according to the CDC.18About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.
