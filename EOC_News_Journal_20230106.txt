General The Notes. The notes: • will be general unsecured  senior obligations of the Issuer; • will constitute two new series of debt securities issued under the Indenture that will initially consist of $750 000 000 aggregate principal amount of 2026 notes and $1 000 000 000 aggregate principal amount of 2033 notes; • with respect to the 2026 notes  will mature on January 10  2026  and with respect to the 2033 notes  will mature on January 31  2033; • will be issued in denominations of $1 000 and integral multiples of $1 000 in excess thereof; • initially will be issued only in book-entry form represented by one or more notes in global form registered in the name of Cede & Co.  as nominee of DTC  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC  and deposited with the Series Trustee as custodian for DTC; and • will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured  unsubordinated basis by the Parent Guarantor  and in certain circumstances may be guaranteed in the future on the same basis by one or more Subsidiary Guarantors. 2 Interest. Interest on the notes will: • with respect to the 2026 notes  accrue at the rate of 5.05% per annum  and with respect to the 2033 notes  accrue at the rate of 5.35% per annum  in each case from January 10  2023 or the most recent interest payment date; • with respect to the 2026 notes  be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on January 10 and July 10 of each year  beginning on July 10  2023  and with respect to the 2033 notes  be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on January 31 and July 31 of each year  beginning on July 31  2023; • with respect to the 2026 notes  be payable to holders of record on the December 26 and June 25 immediately preceding the related interest payment dates  and with respect to the 2033 notes  be payable to holders of record on the January 15 and July 15 immediately preceding the related interest payment dates; and • be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Payment and Transfer. Initially  the notes will be issued only in global form. Beneficial interests in notes in global form will be shown on  and transfers of interests in notes in global form will be made only through  records maintained by DTC and its participants. Notes in definitive form  if any  may be presented for registration of transfer or exchange at the office or agency maintained by us for such purpose (which initially will be the corporate trust office of the Series Trustee located at 111 Fillmore Avenue East  St. Paul  Minnesota 55107-1402). Payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on notes in global form registered in the name of DTC's nominee will be made in immediately available funds to DTC's nominee  as the registered holder of such global notes. If any of the notes is no longer represented by a global note  payment of interest on the notes in definitive form may  at our option  be made at the corporate trust office of the Series Trustee indicated above or by check mailed directly to holders at their respective registered addresses or by wire transfer to an account designated by a holder to an account in the United States. If any interest payment date  maturity date or redemption date falls on a day that is not a business day  the payment due on the notes on such date will be made on the next business day with the same force and effect as if made on the relevant interest payment date  maturity date or redemption date. No interest will accrue on such payment for the period from and after the applicable interest payment date  maturity date or redemption date  as the case may be  to the date of such payment on the next business day. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of notes  but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. We are not required to register the transfer of or exchange any note selected for redemption or for a period of 15 days before mailing or furnishing a notice of redemption of the notes. The registered holder of a note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes  and all references in this ""Description of the Notes"" to ""holders"" mean holders of record  unless otherwise indicated. Investors may hold interests in the notes outside the United States through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (""Euroclear"") or Clearstream Banking S.A. (""Clearstream "" formerly Cedelbank) if they are participants in those systems  or indirectly through organizations which are participants in those systems. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests on behalf of their participants through customers' securities accounts in Euroclear's and Clearstream's names on the books of their respective depositaries which in turn will hold such positions in 3 customers' securities accounts in the names of the nominees of the depositaries on the books of DTC. All securities in Euroclear or Clearstream are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. Transfers of notes by persons holding through Euroclear or Clearstream participants will be effected through DTC  in accordance with DTC's rules  on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system by its depositaries; however  such transactions will require delivery of exercise instructions to the relevant European international clearing system by the participant in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will  if the exercise meets its requirements  deliver instructions to its depositaries to take action to effect exercise of the notes on its behalf by delivering notes through DTC and receiving payment in accordance with its normal procedures for next-day funds settlement. Payments with respect to the notes held through Euroclear or Clearstream will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear participants in accordance with the relevant system's rules and procedures  to the extent received by its depositaries. Replacement of Notes. We will replace any mutilated  destroyed  stolen or lost notes at the expense of the holder upon surrender of the mutilated notes to the Series Trustee or evidence of destruction  loss or theft of a note satisfactory to us and the Series Trustee. In the case of a destroyed  lost or stolen note  we may require an indemnity satisfactory to the Series Trustee and to us before a replacement note will be issued. Further Issuances We may from time to time  without notice or the consent of the holders of the notes of any series  create and issue further notes of the same series ranking equally and ratably with the original notes of that series in all respects (or in all respects except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such further notes  the first interest payment date  the public offering price and the issue date)  so that such further notes form a single series with the original notes of that series and have the same terms as to status  redemption or otherwise as the original notes of that series; provided  however  that such further notes must be fungible with the original notes of that series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Optional Redemption Prior to their maturity  in the case of the 2026 notes  and prior to October 31  2032  in the case of the 2033 notes (such date  the ""2033 notes Par Call Date"")  we may redeem the notes of each series at our option  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of: (1) (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming the notes of the series to be redeemed matured on the 2026 notes maturity date  in the case of the 2026 notes  or on the 2033 notes Par Call Date  in the case of the 2033 notes (such date  as applicable  the ""Relevant Date"")) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points  in the case of the 2026 notes  or 25 basis points  in the case of the 2033 notes less (b) interest accrued to the date of redemption  and (2) 100% of the principal amount of the notes of such series to be redeemed  plus  in either case  accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. On or after the 2033 notes Par Call Date  we may redeem the 2033 notes at our option  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2033 notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. 4 ""Treasury Rate"" means  with respect to any redemption date for the notes of any series  the yield determined by us in accordance with the following two paragraphs. The Treasury Rate shall be determined by us after 4:15 p.m.  New York City time (or after such time as yields on U.S. government securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System)  on the third business day preceding the redemption date based upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as ""Selected Interest Rates (Daily)-H.15"" (or any successor designation or publication) (""H.15"") under the caption ""U.S. government securities-Treasury constant maturities-Nominal"" (or any successor caption or heading) (""H.15 TCM""). In determining the Treasury Rate  we shall select  as applicable: (1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the period from the redemption date to the Relevant Date with respect to the notes to be redeemed (the ""Remaining Life""); or (2) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the Remaining Life  the two yields - one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately longer than the Remaining Life - and shall interpolate to the applicable Relevant Date on a straight-line basis (using the actual number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places; or (3) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life  the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15 closest to the Remaining Life. For purposes of this paragraph  the applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15 shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months or years  as applicable  of such Treasury constant maturity from the redemption date. If on the third business day preceding the redemption date H.15 TCM is no longer published  we shall calculate the Treasury Rate based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time  on the second business day preceding such redemption date of the United States Treasury security maturing on  or with a maturity that is closest to  the applicable Relevant Date. If there is no United States Treasury security maturing on the applicable Relevant Date but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally distant from the applicable Relevant Date  one with a maturity date preceding the applicable Relevant Date and one with a maturity date following the applicable Relevant Date  we shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date preceding the applicable Relevant Date. If there are two or more United States Treasury securities maturing on the applicable Relevant Date or two or more United States Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence  we shall select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States Treasury security that is trading closest to par based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time. In determining the Treasury Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph  the semi-annual yield to maturity of the applicable United States Treasury security shall be based upon the average of the bid and asked prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time  of such United States Treasury security  and rounded to three decimal places. Our actions and determinations in determining the redemption price shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes  absent manifest error. Notes called for redemption become due on the redemption date. Notices of optional redemption will be mailed (or electronically delivered in accordance with applicable procedures of DTC) at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the notes to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of optional redemption for the notes will state  among other things  the amount of notes to be redeemed  the redemption date  the method of calculating the redemption price and each place that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of notes to be redeemed. If less than all of the notes of any series are redeemed at any time  the Series Trustee will select the notes to be redeemed on a pro rata basis  by lot  or by any other method the Series Trustee deems fair and appropriate  and when the notes are in book entry form  in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC. Unless we default in payment of the redemption price  interest will cease to accrue on the redemption date with respect to any notes called for optional redemption. 5 Ranking The notes will be unsecured  unless we are required to secure them pursuant to the limitations on liens covenant described in the accompanying prospectus under ""Description of Debt Securities-Certain Covenants-Limitations on Liens."" The notes will also be the unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer and will rank equally with all other existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer. Each guarantee of the notes will be an unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the Guarantor and will rank equally with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Guarantor. The notes and each guarantee will effectively rank junior to any future indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantor that is both secured and unsubordinated to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness  and the notes will effectively rank junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities of the Issuer's subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors. On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to this senior notes offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom  at September 30  2022  the Issuer had approximately $29.5 billion principal amount of consolidated indebtedness  including $26.3 billion in senior notes and $2.3 billion of junior subordinated notes outstanding under the Base Indenture and a similar indenture  and $921 million in short-term commercial paper notes  and the Parent Guarantor had no indebtedness (excluding guarantees totaling $29.5 billion)  in each case excluding intercompany loans.

Parent Guarantee The Parent Guarantor will fully and unconditionally guarantee to each holder and the Series Trustee  on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis  the full and prompt payment of principal of  premium  if any  and interest on the notes  when and as the same become due and payable  whether at stated maturity  upon redemption  by declaration of acceleration or otherwise. Potential Guarantee of Notes by Subsidiaries Initially  the notes will not be guaranteed by any of our Subsidiaries. In the future  however  if our Subsidiaries become guarantors or co-obligors of our Funded Debt (as defined below)  then those Subsidiaries will jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally  guarantee our payment obligations under the notes. We refer to any such Subsidiaries as ""Subsidiary Guarantors"" and sometimes to such guarantees as ""Subsidiary Guarantees."" Each Subsidiary Guarantor will execute a supplement to the Indenture to effect its guarantee. The obligations of each Guarantor under its guarantee of the notes will be limited to the maximum amount that will not result in the obligations of the Guarantor under the guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal or state law  after giving effect to: • all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor; and • any collection from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under its guarantee. ""Funded Debt"" means all Indebtedness maturing one year or more from the date of the creation thereof  all Indebtedness directly or indirectly renewable or extendible  at the option of the debtor  by its terms or by the terms of any instrument or agreement relating thereto  to a date one year or more from the date of the creation thereof  and all Indebtedness under a revolving credit or similar agreement obligating the lender or lenders to extend credit over a period of one year or more. Addition and Release of Subsidiary Guarantors The guarantee of any Guarantor may be released under certain circumstances. If we exercise our legal or covenant defeasance option with respect to debt securities of any series as described in the accompanying 6 prospectus under ""Description of Debt Securities-Defeasance and Discharge "" then any guarantee will be released with respect to that series. Further  if no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture  a Subsidiary Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from its guarantee: • automatically upon any sale  exchange or transfer  whether by way of merger or otherwise  to any person that is not our affiliate  of all of the Parent Guarantor's direct or indirect limited partnership or other equity interests in the Subsidiary Guarantor; • automatically upon the merger of the Subsidiary Guarantor into us or any other Guarantor or the liquidation and dissolution of the Subsidiary Guarantor; or • following delivery of a written notice by us to the Series Trustee  upon the release of all guarantees or other obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to any Funded Debt of ours  except the notes and any other series of debt securities issued under the Indenture. If at any time following any release of a Subsidiary Guarantor from its initial guarantee of the notes pursuant to the third bullet point in the preceding paragraph  the Subsidiary Guarantor again guarantees or co-issues any of our Funded Debt (other than our obligations under the Indenture)  then the Parent Guarantor will cause the Subsidiary Guarantor to again guarantee the notes in accordance with the Indenture. No Sinking Fund We are not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the notes of any series. 7 DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES In this Description of Debt Securities references to the ""Issuer"" mean only Enterprise Products Operating LLC (successor to Enterprise Products Operating L.P.) and not its subsidiaries.

The Indenture does not require the maintenance of any financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity.

Notwithstanding the preceding  under the Indenture  the Guarantor may  and may permit any Subsidiary to  create  assume  incur  or suffer to exist any lien (other than a Permitted Lien) upon any Principal Property or capital stock of a Restricted Subsidiary to secure debt of the Guarantor  the Issuer or any other person (other than the debt securities)  without securing the debt securities  provided that the aggregate principal amount of all debt then outstanding secured by such lien and all similar liens  together with all Attributable Indebtedness from Sale-Leaseback Transactions (excluding Sale-Leaseback Transactions permitted by clauses (1) through (4)  inclusive  of the first paragraph of the restriction on sale-leasebacks covenant described below) does not exceed 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets. Restriction on Sale-Leasebacks. The Indenture provides that the Guarantor will not  and will not permit any Subsidiary to  engage in the sale or transfer by the Guarantor or any Subsidiary of any Principal Property to a person (other than the Issuer or a Subsidiary) and the taking back by the Guarantor or any Subsidiary  as the case may be  of a lease of such Principal Property (a ""Sale-Leaseback Transaction"")  unless: (1) such Sale-Leaseback Transaction occurs within one year from the date of completion of the acquisition of the Principal Property subject thereto or the date of the completion of construction  development or substantial repair or improvement  or commencement of full operations on such Principal Property  whichever is later; (2) the Sale-Leaseback Transaction involves a lease for a period  including renewals  of not more than three years; (3) the Guarantor or such Subsidiary would be entitled to incur debt secured by a lien on the Principal Property subject thereto in a principal amount equal to or exceeding the Attributable Indebtedness from such Sale-Leaseback Transaction without equally and ratably securing the debt securities; or (4) the Guarantor or such Subsidiary  within a one-year period after such Sale-Leaseback Transaction  applies or causes to be applied an amount not less than the Attributable Indebtedness from such Sale-Leaseback Transaction to (a) the prepayment  repayment  redemption  reduction or retirement of any debt of the Guarantor or any Subsidiary that is not subordinated to the debt securities  or (b) the expenditure or expenditures for Principal Property used or to be used in the ordinary course of business of the Guarantor or its Subsidiaries.

In the case of any lease that is terminable by the lessee upon the payment of a penalty or other termination payment  such amount shall be the lesser of the amount determined assuming termination upon the first date such lease may be terminated (in which case the amount shall also include the amount of the penalty or termination payment  but no rent shall be considered as required to be paid under such lease subsequent to the first date upon which it may be so terminated) or the amount determined assuming no such termination. Notwithstanding the preceding  under the Indenture the Guarantor may  and may permit any Subsidiary to  effect any Sale-Leaseback Transaction that is not excepted by clauses (1) through (4)  inclusive  of the first paragraph under ""-Restrictions on Sale-Leasebacks "" provided that the Attributable Indebtedness from such Sale-Leaseback Transaction  together with the aggregate principal amount of all other such Attributable 12 Indebtedness deemed to be outstanding in respect of all Sale-Leaseback Transactions and all outstanding debt (other than the debt securities) secured by liens (other than Permitted Liens) upon Principal Properties or upon capital stock of any Restricted Subsidiary  do not exceed 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets. Merger  Consolidation or Sale of Assets. The Indenture provides that each of the Guarantor and the Issuer may  without the consent of the holders of any of the debt securities  consolidate with or sell  lease  convey all or substantially all of its assets to  or merge with or into  any partnership  limited liability company or corporation if: (1) the entity surviving any such consolidation or merger or to which such assets shall have been transferred (the ""successor"") is either the Guarantor or the Issuer  as applicable  or the successor is a domestic partnership  limited liability company or corporation and expressly assumes all the Guarantor's or the Issuer's  as the case may be  obligations and liabilities under the Indenture and the debt securities (in the case of the Issuer) and the Guarantee (in the case of the Guarantor); (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and (3) the Issuer and the Guarantor have delivered to the Trustee an officers' certificate and an opinion of counsel  each stating that such consolidation  merger or transfer complies with the Indenture. The successor will be substituted for the Guarantor or the Issuer  as the case may be  in the Indenture with the same effect as if it had been an original party to the Indenture. Thereafter  the successor may exercise the rights and powers of the Guarantor or the Issuer  as the case may be  under the Indenture  in its name or in its own name. If the Guarantor or the Issuer sells or transfers all or substantially all of its assets  it will be released from all liabilities and obligations under the Indenture and under the debt securities (in the case of the Issuer) and the Guarantee (in the case of the Guarantor) except that no such release will occur in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets. Events of Default Each of the following will be an Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to a series of debt securities: (1) default in any payment of interest on any debt securities of that series when due  continued for 30 days; (2) default in the payment of principal of or premium  if any  on any debt securities of that series when due at its stated maturity  upon optional redemption  upon declaration or otherwise; (3) failure by the Guarantor or the Issuer to comply for 60 days after notice with its other agreements contained in the Indenture; (4) certain events of bankruptcy  insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer or the Guarantor (the ""bankruptcy provisions""); or (5) the Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect or is declared null and void in a judicial proceeding or the Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under the Indenture or the Guarantee. However  a default under clause (3) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series notify the Issuer and the Guarantor of the default such default is not cured within the time specified in clause (3) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice. An Event of Default for a particular series of debt securities will not necessarily constitute an Event of Default for any other series of debt securities that may be issued under the Indenture. If an Event of Default 13 (other than an Event of Default described in clause (4) above) occurs and is continuing  the Trustee by notice to the Issuer  or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series by notice to the Issuer and the Trustee  may  and the Trustee at the request of such holders shall  declare the principal of  premium  if any  and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on all the debt securities of that series to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration  such principal  premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default described in clause (4) above occurs and is continuing  the principal of  premium  if any  and accrued and unpaid interest on all the debt securities will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders. However  the effect of such provision may be limited by applicable law. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of a series may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the debt securities of that series and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and all existing Events of Default with respect to that series  other than the nonpayment of the principal of  premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities of that series that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration  have been cured or waived. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee  if an Event of Default with respect to a series of debt securities occurs and is continuing  the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders of debt securities of that series  unless such holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity or security against any loss  liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal  premium  if any  or interest when due  no holder of debt securities of any series may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the debt securities of that series unless: (1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default with respect to the debt securities of that series is continuing; (2) holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such holders have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss  liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series have not given the Trustee a direction that  in the opinion of the Trustee  is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions  the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series have the right to direct the time  method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to that series of debt securities. The Trustee  however  may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder of debt securities of that series or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Indenture provides that if a Default (that is  an event that is  or after notice or the passage of time would be  an Event of Default) with respect to the debt securities of a particular series occurs and is continuing and is known to the Trustee  the Trustee must mail to each holder of debt securities of that series notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of  premium  if any  or interest on the debt securities of that series  the Trustee may withhold notice  but only if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the holders of debt securities of that series. In addition  the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee  within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year  an officers' certificate as to compliance with all covenants in the Indenture and indicating whether the 14 signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer also is required to deliver to the Trustee  within 30 days after the occurrence thereof  an officers' certificate specifying any Default or Event of Default  its status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. Amendments and Waivers Amendments of the Indenture may be made by the Issuer  the Guarantor and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of all debt securities of each series affected thereby then outstanding under the Indenture (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the debt securities). However  without the consent of each holder of outstanding debt securities affected thereby  no amendment may  among other things: (1) reduce the percentage in principal amount of debt securities whose holders must consent to an amendment; (2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any debt securities; (3) reduce the principal of or extend the stated maturity of any debt securities; (4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any debt securities or change the time at which any debt securities may be redeemed; (5) make any debt securities payable in money other than that stated in the debt securities; (6) impair the right of any holder to receive payment of  premium  if any  principal of and interest on such holder's debt securities on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder's debt securities; (7) make any change in the amendment provisions which require each holder's consent or in the waiver provisions; (8) release any security that may have been granted in respect of the debt securities; or (9) release the Guarantor or modify the Guarantee in any manner adverse to the holders. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series affected thereby  may waive compliance by the Issuer and the Guarantor with certain restrictive covenants on behalf of all holders of debt securities of such series  including those described under ""-Certain Covenants-Limitations on Liens"" and ""-Certain Covenants-Restriction on Sale-Leasebacks."" The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series affected thereby  on behalf of all such holders  may waive any past Default or Event of Default with respect to that series (including any such waiver obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the debt securities)  except a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal  premium or interest or in respect of a provision that under the Indenture that cannot be amended without the consent of all holders of the series of debt securities that is affected. Without the consent of any holder  the Issuer  the Guarantor and the Trustee may amend the Indenture to: (1) cure any ambiguity  omission  defect or inconsistency; (2) provide for the assumption by a successor of the obligations of the Guarantor or the Issuer under the Indenture; (3) provide for uncertificated debt securities in addition to or in place of certificated debt securities (provided that the uncertificated debt securities are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended (the ""Internal Revenue Code"")  or in a manner such that the uncertificated debt securities are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code); 15 (4) add or release guarantees by any Subsidiary with respect to the debt securities  in either case as provided in the Indenture; (5) secure the debt securities or a guarantee; (6) add to the covenants of the Guarantor or the Issuer for the benefit of the holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Guarantor or the Issuer; (7) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder; (8) comply with any requirement of the Commission in connection with the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act; and (9) issue any other series of debt securities under the Indenture. The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. After an amendment requiring consent of the holders becomes effective  the Issuer is required to mail to the holders of an affected series a notice briefly describing such amendment. However  the failure to give such notice to all such holders  or any defect therein  will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment. Defeasance and Discharge The Issuer at any time may terminate all its obligations under the Indenture as they relate to a series of debt securities (""legal defeasance"")  except for certain obligations  including those respecting the defeasance trust and obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the debt securities of that series  to replace mutilated  destroyed  lost or stolen debt securities of that series and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of such debt securities. The Issuer at any time may terminate its obligations under covenants described under ""-Certain Covenants"" (other than ""Merger  Consolidation or Sale of Assets"") and the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Guarantor  and the Guarantee provision  described under ""-Events of Default"" above with respect to a series of debt securities (""covenant defeasance""). The Issuer may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option  payment of the defeased series of debt securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option  payment of the affected series of debt securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3)  (4)  (with respect only to the Guarantor) or (5) under ""-Events of Default"" above. If the Issuer exercises either its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option  each guarantee will terminate with respect to the debt securities of the defeased series and any security that may have been granted with respect to such debt securities will be released. In order to exercise either defeasance option  the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the ""defeasance trust"") with the Trustee money  U.S. Government Obligations (as defined in the Indenture) or a combination thereof for the payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on the relevant series of debt securities to redemption or maturity  as the case may be  and must comply with certain other conditions  including delivery to the Trustee of an opinion of counsel (subject to customary exceptions and exclusions) to the effect that holders of that series of debt securities will not recognize income  gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred. In the case of legal defeasance only  such opinion of counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") or other change in applicable federal income tax law. 16 In the event of any legal defeasance  holders of the debt securities of the relevant series would be entitled to look only to the trust fund for payment of principal of and any premium and interest on their debt securities until maturity. Although the amount of money and U.S. Government Obligations on deposit with the Trustee would be intended to be sufficient to pay amounts due on the debt securities of a defeased series at the time of their stated maturity  if the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option for the debt securities of any series and the debt securities are declared due and payable because of the occurrence of an Event of Default  such amount may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the debt securities of that series at the time of the acceleration resulting from such Event of Default. The Issuer would remain liable for such payments  however. In addition  the Issuer may discharge all its obligations under the Indenture with respect to debt securities of any series  other than its obligation to register the transfer of and exchange notes of that series  provided that it either: • delivers all outstanding debt securities of that series to the Trustee for cancellation; or • all such debt securities not so delivered for cancellation have either become due and payable or will become due and payable at their stated maturity within one year or are called for redemption within one year  and in the case of this bullet point the Issuer has deposited with the Trustee in trust an amount of cash sufficient to pay the entire indebtedness of such debt securities  including interest to the stated maturity or applicable redemption date. Subordination Debt securities of a series may be subordinated to our Senior Indebtedness  which we define generally to include all notes or other evidences of indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer  including guarantees  that are not expressly subordinate or junior in right of payment to any other indebtedness of the Issuer. Subordinated debt securities and the Guarantor's guarantee thereof will be subordinate in right of payment  to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture and the prospectus supplement relating to such series  to the prior payment of all indebtedness of the Issuer and Guarantor that is designated as ""Senior Indebtedness"" with respect to the series. The holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer will receive payment in full of the Senior Indebtedness before holders of subordinated debt securities will receive any payment of principal  premium or interest with respect to the subordinated debt securities: • upon any payment of distribution of our assets of the Issuer to its creditors; • upon a total or partial liquidation or dissolution of the Issuer; or • in a bankruptcy  receivership or similar proceeding relating to the Issuer or its property. Until the Senior Indebtedness is paid in full  any distribution to which holders of subordinated debt securities would otherwise be entitled will be made to the holders of Senior Indebtedness  except that such holders may receive units representing limited partner interests and any debt securities that are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness to at least the same extent as the subordinated debt securities. If the Issuer does not pay any principal  premium or interest with respect to Senior Indebtedness within any applicable grace period (including at maturity)  or any other default on Senior Indebtedness occurs and the maturity of the Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms  the Issuer may not: • make any payments of principal  premium  if any  or interest with respect to subordinated debt securities; • make any deposit for the purpose of defeasance of the subordinated debt securities; or 17 • repurchase  redeem or otherwise retire any subordinated debt securities  except that in the case of subordinated debt securities that provide for a mandatory sinking fund  we may deliver subordinated debt securities to the Trustee in satisfaction of our sinking fund obligation  unless  in either case  • the default has been cured or waived and the declaration of acceleration has been rescinded; • the Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash; or • the Issuer and the Trustee receive written notice approving the payment from the representatives of each issue of ""Designated Senior Indebtedness."" Generally  ""Designated Senior Indebtedness"" will include: • indebtedness for borrowed money under a bank credit agreement  called ""Bank Indebtedness""; and • any specified issue of Senior Indebtedness of at least $100 million. During the continuance of any default  other than a default described in the immediately preceding paragraph  that may cause the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness to be accelerated immediately without further notice  other than any notice required to effect such acceleration  or the expiration of any applicable grace periods  the Issuer may not pay the subordinated debt securities for a period called the ""Payment Blockage Period."" A Payment Blockage Period will commence on the receipt by us and the Trustee of written notice of the default  called a ""Blockage Notice "" from the representative of any Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period. The Payment Blockage Period may be terminated before its expiration: • by written notice from the person or persons who gave the Blockage Notice; • by repayment in full in cash of the Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Blockage Notice was given; or • if the default giving rise to the Payment Blockage Period is no longer continuing. Unless the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of the Senior Indebtedness  we may resume payments on the subordinated debt securities after the expiration of the Payment Blockage Period. Generally  not more than one Blockage Notice may be given in any period of 360 consecutive days unless the first Blockage Notice within the 360-day period is given by holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness  other than Bank Indebtedness  in which case the representative of the Bank Indebtedness may give another Blockage Notice within the period. The total number of days during which any one or more Payment Blockage Periods are in effect  however  may not exceed an aggregate of 179 days during any period of 360 consecutive days. After all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full and until the subordinated debt securities are paid in full  holders of the subordinated debt securities shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness. By reason of the subordination  in the event of insolvency  our creditors who are holders of Senior Indebtedness  as well as certain of our general creditors  may recover more  ratably  than the holders of the subordinated debt securities. Form and Denomination Unless otherwise indicated in a prospectus supplement  the debt securities of a series will be issued as Registered Securities in denominations of $1 000 and any integral multiple thereof. 18 Book-Entry System Unless otherwise indicated in a prospectus supplement  we will issue the debt securities in the form of one or more global securities in fully registered form initially in the name of Cede & Co.  as nominee of The Depository Trust Company (""DTC"")  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. Unless otherwise indicated in a prospectus supplement  the global securities will be deposited with the Trustee as custodian for DTC and may not be transferred except as a whole by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC or by DTC or any nominee to a successor of DTC or a nominee of such successor. DTC has advised us as follows: • DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law  a ""banking organization"" within the meaning of the New York Banking Law  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a ""clearing corporation"" within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code  and a ""clearing agency"" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  as amended (the ""Exchange Act""). • DTC holds securities that its participants deposit with DTC and facilitates the post-trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities  such as transfers and pledges  through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants' accounts  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. • Direct participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations and certain other organizations. • DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (""DTCC""). DTCC is the holding company for DTC  National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation  all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. • Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant  either directly or indirectly. • The rules applicable to DTC and its direct and indirect participants are on file with the Commission. Purchases of debt securities under the DTC system must be made by or through direct participants  which will receive a credit for the debt securities on DTC's records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of debt securities is in turn to be recorded on the direct and indirect participants' records. Beneficial owners of the debt securities will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase  but beneficial owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction  as well as periodic statements of their holdings  from the direct or indirect participant through which the beneficial owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the debt securities are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of direct and indirect participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners. Beneficial owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in the debt securities  except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the debt securities is discontinued. To facilitate subsequent transfers  all debt securities deposited by direct participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC's partnership nominee  Cede & Co.  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of debt securities with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the debt securities; DTC's records reflect only the identity of the direct participants to whose accounts such debt securities are credited  which may or may not be the beneficial owners. The direct and indirect participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. 19 Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to direct participants  by  direct participants to indirect participants  and by direct participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among them  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the global securities. Under its usual procedures  DTC mails an omnibus proxy to the issuer as soon as possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy assigns Cede & Co.'s consenting or voting rights to those direct participants to whose accounts the debt securities are credited on the record date (identified in the listing attached to the omnibus proxy). All payments on the global securities will be made to Cede & Co.  as holder of record  or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC's practice is to credit direct participants' accounts upon DTC's receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from us or the Trustee on payment dates in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC's records. Payments by participants to beneficial owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices  as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in ""street name "" and will be the responsibility of such participant and not of DTC  us or the Trustee  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) shall be the responsibility of us or the Trustee. Disbursement of such payments to direct participants shall be the responsibility of DTC  and disbursement of such payments to the beneficial owners shall be the responsibility of direct and indirect participants. DTC may discontinue providing its service as securities depositary with respect to the debt securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to us or the Trustee. In addition  we may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depositary). Under such circumstances  in the event that a successor securities depositary is not obtained  note certificates in fully registered form are required to be printed and delivered to beneficial owners of the global securities representing such debt securities. Neither we nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or obligation to direct or indirect participants  or the persons for whom they act as nominees  with respect to the accuracy of the records of DTC  its nominee or any participant with respect to any ownership interest in the debt securities  or payments to  or the providing of notice to participants or beneficial owners. So long as the debt securities are in DTC's book-entry system  secondary market trading activity in the debt securities will settle in immediately available funds. All payments on the debt securities issued as global securities will be made by us in immediately available funds. The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC's book-entry system has been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable  but we take no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Limitations on Issuance of Bearer Securities The debt securities of a series may be issued as Registered Securities (which will be registered as to principal and interest in the register maintained by the registrar for the debt securities) or Bearer Securities (which will be transferable only by delivery). If the debt securities are issuable as Bearer Securities  certain special limitations and conditions will apply. In compliance with United States federal income tax laws and regulations  we and any underwriter  agent or dealer participating in an offering of Bearer Securities will agree that  in connection with the original issuance of the Bearer Securities and during the period ending 40 days after the issue date  they will not offer  sell or deliver any such Bearer Securities  directly or indirectly  to a United States Person (as defined below) or to any person within the United States  except to the extent permitted under United States Treasury regulations. 20 Bearer Securities will bear a legend to the following effect: ""Any United States person who holds this obligation will be subject to limitations under the United States federal income tax laws  including the limitations provided in Sections 165(j) and 1287(a) of the Internal Revenue Code."" The sections referred to in the legend provide that  with certain exceptions  a United States taxpayer who holds Bearer Securities will not be allowed to deduct any loss with respect to  and will not be eligible for capital gain treatment with respect to any gain realized on the sale  exchange  redemption or other disposition of  the Bearer Securities. For this purpose  ""United States"" includes the United States of America and its possessions  and ""United States person"" means a citizen or resident of the United States  a corporation  partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States  or an estate or trust the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source. Pending the availability of a definitive global security or individual Bearer Securities  as the case may be  debt securities that are issuable as Bearer Securities may initially be represented by a single temporary global security  without interest coupons  to be deposited with a common depositary for the Euroclear System as operated by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (""Euroclear"") and Clearstream Banking S.A. (""Clearstream""  formerly Cedelbank)  for credit to the accounts designated by or on behalf of the purchasers thereof. Following the availability of a definitive global security in bearer form  without coupons attached  or individual Bearer Securities and subject to any further limitations described in the applicable prospectus supplement  the temporary global security will be exchangeable for interests in the definitive global security or for the individual Bearer Securities  respectively  only upon receipt of a ""Certificate of Non-U.S. Beneficial Ownership "" which is a certificate to the effect that a beneficial interest in a temporary global security is owned by a person that is not a United States Person or is owned by or through a financial institution in compliance with applicable United States Treasury regulations. No Bearer Security will be delivered in or to the United States. If so specified in the applicable prospectus supplement  interest on a temporary global security will be paid to each of Euroclear and Clearstream with respect to that portion of the temporary global security held for its account  but only upon receipt as of the relevant interest payment date of a Certificate of Non-U.S. Beneficial Ownership. No Recourse Against General Partner The Guarantor's general partner and its directors  officers  employees and members  as such  shall have no liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantor under the debt securities  the Indenture or the guarantee or for any claim based on  in respect of  or by reason of  such obligations or their creation. Each holder by accepting a note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the debt securities. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws  and it is the view of the Commission that such a waiver is against public policy. Concerning the Trustee The Indenture contains certain limitations on the right of the Trustee  should it become our creditor  to obtain payment of claims in certain cases  or to realize for its own account on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee is permitted to engage in certain other transactions. However  if it acquires any conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act  it must eliminate the conflict or resign as Trustee. The holders of a majority in principal amount of all outstanding debt securities (or if more than one series of debt securities under the Indenture is affected thereby  all series so affected  voting as a single class) will have the right to direct the time  method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy or power available to the Trustee for the debt securities or all such series so affected. If an Event of Default occurs and is not cured under the Indenture and is known to the Trustee  the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by the Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill 21 in its exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions  the Trustee will not be under any obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any of the holders of debt securities unless they shall have offered to such Trustee reasonable security and indemnity. U.S. Bank National Association is the Trustee under the Indenture for the 3.300% Senior Notes due 2053 issued on September 15  2021 and any series of debt securities issued after such notes and has been appointed by the Issuer as Registrar and Paying Agent with regard to such debt securities. U.S. Bank National Association is a lender under the Issuer's credit facilities. Governing Law The Indenture  the debt securities and the guarantee are governed by  and will be construed in accordance with  the laws of the State of New York. 22 Attachments Original LinkOriginal DocumentPermalink Disclaimer Enterprise Products Partners LP published this content on 05 January 2023 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

This summary is not a complete description of all of the terms and provisions of the notes. You should read carefully the section entitled ""Description of Debt Securities"" in the accompanying prospectus for a description of other material terms of the notes  the Guarantee and the Base Indenture (defined below). For more information  we refer you to the notes  the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture described below  all of which are available from us. We urge you to read the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture because they  and not this description  define your rights as an owner of the notes.

General The Notes. The notes: • will be general unsecured  senior obligations of the Issuer; • will constitute two new series of debt securities issued under the Indenture that will initially consist of $750 000 000 aggregate principal amount of 2026 notes and $1 000 000 000 aggregate principal amount of 2033 notes; • with respect to the 2026 notes  will mature on January 10  2026  and with respect to the 2033 notes  will mature on January 31  2033; • will be issued in denominations of $1 000 and integral multiples of $1 000 in excess thereof; • initially will be issued only in book-entry form represented by one or more notes in global form registered in the name of Cede & Co.  as nominee of DTC  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC  and deposited with the Series Trustee as custodian for DTC; and • will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured  unsubordinated basis by the Parent Guarantor  and in certain circumstances may be guaranteed in the future on the same basis by one or more Subsidiary Guarantors. 2 Interest. Interest on the notes will: • with respect to the 2026 notes  accrue at the rate of 5.05% per annum  and with respect to the 2033 notes  accrue at the rate of 5.35% per annum  in each case from January 10  2023 or the most recent interest payment date; • with respect to the 2026 notes  be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on January 10 and July 10 of each year  beginning on July 10  2023  and with respect to the 2033 notes  be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on January 31 and July 31 of each year  beginning on July 31  2023; • with respect to the 2026 notes  be payable to holders of record on the December 26 and June 25 immediately preceding the related interest payment dates  and with respect to the 2033 notes  be payable to holders of record on the January 15 and July 15 immediately preceding the related interest payment dates; and • be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Payment and Transfer. Initially  the notes will be issued only in global form. Beneficial interests in notes in global form will be shown on  and transfers of interests in notes in global form will be made only through  records maintained by DTC and its participants. Notes in definitive form  if any  may be presented for registration of transfer or exchange at the office or agency maintained by us for such purpose (which initially will be the corporate trust office of the Series Trustee located at 111 Fillmore Avenue East  St. Paul  Minnesota 55107-1402). Payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on notes in global form registered in the name of DTC's nominee will be made in immediately available funds to DTC's nominee  as the registered holder of such global notes. If any of the notes is no longer represented by a global note  payment of interest on the notes in definitive form may  at our option  be made at the corporate trust office of the Series Trustee indicated above or by check mailed directly to holders at their respective registered addresses or by wire transfer to an account designated by a holder to an account in the United States. If any interest payment date  maturity date or redemption date falls on a day that is not a business day  the payment due on the notes on such date will be made on the next business day with the same force and effect as if made on the relevant interest payment date  maturity date or redemption date. No interest will accrue on such payment for the period from and after the applicable interest payment date  maturity date or redemption date  as the case may be  to the date of such payment on the next business day. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of notes  but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. We are not required to register the transfer of or exchange any note selected for redemption or for a period of 15 days before mailing or furnishing a notice of redemption of the notes. The registered holder of a note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes  and all references in this ""Description of the Notes"" to ""holders"" mean holders of record  unless otherwise indicated. Investors may hold interests in the notes outside the United States through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (""Euroclear"") or Clearstream Banking S.A. (""Clearstream "" formerly Cedelbank) if they are participants in those systems  or indirectly through organizations which are participants in those systems. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests on behalf of their participants through customers' securities accounts in Euroclear's and Clearstream's names on the books of their respective depositaries which in turn will hold such positions in 3 customers' securities accounts in the names of the nominees of the depositaries on the books of DTC. All securities in Euroclear or Clearstream are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. Transfers of notes by persons holding through Euroclear or Clearstream participants will be effected through DTC  in accordance with DTC's rules  on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system by its depositaries; however  such transactions will require delivery of exercise instructions to the relevant European international clearing system by the participant in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will  if the exercise meets its requirements  deliver instructions to its depositaries to take action to effect exercise of the notes on its behalf by delivering notes through DTC and receiving payment in accordance with its normal procedures for next-day funds settlement. Payments with respect to the notes held through Euroclear or Clearstream will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear participants in accordance with the relevant system's rules and procedures  to the extent received by its depositaries. Replacement of Notes. We will replace any mutilated  destroyed  stolen or lost notes at the expense of the holder upon surrender of the mutilated notes to the Series Trustee or evidence of destruction  loss or theft of a note satisfactory to us and the Series Trustee. In the case of a destroyed  lost or stolen note  we may require an indemnity satisfactory to the Series Trustee and to us before a replacement note will be issued. Further Issuances We may from time to time  without notice or the consent of the holders of the notes of any series  create and issue further notes of the same series ranking equally and ratably with the original notes of that series in all respects (or in all respects except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such further notes  the first interest payment date  the public offering price and the issue date)  so that such further notes form a single series with the original notes of that series and have the same terms as to status  redemption or otherwise as the original notes of that series; provided  however  that such further notes must be fungible with the original notes of that series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Optional Redemption Prior to their maturity  in the case of the 2026 notes  and prior to October 31  2032  in the case of the 2033 notes (such date  the ""2033 notes Par Call Date"")  we may redeem the notes of each series at our option  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of: (1) (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming the notes of the series to be redeemed matured on the 2026 notes maturity date  in the case of the 2026 notes  or on the 2033 notes Par Call Date  in the case of the 2033 notes (such date  as applicable  the ""Relevant Date"")) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points  in the case of the 2026 notes  or 25 basis points  in the case of the 2033 notes less (b) interest accrued to the date of redemption  and (2) 100% of the principal amount of the notes of such series to be redeemed  plus  in either case  accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. On or after the 2033 notes Par Call Date  we may redeem the 2033 notes at our option  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2033 notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. 4 ""Treasury Rate"" means  with respect to any redemption date for the notes of any series  the yield determined by us in accordance with the following two paragraphs. The Treasury Rate shall be determined by us after 4:15 p.m.  New York City time (or after such time as yields on U.S. government securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System)  on the third business day preceding the redemption date based upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as ""Selected Interest Rates (Daily)-H.15"" (or any successor designation or publication) (""H.15"") under the caption ""U.S. government securities-Treasury constant maturities-Nominal"" (or any successor caption or heading) (""H.15 TCM""). In determining the Treasury Rate  we shall select  as applicable: (1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the period from the redemption date to the Relevant Date with respect to the notes to be redeemed (the ""Remaining Life""); or (2) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the Remaining Life  the two yields - one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately longer than the Remaining Life - and shall interpolate to the applicable Relevant Date on a straight-line basis (using the actual number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places; or (3) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life  the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15 closest to the Remaining Life. For purposes of this paragraph  the applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15 shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months or years  as applicable  of such Treasury constant maturity from the redemption date. If on the third business day preceding the redemption date H.15 TCM is no longer published  we shall calculate the Treasury Rate based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time  on the second business day preceding such redemption date of the United States Treasury security maturing on  or with a maturity that is closest to  the applicable Relevant Date. If there is no United States Treasury security maturing on the applicable Relevant Date but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally distant from the applicable Relevant Date  one with a maturity date preceding the applicable Relevant Date and one with a maturity date following the applicable Relevant Date  we shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date preceding the applicable Relevant Date. If there are two or more United States Treasury securities maturing on the applicable Relevant Date or two or more United States Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence  we shall select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States Treasury security that is trading closest to par based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time. In determining the Treasury Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph  the semi-annual yield to maturity of the applicable United States Treasury security shall be based upon the average of the bid and asked prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time  of such United States Treasury security  and rounded to three decimal places. Our actions and determinations in determining the redemption price shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes  absent manifest error. Notes called for redemption become due on the redemption date. Notices of optional redemption will be mailed (or electronically delivered in accordance with applicable procedures of DTC) at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the notes to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of optional redemption for the notes will state  among other things  the amount of notes to be redeemed  the redemption date  the method of calculating the redemption price and each place that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of notes to be redeemed. If less than all of the notes of any series are redeemed at any time  the Series Trustee will select the notes to be redeemed on a pro rata basis  by lot  or by any other method the Series Trustee deems fair and appropriate  and when the notes are in book entry form  in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC. Unless we default in payment of the redemption price  interest will cease to accrue on the redemption date with respect to any notes called for optional redemption. 5 Ranking The notes will be unsecured  unless we are required to secure them pursuant to the limitations on liens covenant described in the accompanying prospectus under ""Description of Debt Securities-Certain Covenants-Limitations on Liens."" The notes will also be the unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer and will rank equally with all other existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer. Each guarantee of the notes will be an unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the Guarantor and will rank equally with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Guarantor. The notes and each guarantee will effectively rank junior to any future indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantor that is both secured and unsubordinated to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness  and the notes will effectively rank junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities of the Issuer's subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors. On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to this senior notes offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom  at September 30  2022  the Issuer had approximately $29.5 billion principal amount of consolidated indebtedness  including $26.3 billion in senior notes and $2.3 billion of junior subordinated notes outstanding under the Base Indenture and a similar indenture  and $921 million in short-term commercial paper notes  and the Parent Guarantor had no indebtedness (excluding guarantees totaling $29.5 billion)  in each case excluding intercompany loans. Please read ""Capitalization."" Parent Guarantee The Parent Guarantor will fully and unconditionally guarantee to each holder and the Series Trustee  on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis  the full and prompt payment of principal of  premium  if any  and interest on the notes  when and as the same become due and payable  whether at stated maturity  upon redemption  by declaration of acceleration or otherwise. Potential Guarantee of Notes by Subsidiaries Initially  the notes will not be guaranteed by any of our Subsidiaries. In the future  however  if our Subsidiaries become guarantors or co-obligors of our Funded Debt (as defined below)  then those Subsidiaries will jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally  guarantee our payment obligations under the notes. We refer to any such Subsidiaries as ""Subsidiary Guarantors"" and sometimes to such guarantees as ""Subsidiary Guarantees."" Each Subsidiary Guarantor will execute a supplement to the Indenture to effect its guarantee. The obligations of each Guarantor under its guarantee of the notes will be limited to the maximum amount that will not result in the obligations of the Guarantor under the guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal or state law  after giving effect to: • all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor; and • any collection from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under its guarantee. ""Funded Debt"" means all Indebtedness maturing one year or more from the date of the creation thereof  all Indebtedness directly or indirectly renewable or extendible  at the option of the debtor  by its terms or by the terms of any instrument or agreement relating thereto  to a date one year or more from the date of the creation thereof  and all Indebtedness under a revolving credit or similar agreement obligating the lender or lenders to extend credit over a period of one year or more. Addition and Release of Subsidiary Guarantors The guarantee of any Guarantor may be released under certain circumstances. If we exercise our legal or covenant defeasance option with respect to debt securities of any series as described in the accompanying 6 prospectus under ""Description of Debt Securities-Defeasance and Discharge "" then any guarantee will be released with respect to that series. Further  if no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture  a Subsidiary Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from its guarantee: • automatically upon any sale  exchange or transfer  whether by way of merger or otherwise  to any person that is not our affiliate  of all of the Parent Guarantor's direct or indirect limited partnership or other equity interests in the Subsidiary Guarantor; • automatically upon the merger of the Subsidiary Guarantor into us or any other Guarantor or the liquidation and dissolution of the Subsidiary Guarantor; or • following delivery of a written notice by us to the Series Trustee  upon the release of all guarantees or other obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to any Funded Debt of ours  except the notes and any other series of debt securities issued under the Indenture. If at any time following any release of a Subsidiary Guarantor from its initial guarantee of the notes pursuant to the third bullet point in the preceding paragraph  the Subsidiary Guarantor again guarantees or co-issues any of our Funded Debt (other than our obligations under the Indenture)  then the Parent Guarantor will cause the Subsidiary Guarantor to again guarantee the notes in accordance with the Indenture. No Sinking Fund We are not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the notes of any series. 7 DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES In this Description of Debt Securities references to the ""Issuer"" mean only Enterprise Products Operating LLC (successor to Enterprise Products Operating L.P.) and not its subsidiaries.

At our option  we may make interest payments  by check mailed to the registered holders thereof or  if so stated in the applicable prospectus supplement  at the option of a holder by wire transfer to an account designated by the holder. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement  no payment on a Bearer Security will be made by mail to an address in the United States or by wire transfer to an account in the United States.

Bearer Securities will be transferable only by delivery. Provisions with respect to the exchange of Bearer Securities will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement. Any funds we pay to a paying agent for the payment of amounts due on any debt securities that remain unclaimed for two years will be returned to us  and the holders of the debt securities must thereafter look only to us for payment thereof. Guarantee The Guarantor will unconditionally guarantee to each holder and the Trustee the full and prompt payment of principal of  premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities  when and as the same become due and payable  whether at maturity  upon redemption or repurchase  by declaration of acceleration or otherwise. Certain Covenants Except as set forth below or as may be provided in a prospectus supplement and supplemental indenture  neither the Issuer nor the Guarantor is restricted by the Indenture from incurring any type of indebtedness or other obligation  from paying dividends or making distributions on its partnership interests or capital stock or purchasing or redeeming its partnership interests or capital stock. The Indenture does not require the maintenance of any financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. In addition  the Indenture does not contain any provisions that would require the Issuer to repurchase or redeem or otherwise modify the terms of any of the debt securities upon a change in control or other events involving the Issuer which may adversely affect the creditworthiness of the debt securities. Limitations on Liens. The Indenture provides that the Guarantor will not  nor will it permit any Subsidiary to  create  assume  incur or suffer to exist any mortgage  lien  security interest  pledge  charge or other 9 encumbrance (""liens"") other than Permitted Liens (as defined below) upon any Principal Property (as defined below) or upon any shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary owning or leasing  either directly or through ownership in another Subsidiary  any Principal Property (a ""Restricted Subsidiary"")  whether owned or leased on the date of the Indenture or thereafter acquired  to secure any indebtedness for borrowed money (""debt"") of the Guarantor or the Issuer or any other person (other than the debt securities)  without in any such case making effective provision whereby all of the debt securities outstanding shall be secured equally and ratably with  or prior to  such debt so long as such debt shall be so secured.

provided that  in each case  such lien only encumbers the property or assets so acquired or owned by such person at the time such person becomes a Subsidiary; (12) liens imposed by law or order as a result of any proceeding before any court or regulatory body that is being contested in good faith  and liens which secure a judgment or other court-ordered award or settlement as to which the Guarantor or the applicable Subsidiary has not exhausted its appellate rights; (13) any extension  renewal  refinancing  refunding or replacement (or successive extensions  renewals  refinancing  refunding or replacements) of liens  in whole or in part  referred to in clauses (1) through (12) above; provided  however  that any such extension  renewal  refinancing  refunding or replacement lien shall be limited to the property or assets covered by the lien extended  renewed  refinanced  refunded or replaced and that the obligations secured by any such extension  renewal  refinancing  refunding or replacement lien shall be in an amount not greater than the amount of the obligations secured by the lien extended  renewed  refinanced  refunded or replaced and any expenses of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries (including any premium) incurred in connection with such extension  renewal  refinancing  refunding or replacement; or (14) any lien resulting from the deposit of moneys or evidence of indebtedness in trust for the purpose of defeasing debt of the Guarantor or any Subsidiary. ""Principal Property"" means  whether owned or leased on the date of the Indenture or thereafter acquired: (1) any pipeline assets of the Guarantor or any Subsidiary  including any related facilities employed in the transportation  distribution  storage or marketing of refined petroleum products  natural gas liquids  and petrochemicals  that are located in the United States of America or any territory or political subdivision thereof; and (2) any processing or manufacturing plant or terminal owned or leased by the Guarantor or any Subsidiary that is located in the United States or any territory or political subdivision thereof  except  in the case of either of the foregoing clauses (1) or (2): (a) any such assets consisting of inventories  furniture  office fixtures and equipment (including data processing equipment)  vehicles and equipment used on  or useful with  vehicles; and (b) any such assets  plant or terminal which  in the opinion of the board of directors of the managing member of the Issuer  is not material in relation to the activities of the Issuer or of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. ""Subsidiary"" means: (1) the Issuer; or (2) any corporation  association or other business entity of which more than 50% of the total voting power of the equity interests entitled (without regard to the occurrence of any contingency) to vote in the 11 election of directors  managers or trustees thereof or any partnership of which more than 50% of the partners' equity interests (considering all partners' equity interests as a single class) is  in each case  at the time owned or controlled  directly or indirectly  by the Guarantor  the Issuer or one or more of the other Subsidiaries of the Guarantor or the Issuer or combination thereof. Notwithstanding the preceding  under the Indenture  the Guarantor may  and may permit any Subsidiary to  create  assume  incur  or suffer to exist any lien (other than a Permitted Lien) upon any Principal Property or capital stock of a Restricted Subsidiary to secure debt of the Guarantor  the Issuer or any other person (other than the debt securities)  without securing the debt securities  provided that the aggregate principal amount of all debt then outstanding secured by such lien and all similar liens  together with all Attributable Indebtedness from Sale-Leaseback Transactions (excluding Sale-Leaseback Transactions permitted by clauses (1) through (4)  inclusive  of the first paragraph of the restriction on sale-leasebacks covenant described below) does not exceed 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets. Restriction on Sale-Leasebacks. The Indenture provides that the Guarantor will not  and will not permit any Subsidiary to  engage in the sale or transfer by the Guarantor or any Subsidiary of any Principal Property to a person (other than the Issuer or a Subsidiary) and the taking back by the Guarantor or any Subsidiary  as the case may be  of a lease of such Principal Property (a ""Sale-Leaseback Transaction"")  unless: (1) such Sale-Leaseback Transaction occurs within one year from the date of completion of the acquisition of the Principal Property subject thereto or the date of the completion of construction  development or substantial repair or improvement  or commencement of full operations on such Principal Property  whichever is later; (2) the Sale-Leaseback Transaction involves a lease for a period  including renewals  of not more than three years; (3) the Guarantor or such Subsidiary would be entitled to incur debt secured by a lien on the Principal Property subject thereto in a principal amount equal to or exceeding the Attributable Indebtedness from such Sale-Leaseback Transaction without equally and ratably securing the debt securities; or (4) the Guarantor or such Subsidiary  within a one-year period after such Sale-Leaseback Transaction  applies or causes to be applied an amount not less than the Attributable Indebtedness from such Sale-Leaseback Transaction to (a) the prepayment  repayment  redemption  reduction or retirement of any debt of the Guarantor or any Subsidiary that is not subordinated to the debt securities  or (b) the expenditure or expenditures for Principal Property used or to be used in the ordinary course of business of the Guarantor or its Subsidiaries. ""Attributable Indebtedness "" when used with respect to any Sale-Leaseback Transaction  means  as at the time of determination  the present value (discounted at the rate set forth or implicit in the terms of the lease included in such transaction) of the total obligations of the lessee for rental payments (other than amounts required to be paid on account of property taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance  assessments  utilities  operating and labor costs and other items that do not constitute payments for property rights) during the remaining term of the lease included in such Sale-Leaseback Transaction (including any period for which such lease has been extended). In the case of any lease that is terminable by the lessee upon the payment of a penalty or other termination payment  such amount shall be the lesser of the amount determined assuming termination upon the first date such lease may be terminated (in which case the amount shall also include the amount of the penalty or termination payment  but no rent shall be considered as required to be paid under such lease subsequent to the first date upon which it may be so terminated) or the amount determined assuming no such termination. Notwithstanding the preceding  under the Indenture the Guarantor may  and may permit any Subsidiary to  effect any Sale-Leaseback Transaction that is not excepted by clauses (1) through (4)  inclusive  of the first paragraph under ""-Restrictions on Sale-Leasebacks "" provided that the Attributable Indebtedness from such Sale-Leaseback Transaction  together with the aggregate principal amount of all other such Attributable 12 Indebtedness deemed to be outstanding in respect of all Sale-Leaseback Transactions and all outstanding debt (other than the debt securities) secured by liens (other than Permitted Liens) upon Principal Properties or upon capital stock of any Restricted Subsidiary  do not exceed 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets. Merger  Consolidation or Sale of Assets. The Indenture provides that each of the Guarantor and the Issuer may  without the consent of the holders of any of the debt securities  consolidate with or sell  lease  convey all or substantially all of its assets to  or merge with or into  any partnership  limited liability company or corporation if: (1) the entity surviving any such consolidation or merger or to which such assets shall have been transferred (the ""successor"") is either the Guarantor or the Issuer  as applicable  or the successor is a domestic partnership  limited liability company or corporation and expressly assumes all the Guarantor's or the Issuer's  as the case may be  obligations and liabilities under the Indenture and the debt securities (in the case of the Issuer) and the Guarantee (in the case of the Guarantor); (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and (3) the Issuer and the Guarantor have delivered to the Trustee an officers' certificate and an opinion of counsel  each stating that such consolidation  merger or transfer complies with the Indenture. The successor will be substituted for the Guarantor or the Issuer  as the case may be  in the Indenture with the same effect as if it had been an original party to the Indenture. Thereafter  the successor may exercise the rights and powers of the Guarantor or the Issuer  as the case may be  under the Indenture  in its name or in its own name. If the Guarantor or the Issuer sells or transfers all or substantially all of its assets  it will be released from all liabilities and obligations under the Indenture and under the debt securities (in the case of the Issuer) and the Guarantee (in the case of the Guarantor) except that no such release will occur in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets. Events of Default Each of the following will be an Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to a series of debt securities: (1) default in any payment of interest on any debt securities of that series when due  continued for 30 days; (2) default in the payment of principal of or premium  if any  on any debt securities of that series when due at its stated maturity  upon optional redemption  upon declaration or otherwise; (3) failure by the Guarantor or the Issuer to comply for 60 days after notice with its other agreements contained in the Indenture; (4) certain events of bankruptcy  insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer or the Guarantor (the ""bankruptcy provisions""); or (5) the Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect or is declared null and void in a judicial proceeding or the Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under the Indenture or the Guarantee. However  a default under clause (3) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series notify the Issuer and the Guarantor of the default such default is not cured within the time specified in clause (3) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice. An Event of Default for a particular series of debt securities will not necessarily constitute an Event of Default for any other series of debt securities that may be issued under the Indenture. If an Event of Default 13 (other than an Event of Default described in clause (4) above) occurs and is continuing  the Trustee by notice to the Issuer  or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series by notice to the Issuer and the Trustee  may  and the Trustee at the request of such holders shall  declare the principal of  premium  if any  and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on all the debt securities of that series to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration  such principal  premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default described in clause (4) above occurs and is continuing  the principal of  premium  if any  and accrued and unpaid interest on all the debt securities will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders. However  the effect of such provision may be limited by applicable law. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of a series may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the debt securities of that series and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and all existing Events of Default with respect to that series  other than the nonpayment of the principal of  premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities of that series that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration  have been cured or waived. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee  if an Event of Default with respect to a series of debt securities occurs and is continuing  the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders of debt securities of that series  unless such holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity or security against any loss  liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal  premium  if any  or interest when due  no holder of debt securities of any series may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the debt securities of that series unless: (1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default with respect to the debt securities of that series is continuing; (2) holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such holders have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss  liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series have not given the Trustee a direction that  in the opinion of the Trustee  is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions  the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series have the right to direct the time  method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to that series of debt securities. The Trustee  however  may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder of debt securities of that series or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Indenture provides that if a Default (that is  an event that is  or after notice or the passage of time would be  an Event of Default) with respect to the debt securities of a particular series occurs and is continuing and is known to the Trustee  the Trustee must mail to each holder of debt securities of that series notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of  premium  if any  or interest on the debt securities of that series  the Trustee may withhold notice  but only if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the holders of debt securities of that series. In addition  the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee  within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year  an officers' certificate as to compliance with all covenants in the Indenture and indicating whether the 14 signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer also is required to deliver to the Trustee  within 30 days after the occurrence thereof  an officers' certificate specifying any Default or Event of Default  its status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. Amendments and Waivers Amendments of the Indenture may be made by the Issuer  the Guarantor and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of all debt securities of each series affected thereby then outstanding under the Indenture (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the debt securities). However  without the consent of each holder of outstanding debt securities affected thereby  no amendment may  among other things: (1) reduce the percentage in principal amount of debt securities whose holders must consent to an amendment; (2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any debt securities; (3) reduce the principal of or extend the stated maturity of any debt securities; (4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any debt securities or change the time at which any debt securities may be redeemed; (5) make any debt securities payable in money other than that stated in the debt securities; (6) impair the right of any holder to receive payment of  premium  if any  principal of and interest on such holder's debt securities on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder's debt securities; (7) make any change in the amendment provisions which require each holder's consent or in the waiver provisions; (8) release any security that may have been granted in respect of the debt securities; or (9) release the Guarantor or modify the Guarantee in any manner adverse to the holders. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series affected thereby  may waive compliance by the Issuer and the Guarantor with certain restrictive covenants on behalf of all holders of debt securities of such series  including those described under ""-Certain Covenants-Limitations on Liens"" and ""-Certain Covenants-Restriction on Sale-Leasebacks."" The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series affected thereby  on behalf of all such holders  may waive any past Default or Event of Default with respect to that series (including any such waiver obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the debt securities)  except a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal  premium or interest or in respect of a provision that under the Indenture that cannot be amended without the consent of all holders of the series of debt securities that is affected. Without the consent of any holder  the Issuer  the Guarantor and the Trustee may amend the Indenture to: (1) cure any ambiguity  omission  defect or inconsistency; (2) provide for the assumption by a successor of the obligations of the Guarantor or the Issuer under the Indenture; (3) provide for uncertificated debt securities in addition to or in place of certificated debt securities (provided that the uncertificated debt securities are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended (the ""Internal Revenue Code"")  or in a manner such that the uncertificated debt securities are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code); 15 (4) add or release guarantees by any Subsidiary with respect to the debt securities  in either case as provided in the Indenture; (5) secure the debt securities or a guarantee; (6) add to the covenants of the Guarantor or the Issuer for the benefit of the holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Guarantor or the Issuer; (7) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder; (8) comply with any requirement of the Commission in connection with the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act; and (9) issue any other series of debt securities under the Indenture. The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. After an amendment requiring consent of the holders becomes effective  the Issuer is required to mail to the holders of an affected series a notice briefly describing such amendment. However  the failure to give such notice to all such holders  or any defect therein  will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment. Defeasance and Discharge The Issuer at any time may terminate all its obligations under the Indenture as they relate to a series of debt securities (""legal defeasance"")  except for certain obligations  including those respecting the defeasance trust and obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the debt securities of that series  to replace mutilated  destroyed  lost or stolen debt securities of that series and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of such debt securities. The Issuer at any time may terminate its obligations under covenants described under ""-Certain Covenants"" (other than ""Merger  Consolidation or Sale of Assets"") and the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Guarantor  and the Guarantee provision  described under ""-Events of Default"" above with respect to a series of debt securities (""covenant defeasance""). The Issuer may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option  payment of the defeased series of debt securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option  payment of the affected series of debt securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3)  (4)  (with respect only to the Guarantor) or (5) under ""-Events of Default"" above. If the Issuer exercises either its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option  each guarantee will terminate with respect to the debt securities of the defeased series and any security that may have been granted with respect to such debt securities will be released. In order to exercise either defeasance option  the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the ""defeasance trust"") with the Trustee money  U.S. Government Obligations (as defined in the Indenture) or a combination thereof for the payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on the relevant series of debt securities to redemption or maturity  as the case may be  and must comply with certain other conditions  including delivery to the Trustee of an opinion of counsel (subject to customary exceptions and exclusions) to the effect that holders of that series of debt securities will not recognize income  gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred. In the case of legal defeasance only  such opinion of counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") or other change in applicable federal income tax law. 16 In the event of any legal defeasance  holders of the debt securities of the relevant series would be entitled to look only to the trust fund for payment of principal of and any premium and interest on their debt securities until maturity. Although the amount of money and U.S. Government Obligations on deposit with the Trustee would be intended to be sufficient to pay amounts due on the debt securities of a defeased series at the time of their stated maturity  if the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option for the debt securities of any series and the debt securities are declared due and payable because of the occurrence of an Event of Default  such amount may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the debt securities of that series at the time of the acceleration resulting from such Event of Default. The Issuer would remain liable for such payments  however. In addition  the Issuer may discharge all its obligations under the Indenture with respect to debt securities of any series  other than its obligation to register the transfer of and exchange notes of that series  provided that it either: • delivers all outstanding debt securities of that series to the Trustee for cancellation; or • all such debt securities not so delivered for cancellation have either become due and payable or will become due and payable at their stated maturity within one year or are called for redemption within one year  and in the case of this bullet point the Issuer has deposited with the Trustee in trust an amount of cash sufficient to pay the entire indebtedness of such debt securities  including interest to the stated maturity or applicable redemption date. Subordination Debt securities of a series may be subordinated to our Senior Indebtedness  which we define generally to include all notes or other evidences of indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer  including guarantees  that are not expressly subordinate or junior in right of payment to any other indebtedness of the Issuer. Subordinated debt securities and the Guarantor's guarantee thereof will be subordinate in right of payment  to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture and the prospectus supplement relating to such series  to the prior payment of all indebtedness of the Issuer and Guarantor that is designated as ""Senior Indebtedness"" with respect to the series. The holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer will receive payment in full of the Senior Indebtedness before holders of subordinated debt securities will receive any payment of principal  premium or interest with respect to the subordinated debt securities: • upon any payment of distribution of our assets of the Issuer to its creditors; • upon a total or partial liquidation or dissolution of the Issuer; or • in a bankruptcy  receivership or similar proceeding relating to the Issuer or its property. Until the Senior Indebtedness is paid in full  any distribution to which holders of subordinated debt securities would otherwise be entitled will be made to the holders of Senior Indebtedness  except that such holders may receive units representing limited partner interests and any debt securities that are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness to at least the same extent as the subordinated debt securities. If the Issuer does not pay any principal  premium or interest with respect to Senior Indebtedness within any applicable grace period (including at maturity)  or any other default on Senior Indebtedness occurs and the maturity of the Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms  the Issuer may not: • make any payments of principal  premium  if any  or interest with respect to subordinated debt securities; • make any deposit for the purpose of defeasance of the subordinated debt securities; or 17 • repurchase  redeem or otherwise retire any subordinated debt securities  except that in the case of subordinated debt securities that provide for a mandatory sinking fund  we may deliver subordinated debt securities to the Trustee in satisfaction of our sinking fund obligation  unless  in either case  • the default has been cured or waived and the declaration of acceleration has been rescinded; • the Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash; or • the Issuer and the Trustee receive written notice approving the payment from the representatives of each issue of ""Designated Senior Indebtedness."" Generally  ""Designated Senior Indebtedness"" will include: • indebtedness for borrowed money under a bank credit agreement  called ""Bank Indebtedness""; and • any specified issue of Senior Indebtedness of at least $100 million. During the continuance of any default  other than a default described in the immediately preceding paragraph  that may cause the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness to be accelerated immediately without further notice  other than any notice required to effect such acceleration  or the expiration of any applicable grace periods  the Issuer may not pay the subordinated debt securities for a period called the ""Payment Blockage Period."" A Payment Blockage Period will commence on the receipt by us and the Trustee of written notice of the default  called a ""Blockage Notice "" from the representative of any Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period. The Payment Blockage Period may be terminated before its expiration: • by written notice from the person or persons who gave the Blockage Notice; • by repayment in full in cash of the Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Blockage Notice was given; or • if the default giving rise to the Payment Blockage Period is no longer continuing. Unless the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of the Senior Indebtedness  we may resume payments on the subordinated debt securities after the expiration of the Payment Blockage Period. Generally  not more than one Blockage Notice may be given in any period of 360 consecutive days unless the first Blockage Notice within the 360-day period is given by holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness  other than Bank Indebtedness  in which case the representative of the Bank Indebtedness may give another Blockage Notice within the period. The total number of days during which any one or more Payment Blockage Periods are in effect  however  may not exceed an aggregate of 179 days during any period of 360 consecutive days. After all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full and until the subordinated debt securities are paid in full  holders of the subordinated debt securities shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness. By reason of the subordination  in the event of insolvency  our creditors who are holders of Senior Indebtedness  as well as certain of our general creditors  may recover more  ratably  than the holders of the subordinated debt securities. Form and Denomination Unless otherwise indicated in a prospectus supplement  the debt securities of a series will be issued as Registered Securities in denominations of $1 000 and any integral multiple thereof. 18 Book-Entry System Unless otherwise indicated in a prospectus supplement  we will issue the debt securities in the form of one or more global securities in fully registered form initially in the name of Cede & Co.  as nominee of The Depository Trust Company (""DTC"")  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. Unless otherwise indicated in a prospectus supplement  the global securities will be deposited with the Trustee as custodian for DTC and may not be transferred except as a whole by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC or by DTC or any nominee to a successor of DTC or a nominee of such successor. DTC has advised us as follows: • DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law  a ""banking organization"" within the meaning of the New York Banking Law  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a ""clearing corporation"" within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code  and a ""clearing agency"" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  as amended (the ""Exchange Act""). • DTC holds securities that its participants deposit with DTC and facilitates the post-trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities  such as transfers and pledges  through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants' accounts  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. • Direct participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations and certain other organizations. • DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (""DTCC""). DTCC is the holding company for DTC  National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation  all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. • Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant  either directly or indirectly. • The rules applicable to DTC and its direct and indirect participants are on file with the Commission. Purchases of debt securities under the DTC system must be made by or through direct participants  which will receive a credit for the debt securities on DTC's records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of debt securities is in turn to be recorded on the direct and indirect participants' records. Beneficial owners of the debt securities will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase  but beneficial owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction  as well as periodic statements of their holdings  from the direct or indirect participant through which the beneficial owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the debt securities are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of direct and indirect participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners. Beneficial owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in the debt securities  except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the debt securities is discontinued. To facilitate subsequent transfers  all debt securities deposited by direct participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC's partnership nominee  Cede & Co.  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of debt securities with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the debt securities; DTC's records reflect only the identity of the direct participants to whose accounts such debt securities are credited  which may or may not be the beneficial owners. The direct and indirect participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. 19 Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to direct participants  by  direct participants to indirect participants  and by direct participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among them  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the global securities. Under its usual procedures  DTC mails an omnibus proxy to the issuer as soon as possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy assigns Cede & Co.'s consenting or voting rights to those direct participants to whose accounts the debt securities are credited on the record date (identified in the listing attached to the omnibus proxy). All payments on the global securities will be made to Cede & Co.  as holder of record  or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC's practice is to credit direct participants' accounts upon DTC's receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from us or the Trustee on payment dates in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC's records. Payments by participants to beneficial owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices  as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in ""street name "" and will be the responsibility of such participant and not of DTC  us or the Trustee  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) shall be the responsibility of us or the Trustee. Disbursement of such payments to direct participants shall be the responsibility of DTC  and disbursement of such payments to the beneficial owners shall be the responsibility of direct and indirect participants. DTC may discontinue providing its service as securities depositary with respect to the debt securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to us or the Trustee. In addition  we may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depositary). Under such circumstances  in the event that a successor securities depositary is not obtained  note certificates in fully registered form are required to be printed and delivered to beneficial owners of the global securities representing such debt securities. Neither we nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or obligation to direct or indirect participants  or the persons for whom they act as nominees  with respect to the accuracy of the records of DTC  its nominee or any participant with respect to any ownership interest in the debt securities  or payments to  or the providing of notice to participants or beneficial owners. So long as the debt securities are in DTC's book-entry system  secondary market trading activity in the debt securities will settle in immediately available funds. All payments on the debt securities issued as global securities will be made by us in immediately available funds. The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC's book-entry system has been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable  but we take no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Limitations on Issuance of Bearer Securities The debt securities of a series may be issued as Registered Securities (which will be registered as to principal and interest in the register maintained by the registrar for the debt securities) or Bearer Securities (which will be transferable only by delivery). If the debt securities are issuable as Bearer Securities  certain special limitations and conditions will apply. In compliance with United States federal income tax laws and regulations  we and any underwriter  agent or dealer participating in an offering of Bearer Securities will agree that  in connection with the original issuance of the Bearer Securities and during the period ending 40 days after the issue date  they will not offer  sell or deliver any such Bearer Securities  directly or indirectly  to a United States Person (as defined below) or to any person within the United States  except to the extent permitted under United States Treasury regulations. 20 Bearer Securities will bear a legend to the following effect: ""Any United States person who holds this obligation will be subject to limitations under the United States federal income tax laws  including the limitations provided in Sections 165(j) and 1287(a) of the Internal Revenue Code."" The sections referred to in the legend provide that  with certain exceptions  a United States taxpayer who holds Bearer Securities will not be allowed to deduct any loss with respect to  and will not be eligible for capital gain treatment with respect to any gain realized on the sale  exchange  redemption or other disposition of  the Bearer Securities. For this purpose  ""United States"" includes the United States of America and its possessions  and ""United States person"" means a citizen or resident of the United States  a corporation  partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States  or an estate or trust the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source. Pending the availability of a definitive global security or individual Bearer Securities  as the case may be  debt securities that are issuable as Bearer Securities may initially be represented by a single temporary global security  without interest coupons  to be deposited with a common depositary for the Euroclear System as operated by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (""Euroclear"") and Clearstream Banking S.A. (""Clearstream""  formerly Cedelbank)  for credit to the accounts designated by or on behalf of the purchasers thereof. Following the availability of a definitive global security in bearer form  without coupons attached  or individual Bearer Securities and subject to any further limitations described in the applicable prospectus supplement  the temporary global security will be exchangeable for interests in the definitive global security or for the individual Bearer Securities  respectively  only upon receipt of a ""Certificate of Non-U.S. Beneficial Ownership "" which is a certificate to the effect that a beneficial interest in a temporary global security is owned by a person that is not a United States Person or is owned by or through a financial institution in compliance with applicable United States Treasury regulations. No Bearer Security will be delivered in or to the United States. If so specified in the applicable prospectus supplement  interest on a temporary global security will be paid to each of Euroclear and Clearstream with respect to that portion of the temporary global security held for its account  but only upon receipt as of the relevant interest payment date of a Certificate of Non-U.S. Beneficial Ownership. No Recourse Against General Partner The Guarantor's general partner and its directors  officers  employees and members  as such  shall have no liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantor under the debt securities  the Indenture or the guarantee or for any claim based on  in respect of  or by reason of  such obligations or their creation. Each holder by accepting a note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the debt securities. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws  and it is the view of the Commission that such a waiver is against public policy. Concerning the Trustee The Indenture contains certain limitations on the right of the Trustee  should it become our creditor  to obtain payment of claims in certain cases  or to realize for its own account on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee is permitted to engage in certain other transactions. However  if it acquires any conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act  it must eliminate the conflict or resign as Trustee. The holders of a majority in principal amount of all outstanding debt securities (or if more than one series of debt securities under the Indenture is affected thereby  all series so affected  voting as a single class) will have the right to direct the time  method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy or power available to the Trustee for the debt securities or all such series so affected. If an Event of Default occurs and is not cured under the Indenture and is known to the Trustee  the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by the Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill 21 in its exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions  the Trustee will not be under any obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any of the holders of debt securities unless they shall have offered to such Trustee reasonable security and indemnity. U.S. Bank National Association is the Trustee under the Indenture for the 3.300% Senior Notes due 2053 issued on September 15  2021 and any series of debt securities issued after such notes and has been appointed by the Issuer as Registrar and Paying Agent with regard to such debt securities. U.S. Bank National Association is a lender under the Issuer's credit facilities. Governing Law The Indenture  the debt securities and the guarantee are governed by  and will be construed in accordance with  the laws of the State of New York. 22 Attachments Original LinkOriginal DocumentPermalink Disclaimer Enterprise Products Partners LP published this content on 05 January 2023 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)° is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)° is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

Given the unprecedented number of otherwise healthy infants who have been hospitalized with RSV this year in the US and the recurrent pattern of RSV epidemics year after year  it is our intention to make nirsevimab available  if approved in time  for the 2023/2024 season to help alleviate the burden of RSV on families and the healthcare system.”RSV is a very contagious virus that can lead to serious respiratory illness  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).10 In the US  RSV is the leading cause of hospitalisation for babies under one.11 Any infant can be hospitalized in their first RSV season: about 75% of infants hospitalized for RSV in the U.S. are born at term  with no underlying conditions.12-14 The current 2022/23 RSV season has placed a particularly high burden on infants and families in the United Stated with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) requesting the White House declare an emergency to support the national response to the alarming surge of pediatric hospitalizations due to RSV and influenza.Story continuesDr William MullerAssociate Professor  Pediatrics  Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Scientific Director  Clinical and Community Trials  Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago  Illinois""A substantial burden of disease from RSV affects infants  families  and healthcare providers every year. Effective interventions to prevent RSV are a critical need. This year in the US  we’ve seen first-hand how frightening the impact of this respiratory disease is on our patients and how stressful it is on the healthcare system  highlighting the urgency of addressing this problem.""The submission was based on results from the Phase 3 MELODY  Phase 2/3 MEDLEY and Phase2b trials.1-8 Results across the MELODY and Phase 2b trials showed that nirsevimab demonstrated consistent protection of approximately 80%  against medically attended RSV disease with a single dose.1-5In these trials  nirsevimab helped protect an all-infant population (including healthy term  late preterm  and preterm infants  as well as infants with specific health conditions) against RSV disease requiring medical care  including physician office  urgent care  emergency room visits and hospitalizations  through the duration of the RSV season.1-8 The safety profile of nirsevimab was similar to placebo. Nirsevimab also demonstrated a comparable safety and tolerability profile to palivizumab in the Phase 2/3 MEDLEY trial.7-9About nirsevimabIn the U.S.  nirsevimab is an investigational single-dose long-acting antibody designed to help protect all infants from birth through their first RSV season and for children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season.Nirsevimab has been developed to offer newborns and infants direct RSV protection via an antibody to help prevent lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused by RSV. Monoclonal antibodies do not require the activation of the immune system to help offer timely  rapid and direct protection against disease.15In March 2017  Sanofi and AstraZeneca announced an agreement to develop and commercialize nirsevimab. Under the terms of the agreement  AstraZeneca leads all development and manufacturing activities and Sanofi leads commercialization activities and records revenues. Under the terms of the global agreement  Sanofi made an upfront payment of €120m  has paid a development milestone of €30m and will pay up to a further €465m upon achievement of certain development and sales-related milestones. The two companies share all costs and profits.Nirsevimab has been granted designations to facilitate expedited development by several regulatory agencies around the world. These include Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the China Center for Drug Evaluation under the National Medical Products Administration; Breakthrough Therapy Designati on from the FDA; access granted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIority MEdicines scheme; Promising Innovative Medicine designation by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; and named “a medicine for prioritized development” under the Project for Drug Selection to Promote New Drug Development in Pediatrics by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED). Nirsevimab was approved by the European Commission in October 2022  and by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in November 2022.16 17About the clinical trialsThe Phase 2b trial was a randomized  placebo-controlled trial designed to measure the efficacy of nirsevimab against medically attended LRTI through 150 days post-dose. Healthy preterm infants of 29–<35 weeks’ gestation (n= 1 453) were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50mg intramuscular injection of nirsevimab (n= 969) or placebo (n= 484) at the RSV season start.3 4 The primary endpoint was met  significantly reducing the incidence of medically attended LRTI caused by RSV by 70.1% (95% CI: 52.3  81.2) compared to placebo.3 4 The proposed dosing regimen was recommended based on further exploration of the Phase 2b data.3 When considering the dosing regimen recommended for approval in this study  nirsevimab reduced the incidence of medically attended LRTI caused by RSV by 86.2% (95% CI: 68.0  94.0) in gestational age ≥29 to <35 weeks. 3 4 The subsequent Phase 3 study  MELODY  applied the recommended dosing regimen.1 2The Phase 3 MELODY (primary cohort) trial was a randomized  placebo-controlled trial conducted across 21 countries designed to determine efficacy of nirsevimab against medically attended LRTI due to RSV confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing through 150 days after dosing  versus placebo  in healthy late preterm and term infants (35 weeks gestational age or greater) entering their first RSV season.1 2 The primary endpoint was met  significantly reducing the incidence of medically attended LRTI  such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia  caused by RSV compared to placebo.1 2 Infants were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50mg (in infants weighing <5kg) or 100mg (in infants weighing ≥5kg) intramuscular injection of nirsevimab or placebo.1 2Following the analysis of the initial 1 490 infants within the MELODY primary cohort additional infants continued to be enrolled. A total of 3 012 healthy late preterm and term infants (35 weeks gestational age or greater) entering their first RSV season were randomized to receive nirsevimab (n=2 009) or placebo (n=1 003). In the exploratory analysis  a single 50mg (in infants weighing <5kg) or 100mg (in infants weighing ≥5kg) intramuscular injection of nirsevimab reduced the incidence of medically attended LRTI caused by RSV through 150 days after dosing by 76.4% (95%: CI 62.3  85.2) compared to placebo  with an acceptable safety profile. Further  nirsevimab demonstrated a 76.8% (95%: CI 49.4  89.4) reduction in the risk of RSV LRTI with hospitalization through 150 days after dosing compared to placebo.MEDLEY was a Phase 2/3  randomized  double-blind  palivizumab-controlled trial with the primary objective of assessing safety and tolerability for nirsevimab in preterm infants and infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) and/or chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) eligible to receive palivizumab.7 8 Between July 2019 and May 2021  approximately 918 infants entering their first RSV season were randomized to receive a single 50mg (in infants weighing <5kg) or 100mg (in infants weighing ≥5kg) intramuscular injection of nirsevimab or palivizumab. Safety was assessed by monitoring the occurrence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment emergent severe adverse events (TESAEs) through 360 days post-dose.7 8 Serum levels of nirsevimab following dosing (on day 151) in this trial were comparable with those observed in the Phase 3 MELODY trial  indicating similar protection in this population to that in the healthy term and late preterm infants is likely.7The safety profile of nirsevimab was similar to palivizumab in the MEDLEY Phase 2/3 and consistent with the safety profile in term and preterm infants studied in the MELODY Phase 3 trial compared to placebo.1-4 7 8 The most commonly reported adverse reactions were: rash 14 days post-dose  (the majority of which were mild to moderate); pyrexia (fever) within 7 days post-dose; non-serious injection site reactions within 7 days post-dose.16Findings from the nirsevimab clinical trial program included a pre-specified pooled analysis of the Phase 3 MELODY trial (primary cohort) and the recommended dose from the Phase 2b trial  in which a relative risk reduction of 79.5% versus placebo (95% CI 65.9  87.7; P<0.0001) was seen against medically attended LRTI  such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia  caused by RSV in infants born at term or preterm entering their first RSV season.5 This analysis also showed a relative risk reduction of 77.3% (95% CI 50.3  89.7; P<0.001) against RSV LRTI hospitalizations.5About RSVRSV is a very contagious virus that can lead to serious respiratory illness for infants  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).10 In the U.S.  RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants under 12 months.11 Approximately 75% of infants hospitalized for RSV are born at term with no underlying conditions.12-14 RSV symptoms can include runny nose  coughing  sneezing  fever  decrease in appetite  and wheezing.10 Each year RSV infection leads to approximately 500 000 emergency department visits by children under 5 years of age  which represents 1 in 4 of all RSV-related doctor visits  according to the CDC.18About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

15993,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4568194-international-wide-moat-stocks-sale-january-2023-heat-map,International Wide-Moat Stocks On Sale - The January 2023 Heat Map,Our 3-step process focuses on wide-moat stocks (as per Morningstar’s rating). Here are some candidates that may be worth your time for further analysis.,ValeryEgorovStep One: Wide-moat stocks with 5-star and 4-star ratingsHistorical evidence says that while quality alone is a poor indicator of outperformance  when combined with a decent valuation filter  Morningstar’s moat rating proves to be more than useful. Based on the available data  stocks with a wide-moat rating that also fit into the 4- or 5-star category deserve to be the subject of further analysis. See the detailed explanation and the underlying evidence of our first step in this article.We focus on those companies that are covered by a Morningstar analyst as assigning a wide-moat rating without thorough analysis is a questionable practice in our opinion. As of January 5  there were 70 international wide-moat stocks meeting our criteria (unchanged from last month).Only 11.4% (8 stocks) of this wide-moat group earned a 5-star (most attractive) valuation rating. Here are they:Company Name Ticker Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV BUD Roche Holding AG OTCQX:RHHBY Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co TSM Tencent Holdings Ltd OTCPK:TCEHY Yum China Holdings Inc YUMC Bayer AG OTCPK:BAYRY Barry Callebaut AG OTCPK:BYCBF Click to enlargeWe believe that the percentage of 5-star-rated wide-moat stocks is a good indicator of market sentiment. When this percentage is high  even the best companies are on sale. When the percentage is extremely low  market conditions may warrant caution. (Please note that this is not an indicator for market timing!)Data from Morningstar. Dataset after 12/2022 only contains international stocks.As these best of breed companies may be worth a closer look even when they are just slightly cheaper than their fair value but are not in the bargain bin  we also list the 4-star-rated wide-moat stocks as of January 5:Company Name Ticker JD.com Inc JD Medtronic plc MDT Schindler Holding AG OTCPK:SHLAF Baidu Inc BIDU GSK plc GSK ASML Holding NV ASML James Hardie Industries plc JHX ABB Ltd ABB Adyen NV OTCPK:ADYEY Airbus SE OTCPK:EADSY Allegion plc ALLE Ambev SA ABEV Brambles Ltd OTCPK:BMBLF British American Tobacco plc BTI Core Laboratories NV CLB Experian plc OTCQX:EXPGF Geberit AG OTCPK:GBERY Imperial Brands PLC OTCQX:IMBBY MercadoLibre Inc MELI Reckitt Benckiser Group plc OTCPK:RBGPF Safran SA OTCPK:SAFRF Sanofi SA SNY The Toronto-Dominion Bank TD Royal Bank of Canada RY Deutsche Boerse AG OTCPK:DBOEY Novozymes A/S B OTCPK:NVZMF Click to enlargeAll in all  we have 34 firms that pass our very first criteria.Data from Morningstar. Dataset after 12/2022 only contains international stocks.Step Two: Historical Valuation in the EVA FrameworkWe believe that the most widely used valuation multiples are terribly flawed. See this article on why we consider the Future Growth Reliance metric the best-of-breed sentiment indicator that addresses accounting distortions  thus gives us a true picture of which wide-moat companies seem attractively valued in historical terms. We want to buy our top-quality targets when the baked-in expectations are low  since that is when surprising on the upside has the highest probability. As investment is a game of probabilities  all we can do is stack the odds in our favor as much as possible.16 of the 34 stocks survived this second step. Here’s the list:Company Name Ticker Ambev SA ABEV Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV BUD Barry Callebaut AG OTCPK:BYCBF Bayer AG OTCPK:BAYRY Brambles Ltd OTCPK:BMBLF Experian plc OTCQX:EXPGF Geberit AG OTCPK:GBERY James Hardie Industries plc JHX MercadoLibre Inc MELI Novozymes A/S B OTCPK:NVZMF Reckitt Benckiser Group plc OTCPK:RBGPF Roche Holding AG OTCQX:RHHBY Royal Bank of Canada RY Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co TSM Tencent Holdings Ltd OTCPK:TCEHY The Toronto-Dominion Bank TD Click to enlargeWe are rather strict when it comes to historical valuation. There are stocks that unquestionably fail both our short- and long-term tests. There are some targets  however  that may look attractively valued if you only focus on the short-term (like the last 5 years)  but the longer you zoom out  the more you lose your appetite. It comes down to personal preference where you draw the line. For us  only those stocks are allowed to appear on the heat map in our third step that seem attractively valued in both a short-term and long-term context. (We go back as far as 20 years  calculate averages and medians on different time frames and let our algorithm do the ruthless work.)Step Three: The Heat Map of the most investable wide-moat stocksSeeing the stocks of our shortlist on a heat map with a quality and valuation axis is something that can prove very useful when we need to make a decision on which candidates to analyze thoroughly. As explained in our previous article  we use the PRVit (Performance-Risk-Valuation investment technology) model of the EVA Dimensions team.All in all  PRVit is a multifactor quantitative stock selection model based on EVA-centric measures of Performance  Risk  and Valuation. It first estimates the fundamental value of a company based on its risk-adjusted EVA performance (shown on the vertical axis) and then compares it to its actual valuation (shown on the horizontal axis). All factors in this model were chosen heuristically based on common sense  and not by data mining  yet strong and statistically significant backtests prove the soundness of the PRVit approach both in the U.S. and globally. (See the details here.)Here is the heat map as of January 5:Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.We also present the results in a table format to make your decision easier.Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.  Morningstar(Stocks highlighted in light blue are Morningstar’s 5-star-rated international wide-moat names that survived the second step of our process.)In PRVit  the factors are grouped into three categories: Performance  Risk  and Valuation. Each company has a composite 0-100 score in each category  where higher is better for Performance and lower is better for Risk and Valuation. We believe that stocks in the upper quintile of the PRVit ranking (with a PRVit score above 80) are worth a closer look.We plan to run this three-step process on a monthly basis and publish the shortlist of targets it produces.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

During this time  Archer has leveraged Stellantis' deep manufacturing  supply chain  and design expertise in connection with Archer's efforts to design  develop  and commercialize its eVTOL aircraft.Stellantis N.V. (NYSE / MTA / Euronext Paris: STLA) and Archer Aviation Inc. (NYSE: ACHR) have agreed to significantly expand their partnership by joining forces to manufacture Archer's flagship electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft  Midnight.Stellantis will work with Archer to stand up Archer's recently announced manufacturing facility in Covington  Georgia at which the companies plan to begin manufacturing the Midnight aircraft in 2024. Midnight is designed to be safe  sustainable  quiet and  with its expected payload of over 1 000 pounds  can carry four passengers plus a pilot. With a range of 100 miles  Midnight is optimized for back-to-back short distance trips of around 20 miles  with a charging time of approximately 10 minutes in-between.This unique partnership in the urban air mobility industry will leverage each company's respective strengths and competencies to bring the Midnight aircraft to market. Archer brings its world-class team of eVTOL  electric powertrain and certification experts while Stellantis will contribute advanced manufacturing technology and expertise  experienced personnel and capital to the partnership.This combination is intended to enable the rapid scaling of aircraft production to meet Archer's commercialization plans  while allowing Archer to strengthen its path to commercialization by helping it avoid hundreds of millions of dollars of spending during the manufacturing ramp up phase. The goal is for Stellantis to mass produce Archer's eVTOL aircraft as its exclusive contract manufacturer.As a further sign of its commitment  Stellantis will provide up to $150 million in equity capital for potential draw by Archer at its discretion in 2023 and 2024  subject to achievement of certain business milestones which Archer expects to occur in 2023. Stellantis also intends to increase its strategic shareholding through future purchases of Archer stock in the open market. These actions  along with the other elements of this expanded partnership  will enable Stellantis to become a long-term  cornerstone investor in Archer.""We've been working closely with Archer for the past two years  and I am continually impressed by their ingenuity and unwavering commitment to deliver "" said Carlos Tavares  Stellantis CEO.""Deepening our partnership with Archer as a strategic investor with plans for growing our shareholding demonstrates how Stellantis is pushing the boundaries to provide sustainable freedom of mobility  from the road to the sky. Supporting Archer with our manufacturing expertise is another example of how Stellantis will lead the way the world moves.""""Stellantis' continued recognition of Archer's progress toward commercialization  and today's commitment of significant resources to build the Midnight aircraft with us  places Archer in a strong position to be first to market "" said Adam Goldstein  founder and CEO of Archer. ""Our two companies are taking these important steps together to realize a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine urban transportation.""Stellantis has been a strategic partner to Archer since 2020 through various collaboration initiatives  and as an investor since 2021.

It has been engineered to express human IL-12  a cytokine that triggers a powerful antitumor immune response  and a full length anti-CTLA4 antibody.By selectively targeting tumor cells and expressing IL-12 and the anti-CTLA4 antibody in the tumor microenvironment  TG6050 is expected to elicit a powerful and multi-pronged antitumor response. A short video detailing the mechanism of action can be found here.TG6050 has been designed to be administered intravenously  a route of administration that has been demonstrated to be safe and feasible with an Invir.IO™ based OV. Intravenous administration will significantly enhance the therapeutic and market potential of this OV as it allows a more targeted approach to many internal cancer lesions and metastases inaccessible by intratumoral injection. Intratumoral injection  where the drug is injected directly into the tumor  is currently the only approved route of administration for an oncolytic virus. IV administration would represent a significant advantage.The Delivir trial will enroll up to 36 patients with advanced NSCLC who have failed standard therapeutic options  including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). TG6050 is expected to overcome tumor resistance by the initiation of an antitumor response through multiple mechanisms of action that include oncolysis  the induction of an immune response and high intra-tumoral concentrations of IL-12 and anti-CTLA4 antibody. The IV route is considered the most appropriate route of administration for this patient population with disseminated disease and multiple overt and occult metastases.Hedi Ben Brahim  CEO of Transgene commented: “TG6050 is an exciting new asset within Transgene’s growing oncolytic virus pipeline  and further demonstrates the ability of our Invir.IO™ platform to generate highly targeted immuno-oncology drugs. These multi-armed drug candidates are expected to have significant advantages over existing therapies. Acting like a Trojan horse  they induce the production of potent therapies such as IL-12 directly in the tumor. The goal: to achieve high concentrations of these drugs only in the tumor  for improved efficacy and fewer side effects compared to systemic administration of these drugs. Intravenous administration addresses a broader range of patients with solid tumors who are not suitable for intratumoral administration. IV administration has the potential to improve the outcomes of patients with advanced lung cancer patients who are in great need of new treatment options.This CTA approval is an important milestone for Transgene  and we look forward to the first patient being recruited and providing further updates on TG6050’s clinical development.”The first patient is expected to be enrolled in this multicenter trial in the first half of 2023.***About the Delivir trialThe Delivir trial is a multicenter  open label  dose-escalation Phase I trial evaluating TG6050 as a single agent. The trial will enroll up to 36 patients with metastatic/advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  who have failed standard therapeutic options including immunotherapies such as ICIs. Patients will receive single and repeated escalating doses of TG6050 administered intravenously  to determine the recommended dose and best schedule of administration for subsequent clinical development.About TG6050TG6050 is an oncolytic virus developed with Transgene’s Invir.IO™ platform for intravenous administration. Invir.IO™’s viruses are based on the patented large capacity Vaccinia virus Copenhagen strain genetically modified with the double deletion TK-RR- (VV COP TK-RR-). TG6050 has been engineered to encode human IL-12  a cytokine that triggers a powerful antitumor immune response and a full length anti-CTLA4 antibody. It has also been optimized with the deletion of the gene encoding for the M2L viral protein that targets CD80 and CD86  two ligands of CTLA4 [source: Kleinpeter et al.  J Virol. 2019 Jun 1; 93(11): e00207-19]. The use of an oncolytic virus to deliver these immunotherapies locally and selectively in the tumor microenvironment allows high intratumoral concentrations of both therapeutic proteins eliciting a stronger and more effective antitumor response. By reducing systemic exposure to a very low level  this local therapeutic activity furthermore allows to increase the safety and tolerability profile of IL-12 and the anti-CTLA4 antibody.It will be evaluated in the Delivir trial  a Phase I trial conducted in advanced NSCLC patients.About TransgeneTransgene (Euronext: TNG) is a biotechnology company focused on designing and developing targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Transgene’s programs utilize viral vector technology with the goal of indirectly or directly killing cancer cells.The Company’s clinical-stage programs consist of two therapeutic vaccines (TG4001 for the treatment of HPV-positive cancers  and TG4050  the first individualized therapeutic vaccine based on the myvac® platform) as well as three oncolytic viruses based on the Invir.IO™ viral backbone (TG6002  BT-001 and TG6050).With Transgene’s myvac® platform  therapeutic vaccination enters the field of precision medicine with a novel immunotherapy that is fully tailored to each individual. The myvac® approach allows the generation of a virus-based immunotherapy that encodes patient-specific mutations identified and selected by Artificial Intelligence capabilities provided by its partner NEC.With its proprietary platform Invir.IO™  Transgene is building on its viral vector engineering expertise to design a new generation of multifunctional oncolytic viruses.

However  given the weight of the Benefit & Rewards activity in Brazil  and the high level of its margins relative to the Group  when the Brazilian real declines against the euro  it has a negative effect on the underlying operating margin due to a change in the mix of margins.

This valuation could be done in the context of a capital transaction that could eventually lead to a takeover of the Company. Pharnext currently favors an agreement with a player in the pharmaceutical industry.In this context  Pharnext has undertaken to carry out an independent financial analysis by a recognized investment research firm to determine the intrinsic value and the target share price. Edison Investment Research is familiar with the Company and has been monitoring and analyzing its financial performance since 2020. In its previous publication  dated October 19th  2022[2]  Edison wrote that the ""total valuation (of Pharnext) remains largely unchanged at €268.9m""[3].Hugo Brugière  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pharnext  commented: “Pharnext is today one of the few independent French biotech companies in P hase III development for a drug candidate that addresses an unmet medical need. I am convinced that this advanced stage represents considerable intrinsic value. I look forward to the outcome of the research note from the Edison team with whom we have engaged in a constructive dialogue. Their latest analysis which values the company at almost €270m already gives an idea of the very strong potential upside compared with the current market cap valuation. ”Edison is planning to publish an updated version of the financial analysis note by the end of Q1 2023. Research notes are available on the Pharnext and Edison websites.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases that currently lack curative and/or disease-modifying treatments.

The article extends the observations reported in Abivax’s previous publications on the Phase 2a and Phase 2b clinical trials conducted in UC  including patients who failed to respond or stopped responding to currently available therapies.The article reports that obefazimod has been observed to impact the immune system in vitro  in murine models of IBD  as well as in patients with UC. The up-regulation of a single microRNA  miR-124  in vitro shows that obefazimod’s MoA leads to decreases in proinflammatory cytokines including IL-17 and IL-6  and in the chemokine CCL2/MCP-1  thereby potentially putting “a physiological brake” on inflammation. It reverses the expression of several inflammatory cytokines without impairing host defense as it does not impact the immune response altogether. These scientific findings may explain its short- and long-term efficacy along with a favorable tolerability and safety profile which were observed during the clinical Phase 2a and Phase 2b induction and maintenance clinical trials conducted in UC patients.Prof. Hartmut J. Ehrlich  M.D.  CEO of Abivax  said: “Abivax feels very encouraged by the data published in our article and the validation and extension of obefazimod’s novel and potent anti-inflammatory mechanism of action. The data complement our scientific findings released on our clinical Phase 2a and Phase 2b induction and maintenance results which were generated with obefazimod for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The article once again supports the rationale that our lead molecule has the potential to efficiently  durably and safely treat UC patients. This specific MoA acts through the upregulation of a specific anti-inflammatory microRNA which reduces the expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Consequently  the excessive immune response leading to the chronic inflammation of the bowel may be balanced through a continued treatment with obefazimod. We believe that obefazimod has the potential to also become an effective long-term therapy for other chronic inflammatory diseases with high medical need.”About obefazimodAbivax believes obefazimod is a highly differentiated oral drug candidate  with a novel mechanism of action based on the upregulation of a single microRNA (miR-124) with potent anti-inflammatory properties. Obefazimod was shown to exert its anti-inflammatory effects through binding to the cap binding complex (“CBC”)  which sits at the 5’ end of every RNA molecule in the cell. By binding to the CBC  obefazimod reinforces the biological functions of CBC in cellular RNA biogenesis. Specifically  obefazimod enhances the selective splicing of a single long non-coding RNA to generate the anti-inflammatory microRNA  miR-124  which downregulates the translation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines like TNF-α  IL-6  CCL2/MCP-1 and IL-17  as well as Th17+ cells. This downregulation thereby potentially “puts a brake” on inflammation and suggests broad potential as a novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic agent. Laboratory analysis of the Phase 2b trial in UC at week eight showed a highly statistically significant upregulation of miR-124 in rectal tissue in all patients treated with obefazimod  compared to baseline. The median increases were 13-fold for the 25 mg group  25-fold for the 50 mg group and 25-fold for the 100 mg group  while no upregulation was observed in the placebo group (1.02-fold increase)  indicative of the positive pharmacological effect of obefazimod. Importantly  obefazimod does not impact the splicing of cellular genes.Obefazimod for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitisObefazimod is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (“ABTECT program”) with the first patient enrolled in the United States on October 11  2022.1 200 UC patients across 36 countries will take part in the pivotal Phase 3 program that consists of two induction trials (ABTECT-1 (ABX464-105) and ABTECT-2 (ABX464-106)) and a single subsequent maintenance trial (ABX464-107).The ABTECT program aims to confirm obefazimod’s potential to maintain and further improve patient-outcomes over time  as well as its favorable safety and tolerability profile  as already observed during previously conducted Phase 2a and Phase 2b clinical trials in moderate to severe UC.*****About Abivax (www.abivax.com)Abivax is a Phase 3 clinical stage biotechnology company  focused on developing therapeutics that modulate the immune system to treat patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

Today the Company announces the signing of binding commercial terms for a 15-year offtake agreement  with extension rights  with Eneco  for the entire storage capacity of the Zuidwending Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) project in the Netherlands. Eneco is a leading renewable power supplier and energy service provider in the Netherlands and Belgium  operating and expanding its activities in the UK and Germany  and is committed to accelerating the energy transition.Zuidwending is located in the Province of Groningen in the Netherlands. Corre Energy has exclusive rights to build a CAES facility using salt caverns at the site  in conjunction with its cavern development partner. The facility will have 320 Megawatts of power generating capacity  with a maximum storage discharge duration of approximately 3.5 days and a target commencement date around the end of 2026. It will be constructed as hydrogen fuel enabled from commencement.Under the terms of the arrangement  Corre Energy will construct  operate and maintain the facility and Eneco will optimise the entire output of the storage site on behalf of Corre Energy. Eneco will provide market access services  enabling Corre Energy to benefit from revenue linked to the high flexibility value of the asset  while also guaranteeing a base level of income. This is supported by the anticipated rapid growth in renewable generation capacity and Eneco's requirements for flexible energy sources to deliver its target of becoming climate-neutral by 2035.This type of facility will be an essential element  in conjunction with other energy storage solutions  in providing the flexibility required to prevent grid congestion in the Netherlands  and to ease the supply/demand balancing challenges associated with the transition from fossil-fuel generation to long-term sustainable renewable sources  such as wind and solar. CAES works alongside smaller  shorter duration lithium-ion battery installations  to cover longer duration renewable downtime  offering balancing solutions within-day and across multiple days.This is a ground-breaking partnership  with both partners fully committed to bringing this project to completion. The planned facility is progressing through the normal permitting procedures associated with an asset of this significance and  when realised  will be the first large-scale CAES facility to be constructed in Europe in almost 50 years.Keith McGrane  Chief Executive Officer of Corre Energy  commented:""We are delighted to have entered into this partnership with Eneco  a world-class energy generation and supply company  which helps to enable its strategic vision and underpins the project economics for Corre Energy. Eneco shares our deep belief in the requirement for and the value of large-scale Compressed Air Energy Storage  and it is making a very significant commitment to enable this project.It also shares Corre Energy's commitment to making a tangible contribution to the energy transition and the journey to net zero in Europe.""Zuidwending will be hydrogen fuel enabled from Day One and we expect the maturing of the hydrogen market to allow the facility to operate entirely on surplus renewable energy and green hydrogen  making an increasingly positive environmental impact.""We have made great progress over the last few years and  with the global regulatory backdrop improving rapidly and ongoing renewables build enhancing the economics of energy storage  I am confident we can deliver this game-changing project.""Kees-Jan Rameau  Chief Strategic Growth Officer for Eneco  said:""With this partnership with Corre Energy  Eneco takes another big step in further reducing CO2- emissions  and providing the flexibility required for the renewable energy system of the future. This will help solve congestion issues and pave the way for more renewable energy for our customers. This unique project will be an important contributor to our One Planet ambition and becoming climateneutral by 2035.""Corre Energy is a leader in the development and operation of Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES) projects and products  accelerating the transition to net zero and enhancing the security and flexibility of energy systems. Our projects address the increasing balancing requirements of renewable power and provide essential and cost-effective services to system operators in the form of storage and balancing services.We also unlock the value of renewables by combining hydrogen production with long duration and flexible energy storage  and by doing so we can help to deliver more affordable  green energy to customers.Eneco is an international energy company committed to accelerating the energy transition. Our One Planet Plan forms the basis for our ambition to be completely climate-neutral as early as 2035  in terms of both our own and our customers' energy consumption. This requires radical electrification  phasing out natural gas in the production and supply of energy and accelerating sustainable heat.

The trial results are highly encouraging and offer tremendous hope for all those families living with this neurodegenerative disease for which there is currently no available treatment.""In conclusion  Theranexus' Chief Medical Officer Marie Sebille added: ""We have achieved an important milestone with these Phase I/II results in CLN3 patients  enabling us to prepare the protocol of the Phase III trial to launch our pivotal clinical trial involving a pediatric cohort during 2023.""As a reminder  for the Sachs Associates 6th Annual Neuroscience Innovation Forum  to be held in San Francisco on 8 January 2023  Theranexus[1] will be presenting its latest advances on the Batten-1 program and also be participating in a roundtable discussion on the theme ""Rare and orphan diseases new modalities panel."" In addition  the company will be exhibiting at Biotech Showcase and at the same time participating in the 41st annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference bringing together key healthcare leaders.About Batten-1Batten-1 is a novel and exclusive proprietary drug containing the active ingredient miglustat. The mechanism of action of this substance blocks the accumulation of glycosphingolipids and neuroinflammation. For patients over 17 years of age in the Phase I/II trial  the product is administered in solid form. In the Phase III trial  it will be administered in a liquid form better suited to pediatric patients.Phase I/II trial design: this is an open-label trial involving 6 patients over 17 years of age with CLN3 Batten disease  treated with miglustat up to 600 mg/day for a 2-year period. The primary endpoint is patient safety and tolerability  assessed using reports of adverse effects  biological tests and ECG  as well as the pharmacokinetics of miglustat. The secondary endpoints include efficacy monitoring: Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale  visual acuity  and brain MRI and optical coherence tomography scans. Administration of Batten-1 in escalating doses with a maximum of 600 mg/day was well tolerated  with no severe side effects observed causing treatment discontinuation. The most commonly reported adverse events are reversible gastrointestinal effects of often light to moderate severity  thus demonstrating the good tolerability profile of Batten-1 in this population. Batten-1 will continue to be assessed in these patients treated over a 24-month period. Further information about the trial is available on https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT05174039.About Batten diseaseJuvenile Batten disease  also known as Spielmeyer-Vogt or CLN3 disease  is a rare  fatal  inherited disorder of the nervous system for which there is no treatment or cure. Juvenile Batten disease belongs to a group of disorders referred to as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). Over 400 different errors in 13 genes have been attributed to various forms of NCL  which differ from one another primarily by when symptoms first appear. The first symptom in the juvenile form  progressive vision loss  appears between the ages of 4 and 6 which is followed by personality changes  behavioral problems  and slowed learning. Seizures commonly appear within 2-4 years of the onset of disease. Over time  patients continue to decline mentally and physically. Eventually  those affected become wheelchair-bound  are bedridden  and die prematurely. Psychiatric symptoms or psychosis can appear at any time.Juvenile Batten disease is always fatal; usually by the late teens to early 20s. In the United States and Europe  the juvenile form is the most common of the NCLs  which together  affect nearly 3 000 patients[2]. In pathophysiological terms  interactions between neurons and glial cells play key roles in the emergence and progression of all the NCLs.About Beyond Batten Disease FoundationBeyond Batten Disease Foundation (BBDF) is the world's largest nonprofit organization dedicated to funding research for a treatment and cure for juvenile (CLN3) Batten disease. Since its inception in 2008  over $35 million has been invested in research by leveraging donations  co-funding and strategic partnerships. BBDF is spearheading a unique  cohesive strategy  incorporating independent scientific resources and collaboration with related organizations to drive research in juvenile Batten Disease[3]. Today there is a treatment in sight. BBDF funded research has discovered a drug – Batten-1 – that slows the progression of the disease in Batten models.

Healthcare was also up in particular due to a strong increase in retail sales. In Europe   organic growth was more contained at +5.9% due to the end of the Testing Centers. However  there was a strong return to the workplace across the zone as well as a recovery in the number of corporate events and tourists  particularly in Paris. The Rest of the World organic growth was +15.3% with a very solid performance in Business & Administrations in all regions despite the impact of the sporadic lockdowns in China and a particularly strong recovery in Education in India.The acceleration of the organic growth in revenues of Benefits & Rewards Services continued in the First quarter  at +23.4%.

From the second quarter  the strong momentum in Benefits & Rewards Services will continue but against a stronger comparative base.

However  given the weight of the Benefit & Rewards activity in Brazil  and the high level of its margins relative to the Group  when the Brazilian real declines against the euro  it has a negative effect on the underlying operating margin due to a change in the mix of margins. Conversely  when the Brazilian real strengthens Group margins increase.1€= AVERAGE RATEQ1 FY 2023 AVERAGE RATEQ1 FY 2022 AVERAGE RATEQ1 FY 2023VS.

16056,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.thetradenews.com/fireside-friday-with-cboe-clear-europes-tim-beckwith/,Fireside Friday with… Cboe Clear Europe’s Tim Beckwith,Head of commercial and business development at Cboe Clear Europe expects the Euronext Clearing migration to have the most impact on the post-trade space in 2023.,What will most impact the post-trade space in the next 12 months?We think the biggest single change to the clearing landscape across equities and derivatives will be the impact of Euronext’s CCP migration  moving from LSEG’s LCH SA unit to an in-house CCP called Euronext Clearing. The market hasn’t ever seen such a mass migration of clearing from one CCP to another in a mandatory form  and on such a short timeline; it is unprecedented.Everything we’ve seen in the past decade has been small exchanges making changes on the back of M&A  which has taken some time to execute or has been discretionary. The change is logical if you’re an exchange that doesn’t want to embrace true CCP interoperability and you have a CCP within the group that you want to build out  especially when you are using the services of a CCP that forms part of another exchange group. That said  the timelines Euronext has proposed are relatively aggressive.What impact will the ongoing Euronext Clearing migration project have on Cboe Clear Europe?We are able to clear cash equities on Euronext venues under the Open Access provisions in Mifir  and so the Euronext Clearing project should not change that. Whilst they haven’t adopted an interoperable model  Euronext have embraced Open Access  a provision we believe will remain untouched for cash equities in the Mifir Review  which is designed to promote the competitiveness of EU capital markets. We believe a competitive clearing environment is an essential element of achieving that – and to making EU capital markets more attractive to investors generally.Being more specific  we utilise the preferred clearing model on Euronext markets  which means both counterparties must select us if we are to clear a trade. We have seen a strong uptake of this service in the last two to three years: Last year  on the core Euronext venues outside Milan  we cleared 51.6 million trades  versus 8.9 million in 2021 – representing around 16% market share at the end of 2022. As long as we continue this upward trend  the impact will likely be that clients look to us as the main alternative to Euronext Clearing because of the concerns around the exchange group creating a new vertical silo. Clients want more clearing competition in Europe and Cboe Clear Europe has been extremely successful at bringing this about.In terms of the industry as a whole  the impact of Euronext’s plans will be significant  as they’re driving the mandatory migration of clearing from one CCP to another on an ambitious timetable. A lot of clients look at CCPs naturally as critical pieces of market infrastructure and onboarding a new one is a major initiative. Many clients will have to onboard Euronext Clearing as a new CCP in new regions and so the impact will be significant.What are some of the key regulatory topics that you expect to have an impact in 2023?There are three reviews in flight  Emir  Mifir and CSDR. Emir is probably the one that will affect us the most. We’re still reviewing the European Commission’s recent proposal in detail  but its general intent is to improve the resilience of EU CCPs and make it more attractive to clear EU products with EU-domiciled CCPs– with a particular focus on interest rate swaps. As Cboe Clear Europe doesn’t clear these products  this aspect of the proposal doesn’t affect us directly. Our priorities are to make sure the review does not impact current interoperability/pro-competition arrangements in cash equities  and to ensure the supervisory framework supports resilience and enables innovation. In Mifir  the continuation of Open Access for cash equities is our main focus and ensuring the EU continues with that philosophy. We don’t want any kind of opportunity for exchange groups to reverse what we’ve achieved in the last 10 years in terms of clearing competition. Our venue access now constitutes roughly 95% of all on-venue equity trading in Europe  which has helped us to lower post-trade costs significantly. But there are still lots of things we can do to bring further efficiencies to clients.For CSDR  we did a lot of work when it first went live at the start of 2022 where we operated a penalties collections service for the industry on late settlements. The CSDR Refit has relieved us of that collection responsibility  which in theory is a good thing and puts the onus on CSDs to control it all. The other key part of CSDR is the ongoing conversation around mandatory buy-ins which were suspended pending further discussion. There are now discussions around discretionary buy-ins  or buy-ins on certain asset classes  so we’re keeping an eye on that to see how that impacts us  especially as we were considering whether to become a buying agent under the original regime. We are seeing settlement efficiency improve. Industry efforts to comply with CSDR in the last 12 months are going in the right direction and client behaviour is improving but fines for late settlement remain high.What role do you think Brexit is playing in the recent proposals around post trade?Brexit is obviously playing a key role in post-trade markets  with the political desire to attract more clearing into the EU very evident in the Emir review. Given that  part of our focus around EMIR will be to ensure that it enhances the regulatory framework around CCPs in a manner that promotes both safety and innovation. There have been continuous extensions on CCP equivalence  both on the EU and UK side  which has limited any sort of widespread impact to date on the clearing landscape. As an EU-based CCP  we do need to secure UK equivalence with the Bank of England. We are currently part of the UK’s temporary recognition regime  which expires at the end of 2024  and are in advanced conversations with the Bank of England to make that temporary condition permanent so we can continue our services in the UK.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.0,mixed,0.46,0.16,0.38,True,English,"['Cboe Clear Europe', 'Tim Beckwith', 'Fireside', 'last two to three years', 'ongoing Euronext Clearing migration project', 'LCH SA unit', 'interest rate swaps', 'key regulatory topics', 'Euronext Clearing project', 'competitive clearing environment', 'venue equity trading', 'new vertical silo', 'Cboe Clear Europe', 'preferred clearing model', 'biggest single change', 'penalties collections service', 'true CCP interoperability', 'EU capital markets', 'other key part', 'core Euronext venues', 'Open Access provisions', 'The CSDR Refit', 'last 10 years', 'three reviews', 'ongoing conversation', 'last 12 months', 'Euronext markets', 'mass migration', 'mandatory migration', 'venue access', 'CCP migration', 'clearing landscape', 'interoperable model', 'new one', 'new regions', 'clearing competition', 'key role', 'new CCP', 'post-trade space', 'next 12 months', 'mandatory form', 'short timeline', 'past decade', 'small exchanges', 'M&A', 'essential element', 'strong uptake', '51.6 million trades', 'upward trend', 'main alternative', 'ambitious timetable', 'critical pieces', 'major initiative', 'European Commission', 'general intent', 'particular focus', 'supervisory framework', 'main focus', 'post-trade costs', 'late settlements', 'collection responsibility', 'good thing', 'mandatory buy-ins', 'discretionary buy-ins', 'asset classes', 'buying agent', 'original regime', 'settlement efficiency', 'right direction', 'client behaviour', 'recent proposals', 'house CCP', 'one CCP', 'EU CCPs', 'cash equities', 'exchange groups', 'EU products', '16% market share', 'market infrastructure', 'EU-domiciled CCPs', 'competition arrangements', 'post trade', 'Industry efforts', 'Many clients', 'Mifir Review', 'derivatives', 'impact', 'LSEG', 'Everything', 'back', 'services', 'timelines', 'competitiveness', 'investors', 'counterparties', 'Milan', 'concerns', 'terms', 'plans', 'lot', 'flight', 'Emir', 'detail', 'resilience', 'aspect', 'priorities', 'innovation', 'continuation', 'philosophy', 'kind', 'opportunity', 'things', 'start', 'theory', 'onus', 'CSDs', 'discussion', 'eye', 'fines', 'Brexit']",2023-01-06,2023-01-06,thetradenews.com

It has been engineered to express human IL-12  a cytokine that triggers a powerful antitumor immune response  and a full length anti-CTLA4 antibody.By selectively targeting tumor cells and expressing IL-12 and the anti-CTLA4 antibody in the tumor microenvironment  TG6050 is expected to elicit a powerful and multi-pronged antitumor response. A short video detailing the mechanism of action can be found here.TG6050 has been designed to be administered intravenously  a route of administration that has been demonstrated to be safe and feasible with an Invir.IOtm based OV. Intravenous administration will significantly enhance the therapeutic and market potential of this OV as it allows a more targeted approach to many internal cancer lesions and metastases inaccessible by intratumoral injection. Intratumoral injection  where the drug is injected directly into the tumor  is currently the only approved route of administration for an oncolytic virus. IV administration would represent a significant advantage.The Delivir trial will enroll up to 36 patients with advanced NSCLC who have failed standard therapeutic options  including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). TG6050 is expected to overcome tumor resistance by the initiation of an antitumor response through multiple mechanisms of action that include oncolysis  the induction of an immune response and high intra-tumoral concentrations of IL-12 and anti-CTLA4 antibody. The IV route is considered the most appropriate route of administration for this patient population with disseminated disease and multiple overt and occult metastases.Hedi Ben Brahim  CEO of Transgene commented: ""TG6050 is an exciting new asset within Transgene's growing oncolytic virus pipeline  and further demonstrates the ability of our Invir.IOtm platform to generate highly targeted immuno-oncology drugs. These multi-armed drug candidates are expected to have significant advantages over existing therapies. Acting like a Trojan horse  they induce the production of potent therapies such as IL-12 directly in the tumor. The goal: to achieve high concentrations of these drugs only in the tumor  for improved efficacy and fewer side effects compared to systemic administration of these drugs. Intravenous administration addresses a broader range of patients with solid tumors who are not suitable for intratumoral administration. IV administration has the potential to improve the outcomes of patients with advanced lung cancer patients who are in great need of new treatment options.This CTA approval is an important milestone for Transgene  and we look forward to the first patient being recruited and providing further updates on TG6050's clinical development.""The first patient is expected to be enrolled in this multicenter trial in the first half of 2023.***About the Delivir trialThe Delivir trial is a multicenter  open label  dose-escalation Phase I trial evaluating TG6050 as a single agent. The trial will enroll up to 36 patients with metastatic/advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  who have failed standard therapeutic options including immunotherapies such as ICIs. Patients will receive single and repeated escalating doses of TG6050 administered intravenously  to determine the recommended dose and best schedule of administration for subsequent clinical development.About TG6050TG6050 is an oncolytic virus developed with Transgene's Invir.IOtm platform for intravenous administration. Invir.IOtm's viruses are based on the patented large capacity Vaccinia virus Copenhagen strain genetically modified with the double deletion TK-RR- (VV COP TK-RR-). TG6050 has been engineered to encode human IL-12  a cytokine that triggers a powerful antitumor immune response and a full length anti-CTLA4 antibody. It has also been optimized with the deletion of the gene encoding for the M2L viral protein that targets CD80 and CD86  two ligands of CTLA4 [source: Kleinpeter et al.  J Virol. 2019 Jun 1; 93(11): e00207-19]. The use of an oncolytic virus to deliver these immunotherapies locally and selectively in the tumor microenvironment allows high intratumoral concentrations of both therapeutic proteins eliciting a stronger and more effective antitumor response. By reducing systemic exposure to a very low level  this local therapeutic activity furthermore allows to increase the safety and tolerability profile of IL-12 and the anti-CTLA4 antibody.It will be evaluated in the Delivir trial  a Phase I trial conducted in advanced NSCLC patients.About TransgeneTransgene (Euronext: TNG) is a biotechnology company focused on designing and developing targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Transgene's programs utilize viral vector technology with the goal of indirectly or directly killing cancer cells.The Company's clinical-stage programs consist of two therapeutic vaccines (TG4001 for the treatment of HPV-positive cancers  and TG4050  the first individualized therapeutic vaccine based on the myvac® platform) as well as three oncolytic viruses based on the Invir.IOtm viral backbone (TG6002  BT-001 and TG6050).With Transgene's myvac® platform  therapeutic vaccination enters the field of precision medicine with a novel immunotherapy that is fully tailored to each individual.

The trial results are highly encouraging and offer tremendous hope for all those families living with this neurodegenerative disease for which there is currently no available treatment.""In conclusion  Theranexus' Chief Medical Officer Marie Sebille added: ""We have achieved an important milestone with these Phase I/II results in CLN3 patients  enabling us to prepare the protocol of the Phase III trial to launch our pivotal clinical trial involving a pediatric cohort during 2023.""As a reminder  for the Sachs Associates 6th Annual Neuroscience Innovation Forum  to be held in San Francisco on 8 January 2023  Theranexus[1] will be presenting its latest advances on the Batten-1 program and also be participating in a roundtable discussion on the theme ""Rare and orphan diseases new modalities panel."" In addition  the company will be exhibiting at Biotech Showcase and at the same time participating in the 41st annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference bringing together key healthcare leaders.About Batten-1Batten-1 is a novel and exclusive proprietary drug containing the active ingredient miglustat. The mechanism of action of this substance blocks the accumulation of glycosphingolipids and neuroinflammation. For patients over 17 years of age in the Phase I/II trial  the product is administered in solid form. In the Phase III trial  it will be administered in a liquid form better suited to pediatric patients.Phase I/II trial design: this is an open-label trial involving 6 patients over 17 years of age with CLN3 Batten disease  treated with miglustat up to 600 mg/day for a 2-year period. The primary endpoint is patient safety and tolerability  assessed using reports of adverse effects  biological tests and ECG  as well as the pharmacokinetics of miglustat. The secondary endpoints include efficacy monitoring: Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale  visual acuity  and brain MRI and optical coherence tomography scans. Administration of Batten-1 in escalating doses with a maximum of 600 mg/day was well tolerated  with no severe side effects observed causing treatment discontinuation. The most commonly reported adverse events are reversible gastrointestinal effects of often light to moderate severity  thus demonstrating the good tolerability profile of Batten-1 in this population. Batten-1 will continue to be assessed in these patients treated over a 24-month period.

Juvenile Batten disease belongs to a group of disorders referred to as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). Over 400 different errors in 13 genes have been attributed to various forms of NCL  which differ from one another primarily by when symptoms first appear. The first symptom in the juvenile form  progressive vision loss  appears between the ages of 4 and 6 which is followed by personality changes  behavioral problems  and slowed learning. Seizures commonly appear within 2-4 years of the onset of disease. Over time  patients continue to decline mentally and physically. Eventually  those affected become wheelchair-bound  are bedridden  and die prematurely. Psychiatric symptoms or psychosis can appear at any time.Juvenile Batten disease is always fatal; usually by the late teens to early 20s. In the United States and Europe  the juvenile form is the most common of the NCLs  which together  affect nearly 3 000 patients[2]. In pathophysiological terms  interactions between neurons and glial cells play key roles in the emergence and progression of all the NCLs.About Beyond Batten Disease FoundationBeyond Batten Disease Foundation (BBDF) is the world's largest nonprofit organization dedicated to funding research for a treatment and cure for juvenile (CLN3) Batten disease. Since its inception in 2008  over $35 million has been invested in research by leveraging donations  co-funding and strategic partnerships. BBDF is spearheading a unique  cohesive strategy  incorporating independent scientific resources and collaboration with related organizations to drive research in juvenile Batten Disease[3]. Today there is a treatment in sight. BBDF funded research has discovered a drug - Batten-1 - that slows the progression of the disease in Batten models.
