15993,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4568194-international-wide-moat-stocks-sale-january-2023-heat-map,International Wide-Moat Stocks On Sale - The January 2023 Heat Map,Our 3-step process focuses on wide-moat stocks (as per Morningstar’s rating). Here are some candidates that may be worth your time for further analysis.,ValeryEgorovStep One: Wide-moat stocks with 5-star and 4-star ratingsHistorical evidence says that while quality alone is a poor indicator of outperformance  when combined with a decent valuation filter  Morningstar’s moat rating proves to be more than useful. Based on the available data  stocks with a wide-moat rating that also fit into the 4- or 5-star category deserve to be the subject of further analysis. See the detailed explanation and the underlying evidence of our first step in this article.We focus on those companies that are covered by a Morningstar analyst as assigning a wide-moat rating without thorough analysis is a questionable practice in our opinion. As of January 5  there were 70 international wide-moat stocks meeting our criteria (unchanged from last month).Only 11.4% (8 stocks) of this wide-moat group earned a 5-star (most attractive) valuation rating. Here are they:Company Name Ticker Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV BUD Roche Holding AG OTCQX:RHHBY Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co TSM Tencent Holdings Ltd OTCPK:TCEHY Yum China Holdings Inc YUMC Bayer AG OTCPK:BAYRY Barry Callebaut AG OTCPK:BYCBF Click to enlargeWe believe that the percentage of 5-star-rated wide-moat stocks is a good indicator of market sentiment. When this percentage is high  even the best companies are on sale. When the percentage is extremely low  market conditions may warrant caution. (Please note that this is not an indicator for market timing!)Data from Morningstar. Dataset after 12/2022 only contains international stocks.As these best of breed companies may be worth a closer look even when they are just slightly cheaper than their fair value but are not in the bargain bin  we also list the 4-star-rated wide-moat stocks as of January 5:Company Name Ticker JD.com Inc JD Medtronic plc MDT Schindler Holding AG OTCPK:SHLAF Baidu Inc BIDU GSK plc GSK ASML Holding NV ASML James Hardie Industries plc JHX ABB Ltd ABB Adyen NV OTCPK:ADYEY Airbus SE OTCPK:EADSY Allegion plc ALLE Ambev SA ABEV Brambles Ltd OTCPK:BMBLF British American Tobacco plc BTI Core Laboratories NV CLB Experian plc OTCQX:EXPGF Geberit AG OTCPK:GBERY Imperial Brands PLC OTCQX:IMBBY MercadoLibre Inc MELI Reckitt Benckiser Group plc OTCPK:RBGPF Safran SA OTCPK:SAFRF Sanofi SA SNY The Toronto-Dominion Bank TD Royal Bank of Canada RY Deutsche Boerse AG OTCPK:DBOEY Novozymes A/S B OTCPK:NVZMF Click to enlargeAll in all  we have 34 firms that pass our very first criteria.Data from Morningstar. Dataset after 12/2022 only contains international stocks.Step Two: Historical Valuation in the EVA FrameworkWe believe that the most widely used valuation multiples are terribly flawed. See this article on why we consider the Future Growth Reliance metric the best-of-breed sentiment indicator that addresses accounting distortions  thus gives us a true picture of which wide-moat companies seem attractively valued in historical terms. We want to buy our top-quality targets when the baked-in expectations are low  since that is when surprising on the upside has the highest probability. As investment is a game of probabilities  all we can do is stack the odds in our favor as much as possible.16 of the 34 stocks survived this second step. Here’s the list:Company Name Ticker Ambev SA ABEV Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV BUD Barry Callebaut AG OTCPK:BYCBF Bayer AG OTCPK:BAYRY Brambles Ltd OTCPK:BMBLF Experian plc OTCQX:EXPGF Geberit AG OTCPK:GBERY James Hardie Industries plc JHX MercadoLibre Inc MELI Novozymes A/S B OTCPK:NVZMF Reckitt Benckiser Group plc OTCPK:RBGPF Roche Holding AG OTCQX:RHHBY Royal Bank of Canada RY Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co TSM Tencent Holdings Ltd OTCPK:TCEHY The Toronto-Dominion Bank TD Click to enlargeWe are rather strict when it comes to historical valuation. There are stocks that unquestionably fail both our short- and long-term tests. There are some targets  however  that may look attractively valued if you only focus on the short-term (like the last 5 years)  but the longer you zoom out  the more you lose your appetite. It comes down to personal preference where you draw the line. For us  only those stocks are allowed to appear on the heat map in our third step that seem attractively valued in both a short-term and long-term context. (We go back as far as 20 years  calculate averages and medians on different time frames and let our algorithm do the ruthless work.)Step Three: The Heat Map of the most investable wide-moat stocksSeeing the stocks of our shortlist on a heat map with a quality and valuation axis is something that can prove very useful when we need to make a decision on which candidates to analyze thoroughly. As explained in our previous article  we use the PRVit (Performance-Risk-Valuation investment technology) model of the EVA Dimensions team.All in all  PRVit is a multifactor quantitative stock selection model based on EVA-centric measures of Performance  Risk  and Valuation. It first estimates the fundamental value of a company based on its risk-adjusted EVA performance (shown on the vertical axis) and then compares it to its actual valuation (shown on the horizontal axis). All factors in this model were chosen heuristically based on common sense  and not by data mining  yet strong and statistically significant backtests prove the soundness of the PRVit approach both in the U.S. and globally. (See the details here.)Here is the heat map as of January 5:Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.We also present the results in a table format to make your decision easier.Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.  Morningstar(Stocks highlighted in light blue are Morningstar’s 5-star-rated international wide-moat names that survived the second step of our process.)In PRVit  the factors are grouped into three categories: Performance  Risk  and Valuation. Each company has a composite 0-100 score in each category  where higher is better for Performance and lower is better for Risk and Valuation. We believe that stocks in the upper quintile of the PRVit ranking (with a PRVit score above 80) are worth a closer look.We plan to run this three-step process on a monthly basis and publish the shortlist of targets it produces.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

During this time  Archer has leveraged Stellantis' deep manufacturing  supply chain  and design expertise in connection with Archer's efforts to design  develop  and commercialize its eVTOL aircraft.Stellantis N.V. (NYSE / MTA / Euronext Paris: STLA) and Archer Aviation Inc. (NYSE: ACHR) have agreed to significantly expand their partnership by joining forces to manufacture Archer's flagship electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft  Midnight.Stellantis will work with Archer to stand up Archer's recently announced manufacturing facility in Covington  Georgia at which the companies plan to begin manufacturing the Midnight aircraft in 2024. Midnight is designed to be safe  sustainable  quiet and  with its expected payload of over 1 000 pounds  can carry four passengers plus a pilot. With a range of 100 miles  Midnight is optimized for back-to-back short distance trips of around 20 miles  with a charging time of approximately 10 minutes in-between.This unique partnership in the urban air mobility industry will leverage each company's respective strengths and competencies to bring the Midnight aircraft to market. Archer brings its world-class team of eVTOL  electric powertrain and certification experts while Stellantis will contribute advanced manufacturing technology and expertise  experienced personnel and capital to the partnership.This combination is intended to enable the rapid scaling of aircraft production to meet Archer's commercialization plans  while allowing Archer to strengthen its path to commercialization by helping it avoid hundreds of millions of dollars of spending during the manufacturing ramp up phase. The goal is for Stellantis to mass produce Archer's eVTOL aircraft as its exclusive contract manufacturer.As a further sign of its commitment  Stellantis will provide up to $150 million in equity capital for potential draw by Archer at its discretion in 2023 and 2024  subject to achievement of certain business milestones which Archer expects to occur in 2023. Stellantis also intends to increase its strategic shareholding through future purchases of Archer stock in the open market. These actions  along with the other elements of this expanded partnership  will enable Stellantis to become a long-term  cornerstone investor in Archer.""We've been working closely with Archer for the past two years  and I am continually impressed by their ingenuity and unwavering commitment to deliver "" said Carlos Tavares  Stellantis CEO.""Deepening our partnership with Archer as a strategic investor with plans for growing our shareholding demonstrates how Stellantis is pushing the boundaries to provide sustainable freedom of mobility  from the road to the sky. Supporting Archer with our manufacturing expertise is another example of how Stellantis will lead the way the world moves.""""Stellantis' continued recognition of Archer's progress toward commercialization  and today's commitment of significant resources to build the Midnight aircraft with us  places Archer in a strong position to be first to market "" said Adam Goldstein  founder and CEO of Archer. ""Our two companies are taking these important steps together to realize a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine urban transportation.""Stellantis has been a strategic partner to Archer since 2020 through various collaboration initiatives  and as an investor since 2021.

It has been engineered to express human IL-12  a cytokine that triggers a powerful antitumor immune response  and a full length anti-CTLA4 antibody.By selectively targeting tumor cells and expressing IL-12 and the anti-CTLA4 antibody in the tumor microenvironment  TG6050 is expected to elicit a powerful and multi-pronged antitumor response. A short video detailing the mechanism of action can be found here.TG6050 has been designed to be administered intravenously  a route of administration that has been demonstrated to be safe and feasible with an Invir.IO™ based OV. Intravenous administration will significantly enhance the therapeutic and market potential of this OV as it allows a more targeted approach to many internal cancer lesions and metastases inaccessible by intratumoral injection. Intratumoral injection  where the drug is injected directly into the tumor  is currently the only approved route of administration for an oncolytic virus. IV administration would represent a significant advantage.The Delivir trial will enroll up to 36 patients with advanced NSCLC who have failed standard therapeutic options  including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). TG6050 is expected to overcome tumor resistance by the initiation of an antitumor response through multiple mechanisms of action that include oncolysis  the induction of an immune response and high intra-tumoral concentrations of IL-12 and anti-CTLA4 antibody. The IV route is considered the most appropriate route of administration for this patient population with disseminated disease and multiple overt and occult metastases.Hedi Ben Brahim  CEO of Transgene commented: “TG6050 is an exciting new asset within Transgene’s growing oncolytic virus pipeline  and further demonstrates the ability of our Invir.IO™ platform to generate highly targeted immuno-oncology drugs. These multi-armed drug candidates are expected to have significant advantages over existing therapies. Acting like a Trojan horse  they induce the production of potent therapies such as IL-12 directly in the tumor. The goal: to achieve high concentrations of these drugs only in the tumor  for improved efficacy and fewer side effects compared to systemic administration of these drugs. Intravenous administration addresses a broader range of patients with solid tumors who are not suitable for intratumoral administration. IV administration has the potential to improve the outcomes of patients with advanced lung cancer patients who are in great need of new treatment options.This CTA approval is an important milestone for Transgene  and we look forward to the first patient being recruited and providing further updates on TG6050’s clinical development.”The first patient is expected to be enrolled in this multicenter trial in the first half of 2023.***About the Delivir trialThe Delivir trial is a multicenter  open label  dose-escalation Phase I trial evaluating TG6050 as a single agent. The trial will enroll up to 36 patients with metastatic/advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  who have failed standard therapeutic options including immunotherapies such as ICIs. Patients will receive single and repeated escalating doses of TG6050 administered intravenously  to determine the recommended dose and best schedule of administration for subsequent clinical development.About TG6050TG6050 is an oncolytic virus developed with Transgene’s Invir.IO™ platform for intravenous administration. Invir.IO™’s viruses are based on the patented large capacity Vaccinia virus Copenhagen strain genetically modified with the double deletion TK-RR- (VV COP TK-RR-). TG6050 has been engineered to encode human IL-12  a cytokine that triggers a powerful antitumor immune response and a full length anti-CTLA4 antibody. It has also been optimized with the deletion of the gene encoding for the M2L viral protein that targets CD80 and CD86  two ligands of CTLA4 [source: Kleinpeter et al.  J Virol. 2019 Jun 1; 93(11): e00207-19]. The use of an oncolytic virus to deliver these immunotherapies locally and selectively in the tumor microenvironment allows high intratumoral concentrations of both therapeutic proteins eliciting a stronger and more effective antitumor response. By reducing systemic exposure to a very low level  this local therapeutic activity furthermore allows to increase the safety and tolerability profile of IL-12 and the anti-CTLA4 antibody.It will be evaluated in the Delivir trial  a Phase I trial conducted in advanced NSCLC patients.About TransgeneTransgene (Euronext: TNG) is a biotechnology company focused on designing and developing targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Transgene’s programs utilize viral vector technology with the goal of indirectly or directly killing cancer cells.The Company’s clinical-stage programs consist of two therapeutic vaccines (TG4001 for the treatment of HPV-positive cancers  and TG4050  the first individualized therapeutic vaccine based on the myvac® platform) as well as three oncolytic viruses based on the Invir.IO™ viral backbone (TG6002  BT-001 and TG6050).With Transgene’s myvac® platform  therapeutic vaccination enters the field of precision medicine with a novel immunotherapy that is fully tailored to each individual.

Facilities Management Services organic growth impacted by the end of the Testing Centers contract in the UK stalled at +0.5%. Excluding this  Facilities Management Services was up by nearly +6%. Higher prices contributed about 5-6% to growth. By zone  the key elements were: North America generated organic growth of +15.7% boosted by the post-Covid return to the workplace  a better-than-expected increase in the sporting and convention center activity and more retail and event catering activity on University campuses. Healthcare was also up in particular due to a strong increase in retail sales. In Europe   organic growth was more contained at +5.9% due to the end of the Testing Centers. However  there was a strong return to the workplace across the zone as well as a recovery in the number of corporate events and tourists  particularly in Paris. The Rest of the World organic growth was +15.3% with a very solid performance in Business & Administrations in all regions despite the impact of the sporadic lockdowns in China and a particularly strong recovery in Education in India.The acceleration of the organic growth in revenues of Benefits & Rewards Services continued in the First quarter  at +23.4%. Higher demand  face values  net new business and interest rates all contributed. In particular  the quarter benefited from higher interest rates in the euro zone for the first time and a significant one-off contribution from the Austrian Klimabonus.During this first quarter  Sodexo continued to reinforce its commitments to reduce its environmental footprint: Sodexo progressed towards its 2025 CSR objectives: By promoting plant-based meal options: Sodexo just concluded its first global Sustainable Chef Challenge.

As we progress during the year  the post-Covid ramp-up will reduce gradually. From the second quarter  the strong momentum in Benefits & Rewards Services will continue but against a stronger comparative base. Growth is expected to be higher in the first half than in the second half of the year  even if the progressive increase in the contribution of last year’s net new development will support the organic growth in the second half.Group Fiscal 2023 guidance is maintained:Fiscal 2023 organic revenue growth expected to be between +8 and +10% driven by: Further recovery in Corporate Services and Sports & Leisure; Positive net new business momentum including expected further improvement in retention; Inflationary pricing at 4-5%; Partially offset by the impact of the end of the Testing Centers contract in the United Kingdom (-100 bps).driven by: Fiscal 2023 Underlying operating profit margin close to 5.5%  at constant rates  supported by: Continued price increases and inflation mitigation action plans; Operational excellence including supply chain efficiencies; Further ramp-up in volume; Increased investment to sustain growth.supported by:Fiscal 2023 guidance for Benefits & Rewards Services is also maintained:Organic growth of +12 to +15% for Fiscal 2023   driven by: Further progress in new business  cross-selling and retention; Strong demand in all regions; Benefits from inflation and higher interest rates.  driven by:Underlying operating profit margin around 30% at constant rates for Fiscal 2023  supported by: The benefits of the topline growth flow-through; Increased investment in technology  digital offers  brand and sales & marketing.  supported by:Conference callSodexo will hold a conference call in (English) today at 9:00 a.m. (Paris time)  8:00 a.m. (London time) to comment on its Q1 Fiscal 2023 revenues.

However  given the weight of the Benefit & Rewards activity in Brazil  and the high level of its margins relative to the Group  when the Brazilian real declines against the euro  it has a negative effect on the underlying operating margin due to a change in the mix of margins. Conversely  when the Brazilian real strengthens Group margins increase.1€= AVERAGE RATEQ1 FY 2023 AVERAGE RATEQ1 FY 2022 AVERAGE RATEQ1 FY 2023VS.

Today the Company announces the signing of binding commercial terms for a 15-year offtake agreement  with extension rights  with Eneco  for the entire storage capacity of the Zuidwending Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) project in the Netherlands. Eneco is a leading renewable power supplier and energy service provider in the Netherlands and Belgium  operating and expanding its activities in the UK and Germany  and is committed to accelerating the energy transition.Zuidwending is located in the Province of Groningen in the Netherlands. Corre Energy has exclusive rights to build a CAES facility using salt caverns at the site  in conjunction with its cavern development partner. The facility will have 320 Megawatts of power generating capacity  with a maximum storage discharge duration of approximately 3.5 days and a target commencement date around the end of 2026. It will be constructed as hydrogen fuel enabled from commencement.Under the terms of the arrangement  Corre Energy will construct  operate and maintain the facility and Eneco will optimise the entire output of the storage site on behalf of Corre Energy. Eneco will provide market access services  enabling Corre Energy to benefit from revenue linked to the high flexibility value of the asset  while also guaranteeing a base level of income. This is supported by the anticipated rapid growth in renewable generation capacity and Eneco's requirements for flexible energy sources to deliver its target of becoming climate-neutral by 2035.This type of facility will be an essential element  in conjunction with other energy storage solutions  in providing the flexibility required to prevent grid congestion in the Netherlands  and to ease the supply/demand balancing challenges associated with the transition from fossil-fuel generation to long-term sustainable renewable sources  such as wind and solar. CAES works alongside smaller  shorter duration lithium-ion battery installations  to cover longer duration renewable downtime  offering balancing solutions within-day and across multiple days.This is a ground-breaking partnership  with both partners fully committed to bringing this project to completion. The planned facility is progressing through the normal permitting procedures associated with an asset of this significance and  when realised  will be the first large-scale CAES facility to be constructed in Europe in almost 50 years.Keith McGrane  Chief Executive Officer of Corre Energy  commented:""We are delighted to have entered into this partnership with Eneco  a world-class energy generation and supply company  which helps to enable its strategic vision and underpins the project economics for Corre Energy. Eneco shares our deep belief in the requirement for and the value of large-scale Compressed Air Energy Storage  and it is making a very significant commitment to enable this project.It also shares Corre Energy's commitment to making a tangible contribution to the energy transition and the journey to net zero in Europe.""Zuidwending will be hydrogen fuel enabled from Day One and we expect the maturing of the hydrogen market to allow the facility to operate entirely on surplus renewable energy and green hydrogen  making an increasingly positive environmental impact.""We have made great progress over the last few years and  with the global regulatory backdrop improving rapidly and ongoing renewables build enhancing the economics of energy storage  I am confident we can deliver this game-changing project.""Kees-Jan Rameau  Chief Strategic Growth Officer for Eneco  said:""With this partnership with Corre Energy  Eneco takes another big step in further reducing CO2- emissions  and providing the flexibility required for the renewable energy system of the future. This will help solve congestion issues and pave the way for more renewable energy for our customers. This unique project will be an important contributor to our One Planet ambition and becoming climateneutral by 2035.""Corre Energy is a leader in the development and operation of Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES) projects and products  accelerating the transition to net zero and enhancing the security and flexibility of energy systems. Our projects address the increasing balancing requirements of renewable power and provide essential and cost-effective services to system operators in the form of storage and balancing services.We also unlock the value of renewables by combining hydrogen production with long duration and flexible energy storage  and by doing so we can help to deliver more affordable  green energy to customers.Eneco is an international energy company committed to accelerating the energy transition. Our One Planet Plan forms the basis for our ambition to be completely climate-neutral as early as 2035  in terms of both our own and our customers' energy consumption. This requires radical electrification  phasing out natural gas in the production and supply of energy and accelerating sustainable heat.

However  there was a strong return to the workplace across the zone as well as a recovery in the number of corporate events and tourists  particularly in Paris. The Rest of the World organic growth was +15.3% with a very solid performance in Business & Administrations in all regions despite the impact of the sporadic lockdowns in China and a particularly strong recovery in Education in India.The acceleration of the organic growth in revenues of Benefits & Rewards Services continued in the First quarter  at +23.4%.

From the second quarter  the strong momentum in Benefits & Rewards Services will continue but against a stronger comparative base.

However  given the weight of the Benefit & Rewards activity in Brazil  and the high level of its margins relative to the Group  when the Brazilian real declines against the euro  it has a negative effect on the underlying operating margin due to a change in the mix of margins. Conversely  when the Brazilian real strengthens Group margins increase.1€= AVERAGE RATEQ1 FY 2023 AVERAGE RATEQ1 FY 2022 AVERAGE RATEQ1 FY 2023VS.

In 2019  the U.S. FDA granted orphan drug designation to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of MG.4The safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab have not been established and they are not currently approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.The FDA Priority Review designation follows the recent European Medicines Agency (EMA) validation of the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for rozanolixizumab for the treatment of adults with AChR or MuSK antibody positive gMG who require treatment in addition to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressants. Validation confirms that the application is complete and the formal review process by the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) can begin. Orphan designation was granted by the European Commission in April 2020 to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.5UCB expects to receive feedback from both the FDA and EMA during the second quarter of 2023.""People living with MG suffer from unpredictable  fluctuating  and debilitating symptoms that have a huge impact on their lives  and there is a clear need for additional targeted treatments. We are firmly committed to supporting the gMG community by providing solutions to help improve outcomes for patients and reduce the day-to-day burden of the disease "" said Charl van Zyl  Executive Vice President Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International Markets  UCB. ""The FDA's decision to assess rozanolixizumab via their priority review process  as well as the recent filing of the MAA in Europe  brings us important steps further on our journey towards approvals for rozanolixizumab. We look forward to working with the FDA and EMA to help bring this new treatment option to patients.""gMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.6 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including drooping eyelids  double vision  and difficulty in swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as severe muscle weakness that can result in life-threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.4 7 In the U.S. the prevalence of MG is estimated at 14 to 20 per 100 000 population; approximately 36 000 to 60 000 cases.4 In Europe  the prevalence is estimated at 10 per 100 000 population.8Data from the MycarinG studyThe Priority Review BLA and the MAA are based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 MycarinG study (NCT03971422)  in which rozanolixizumab demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in MG-specific outcomes in patients with AChR MuSK antibody positive MG. In the primary endpoint  rozanolixizumab significantly reduced MG-ADL from baseline to Day 43. Rozanolixizumab showed an LS mean difference vs placebo (95% CI) of -2.59 points at the 7mg/kg dose and -2.62 points at the 10mg/kg dose.9Furthermore  a greater percentage of patients in the rozanolixizumab 7mg/kg and 10mg/kg arms than the placebo arm achieved a 2.0-point or greater improvement (p<0.001) in MG-ADL  a 3.0-point or greater improvement in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scores and a 3.0-point or greater improvement in Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) scores7  demonstrating clinically meaningful reductions in these assessments.Rozanolixizumab demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile with similar occurrences of TEAEs between both doses. A higher proportion of TEAEs occurred in the active treatment arms versus placebo (81.3% for 7 mg/kg  82.6% for 10 mg/kg and 67.2% for placebo) and were comparable between the rozanolixizumab groups. The most frequently reported TEAEs were headache  diarrhea  pyrexia  and nausea. A higher incidence of headache was reported in the rozanolixizumab groups versus placebo  with most cases mild to moderate and severe cases generally managed with non-opioid analgesics. Treatment discontinuation rates due to TEAEs were low.7In the MycarinG study  200 patients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive weekly rozanolixizumab 7 mg/kg (N=66)  10 mg/kg (N=67) or placebo (N=67) for 6 weeks  which was followed by an 8-week observation period.6""Patients living with MG may experience high disease and treatment burden resulting in a significant impact on their daily lives. If approved  rozanolixizumab has the potential to address unmet needs of gMG patients "" said Iris Loew-Friedrich  Executive Vice-President and Chief Medical Officer at UCB. ""Through rozanolixizumab and zilucoplan  we intend to bring two medicines with different mechanisms of action that have the potential to provide targeted treatment options to patients. With our gMG pipeline  we hope to address both drivers of disease pathology and which account for approximately 95% of people living with gMG. Priority Review Designation by the FDA for rozanolixizumab reflects the extent to which our science speaks for itself in potentially addressing the significant unmet needs still faced by the gMG community.""UCB is currently investigating two potential therapies with different modes of action for the treatment of gMG. Alongside rozanolixizumab  a NDA for zilucoplan – a subcutaneous self-administered peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) has recently been filed with the U.S. FDA for the treatment of adults with AChR antibody positive gMG. Additionally  zilucoplan received MAA validation from the EMA for the treatment of adults with AChR antibody positive gMG and who require treatment in addition to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressants.10 11 12For further information  contact UCB:Brand Communications  Rare DiseasesJim BaxterT+32.2.473.78.85.01jim.baxter@ucb.comU.S. Communications  Rare DiseasesDaphne TeoT +1.770.880.7655daphne.teo@ucb.comCorporate Communications  Media RelationsLaurent SchotsT+32.2.559.92.64Laurent.schots@ucb.comInvestor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14antje.witte@ucb.comAbout Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)Myasthenia gravis is a rare disease impacting more than 700 000 people worldwide.13 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including drooping eyelids  double vision  difficulty swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as severe muscular weakness that can result in life threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.4gMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.4 14 gMG can occur in any race  although previous studies have shown that women are more often impacted than men.15 16 Most patients with gMG have pathogenic IgG antibodies that disrupt the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles in the NMJ and some activate the complement cascade.1 Complement-mediated destruction via MAC formation is a key mechanism causing damage at the NMJ and is the key driver of disease in AChR antibody positive gMG gMG.About the rozanolixizumab MycarinG study17The MycarinG study (NCT03971422) is a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rozanolixizumab in adult patients with gMG  with an open-label extension. The primary endpoint for the MycarinG study is change from baseline to day 43 in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score  an eight-item patient-reported scale developed to assess MG symptoms and their effects on daily activities. Additional endpoints include response rates  changes in the Myasthenia Gravis composite (MGC) score  the Quantitative MG (QMG) score  patient-reported outcomes and adverse events (AEs). The majority of patients taking part in the MycarinG study opted to enroll in the open label extensions to this clinical trial. As a result  UCB is exploring the potential for further extension studies into this treatment.For more information about the trial  visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT03971422.About rozanolixizumabRozanolixizumab is a SC administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). It has been designed to block the interaction of FcRn and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)  accelerating the catabolism of antibodies and reducing the concentration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies.1 18Rozanolixizumab is under clinical development with the aim of improving the lives of people with pathogenic IgG-autoantibody-driven autoimmune diseases. In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.2 Orphan designation was granted in 2020 by the European Commission for rozanolixizumab to the treatment of myasthenia gravis.3The safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab have not been established and it is not approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About zilucoplanZilucoplan is a once-daily SC  self-administered peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) under clinical development by UCB in gMG. As a C5 inhibitor  zilucoplan inhibits complement-mediated damage to the neuromuscular junction through its targeted dual mechanism of action.8 In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.9 Orphan designation was granted in 2022 by the European Commission to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.10The safety and efficacy of zilucoplan have not been established and it is not currently approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About UCB in Rare DiseasesAt UCB  we don't just see patients or population sizes  we see people in need.

From the second quarter  the strong momentum in Benefits & Rewards Services will continue but against a stronger comparative base.

However  given the weight of the Benefit & Rewards activity in Brazil  and the high level of its margins relative to the Group  when the Brazilian real declines against the euro  it has a negative effect on the underlying operating margin due to a change in the mix of margins. Conversely  when the Brazilian real strengthens Group margins increase.1€= AVERAGE RATEQ1 FY 2023 AVERAGE RATEQ1 FY 2022 AVERAGE RATEQ1 FY 2023VS.

Priority Review designation means the FDA's goal is to take action on an application within 6 months  compared to 10 months under standard review3. In 2019  the U.S. FDA granted orphan drug designation to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of MG.4The safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab have not been established and they are not currently approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.The FDA Priority Review designation follows the recent European Medicines Agency (EMA) validation of the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for rozanolixizumab for the treatment of adults with AChR or MuSK antibody positive gMG who require treatment in addition to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressants. Validation confirms that the application is complete and the formal review process by the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) can begin. Orphan designation was granted by the European Commission in April 2020 to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.5UCB expects to receive feedback from both the FDA and EMA during the second quarter of 2023.""People living with MG suffer from unpredictable  fluctuating  and debilitating symptoms that have a huge impact on their lives  and there is a clear need for additional targeted treatments. We are firmly committed to supporting the gMG community by providing solutions to help improve outcomes for patients and reduce the day-to-day burden of the disease "" said Charl van Zyl  Executive Vice President Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International Markets  UCB. ""The FDA's decision to assess rozanolixizumab via their priority review process  as well as the recent filing of the MAA in Europe  brings us important steps further on our journey towards approvals for rozanolixizumab. We look forward to working with the FDA and EMA to help bring this new treatment option to patients.""gMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.6 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including drooping eyelids  double vision  and difficulty in swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as severe muscle weakness that can result in life-threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.4 7 In the U.S. the prevalence of MG is estimated at 14 to 20 per 100 000 population; approximately 36 000 to 60 000 cases.4 In Europe  the prevalence is estimated at 10 per 100 000 population.8Data from the MycarinG studyThe Priority Review BLA and the MAA are based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 MycarinG study (NCT03971422)  in which rozanolixizumab demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in MG-specific outcomes in patients with AChR MuSK antibody positive MG. In the primary endpoint  rozanolixizumab significantly reduced MG-ADL from baseline to Day 43. Rozanolixizumab showed an LS mean difference vs placebo (95% CI) of -2.59 points at the 7mg/kg dose and -2.62 points at the 10mg/kg dose.9Furthermore  a greater percentage of patients in the rozanolixizumab 7mg/kg and 10mg/kg arms than the placebo arm achieved a 2.0-point or greater improvement (p0.001) in MG-ADL  a 3.0-point or greater improvement in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scores and a 3.0-point or greater improvement in Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) scores7  demonstrating clinically meaningful reductions in these assessments.Rozanolixizumab demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile with similar occurrences of TEAEs between both doses. A higher proportion of TEAEs occurred in the active treatment arms versus placebo (81.3% for 7 mg/kg  82.6% for 10 mg/kg and 67.2% for placebo) and were comparable between the rozanolixizumab groups. The most frequently reported TEAEs were headache  diarrhea  pyrexia  and nausea. A higher incidence of headache was reported in the rozanolixizumab groups versus placebo  with most cases mild to moderate and severe cases generally managed with non-opioid analgesics.Treatment discontinuation rates due to TEAEs were low.7In the MycarinG study  200 patients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive weekly rozanolixizumab 7 mg/kg (N=66)  10 mg/kg (N=67) or placebo (N=67) for 6 weeks  which was followed by an 8-week observation period.6""Patients living with MG may experience high disease and treatment burden resulting in a significant impact on their daily lives. If approved  rozanolixizumab has the potential to address unmet needs of gMG patients "" said Iris Loew-Friedrich  Executive Vice-President and Chief Medical Officer at UCB. ""Through rozanolixizumab and zilucoplan  we intend to bring two medicines with different mechanisms of action that have the potential to provide targeted treatment options to patients. With our gMG pipeline  we hope to address both drivers of disease pathology and which account for approximately 95% of people living with gMG. Priority Review Designation by the FDA for rozanolixizumab reflects the extent to which our science speaks for itself in potentially addressing the significant unmet needs still faced by the gMG community.""UCB is currently investigating two potential therapies with different modes of action for the treatment of gMG. Alongside rozanolixizumab  a NDA for zilucoplan - a subcutaneous self-administered peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) has recently been filed with the U.S. FDA for the treatment of adults with AChR antibody positive gMG. Additionally  zilucoplan received MAA validation from the EMA for the treatment of adults with AChR antibody positive gMG and who require treatment in addition to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressants.10 11 12For further information  contact UCB:Brand Communications  Rare DiseasesJim BaxterT+32.2.473.78.85.01jim.baxter@ucb.comCorporate Communications  Media RelationsLaurent SchotsT+32.2.559.92.64Laurent.schots@ucb.comInvestor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14antje.witte@ucb.comAbout Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)Myasthenia gravis is a rare disease impacting more than 700 000 people worldwide.13 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including drooping eyelids  double vision  difficulty swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as severe muscular weakness that can result in life threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.4  4gMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.4 14 gMG can occur in any race  although previous studies have shown that women are more often impacted than men.15 16 Most patients with gMG have pathogenic IgG antibodies that disrupt the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles in the NMJ and some activate the complement cascade.1 Complement-mediated destruction via MAC formation is a key mechanism causing damage at the NMJ and is the key driver of disease in AChR antibody positive gMG gMG.About the rozanolixizumab MycarinG study17The MycarinG study (NCT03971422) is a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rozanolixizumab in adult patients with gMG  with an open-label extension. The primary endpoint for the MycarinG study is change from baseline to day 43 in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score  an eight-item patient-reported scale developed to assess MG symptoms and their effects on daily activities. Additional endpoints include response rates  changes in the Myasthenia Gravis composite (MGC) score  the Quantitative MG (QMG) score  patient-reported outcomes and adverse events (AEs). The majority of patients taking part in the MycarinG study opted to enroll in the open label extensions to this clinical trial. As a result  UCB is exploring the potential for further extension studies into this treatment.For more information about the trial  visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT03971422.About rozanolixizumabRozanolixizumab is a SC administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). It has been designed to block the interaction of FcRn and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)  accelerating the catabolism of antibodies and reducing the concentration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies.1 18Rozanolixizumab is under clinical development with the aim of improving the lives of people with pathogenic IgG-autoantibody-driven autoimmune diseases. In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.2 Orphan designation was granted in 2020 by the European Commission for rozanolixizumab to the treatment of myasthenia gravis.3The safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab have not been established and it is not approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About zilucoplanZilucoplan is a once-daily SC  self-administered peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) under clinical development by UCB in gMG. As a C5 inhibitor  zilucoplan inhibits complement-mediated damage to the neuromuscular junction through its targeted dual mechanism of action.8 In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.9 Orphan designation was granted in 2022 by the European Commission to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.10The safety and efficacy of zilucoplan have not been established and it is not currently approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About UCB in Rare DiseasesAt UCB  we don't just see patients or population sizes  we see people in need.

In 2019  the U.S. FDA granted orphan drug designation to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of MG.4The safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab have not been established and they are not currently approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.The FDA Priority Review designation follows the recent European Medicines Agency (EMA) validation of the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for rozanolixizumab for the treatment of adults with AChR or MuSK antibody positive gMG who require treatment in addition to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressants. Validation confirms that the application is complete and the formal review process by the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) can begin. Orphan designation was granted by the European Commission in April 2020 to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.5UCB expects to receive feedback from both the FDA and EMA during the second quarter of 2023.""People living with MG suffer from unpredictable  fluctuating  and debilitating symptoms that have a huge impact on their lives  and there is a clear need for additional targeted treatments. We are firmly committed to supporting the gMG community by providing solutions to help improve outcomes for patients and reduce the day-to-day burden of the disease "" said Charl van Zyl  Executive Vice President Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International Markets  UCB. ""The FDA's decision to assess rozanolixizumab via their priority review process  as well as the recent filing of the MAA in Europe  brings us important steps further on our journey towards approvals for rozanolixizumab. We look forward to working with the FDA and EMA to help bring this new treatment option to patients.""gMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.6 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including drooping eyelids  double vision  and difficulty in swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as severe muscle weakness that can result in life-threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.4 7 In the U.S. the prevalence of MG is estimated at 14 to 20 per 100 000 population; approximately 36 000 to 60 000 cases.4 In Europe  the prevalence is estimated at 10 per 100 000 population.8Data from the MycarinG studyThe Priority Review BLA and the MAA are based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 MycarinG study (NCT03971422)  in which rozanolixizumab demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in MG-specific outcomes in patients with AChR MuSK antibody positive MG. In the primary endpoint  rozanolixizumab significantly reduced MG-ADL from baseline to Day 43. Rozanolixizumab showed an LS mean difference vs placebo (95% CI) of -2.59 points at the 7mg/kg dose and -2.62 points at the 10mg/kg dose.9Furthermore  a greater percentage of patients in the rozanolixizumab 7mg/kg and 10mg/kg arms than the placebo arm achieved a 2.0-point or greater improvement (p<0.001) in MG-ADL  a 3.0-point or greater improvement in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scores and a 3.0-point or greater improvement in Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) scores7  demonstrating clinically meaningful reductions in these assessments.Rozanolixizumab demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile with similar occurrences of TEAEs between both doses. A higher proportion of TEAEs occurred in the active treatment arms versus placebo (81.3% for 7 mg/kg  82.6% for 10 mg/kg and 67.2% for placebo) and were comparable between the rozanolixizumab groups. The most frequently reported TEAEs were headache  diarrhea  pyrexia  and nausea. A higher incidence of headache was reported in the rozanolixizumab groups versus placebo  with most cases mild to moderate and severe cases generally managed with non-opioid analgesics. Treatment discontinuation rates due to TEAEs were low.7In the MycarinG study  200 patients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive weekly rozanolixizumab 7 mg/kg (N=66)  10 mg/kg (N=67) or placebo (N=67) for 6 weeks  which was followed by an 8-week observation period.6""Patients living with MG may experience high disease and treatment burden resulting in a significant impact on their daily lives. If approved  rozanolixizumab has the potential to address unmet needs of gMG patients "" said Iris Loew-Friedrich  Executive Vice-President and Chief Medical Officer at UCB. ""Through rozanolixizumab and zilucoplan  we intend to bring two medicines with different mechanisms of action that have the potential to provide targeted treatment options to patients. With our gMG pipeline  we hope to address both drivers of disease pathology and which account for approximately 95% of people living with gMG. Priority Review Designation by the FDA for rozanolixizumab reflects the extent to which our science speaks for itself in potentially addressing the significant unmet needs still faced by the gMG community.""UCB is currently investigating two potential therapies with different modes of action for the treatment of gMG. Alongside rozanolixizumab  a NDA for zilucoplan – a subcutaneous self-administered peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) has recently been filed with the U.S. FDA for the treatment of adults with AChR antibody positive gMG. Additionally  zilucoplan received MAA validation from the EMA for the treatment of adults with AChR antibody positive gMG and who require treatment in addition to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressants.10 11 12For further information  contact UCB:Brand Communications  Rare DiseasesJim BaxterT+32.2.473.78.85.01[email protected]U.S. Communications  Rare DiseasesDaphne TeoT +1.770.880.7655[email protected]Corporate Communications  Media RelationsLaurent SchotsT+32.2.559.92.64[email protected]Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14[email protected]About Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)Myasthenia gravis is a rare disease impacting more than 700 000 people worldwide.13 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including drooping eyelids  double vision  difficulty swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as severe muscular weakness that can result in life threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.4gMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.4 14 gMG can occur in any race  although previous studies have shown that women are more often impacted than men.15 16 Most patients with gMG have pathogenic IgG antibodies that disrupt the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles in the NMJ and some activate the complement cascade.1 Complement-mediated destruction via MAC formation is a key mechanism causing damage at the NMJ and is the key driver of disease in AChR antibody positive gMG gMG.About the rozanolixizumab MycarinG study17The MycarinG study (NCT03971422) is a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rozanolixizumab in adult patients with gMG  with an open-label extension. The primary endpoint for the MycarinG study is change from baseline to day 43 in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score  an eight-item patient-reported scale developed to assess MG symptoms and their effects on daily activities. Additional endpoints include response rates  changes in the Myasthenia Gravis composite (MGC) score  the Quantitative MG (QMG) score  patient-reported outcomes and adverse events (AEs). The majority of patients taking part in the MycarinG study opted to enroll in the open label extensions to this clinical trial. As a result  UCB is exploring the potential for further extension studies into this treatment.For more information about the trial  visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT03971422.About rozanolixizumabRozanolixizumab is a SC administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). It has been designed to block the interaction of FcRn and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)  accelerating the catabolism of antibodies and reducing the concentration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies.1 18Rozanolixizumab is under clinical development with the aim of improving the lives of people with pathogenic IgG-autoantibody-driven autoimmune diseases. In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.2 Orphan designation was granted in 2020 by the European Commission for rozanolixizumab to the treatment of myasthenia gravis.3The safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab have not been established and it is not approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About zilucoplanZilucoplan is a once-daily SC  self-administered peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) under clinical development by UCB in gMG. As a C5 inhibitor  zilucoplan inhibits complement-mediated damage to the neuromuscular junction through its targeted dual mechanism of action.8 In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.9 Orphan designation was granted in 2022 by the European Commission to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.10The safety and efficacy of zilucoplan have not been established and it is not currently approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About UCB in Rare DiseasesAt UCB  we don't just see patients or population sizes  we see people in need.
