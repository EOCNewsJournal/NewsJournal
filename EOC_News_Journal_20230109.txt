And all this in strict compliance with the EU Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO). Schwörer employees use the newly developed employee app either as a desktop app on the browser of their computer or tablet or on their cell phone.A unique feature of the CompanyMessenger is that no personal cell phone number of the employee is required to use it; instead  communication takes place exclusively via a unique user ID. CompanyMessenger accesses the central contact book of the Schwörer Group and not the employee's personal contacts.And this is how simply the new CompanyMessenger works for all Schwörer employees: The employee downloads the app from the Apple or Google app stores onto his or her chosen end device and can start immediately by entering the personnel number and individual login data.In addition to chat communication  Schwörer's marketing department also uses the so-called ""News Editor"" and sends push messages to all Schwörer employees or just to one of the seven Schwörer plants. The employees can all be reached easily  promptly and directly in this way.The SchwörerHaus assembly teams  which are deployed throughout Europe  can organize and exchange information in chat groups within CompanyMessenger. Even an employee's personal time account can be quickly accessed via CompanyMessenger. In the near future  it will also be possible to include external users  such as suppliers or subcontractors  in the Schwörer chat community.SchwörerHaus retains full control over the data and defines its own usage guidelines and regulations for the app.-terms of use for the app itself.""What was important for SchwörerHaus when selecting CompanyMessenger as an employee app was first and foremost a similarly simple operation of chat communication as with WhatsApp®  so that no training of users is necessary when rolling out the app. Everyone can use WhatsApp® in their private lives and can therefore intuitively find their way around CompanyMessenger "" says Markus Schwörer  Head of IT at SchwörerHaus.Thomas Teufel  MEXS Managing Director and Member of the Board of UMT AG  adds: ""The novel MEXS CompanyMessenger solution enables companies today to involve all employees  including those in production or field service  in communication via chat. And if desired  the push messages can also be muted using the so-called ""after-work button"" if the employee does not want to be bothered.""""We are pleased to expand our customer base with SchwörerHaus and at the same time to welcome our first customer on the new SaaS platform from MEXS. With SaaS (""Software as a Service"")  we are opening up a new dimension of scalability for our business model through lucrative subscription models. However  development is not standing still: We are already working on a concept that allows messages from different messenger systems to be exchanged. This will put MEXS in the league of unified communications providers "" continues Thomas Teufel.UMT AG is building a scalable business model with the MEXS messaging platform and in the future will offer the newly designed CompanyMessenger solution via attractive subscription models  especially for German medium-sized businesses.""The CompanyMessenger  as a ""Made in Germany"" product introduces companies to chat communication without any worries about protection and confidentiality of their data. With this solution  UMT has entered the growing market of chat communication for mobile working and thus sees extraordinary growth potential for MEXS "" said Dr. Jürgen Schulz  Spokesman of the Board of Management at UMT AG.You can find out more about the MEXS Group and MEXS CompanyMessenger here or on the MEXS website at www.mexs.io.About UMT AG:UMT United Mobility Technology AG stands as a ""TechnologyHouse"" for the development and implementation of customized solutions for the digitalization of business processes.

The anticipated acquisition will enrich Ipsen’s Rare Disease portfolio and pipeline.The lead medicine in Albireo’s pipeline is Bylvay® (odevixibat)  a potent  once-daily  oral  non-systemic ileal bile acid transport inhibitor (IBATi). Bylvay was approved in 2021 in the U.S. for the treatment of pruritus in patients three months of age and older with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC)1  and in the E.U. for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older.2 Pruritus is one of the most prominent and problematic manifestations of the disease 3 often resulting in severely diminished quality of life.4 Bylvay has orphan exclusivity for the approved indications in PFIC in the U.S. and E.U.“ We are excited about the potential of Albireo’s assets and scientific expertise  which we gain through this acquisition  and we believe this is a compelling growth opportunity for Ipsen.” said David Loew  Chief Executive Officer of Ipsen. “ Our Rare Disease franchise is strengthened with Bylvay  which  in addition to being the first-approved treatment in PFIC  has two further indications being investigated in rare liver conditions that are underserved. Additionally  Bylvay and the clinical and preclinical novel bile acid transport inhibitors in Albireo’s portfolio complement our own pipeline in liver disease.”“ Unwavering dedication to patients and commitment to science have always been the north star for Albireo. This focus has driven us to develop and gain approval for Bylvay as the first drug treatment for PFIC ” said Ron Cooper  President and Chief Executive Officer of Albireo. “ Our talented team at Albireo have advanced the first Phase III studies in three different pediatric liver diseases while discovering two promising new clinical stage bile acid modulators. We believe that Ipsen is well positioned to apply its global R&D and commercial capabilities to make these medicines available to more cholestatic liver disease patients and accelerate the mission of providing hope for families. ”In addition to this lead indication  Albireo announced in December 2022 that supplementary regulatory filings have been made for Bylvay in the E.U. and the U.S. for Alagille syndrome (ALGS). ALGS is a rare  genetic disorder that can affect multiple organ systems  including the liver  with a paucity of bile ducts preventing bile flow from the liver to the small intestine. The most debilitating symptom of ALGS is severe pruritus.5 In the Phase III ASSERT trial  treatment with Bylvay met both primary and secondary endpoints and was associated with statistically significant improvements in pruritus severity and reductions in serum bile acid levels compared to placebo  and was well tolerated.6Furthermore  Bylvay is in late-stage development for biliary atresia (BA). It is currently being investigated in the BOLD study  the first  prospective double-blind  Phase III clinical trial in BA  a rare  pediatric liver disease that can result in cirrhosis and liver failure and is the leading cause of liver transplantation among children.7 Orphan drug designations have been granted in both ALGS and BA indications in the U.S. and E.U.As part of the transaction  Ipsen will also acquire Albireo’s clinical stage asset A3907  a novel oral systemic apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) inhibitor currently in development for adult cholestatic liver disease  such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)  which could complement Ipsen´s existing development programs. In addition to Bylvay and A3907  Albireo’s pipeline includes A2342  an oral systemic sodium-taurocholate co-transporting peptide (NTCP) inhibitor being evaluated for viral and cholestatic diseases  which is moving ahead in investigational new drug (IND)-enabling trials.Financial highlightsThe acquisition of Albireo will provide immediate incremental sales and strengthen Ipsen’s rare disease infrastructure. Albireo guided for total Bylvay revenues of $24 million for 2022. Given the level of ongoing R&D expenses  the transaction is expected to be dilutive to Ipsen’s core operating income until the end of 2024. This is in line with Ipsen’s medium-term outlook regarding its strategic focus on building a high-value and sustainable pipeline through external innovation. The Group will provide its annual guidance for 2023 in February.Transaction detailsUnder the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  Ipsen  through a fully-owned subsidiary  will initiate a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Albireo at a price of $42.00 per share in cash at the closing of the transaction  for an initial estimated aggregate consideration of $952 million plus one contingent value right (CVR) per share. Each CVR will entitle its holder to deferred cash payments of $10.00 per CVR payable upon the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Bylvay in the Biliary Atresia indication at the latest by 31 December 2027  allowing for a potential increase in the number of patients in the BOLD study.The $42.00 per-share cash consideration represents a premium of 104% compared to Albireo’s 1-month volume-weighted average price of $20.60 preceding announcement of the transaction. The transaction will be fully financed by Ipsen’s existing cash and lines of credit. The Board of Directors of Albireo has unanimously approved the transaction and recommended that the stockholders of Albireo tender their shares in the tender offer.The closing of the tender offer will be subject to customary conditions  including the tender of shares which represent at least a majority of the total number of Albireo’s outstanding shares  the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and the receipt of consents of  or filings with  any governmental body or pursuant to certain foreign antitrust laws and the expiration of any applicable waiting period and other customary conditions. Upon the successful completion of the tender offer  Ipsen would acquire all shares not acquired in the tender offer through a second-step merger for the same consideration that the tendering stockholders will receive in the tender offer. It is anticipated the transaction will close by end of Q1  2023.AdvisorsGoldman Sachs is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Ipsen and Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP as legal counsel to Ipsen. Centerview Partners is serving as exclusive financial advisor to Albireo. Chestnut Partners also provided advice to Albireo. Paul  Weiss  Rifkind  Wharton & Garrison and Mintz  Levin  Cohn  Ferris  Glovsky and Popeo  P.C are serving as legal counsel to Albireo.Conference callA conference call and webcast for investors and analysts will begin today at 3pm  Paris time. Participants can access the call and its details by registering here; webcast details can be found here. A recording will be available on ipsen.com.About Bylvay® (odevixibat)Bylvay (odevixibat) is a potent  non-systemic ileal bile acid transport inhibitor (IBATi). It is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of pruritus in patients three months of age and older with PFIC 1 where it has orphan exclusivity. Bylvay is launched in the U.S.  where it is supported by a program designed to assist with access to treatment and patient support. Bylvay is also approved in the E.U. for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older.2 It has launched in over nine countries and has secured public reimbursement across several major markets including Germany  Italy  UK  France and Belgium.View full E.U. prescribing information here: Bylvay  INN-odevixibat (europa.eu)View full U.S. prescribing information here: label (fda.gov)A second potential indication for Bylvay in patients with ALGS has been submitted as a supplemental New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a variation application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in December 2022.Bylvay is being investigated in biliary atresia  a severe and potentially fatal pediatric liver disease  in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial.About PFICPFIC is a spectrum8-11 of autosomal recessive genetic disorders in which cholestasis may lead to end-stage liver disease.12 The estimated global incidence of PFIC is 1 in 100 000 live births.12 Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 500 PFIC patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment. Subtypes PFIC1  PFIC2 and PFIC3 are the most common.12 In addition  other rare forms of PFIC exist with varying degrees of cholestasis.13 Patients with PFIC have impaired bile flow  or cholestasis  and the resulting bile build-up in liver cells causes liver disease and symptoms. The most debilitating symptom of PFIC is pruritus (itching)  which may be so severe that it leads to skin mutilation  loss of sleep  irritability  poor attention and impaired school performance.11 Up to 80% of PFIC patients suffer from severe pruritus  associated with abrasions  skin mutilation  hemorrhage or scarring.14About PEDFIC 1 and 2The PEDFIC trials (NCT03566238 and NCT03659916) represented the largest trials ever completed in children with PFIC. PEDFIC 1 was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III trial aiming to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Bylvay in reducing pruritus and serum bile acids (sBAs) in children with PFIC. All patients enrolled in PEDFIC-1 were eligible to participate in PEDFIC 2  a long-term  open-label extension phase.About Alagille syndromeALGS is an inherited rare  genetic disorder that can affect multiple organ systems in the body including the liver  heart  skeleton  eyes and kidneys. Liver damage may result from having fewer than normal  narrowed or malformed bile ducts  which leads to toxic bile acid build-up  which in turn can cause scarring and progressive liver disease.15 Approximately 95% of patients with the condition present with chronic cholestasis  usually within the first three months of life and as many as 88% also present with severe  intractable pruritus.16 17 The estimated global incidence of ALGS is 3 in 100 000 live births.18 Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 1 300 patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment.About ASSERTASSERT (NCT04674761) is a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Bylvay (odevixibat) for 24 weeks in patients with ALGS up to 17 years of age. The primary endpoint evaluates the impact of odevixibat on pruritus score compared to placebo. Key secondary endpoints measure changes in serum bile acid levels and safety and tolerability. Top-line results were presented at the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) Conference in November 2022  supporting the efficacy and safety of Bylvay in patients with ALGS: Improvement in pruritus scores and reduction in serum bile acid levels were statistically significant compared to placebo. Additionally  Bylvay led to significant sleep improvements over time. There were no trial discontinuations and all patients completed the initial 24 weeks treatment duration  with 96% rolled over into the open-label extension trial. Low rates of diarrhea were reported during the trial.About biliary atresiaBA is a rare pediatric liver disease. Symptoms typically develop about two to eight weeks after birth and there are no approved pharmacological therapies. Damaged or absent bile ducts outside the liver result in bile and bile acids being trapped inside the liver  quickly resulting in cirrhosis and liver failure requiring liver transplantation. At the time of diagnosis  a hepatic portoenterostomy (HPE) called Kasai procedure is performed to create a conduit allowing biliary drainage. The rate of success in re-establishing bile flow is dependent on the age of the infant when the HPE is performed. Kasai procedure is not curative and most patients who have BA have progressive disease  with at least 80% requiring liver transplantation by age 20 years.19 Of those who survive into the third decade after birth  almost all have portal hypertension or other complications of cirrhosis.20 New therapies are therefore needed to delay or avoid the need for liver transplantation following Kasai procedure.21 There are currently no approved pharmacological treatments for biliary atresia. There is an estimated incidence of 5/6 per 100 000 live births worldwide with BA22. Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 750 patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment.About BOLDBOLD (NCT04336722) is a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bylvay (odevixibat) in children who have biliary atresia and have undergone a Kasai procedure before age three months. Children in the treatment arm receive Bylvay 120 μg/kg orally once daily for 24 months. The primary efficacy endpoint is improvement in the proportion of patients who are alive and have not undergone a liver transplant after two years of treatment compared to placebo  and secondary outcome measures include time to onset of any sentinel events  total bilirubin levels and sBA levels.About AlbireoAlbireo is a rare disease company focused on the development of novel bile acid modulators to treat pediatric and adult liver diseases. Albireo’s lead product  Bylvay  was approved by the U.S. FDA as the first drug for the treatment of pruritus in all types of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC)  and in Europe for the treatment of PFIC. Bylvay is also being developed to treat other rare pediatric cholestatic liver diseases with a completed Phase III trial in ALGS  an ongoing Phase III study in biliary atresia  as well as Open-label Extension (OLE) studies for PFIC and ALGS. The company has also completed a Phase I clinical trial for A3907 to advance development in adult cholestatic liver disease  with IND-enabling studies progressing with A2342 for viral and cholestatic liver disease.

The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof and  other than as required by applicable law  none of the Albireo  Ipsen or any of their respective affiliates undertakes any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information or statements.Ipsen’s forward-looking statementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.comAbout the OfferThe tender offer for the outstanding shares of Albireo common stock referenced in this press release has not yet commenced.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}A proposed merger between two poultry feed giants is to be scrutinised under a full-scale investigation after the competition watchdog said the pair had failed to address its concerns.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it is referring the planned tie-up between the animal feed milling operations owned by ForFarmers UK and 2Agriculture for a so-called phase two probe  having warned last month that the deal could lead to price increases for farmers and push up costs for shoppers.An initial investigation into the deal found concerns in four local areas across East Anglia  north-western England and North Wales  according to the CMA.The CMA said the deal could reduce competition in those areas and lead to higher prices for poultry feed  lower quality feed  or have an impact on service  which could ultimately raise prices for consumers.The firms submitted a proposal on December 30 to try to ease the CMA’s concerns  but the regulator said it was not suitable and would therefore refer the deal for an in-depth inquiry.ForFarmers and 2Agriculture  which is owned by Boparan  both make and supply chicken and other types of poultry feed in the UK.They announced plans in July to combine their animal feed milling operations – spanning 19 mills across the UK.The competition concerns centre on four of the feed mills operated by the two businesses – in Burston  Norfolk; Bury  Greater Manchester; Llay  near Wrexham in North Wales; and Preston  Lancashire.The combined businesses would account for between 50% and 60% of the supply of meat poultry feed to third parties in three of these areas – Burston  Bury and Llay – and between 40% and 50% in Preston.The CMA said it is also concerned that the joint venture could unfairly favour Boparan’s chicken farming and processing businesses.This would see less choice for smaller chicken farmers and processors  who might rely on ForFarmers and Boparan for their chicken feed.ForFarmers UK is a subsidiary of Dutch-based ForFarmers NV  which was founded as a farmer co-operative in 1896 and is now listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange.Boparan’s 2Agriculture is one of the UK’s largest poultry feed suppliers and uses its production to supply Hook2Sisters  which is linked to Boparan.Boparan also owns 2 Sisters Food Group  which supplies about a third of the chicken on UK supermarket shelves.,neutral,0.04,0.96,0.0,mixed,0.16,0.08,0.76,True,English,"['Poultry feed deal', 'depth inquiry', 'competition watchdog', 'free real time breaking news alerts', 'free breaking news emails', 'Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange', 'animal feed milling operations', 'largest poultry feed suppliers', 'two poultry feed giants', 'valid email address', 'phase two probe', 'lower quality feed', 'meat poultry feed', '2 Sisters Food Group', 'Dutch-based ForFarmers NV', 'four local areas', 'UK supermarket shelves', 'smaller chicken farmers', 'two businesses', 'chicken feed', 'feed mills', 'The Independent', 'privacy notice', 'full-scale investigation', 'Markets Authority', 'price increases', 'initial investigation', 'East Anglia', 'north-western England', 'North Wales', 'depth inquiry', 'other types', 'Greater Manchester', 'combined businesses', 'joint venture', 'processing businesses', 'less choice', 'farmer co', 'chicken farming', 'competition watchdog', 'The Competition', 'higher prices', 'third parties', 'ForFarmers UK', 'The CMA', '19 mills', 'inbox', 'offers', 'events', 'updates', 'verifyErrors', 'Something', 'merger', 'pair', 'concerns', 'tie-up', '2Agriculture', 'deal', 'costs', 'shoppers', 'impact', 'service', 'consumers', 'firms', 'proposal', 'December', 'regulator', 'Boparan', 'plans', 'July', 'Burston', 'Norfolk', 'Bury', 'Llay', 'Wrexham', 'Preston', 'Lancashire', 'supply', 'processors', 'subsidiary', 'operative', 'production', 'Hook2Sisters']",2023-01-09,2023-01-09,independent.co.uk

A guide explaining how to vote  and notably how to vote by internet  will be posted on Nicox’s website by January 24  2023. Shareholders may also contact the Company’s Investor Relations team at ag2023nicox@nicox.com for any question on the voting process.In the event the quorum is not reached on first call  Nicox will convene an ordinary shareholder meeting on second call on Tuesday February 28  2023 at 2:00 pm CEST in the offices of BuroClub - Drakkar 2 - Bâtiment D - 2405 route des Dolines - 06560 Valbonne - France.Proposed Transfer of the listing of Nicox’s securities to the Euronext Growth marketThis ordinary shareholder meeting will decide on the proposed transfer of the listing of securities issued by the Company from the Euronext Paris regulated market to the Euronext Growth Paris multilateral trading facility (the “Transfer”)  and will be asked to grant the Board of Directors all the powers necessary to carry out this Transfer.Euronext Growth Paris is a market organized by Euronext Paris. It is not a regulated market  but a multilateral trading facility organized within the meaning of article 525-1 of the General regulations of the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF). Its organizational rules are approved by the AMF.The Board of Directors considers that this proposed transfer would allow the Company to have its securities admitted to trading on a market more commensurate with its size and market capitalization. The transfer to Euronext Growth Paris should enable the Company to reduce its obligations and constraints (under the conditions detailed below) and  as a result  reduce the costs associated with its listing  while maintaining the shares' tradability on a financial market.Main consequences of the proposed Transfer (non-exhaustive list)In accordance with articles L. 421-14 of the Monetary and Financial Code and 223-36 of the General regulation of the AMF  the Company hereby informs its shareholders of the main consequences of the Transfer.With regards to the periodic information:The half-yearly report  including the half-yearly (and consolidated) financial statements and an activity report relating to these half-yearly financial statements  would be published within four months following the end of the first half of the Company's fiscal year  instead of the period of three months following the end of the first half of the fiscal year applicable to companies whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market; in addition  the review of the half-yearly financial statements by the statutory auditors would no longer be required.Lighter information will be required in the management report and the corporate governance report.The Company will continue to prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS.The Company will continue with its current reporting frequency with regards to quarterly updates.With regards to the permanent information:As Euronext Growth Paris is a multilateral trading facility  the Company would remain subject to the provisions applicable to permanent market disclosure  and  in particular  to the provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 16  2014 on market abuse (“MAR”). Any company listed on Euronext Growth Paris must ensure the effective and full dissemination of the so-called regulated information.In addition  the Company's managers and persons having a close relationship with them would remain subject to the obligation to report transactions on the shares or debt securities of the Company pursuant to article 19 of MAR.With regards to the protection of minority shareholders  the Company would be subject to the regulations applicable to companies listed on Euronext Growth Paris:Unless an exemption is granted  the protection of minority shareholders is ensured on Euronext Growth Paris by the mechanism of a mandatory public tender offer in the event that the threshold of 50% of the share capital or voting rights is crossed  directly or indirectly  alone or in concert.Only the crossing  upwards or downwards  of the thresholds of 50% and 95% of the share capital or voting rights must be reported to the AMF and the Company  subject to the crossing of statutory thresholds to be reported to the Company.However  both the public tender offer regulations and the threshold disclosure requirements applicable to companies whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market would remain applicable for three years from the date of admission of the Company's securities to the Euronext Growth Paris multilateral trading facility.With regards to the general meetings  the publication and reporting requirements would be slightly modified  principally as follows:The documents relating to shareholder meetings provided to shareholders should be published on the Company's website only on the date of the convening of meeting  as opposed to 21 days before the date of the meeting.The notice of availability of the preparatory documents for the general meeting would no longer be required.The publication on the Company's website of the results of the votes and the minutes of the general meeting would no longer be required.Principal additional changes are as follows:The Company would no longer be subject to the ""say on pay"" regulation  which provides for an ex-ante vote by the shareholders on executive’s compensation policy  an ex-post vote on the report on compensation and the approval of individual executive compensation.The Company would no longer be required to report on internal control or risk management.The Company would no longer be subject to the provisions of articles L. 823-19 et seq. of the French Commercial Code relating to audit committees.As Euronext Growth Paris is not a regulated market  the transfer to Euronext Growth Paris could result in a change in the liquidity of the shares which could differ from the liquidity observed since the beginning of the Company's listing on the Euronext Paris regulated market.Indicative timetable for the proposed Transfer (subject to its validation by Euronext Paris)If the Company’s shareholders approve the contemplated Transfer  and subject to the market operator’s approval  the Company’s securities would be listed and traded on the Euronext Growth Paris market no earlier than two months after the ordinary shareholder meeting having approved the Transfer  such meeting being scheduled for February 14  2023  and within 12 months of the date of that meeting.The Company will appoint a Listing Sponsor  within the timeframe stipulated by applicable

The transfer to Euronext Growth Paris should enable the Company to reduce its obligations and constraints (under the conditions detailed below) and  as a result  reduce the costs associated with its listing  while maintaining the shares' tradability on a financial market.Main consequences of the proposed Transfer (non-exhaustive list)In accordance with articles L. 421-14 of the Monetary and Financial Code and 223-36 of the General regulation of the AMF  the Company hereby informs its shareholders of the main consequences of the Transfer.With regards to the periodic information:The half-yearly report  including the half-yearly (and consolidated) financial statements and an activity report relating to these half-yearly financial statements  would be published within four months following the end of the first half of the Company's fiscal year  instead of the period of three months following the end of the first half of the fiscal year applicable to companies whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market; in addition  the review of the half-yearly financial statements by the statutory auditors would no longer be required.Lighter information will be required in the management report and the corporate governance report.The Company will continue to prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS.The Company will continue with its current reporting frequency with regards to quarterly updates.With regards to the permanent information:As Euronext Growth Paris is a multilateral trading facility  the Company would remain subject to the provisions applicable to permanent market disclosure  and  in particular  to the provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 16  2014 on market abuse (“MAR”). Any company listed on Euronext Growth Paris must ensure the effective and full dissemination of the so-called regulated information.In addition  the Company's managers and persons having a close relationship with them would remain subject to the obligation to report transactions on the shares or debt securities of the Company pursuant to article 19 of MAR.With regards to the protection of minority shareholders  the Company would be subject to the regulations applicable to companies listed on Euronext Growth Paris:Unless an exemption is granted  the protection of minority shareholders is ensured on Euronext Growth Paris by the mechanism of a mandatory public tender offer in the event that the threshold of 50% of the share capital or voting rights is crossed  directly or indirectly  alone or in concert.Only the crossing  upwards or downwards  of the thresholds of 50% and 95% of the share capital or voting rights must be reported to the AMF and the Company  subject to the crossing of statutory thresholds to be reported to the Company.However  both the public tender offer regulations and the threshold disclosure requirements applicable to companies whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market would remain applicable for three years from the date of admission of the Company's securities to the Euronext Growth Paris multilateral trading facility.With regards to the general meetings  the publication and reporting requirements would be slightly modified  principally as follows:The documents relating to shareholder meetings provided to shareholders should be published on the Company's website only on the date of the convening of meeting  as opposed to 21 days before the date of the meeting.The notice of availability of the preparatory documents for the general meeting would no longer be required.The publication on the Company's website of the results of the votes and the minutes of the general meeting would no longer be required.Principal additional changes are as follows:The Company would no longer be subject to the ""say on pay"" regulation  which provides for an ex-ante vote by the shareholders on executive’s compensation policy  an ex-post vote on the report on compensation and the approval of individual executive compensation.The Company would no longer be required to report on internal control or risk management.The Company would no longer be subject to the provisions of articles L. 823-19 et seq. of the French Commercial Code relating to audit committees.As Euronext Growth Paris is not a regulated market  the transfer to Euronext Growth Paris could result in a change in the liquidity of the shares which could differ from the liquidity observed since the beginning of the Company's listing on the Euronext Paris regulated market.Indicative timetable for the proposed Transfer (subject to its validation by Euronext Paris)If the Company’s shareholders approve the contemplated Transfer  and subject to the market operator’s approval  the Company’s securities would be listed and traded on the Euronext Growth Paris market no earlier than two months after the ordinary shareholder meeting having approved the Transfer  such meeting being scheduled for February 14  2023  and within 12 months of the date of that meeting.The Company will appoint a Listing Sponsor  within the timeframe stipulated by applicable regulations  to assist the Company with respect to the contemplated Transfer.Date Operation January 4  2023 Decision of the Board of Directors to convene an ordinary shareholder meeting to vote on the

Find out why I'm bullish on the stock.,"Manuel Milan/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield (OTCPK:UNBLF) (OTC:URMCY) is one of the largest commercial real estate REITs in the world. While the REIT seemed to have bitten off more than it could chew with the pre-COVID acquisition of Westfield  an Australia-based commercial real estate REIT  it spent the past few years on getting itself sorted out. The management took the courageous but wise decision to cancel the dividend for a few years. This enables Unibail to retain hundreds of millions in cash to protect its balance sheet while it is also selling assets. It looks like the market has given up on Unibail due to the lack of a dividend  but I think the REIT could be in a stronger position than ever before by the end of this year.Yahoo FinanceUnibail has its primary listing on Euronext Amsterdam where it's trading with URW as its ticker symbol. The average daily volume in Amsterdam is just under 700 000 shares  representing a monetary value of 35M EUR (and close to $40M). As Amsterdam offers the best liquidity to trade in Unibail’s shares  I would strongly recommend to use that exchange to trade in the company’s securities. I will use the Euro as base currency throughout this article.Selling the US portfolio is slower than I had expected – but the prices are betterWhen I discussed Unibail in 2022  the REIT had just organized a capital markets date with an encouraging update and outlook for 2024. The REIT mentioned it planned to entirely exit the US market and focus on quality.One of the most important slides presented during the capital markets day was this sensitivity analysis. Unibail provided investors with how the sale of the US portfolio would impact the LTV ratios of the REIT on post-deal basis. I was perhaps a bit surprised the REIT even provided the outcome of a scenario where the US assets would be sold at a 50% discount (!) to their respective book values but even in this scenario the LTV ratio would stay below 39% and even if one would include the hybrid bond (deeply subordinated debt which is actually added to the equity portion of the balance sheet due to its status)  the LTV ratio would be a very manageable 43.6%.Unibail Investor RelationsThis actually was one of the main reasons why I started keeping close tabs on Unibail again. While the scenario of selling the US assets at a 50% discount sounded ridiculous  I would have been perfectly fine with the ""minus 30% scenario"" as in that scenario the LTV ratio would also be a very manageable 33%. So whatever happens to the US portfolio  Unibail will emerge as a stronger REIT. Sure there will be earnings implications but for a REIT whose existence was threatened during the COVID pandemic  strengthening the balance sheet is priority number one.Subsequent to the capital markets day  Unibail announced the sale of two European assets. I admittedly scratched my head as I was expecting the US asset sales to be prioritized  but this doesn’t mean this was a bad move by Unibail. The 116M EUR sale of a German property was completed at a premium to book value while the sale of a Dutch mall was completed at book value. These two transactions already helped to rapidly reduce the gross debt and net debt on the balance sheet. And at the end of the third quarter  Unibail sold a French mall which allowed it to reach a total disposal value of 3.2B EUR of the 4B EUR it was eyeing to sell. The average sales price of those assets was a premium of approximately 5% to the book value.I thought that was great  but the market didn’t care and in the weeks subsequent to the completion of the sale of the French mall  Unibail’s shares traded at a level we hadn’t seen since Q4 2020.I did understand the impatience of the market  as everyone was waiting for the sale of the US portfolio but investors had to wait for about five months after the capital markets day before seeing the first substantial US asset sale. The Westfield Santa Ana asset was sold for $537.5M which represented a discount of less than 11% on the book value.A second noteworthy sale in the USA was completed right before the end of the financial year as Unibail sold the San Fernando Valley asset for $325M  again at a discount of less than 11% to the book value.While selling assets at a discount to their book value never is a good thing to do  the in excess of $1B in US asset sales confirm one thing: The discount to the book value is lower than I had anticipated. Even my conservative scenario of conceding a 30% discount to the book value now appears to be too conservative. Which means that Unibail now has a very good chance to reach an LTV ratio of less than 30% upon the completion of the sale of the US assets. That would make the balance sheet one of the best and most robust in the European commercial real estate segment of the market.Subsequent to the capital markets day  Unibail did provide a new sensitivity analysis taking the asset sales up until the end of Q3 but excluding the Westfield Santa Ana sale into account.Unibail Investor RelationsSo even if the remainder of the US portfolio would be sold at a 20% discount  the LTV ratio would be less than 30%.The recent asset disposals will help to protect the book value  while the earnings will remain strongThe downside of selling assets is quite obviously that a REIT is no longer able to collect the rent. This means the net rental income and cash flows will suffer. That being said  it will also allow Unibail to repay some of its most expensive debt which means the actual net impact on the FFO should remain limited.Unibail reports its FFO as AREPS  Annual Recurring EPS. It basically is the net income but excluding the property valuations which can have an impact on the bottom line. Although REPS is not a European standard (that would be EPRA earnings) and although Unibail does not report the US-equivalent FFO  we should consider the REPS to be the FFO-equivalent.Unfortunately Unibail only provides detailed financial statements every six months  but the Q3 Trading Update did contain some interesting information. The net debt decreased by 800M EUR during the third quarter to 23.3B EUR  and Unibail’s sale of the San Fernando Valley asset in combination with retained earnings  will for sure result in a net debt level of less than 23B EUR as of the end of 2022. Unibail also had 3B EUR in cash on hand and had access to 10B EUR in credit lines so liquidity for sure is not an issue at this time. The REIT estimates that its existing cash and credit lines could take care of all of its financing needs for the next three years (including dividend payments and the repayment of a hybrid bond).The REIT also hiked its AREPS guidance from 8.90 EUR to 9.10 EUR. This indeed means the REIT is currently trading at just six times its AREPS which by itself is cheap. Too cheap.Sure  the AREPS will decrease as Unibail completes its asset disposal program  but Unibail will also be able to rapidly reduce its interest expenses so I expect the net impact to be relatively limited. Unibail paid 225M EUR in net finance expenses in the first half of this year (335M EUR in interest expenses partially offset by roughly 110M EUR in interest income on derivatives).Unibail Investor RelationsThe higher interest rates on the market does mean I will have to fine-tune my expectations for 2024. Unibail originally expected to generate a Net Rental Income of 1.57B EUR. I will use 1.65B EUR as updated basis given the current strong performance.I'm slightly lowering my G&A expenses to 170M EUR (a 20% decrease from FY 2021 with inflation partially offsetting the cost savings related to exiting the US market) but I’m afraid I will have to strongly increase my anticipated interest expenses. Assuming the gross debt will decrease to 12B EUR while the average interest rate increases to 4% (the full effect will only be felt from 2026 on as Unibail has hedged its entire interest rate exposure)  the new interest expense will increase to 480M EUR. This would indicate Unibail’s ARE would come in at 1B EUR. We would still have to deduct the 50M EUR in payments on the deeply subordinated debt and about 75M EUR in annual earnings attributable to non-controlling interests.Unibail Investor RelationsThis would indicate the shareholders of Unibail can look forward to 875M EUR in Annual Recurring Earnings and divided over 139M shares  the AREPS would be 6.3 EUR per share. Applying a multiple of 12 which really isn’t unreasonable considering the LTV ratio will likely be less than 30% would result in a fair value of 75 EUR per share.More importantly  applying a payout ratio of 75% would indicate a dividend of 4.8 UR per share. And should Unibail decide to repay it hybrid debt securities  the 75% payout ratio would imply a dividend of 5.1 EUR per share. I think it is increasingly likely Unibail will call the hybrid securities as the interest rate will reset this year and based on the current five-year Euro-midswap  Unibail would have to start paying 4.5-5% on these securities.Unibail Investor RelationsInvestment thesisI initiated a small long position in October and am looking to expand this position during 2023. My preferred way to gain additional exposure is by writing put options with various strike prices and expiry dates. The market is pricing the options as if it doesn’t believe Unibail will execute on its transformation plan. I think the REIT will be able to sell its US assets at a decent price and even if it takes longer than anticipated  so be it. I also wouldn’t mind if the very first distribution after the reinstatement would be a small one if that would allow Unibail to hoard a few hundred million euro of additional cash.As mentioned  the option premiums to write put options are surprisingly high. You can write a P50 or P45 for March for an option premium of respectively 3.25 EUR and 1.80 EUR. Meanwhile  a P45 for September can be written for 4.65 EUR while a P35 for September would still get you an option premium of in excess of 2 EUR. I personally don’t think the share price will drop to those levels but I think I’d be happy to pick up tock at those levels. And for those who would want to go a little bit more aggressive: the P60 for December of this year has an option premium of 13.00 EUR. Which means that you either pocket the 13 EUR premium if the option isn’t exercised  or you’d establish a position at 60-13 = 47 EUR per share.The market isn’t giving Unibail enough credit for what it has already done and I think the market is wrong. The immediate and acute balance sheet danger no longer exists and I’m fine with Unibail selling down its US portfolio asset by asset. I expect the REIT to generate north of 6 EUR per share in FFO after completing the asset sales while the dividend yield could easily approach 10%.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Our clinical and regulatory development teams have done a remarkable job  particularly in discussions with the European regulatory authorities (EMA) for our Phase 2/3 study ACTISAVE  in order to advance the preparation of a marketing authorization application for glenzocimab in stroke. We have fully met our patient enrollment goals in 2022 and are involving new countries and hospitals in 2023. We are proud that the enrollment of patients in the Phase 2/3 GREEN study  promoted by the AP-HP in the framework of the RHU BOOSTER  has started. We look forward to continuing the clinical development of glenzocimab in the treatment of myocardial infarction in partnership with the University of Birmingham (UK). We will keep up our efforts to provide a therapeutic solution to this unmet medical need in cardiovascular emergencies.”1) ACTISAVE: Phase 2/3 clinical study in strokeStudy design and regulatory discussionsACTISAVE (NCT05070260) is a multinational  adaptive  multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group Phase 2/3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a single dose of glenzocimab used in combination with standard of care (thrombolysis +/- thrombectomy) for acute ischemic stroke. The study is being conducted in 7 European countries  UK  Israel  and the USA.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the adaptive design strategy and validated the choice of a dual primary endpoint: an ordinal endpoint of the difference between the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)1 and a binary endpoint of the percentage of patients with severe disability or death  i.e. an mRS score of 4-6. The recognition of this pivotal study design supports a future application for marketing authorization for glenzocimab in stroke in Europe.In the context of the ""PRIME"" status received in July 2022  a program aimed at optimizing the development plan to speed up patient access to the drug candidate  the company is continuing its interactions with the EMA.In the United States  discussions are underway with the American regulatory agency (FDA) to set up a Type C meeting to validate the design and statistical analysis of the study in support of a future Biologic License Application (BLA) in the United States. An amendment to the study protocol allowing the use of the two recognized thrombolytic agents in stroke management  tenecteplase (TNK) and alteplase  was submitted to the FDA in November 2022  and is awaiting approval by the Ethics Review Board (IRB). Two patients have been enrolled to date. This amendment should accelerate enrollment  given the massive use of TNK in U.S. hospitals.Number of patients recruited to date: 203 patients.Next clinical step: an initial futility analysis is planned when 100 patients will be enrolled with thrombolysis + thrombectomy  treated and followed for 90 days to confirm the safety of the study and ensure that the preliminary results are consistent with the original trial assumptions. Results of this futility study are expected in the 3rd quarter 2023.2) GREEN: Phase 2/3 clinical trial in strokeStudy designGREEN (NCT05559398) is a randomized  double-blind  multicenter  placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 study of the efficacy and safety of glenzocimab as an adjunct to mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke. The GREEN study is conducted under the auspices of the Paris Public Hospitals (Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris)  and is part of the RHU BOOSTER  receiving financial support from the French National Research Agency (Agence Nationale de la Recherche) and the Government’s ‘Investments for the Future’ program (Programme Investissements d’Avenir).The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of glenzocimab in combination with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) versus EVT alone on 90-day functional outcome (mRS). Secondary objectives are to evaluate the impact of glenzocimab on overall survival  reperfusion  clinical improvement at 24 hours  symptomatic and asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage  serious adverse events (SAEs)  serious unexpected adverse events (SUSARs) and quality of life. This study will include nearly 260 patients eligible for mechanical thrombectomy in 11 French neurovascular units and institutions of excellence.Number of patients recruited to date: 1 patient.Next clinical step: an interim analysis will be performed after the first 78 patients are included and is expected end of 2023.3) LIBERATE: Phase 2b clinical trial in the treatment of myocardial infarctionStudy designLIBERATE (IRAS -1005400) is a randomized  double-blind  Phase 2b study that will include more than 200 patients in the acute phase of myocardial infarction to test the safety and efficacy of glenzocimab 1000 mg versus placebo in reducing cardiac damage remote from the infarction. This study is being conducted in partnership with the University of Birmingham (UK)  with expert clinicians from the Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust.Current status of the study: file being submitted to the UK regulatory authorities.Next clinical step: Inclusion of the first patient planned for the second quarter of 2023.4) Other indications for cardiovascular emergenciesAt this stage of development  Acticor Biotech has decided to focus its efforts on the development of glenzocimab in stroke and myocardial infarction with three ongoing studies (ACTISAVE  GREEN and LIBERATE) and to postpone the launch of its Phase 2 study  BREATHE in pulmonary embolism.About ACTICOR BIOTECHActicor Biotech is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company  a spin-off from INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research)  which is aiming to develop an innovative treatment for cardiovascular emergencies  including ischemic stroke.Acticor Biotech is developing glenzocimab (ACT017)  a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) fragment directed against a novel target of major interest  platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI). Glenzocimab inhibits platelet binding to the thrombus without affecting physiological hemostasis  thereby limiting the bleeding risk  particularly in the brain.In May 2022  Acticor Biotech presented positive results from its Phase 1b/2a study  ACTIMIS  at the ESOC  confirming the safety profile and showing a reduction in mortality and intracerebral hemorrhage in the glenzocimab-treated group in patients with stroke. The efficacy of glenzocimab is now being evaluated in an international Phase 2/3 study  ACTISAVE  which will include 1 000 patients.

This transaction is aligned with the Company’s determination to actively pursue the redemption of the French State support package and the granted liquidity measures  in combination with its recovery path and sustainability ambition.This transaction issuance is framed into the newly set Air France-KLM's Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework  aligned with the Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles (“SLBP”) published by the ICMA in June 2020  and received a Second Party Opinion from Moody’s Investors Services with a qualification of “Significant contribution to Sustainability”.This inaugural transaction links the Company’s financial strategy with its environmental objectives and represents an additional milestone in Air France-KLM’s ambition to achieve its decarbonization targets  as a leader for a more sustainable aviation industry. As such  it represents the first public sustainability-linked bond issuance in EUR in the airline sector.The Air France-KLM Group and its airlines are fully committed to reducing their environmental footprint as part of a transparent and responsible approach to sustainability  with the objective to diminish its well-to-wake scope 1 and 3 jet fuel greenhouse gas protocol emissions by 30% per revenue tonne kilometre (RTK) by 2030 compared to 2019. In that context  the SBTi’s Target Validation Team approved in December 2022 the Group’s scope 1 and scope 3 emissions reduction targets and has confirmed that they are in line with a well-below 2°C objective  as determined by the Paris Agreement signed in 2015.The Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework and the Second-Party Opinion are available at: https://www.airfranceklm.com/en/finance/investors-and-analysts/debtAn application will be made for the bonds to be admitted to trading on Euronext Paris.Natixis acted as sole sustainability structuring advisor and Deutsche Bank  HSBC  Natixis  Société Générale and Crédit Agricole CIB acted as joint bookrunners of the transaction.Investor RelationsFrédéric Kahane Michiel Klinkersfrkahane@airfranceklm.com michiel.klinkers@airfranceklm.comWebsite: www.airfranceklm.comAttachment,neutral,0.1,0.89,0.0,mixed,0.41,0.16,0.43,True,English,"['inaugural sustainability-linked bonds', 'total aggregate amount', 'Air France-KLM', 'successful issuance', 'bn', 'Frédéric Kahane Michiel Klinkers', '3 jet fuel greenhouse gas protocol emissions', 'Société Générale', 'first public sustainability-linked bond issuance', 'Crédit Agricole CIB', 'sole sustainability structuring advisor', 'Air France–KLM Group', 'French State support package', 'scope 3 emissions reduction targets', 'The Air France-KLM Group', 'Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles', 'Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework', 'first sustainability-linked bonds', 'sustainable transformation plan', 'sustainable aviation industry', 'strong investor interest', 'outstanding bank loan', 'Strong investor demand', 'total aggregate amount', 'Second Party Opinion', 'wider decarbonization roadmap', 'revenue tonne kilometre', 'Target Validation Team', 'inaugural sustainability-linked bonds', 'debt redemption profile', 'GHG) emissions', 'decarbonization targets', 'successful issuance', 'additional support', 'Deutsche Bank', 'Investor Relations', 'debt reprofiling', 'nominal amount', 'Second-Party Opinion', 'decarbonization trajectory', 'transaction issuance', 'financial flexibility', 'two tranches', '3.3-year maturity', '5.3-year maturity', 'Covid-19 crisis', 'coming years', 'additional leeway', 'partial redemption', 'recovery path', 'Significant contribution', 'financial strategy', 'environmental objectives', 'additional milestone', 'airline sector', 'environmental footprint', 'responsible approach', 'joint bookrunners', 'inaugural transaction', 'Bonds’ coupons', 'investors’ confidence', 'Investors Services', 'Paris Agreement', 'Euronext Paris', 'liquidity measures', 'sustainability ambition', '2°C objective', '9 January', 'offer', 'orderbook', 'size', 'wake', 'RTK', 'proceeds', 'May', 'Company', '2019 baseline', '2030 SBTi', 'testament', 'creditworthiness', 'renewal', 'fleet', 'PGE', 'determination', 'combination', 'SLBP', 'ICMA', 'June', 'Moody', 'qualification', 'leader', 'airlines', 'transparent', 'context', 'December', 'airfranceklm', 'finance', 'analysts', 'application', 'Natixis', 'HSBC', 'Website', 'Attachment', '7.', '8.1']",2023-01-09,2023-01-09,marketscreener.com

At the same time  UCB also announces that in 2022  Cimzia® (certolizumab pegol) has reached its guided peak sales target of € 2bn ahead of time (expected by 2024).""We are satisfied with our operating performance in 2022 "" says Sandrine Dufour  CFO of UCB. ""Thanks to the performance of our key products  the successful integration of our latest acquisition as well as cost discipline  wise resource allocations and efficiencies  we expect to land at the upper end of the ranges of our financial guidance given earlier in 2022. We are also very confident about the future of UCB. We will give a financial guidance for 2023 on 22 February 2023. At this point in time  we're already sharing the expected peak sales for Fintepla® (fenfluramine) of € 800 million by 2027.""Reaching the upper end of UCB's financial guidance - despite the macroeconomic headwinds - is mainly driven by the solid performance of the company's core products  like Cimzia® (certolizumab pegol) and Vimpat® (lacosamide)  as well as cost discipline  wise resource allocations  efficiencies and the meanwhile successful finished integration of Zogenix (acquired in March 2022) being less dilutive than expected.UCB will publish its Full Year 2022 financial results on 22nd of February at 7am CET.About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise.

Epub 2017 Jun 1.      Attachments   Original Link   Original Document   Permalink ...https://www.marketscree…,"PARIS  FRANCE & BOSTON  U.S.  09 January 2023 - Ipsen (Euronext: IPN: ADR: IPSEY) and Albireo (Nasdaq: ALBO) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Ipsen will acquire Albireo  a leading innovator in bile-acid modulators to treat pediatric and adult cholestatic liver diseases. The anticipated acquisition will enrich Ipsen's Rare Disease portfolio and pipeline.The lead medicine in Albireo's pipeline is Bylvay® (odevixibat)  a potent  once-daily  oral  non-systemic ileal bile acid transport inhibitor (IBATi). Bylvay was approved in 2021 in the U.S. for the treatment of pruritus in patients three months of age and older with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC)1  and in the E.U. for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older.2 Pruritus is one of the most prominent and problematic manifestations of the disease 3 often resulting in severely diminished quality of life.4 Bylvay has orphan exclusivity for the approved indications in PFIC in the U.S. and E.U.""We are excited about the potential of Albireo's assets and scientific expertise  which we gain through this acquisition  and we believe this is a compelling growth opportunity for Ipsen."" said David Loew  Chief Executive Officer of Ipsen. ""Our Rare Disease franchise is strengthened with Bylvay  which  in addition to being the first-approved treatment in PFIC  has two further indications being investigated in rare liver conditions that are underserved. Additionally  Bylvay and the clinical and preclinical novel bile acid transport inhibitors in Albireo's portfolio complement our own pipeline in liver disease.""""Unwavering dedication to patients and commitment to science have always been the north star for Albireo. This focus has driven us to develop and gain approval for Bylvay as the first drug treatment for PFIC "" said Ron Cooper  President and Chief Executive Officer of Albireo. ""Our talented team at Albireo have advanced the first Phase III studies in three different pediatric liver diseases while discovering two promising new clinical stage bile acid modulators. We believe that Ipsen is well positioned to apply its global R&D and commercial capabilities to make these medicines available to more cholestatic liver disease patients and accelerate the mission of providing hope for families. ""In addition to this lead indication  Albireo announced in December 2022 that supplementary regulatory filings have been made for Bylvay in the E.U. and the U.S. for Alagille syndrome (ALGS). ALGS is a rare  genetic disorder that can affect multiple organ systems  including the liver  with a paucity of bile ducts preventing bile flow from the liver to the small intestine. The most debilitating symptom of ALGS is severe pruritus.5 In the Phase III ASSERT trial  treatment with Bylvay met both primary and secondary endpoints and was associated with statistically significant improvements in pruritus severity and reductions in serum bile acid levels compared to placebo  and was well tolerated.6Furthermore  Bylvay is in late-stage development for biliary atresia (BA). It is currently being investigated in the BOLD study  the first  prospective double-blind  Phase III clinical trial in BA  a rare  pediatric liver disease that can result in cirrhosis and liver failure and is the leading cause of liver transplantation among children.7 Orphan drug designations have been granted in both ALGS and BA indications in the U.S. and E.U.As part of the transaction  Ipsen will also acquire Albireo's clinical stage asset A3907  a novel oral systemic apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) inhibitor currently in development for adult cholestatic liver disease  such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)  which could complement Ipsen´s existing development programs. In addition to Bylvay and A3907  Albireo's pipeline includes A2342  an oral systemic sodium-taurocholate co-transporting peptide (NTCP) inhibitor being evaluated for viral and cholestatic diseases  which is moving ahead in investigational new drug (IND)-enabling trials.Financial highlightsThe acquisition of Albireo will provide immediate incremental sales and strengthen Ipsen's rare disease infrastructure. Albireo guided for total Bylvay revenues of $24 million for 2022. Given the level of ongoing R&D expenses  the transaction is expected to be dilutive to Ipsen's core operating income until the end of 2024. This is in line with Ipsen's medium-term outlook regarding its strategic focus on building a high-value and sustainable pipeline through external innovation. The Group will provide its annual guidance for 2023 in February.Transaction detailsUnder the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  Ipsen  through a fully-owned subsidiary  will initiate a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Albireo at a price of $42.00 per share in cash at the closing of the transaction  for an initial estimated aggregate consideration of $952 million plus one contingent value right (CVR) per share. Each CVR will entitle its holder to deferred cash payments of $10.00 per CVR payable upon the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Bylvay in the Biliary Atresia indication at the latest by 31 December 2027  allowing for a potential increase in the number of patients in the BOLD study.The $42.00 per-share cash consideration represents a premium of 104% compared to Albireo's 1-month volume-weighted average price of $20.60 preceding announcement of the transaction. The transaction will be fully financed by Ipsen's existing cash and lines of credit. The Board of Directors of Albireo has unanimously approved the transaction and recommended that the stockholders of Albireo tender their shares in the tender offer.The closing of the tender offer will be subject to customary conditions  including the tender of shares which represent at least a majority of the total number of Albireo's outstanding shares  the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and the receipt of consents of  or filings with  any governmental body or pursuant to certain foreign antitrust laws and the expiration of any applicable waiting period and other customary conditions. Upon the successful completion of the tender offer  Ipsen would acquire all shares not acquired in the tender offer through a second-step merger for the same consideration that the tendering stockholders will receive in the tender offer. It is anticipated the transaction will close by end of Q1  2023.AdvisorsGoldman Sachs is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Ipsen and Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP as legal counsel to Ipsen. Centerview Partners is serving as exclusive financial advisor to Albireo. Chestnut Partners also provided advice to Albireo. Paul  Weiss  Rifkind  Wharton & Garrison and Mintz  Levin  Cohn  Ferris  Glovsky and Popeo  P.C are serving as legal counsel to Albireo.Conference callA conference call and webcast for investors and analysts will begin today at 3pm  Paris time.

It is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of pruritus in patients three months of age and older with PFIC 1 where it has orphan exclusivity. Bylvay is launched in the U.S.  where it is supported by a program designed to assist with access to treatment and patient support. Bylvay is also approved in the E.U. for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older.2 It has launched in over nine countries and has secured public reimbursement across several major markets including Germany  Italy  UK  France and Belgium.View full E.U. prescribing information here: Bylvay  INN-odevixibat (europa.eu)View full U.S. prescribing information here: label (fda.gov)A second potential indication for Bylvay in patients with ALGS has been submitted as a supplemental New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a variation application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in December 2022.Bylvay is being investigated in biliary atresia  a severe and potentially fatal pediatric liver disease  in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial.About PFICPFIC is a spectrum8-11 of autosomal recessive genetic disorders in which cholestasis may lead to end-stage liver disease.12 The estimated global incidence of PFIC is 1 in 100 000 live births.12 Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 500 PFIC patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment. Subtypes PFIC1  PFIC2 and PFIC3 are the most common.12 In addition  other rare forms of PFIC exist with varying degrees of cholestasis.13 Patients with PFIC have impaired bile flow  or cholestasis  and the resulting bile build-up in liver cells causes liver disease and symptoms. The most debilitating symptom of PFIC is pruritus (itching)  which may be so severe that it leads to skin mutilation  loss of sleep  irritability  poor attention and impaired school performance.11 Up to 80% of PFIC patients suffer from severe pruritus  associated with abrasions  skin mutilation  hemorrhage or scarring.14About PEDFIC 1 and 2The PEDFIC trials (NCT03566238 and NCT03659916) represented the largest trials ever completed in children with PFIC. PEDFIC 1 was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III trial aiming to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Bylvay in reducing pruritus and serum bile acids (sBAs) in children with PFIC. All patients enrolled in PEDFIC-1 were eligible to participate in PEDFIC 2  a long-term  open-label extension phase.About Alagille syndromeALGS is an inherited rare  genetic disorder that can affect multiple organ systems in the body including the liver  heart  skeleton  eyes and kidneys. Liver damage may result from having fewer than normal  narrowed or malformed bile ducts  which leads to toxic bile acid build-up  which in turn can cause scarring and progressive liver disease.15 Approximately 95% of patients with the condition present with chronic cholestasis  usually within the first three months of life and as many as 88% also present with severe  intractable pruritus.16 17 The estimated global incidence of ALGS is 3 in 100 000 live births.18 Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 1 300 patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment.About ASSERTASSERT (NCT04674761) is a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Bylvay (odevixibat) for 24 weeks in patients with ALGS up to 17 years of age. The primary endpoint evaluates the impact of odevixibat on pruritus score compared to placebo. Key secondary endpoints measure changes in serum bile acid levels and safety and tolerability. Top-line results were presented at the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) Conference in November 2022  supporting the efficacy and safety of Bylvay in patients with ALGS: Improvement in pruritus scores and reduction in serum bile acid levels were statistically significant compared to placebo. Additionally  Bylvay led to significant sleep improvements over time. There were no trial discontinuations and all patients completed the initial 24 weeks treatment duration  with 96% rolled over into the open-label extension trial. Low rates of diarrhea were reported during the trial.About biliary atresiaBA is a rare pediatric liver disease. Symptoms typically develop about two to eight weeks after birth and there are no approved pharmacological therapies. Damaged or absent bile ducts outside the liver result in bile and bile acids being trapped inside the liver  quickly resulting in cirrhosis and liver failure requiring liver transplantation. At the time of diagnosis  a hepatic portoenterostomy (HPE) called Kasai procedure is performed to create a conduit allowing biliary drainage. The rate of success in re-establishing bile flow is dependent on the age of the infant when the HPE is performed. Kasai procedure is not curative and most patients who have BA have progressive disease  with at least 80% requiring liver transplantation by age 20 years.19 Of those who survive into the third decade after birth  almost all have portal hypertension or other complications of cirrhosis.20 New therapies are therefore needed to delay or avoid the need for liver transplantation following Kasai procedure.21 There are currently no approved pharmacological treatments for biliary atresia. There is an estimated incidence of 5/6 per 100 000 live births worldwide with BA22. Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 750 patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment.About BOLDBOLD (NCT04336722) is a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bylvay (odevixibat) in children who have biliary atresia and have undergone a Kasai procedure before age three months. Children in the treatment arm receive Bylvay 120 μg/kg orally once daily for 24 months. The primary efficacy endpoint is improvement in the proportion of patients who are alive and have not undergone a liver transplant after two years of treatment compared to placebo  and secondary outcome measures include time to onset of any sentinel events  total bilirubin levels and sBA levels.About AlbireoAlbireo is a rare disease company focused on the development of novel bile acid modulators to treat pediatric and adult liver diseases. Albireo's lead product  Bylvay  was approved by the U.S. FDA as the first drug for the treatment of pruritus in all types of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC)  and in Europe for the treatment of PFIC. Bylvay is also being developed to treat other rare pediatric cholestatic liver diseases with a completed Phase III trial in ALGS  an ongoing Phase III study in biliary atresia  as well as Open-label Extension (OLE) studies for PFIC and ALGS. The company has also completed a Phase I clinical trial for A3907 to advance development in adult cholestatic liver disease  with IND-enabling studies progressing with A2342 for viral and cholestatic liver disease. Albireo was spun out from AstraZeneca in 2008 and is headquartered in Boston  Massachusetts  with its key operating subsidiary in Gothenburg  Sweden.

The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof and  other than as required by applicable law  none of the Albireo  Ipsen or any of their respective affiliates undertakes any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information or statements.Ipsen's forward-looking statementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen's management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen's future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words 'believes'  'anticipates' and 'expects' and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen's expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen's patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen's activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen's partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen's business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen's business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen's 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.comAbout the OfferThe tender offer for the outstanding shares of Albireo common stock referenced in this press release has not yet commenced.

The anticipated acquisition will enrich Ipsen's Rare Disease portfolio and pipeline.The lead medicine in Albireo's pipeline is Bylvay ® (odevixibat)  a potent  once-daily  oral  non-systemic ileal bile acid transport inhibitor (IBATi). Bylvay was approved in 2021 in the U.S. for the treatment of pruritus in patients three months of age and older with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC)1  and in the E.U. for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older.2 Pruritus is one of the most prominent and problematic manifestations of the disease 3 often resulting in severely diminished quality of life.4 Bylvay has orphan exclusivity for the approved indications in PFIC in the U.S. and E.U.""We are excited about the potential of Albireo's assets and scientific expertise  which we gain through this acquisition  and we believe this is a compelling growth opportunity for Ipsen."" said David Loew  Chief Executive Officer of Ipsen. ""Our Rare Disease franchise is strengthened with Bylvay  which  in addition to being the first-approved treatment in PFIC  has two further indications being investigated in rare liver conditions that are underserved. Additionally  Bylvay and the clinical and preclinical novel bile acid transport inhibitors in Albireo's portfolio complement our own pipeline in liver disease.""""Unwavering dedication to patients and commitment to science have always been the north star for Albireo. This focus has driven us to develop and gain approval for Bylvay as the first drug treatment for PFIC "" said Ron Cooper  President and Chief Executive Officer of Albireo. ""Our talented team at Albireo have advanced the first Phase III studies in three different pediatric liver diseases while discovering two promising new clinical stage bile acid modulators. We believe that Ipsen is well positioned to apply its global R&D and commercial capabilities to make these medicines available to more cholestatic liver disease patients and accelerate the mission of providing hope for families. ""In addition to this lead indication  Albireo announced in December 2022 that supplementary regulatory filings have been made for Bylvay in the E.U. and the U.S. for Alagille syndrome (ALGS). ALGS is a rare  genetic disorder that can affect multiple organ systems  including the liver  with a paucity of bile ducts preventing bile flow from the liver to the small intestine. The most debilitating symptom of ALGS is severe pruritus.5 In the Phase III ASSERT trial  treatment with Bylvay met both primary and secondary endpoints and was associated with statistically significant improvements in pruritus severity and reductions in serum bile acid levels compared to placebo  and was well tolerated.6Furthermore  Bylvay is in late-stage development for biliary atresia (BA). It is currently being investigated in the BOLD study  the first  prospective double-blind  Phase III clinical trial in BA  a rare  pediatric liver disease that can result in cirrhosis and liver failure and is the leading cause of liver transplantation among children.7 Orphan drug designations have been granted in both ALGS and BA indications in the U.S. and E.U.As part of the transaction  Ipsen will also acquire Albireo's clinical stage asset A3907  a novel oral systemic apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) inhibitor currently in development for adult cholestatic liver disease  such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)  which could complement Ipsen´s existing development programs. In addition to Bylvay and A3907  Albireo's pipeline includes A2342  an oral systemic sodium-taurocholate co-transporting peptide (NTCP) inhibitor being evaluated for viral and cholestatic diseases  which is moving ahead in investigational new drug (IND)-enabling trials.Financial highlightsThe acquisition of Albireo will provide immediate incremental sales and strengthen Ipsen's rare disease infrastructure. Albireo guided for total Bylvay revenues of $24 million for 2022. Given the level of ongoing R&D expenses  the transaction is expected to be dilutive to Ipsen's core operating income until the end of 2024. This is in line with Ipsen's medium-term outlook regarding its strategic focus on building a high-value and sustainable pipeline through external innovation. The Group will provide its annual guidance for 2023 in February.Transaction detailsUnder the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  Ipsen  through a fully-owned subsidiary  will initiate a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Albireo at a price of $42.00 per share in cash at the closing of the transaction  for an initial estimated aggregate consideration of $952 million plus one contingent value right (CVR) per share. Each CVR will entitle its holder to deferred cash payments of $10.00 per CVR payable upon the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Bylvay in the Biliary Atresia indication at the latest by 31 December 2027  allowing for a potential increase in the number of patients in the BOLD study.The $42.00 per-share cash consideration represents a premium of 104% compared to Albireo's 1-month volume-weighted average price of $20.60 preceding announcement of the transaction. The transaction will be fully financed by Ipsen's existing cash and lines of credit. The Board of Directors of Albireo has unanimously approved the transaction and recommended that the stockholders of Albireo tender their shares in the tender offer.The closing of the tender offer will be subject to customary conditions  including the tender of shares which represent at least a majority of the total number of Albireo's outstanding shares  the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and the receipt of consents of  or filings with  any governmental body or pursuant to certain foreign antitrust laws and the expiration of any applicable waiting period and other customary conditions. Upon the successful completion of the tender offer  Ipsen would acquire all shares not acquired in the tender offer through a second-step merger for the same consideration that the tendering stockholders will receive in the tender offer. It is anticipated the transaction will close by end of Q1  2023.AdvisorsGoldman Sachs is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Ipsen and Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP as legal counsel to Ipsen.

It is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of pruritus in patients three months of age and older with PFIC 1 where it has orphan exclusivity. Bylvay is launched in the U.S.  where it is supported by a program designed to assist with access to treatment and patient support. Bylvay is also approved in the E.U. for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older.2 It has launched in over nine countries and has secured public reimbursement across several major markets including Germany  Italy  UK  France and Belgium.View full E.U. prescribing information here: Bylvay  INN-odevixibat (europa.eu)View full U.S. prescribing information here: label (fda.gov)A second potential indication for Bylvay in patients with ALGS has been submitted as a supplemental New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a variation application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in December 2022.Bylvay is being investigated in biliary atresia  a severe and potentially fatal pediatric liver disease  in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial.About PFICPFIC is a spectrum8-11 of autosomal recessive genetic disorders in which cholestasis may lead to end-stage liver disease.12 The estimated global incidence of PFIC is 1 in 100 000 live births.12 Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 500 PFIC patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment. Subtypes PFIC1  PFIC2 and PFIC3 are the most common.12 In addition  other rare forms of PFIC exist with varying degrees of cholestasis.13 Patients with PFIC have impaired bile flow  or cholestasis  and the resulting bile build-up in liver cells causes liver disease and symptoms. The most debilitating symptom of PFIC is pruritus (itching)  which may be so severe that it leads to skin mutilation  loss of sleep  irritability  poor attention and impaired school performance.11 Up to 80% of PFIC patients suffer from severe pruritus  associated with abrasions  skin mutilation  hemorrhage or scarring.14About PEDFIC 1 and 2The PEDFIC trials (NCT03566238 and NCT03659916) represented the largest trials ever completed in children with PFIC. PEDFIC 1 was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III trial aiming to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Bylvay in reducing pruritus and serum bile acids (sBAs) in children with PFIC. All patients enrolled in PEDFIC-1 were eligible to participate in PEDFIC 2  a long-term  open-label extension phase.About Alagille syndromeALGS is an inherited rare  genetic disorder that can affect multiple organ systems in the body including the liver  heart  skeleton  eyes and kidneys. Liver damage may result from having fewer than normal  narrowed or malformed bile ducts  which leads to toxic bile acid build-up  which in turn can cause scarring and progressive liver disease.15 Approximately 95% of patients with the condition present with chronic cholestasis  usually within the first three months of life and as many as 88% also present with severe  intractable pruritus.16 17 The estimated global incidence of ALGS is 3 in100 000 live births.18 Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 1 300 patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment.About ASSERTASSERT (NCT04674761) is a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Bylvay (odevixibat) for 24 weeks in patients with ALGS up to 17 years of age. The primary endpoint evaluates the impact of odevixibat on pruritus score compared to placebo. Key secondary endpoints measure changes in serum bile acid levels and safety and tolerability. Top-line results were presented at the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) Conference in November 2022  supporting the efficacy and safety of Bylvay in patients with ALGS: Improvement in pruritus scores and reduction in serum bile acid levels were statistically significant compared to placebo. Additionally  Bylvay led to significant sleep improvements over time. There were no trial discontinuations and all patients completed the initial 24 weeks treatment duration  with 96% rolled over into the open-label extension trial. Low rates of diarrhea were reported during the trial.About biliary atresiaBA is a rare pediatric liver disease. Symptoms typically develop about two to eight weeks after birth and there are no approved pharmacological therapies. Damaged or absent bile ducts outside the liver result in bile and bile acids being trapped inside the liver  quickly resulting in cirrhosis and liver failure requiring liver transplantation. At the time of diagnosis  a hepatic portoenterostomy (HPE) called Kasai procedure is performed to create a conduit allowing biliary drainage. The rate of success in re-establishing bile flow is dependent on the age of the infant when the HPE is performed. Kasai procedure is not curative and most patients who have BA have progressive disease  with at least 80% requiring liver transplantation by age 20 years.19 Of those who survive into the third decade after birth  almost all have portal hypertension or other complications of cirrhosis.20 New therapies are therefore needed to delay or avoid the need for liver transplantation following Kasai procedure.21 There are currently no approved pharmacological treatments for biliary atresia. There is an estimated incidence of 5/6 per 100 000 live births worldwide with BA22. Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 750 patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment.About BOLDBOLD ( NCT04336722 ) is a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bylvay (odevixibat) in children who have biliary atresia and have undergone a Kasai procedure before age three months. Children in the treatment arm receive Bylvay 120 μg/kg orally once daily for 24 months. The primary efficacy endpoint is improvement in the proportion of patients who are alive and have not undergone a liver transplant after two years of treatment compared to placebo  and secondary outcome measures include time to onset of any sentinel events  total bilirubin levels and sBA levels.About AlbireoAlbireo is a rare disease company focused on the development of novel bile acid modulators to treat pediatric and adult liver diseases. Albireo's lead product  Bylvay  was approved by the U.S. FDA as the first drug for the treatment of pruritus in all types of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC)  and in Europe for the treatment of PFIC. Bylvay is also being developed to treat other rare pediatric cholestatic liver diseases with a completed Phase III trial in ALGS  an ongoing Phase III study in biliary atresia  as well as Open-label Extension (OLE) studies for PFIC and ALGS. The company has also completed a Phase I clinical trial for A3907 to advance development in adult cholestatic liver disease  with IND-enabling studies progressing with A2342 for viral and cholestatic liver disease.

Although the Albireo's management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable  investors are cautioned that forward-looking information and statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties  many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of the Albireo  that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied or projected by  the forward-looking information and statements. These risks and uncertainties include among other things  (i) uncertainties as to the timing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; (ii) the risk that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement may not be completed in a timely manner or at all; (iii) uncertainties as to the percentage of the Albireo's stockholders tendering their Shares in the Offer; (iv) the possibility that competing offers for the Albireo may be made; (v) the possibility that any or all of the various conditions to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement may not be satisfied or waived  including the failure to receive any required regulatory approvals (or any conditions  limitations or restrictions placed on such approvals); (vi) the occurrence of any event  change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement  including in circumstances which would require the Albireo to pay a termination fee; (vii) the risk that the milestone specified in the CVR Agreement is not achieved; (viii) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on the Albireo's ability to retain and hire key personnel  its ability to maintain relationships with its customers  suppliers and others with whom it does business  or its business generally; (ix) risks related to diverting management's attention from the Albireo's ongoing business operations; (x) the risk that stockholder litigation in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement may result in significant costs of defense  indemnification and liability; as well as (xi) risks and uncertainties pertaining to the Albireo's business  including those detailed under ""Risk Factors"" and ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" in the Albireo's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31  2021  quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  such as the risk that the regulatory filings made for Bylvay in patients with ALGS will not be approved by the FDA and EMA and on the timelines the Albireo anticipates; the risk that the FDA and EMA will not complete their respective reviews within target timelines  once determined; the risk that the FDA and EMA will require additional information  the risk that we will not be able to provide in a timely manner any additional information that the FDA and EMA request  and the risk that such additional information will not be satisfactory to the FDA and EMA; the risk that Bylvay will not be commercially successful; the risk that we may encounter issues  delays or other challenges in commercializing Bylvay; the risk that Bylvay does not receives acceptance from patients and physicians for its approved indication; the risk of challenges associated with execution of the Albireo's sales activities  which in each case could limit the potential of its product; the risk of challenges associated with supply and distribution activities  which in each case could limit the Albireo's sales and the availability of its product; the risk of potential negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic  including on manufacturing  supply  conduct or initiation of clinical trials  or other aspects of our business; the risk that favorable findings from clinical trials of Bylvay to date  including findings in PFIC  ALGS and other indications  will be predictive of results from other clinical trials of Bylvay; the risk that Bylvay will not be approved in jurisdictions or for indications beyond the jurisdictions in which or indications (such as biliary atresia or ALGS) for which Bylvay is currently approved; the risk that the Albireo's other product candidates will not be approved; the risk that estimates of the addressable patient population for target indications may prove to be incorrect; the outcome and interpretation by regulatory authorities of the ongoing third-party study pooling and analyzing of long-term PFIC patient data; the timing for initiation or completion of  or for availability of data from  clinical trials of Bylvay  including BOLD  and the Phase 2 clinical trial of A3907  and the outcomes of such trials; the Albireo's ability to obtain coverage  pricing or reimbursement for approved products in the United States or Europe; delays or other challenges in the recruitment of patients for  or the conduct of  the Albireo's clinical trials; any repurchase by the Albireo of Sagard's interest in the royalty interest payments under our royalty monetization agreement with Sagard could materially impact our financial condition; and the Albireo's critical accounting policies. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof and  other than as required by applicable law  none of the Albireo  Ipsen or any of their respective affiliates undertakes any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information or statements.Ipsen's forward-looking statementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen's management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen's future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words 'believes'  'anticipates' and 'expects' and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen's expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen's patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen's activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen's partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen's business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen's business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen's 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.comAbout the OfferThe tender offer for the outstanding shares of Albireo common stock referenced in this press release has not yet commenced.

Those shareholders are cashing out at a sale price of $14.50 plus $2.50 in contingent value if the business hits performance targets set by Chiesi.The sale will see early Raglan investors exit  including Mr Friel  co-founder and CEO Dr Joe Wiley  CFO Rory Nealon and chair Ray Stafford.The transaction suggests that trade buyers in the life sciences sector are willing to pay up for the right assets  despite negative market trends that have pushed valuations down.“Hedge funds and other large investors wouldn’t have sold without such a high premium ” said Mr Friel. “It’s something you see more often in biotech where the share price doesn’t almost reflect the real value of the company.”Amryt shares have languished below its IPO price for much of this year  partly because of generally poor sentiment towards equities and partly because investors were wary of the company’s $200m debt load.With Amryt’s debt at about five times the company’s earnings guidance in early 2022  the market took some convincing that the company was worth a higher share price.The company refinanced $95m of its debt early last year with an $85m term loan and a $40m revolving credit facility  but even with a healthy amount of cash on the balance sheet  the shares didn’t regain their traction.But  as frequently happens in biotech and pharma  the buyer wanted assets the seller owned.It is understood that Chiesi was an underbidder when Amryt bought Aegerion out of bankruptcy in 2019  acquiring two regulator-approved drugs that were generating revenues in Europe and the US already.“A take-out was always the exit plan ” said Mr Friel. “You use public markets to pick up assets and issue paper. People hold on the basis that big pharma will take you out  just like in the oil and gas industry.”Amryt originated in 2016 as a reverse takeover shell to acquire Fastnet  the listed oil and gas explorer chaired by Mr Friel.Mr Friel’s reasoning  amid a catastrophic collapse in the price of oil  was that pharma companies operated on similar risk/reward principles as exploration firms.“Either you find an amazing molecule or you buy struggling  underperforming assets and develop them. That's what we did ” he said.Those original early investors took the punt by funding a convertible loan note which gave them an option on shares at a 30pc discount to the IPO price when the company was listing on Euronext Dublin and AIM.The move to Nasdaq unlocked a lot of value and ultimately made it a target for a motivated buyer – a trick Mr Friel is now trying to repeat with Raglan-backed Poolbeg Pharma and Hvivo.,neutral,0.28,0.72,0.01,mixed,0.12,0.05,0.84,True,English,"['lucrative return', 'Chiesi Pharma', '$1.48bn deal', 'Investors', 'Amryt', 'rare disease drug maker', '$40m revolving credit facility', 'Nasdaq initial public offering', 'early Raglan investors exit', 'Raglan managing director', 'a half years', 'Dr Joe Wiley', 'CFO Rory Nealon', 'life sciences sector', '$85m term loan', 'reverse takeover shell', 'similar risk/reward principles', 'convertible loan note', '10 Raglan Capital investors', 'other large investors', 'original early investors', 'Raglan-backed Poolbeg Pharma', 'negative market trends', 'two regulator-approved drugs', '$200m debt load', 'higher share price', 'founder Cathal Friel', 'exit plan', 'public markets', 'Early shareholders', 'big pharma', 'Mr Friel', 'massive premium', '107pc premium', 'performance targets', 'Ray Stafford', 'trade buyers', 'Hedge funds', 'high premium', 'IPO price', 'poor sentiment', 'five times', 'earnings guidance', 'healthy amount', 'balance sheet', 'catastrophic collapse', 'exploration firms', 'amazing molecule', '30pc discount', 'Euronext Dublin', 'contingent value', 'real value', 'Chiesi Pharma', 'Amryt Pharma', 'sale price', 'right assets', 'gas industry', 'underperforming assets', 'motivated buyer', 'Amryt shares', 'investment', 'Italy', 'group', 'average', 'founding', 'milestones', '$1.48bn', 'deal', 'company', 'money', 'July', 'business', 'CEO', 'chair', 'transaction', 'something', 'biotech', 'equities', 'convincing', 'cash', 'seller', 'underbidder', 'Aegerion', 'bankruptcy', 'revenues', 'Europe', 'paper', 'People', 'basis', 'oil', 'Fastnet', 'explorer', 'reasoning', 'companies', 'punt', 'option', 'AIM', 'move', 'lot', 'trick', 'Hvivo']",2023-01-09,2023-01-09,independent.ie

These documents will also be made available to shareholders at the headquarters of the Company and on its website (www.nicox.com) by January 24  2023.Shareholders may vote by proxy  by internet or by attending the ordinary shareholder meeting in person.

It is not a regulated market  but a multilateral trading facility organized within the meaning of article 525-1 of the General regulations of the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF). Its organizational rules are approved by the AMF.The Board of Directors considers that this proposed transfer would allow the Company to have its securities admitted to trading on a market more commensurate with its size and market capitalization. The transfer to Euronext Growth Paris should enable the Company to reduce its obligations and constraints (under the conditions detailed below) and  as a result  reduce the costs associated with its listing  while maintaining the shares' tradability on a financial market.Main consequences of the proposed Transfer (non-exhaustive list)In accordance with articles L. 421-14 of the Monetary and Financial Code and 223-36 of the General regulation of the AMF  the Company hereby informs its shareholders of the main consequences of the Transfer.With regards to the periodic information:The half-yearly report  including the half-yearly (and consolidated) financial statements and an activity report relating to these half-yearly financial statements  would be published within four months following the end of the first half of the Company's fiscal year  instead of the period of three months following the end of the first half of the fiscal year applicable to companies whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market; in addition  the review of the half-yearly financial statements by the statutory auditors would no longer be required.Lighter information will be required in the management report and the corporate governance report.The Company will continue to prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS.The Company will continue with its current reporting frequency with regards to quarterly updates.With regards to the permanent information:As Euronext Growth Paris is a multilateral trading facility  the Company would remain subject to the provisions applicable to permanent market disclosure  and  in particular  to the provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 16  2014 on market abuse (“MAR”). Any company listed on Euronext Growth Paris must ensure the effective and full dissemination of the so-called regulated information.In addition  the Company's managers and persons having a close relationship with them would remain subject to the obligation to report transactions on the shares or debt securities of the Company pursuant to article 19 of MAR.With regards to the protection of minority shareholders  the Company would be subject to the regulations applicable to companies listed on Euronext Growth Paris:Unless an exemption is granted  the protection of minority shareholders is ensured on Euronext Growth Paris by the mechanism of a mandatory public tender offer in the event that the threshold of 50% of the share capital or voting rights is crossed  directly or indirectly  alone or in concert.Only the crossing  upwards or downwards  of the thresholds of 50% and 95% of the share capital or voting rights must be reported to the AMF and the Company  subject to the crossing of statutory thresholds to be reported to the Company.However  both the public tender offer regulations and the threshold disclosure requirements applicable to companies whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market would remain applicable for three years from the date of admission of the Company's securities to the Euronext Growth Paris multilateral trading facility.With regards to the general meetings  the publication and reporting requirements would be slightly modified  principally as follows:The documents relating to shareholder meetings provided to shareholders should be published on the Company's website only on the date of the convening of meeting  as opposed to 21 days before the date of the meeting.The notice of availability of the preparatory documents for the general meeting would no longer be required.The publication on the Company's website of the results of the votes and the minutes of the general meeting would no longer be required.Principal additional changes are as follows:The Company would no longer be subject to the ""say on pay"" regulation  which provides for an ex-ante vote by the shareholders on executive’s compensation policy  an ex-post vote on the report on compensation and the approval of individual executive compensation.The Company would no longer be required to report on internal control or risk management.The Company would no longer be subject to the provisions of articles L. 823-19 et seq. of the French Commercial Code relating to audit committees.As Euronext Growth Paris is not a regulated market  the transfer to Euronext Growth Paris could result in a change in the liquidity of the shares which could differ from the liquidity observed since the beginning of the Company's listing on the Euronext Paris regulated market.Indicative timetable for the proposed Transfer (subject to its validation by Euronext Paris)If the Company’s shareholders approve the contemplated Transfer  and subject to the market operator’s approval  the Company’s securities would be listed and traded on the Euronext Growth Paris market no earlier than two months after the ordinary shareholder meeting having approved the Transfer  such meeting being scheduled for February 14  2023  and within 12 months of the date of that meeting.The Company will appoint a Listing Sponsor  within the timeframe stipulated by applicable regulations  to assist the Company with respect to the contemplated Transfer.Date Operation January 4  2023 Decision of the Board of Directors to convene an ordinary shareholder meeting to vote on the
