And all this in strict compliance with the EU Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO). Schwörer employees use the newly developed employee app either as a desktop app on the browser of their computer or tablet or on their cell phone.A unique feature of the CompanyMessenger is that no personal cell phone number of the employee is required to use it; instead  communication takes place exclusively via a unique user ID. CompanyMessenger accesses the central contact book of the Schwörer Group and not the employee's personal contacts.And this is how simply the new CompanyMessenger works for all Schwörer employees: The employee downloads the app from the Apple or Google app stores onto his or her chosen end device and can start immediately by entering the personnel number and individual login data.In addition to chat communication  Schwörer's marketing department also uses the so-called ""News Editor"" and sends push messages to all Schwörer employees or just to one of the seven Schwörer plants.

16119,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230108005085/en/Ipsen-to-Acquire-Albireo-Accelerating-Growth-in-Rare-Disease-With-Treatments-for-Several-Pediatric-Liver-Diseases,Ipsen to Acquire Albireo Accelerating Growth in Rare Disease With Treatments for Several Pediatric Liver Diseases,PARIS & BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News: Ipsen (Euronext: IPN: ADR: IPSEY) and Albireo (Nasdaq: ALBO) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Ipsen will acquire Albireo  a leading innovator in bile-acid m…,PARIS & BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Ipsen (Euronext: IPN: ADR: IPSEY) and Albireo (Nasdaq: ALBO) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Ipsen will acquire Albireo  a leading innovator in bile-acid modulators to treat pediatric and adult cholestatic liver diseases. The anticipated acquisition will enrich Ipsen’s Rare Disease portfolio and pipeline.The lead medicine in Albireo’s pipeline is Bylvay® (odevixibat)  a potent  once-daily  oral  non-systemic ileal bile acid transport inhibitor (IBATi). Bylvay was approved in 2021 in the U.S. for the treatment of pruritus in patients three months of age and older with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC)1  and in the E.U. for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older.2 Pruritus is one of the most prominent and problematic manifestations of the disease 3 often resulting in severely diminished quality of life.4 Bylvay has orphan exclusivity for the approved indications in PFIC in the U.S. and E.U.“ We are excited about the potential of Albireo’s assets and scientific expertise  which we gain through this acquisition  and we believe this is a compelling growth opportunity for Ipsen.” said David Loew  Chief Executive Officer of Ipsen. “ Our Rare Disease franchise is strengthened with Bylvay  which  in addition to being the first-approved treatment in PFIC  has two further indications being investigated in rare liver conditions that are underserved. Additionally  Bylvay and the clinical and preclinical novel bile acid transport inhibitors in Albireo’s portfolio complement our own pipeline in liver disease.”“ Unwavering dedication to patients and commitment to science have always been the north star for Albireo. This focus has driven us to develop and gain approval for Bylvay as the first drug treatment for PFIC ” said Ron Cooper  President and Chief Executive Officer of Albireo. “ Our talented team at Albireo have advanced the first Phase III studies in three different pediatric liver diseases while discovering two promising new clinical stage bile acid modulators. We believe that Ipsen is well positioned to apply its global R&D and commercial capabilities to make these medicines available to more cholestatic liver disease patients and accelerate the mission of providing hope for families. ”In addition to this lead indication  Albireo announced in December 2022 that supplementary regulatory filings have been made for Bylvay in the E.U. and the U.S. for Alagille syndrome (ALGS). ALGS is a rare  genetic disorder that can affect multiple organ systems  including the liver  with a paucity of bile ducts preventing bile flow from the liver to the small intestine. The most debilitating symptom of ALGS is severe pruritus.5 In the Phase III ASSERT trial  treatment with Bylvay met both primary and secondary endpoints and was associated with statistically significant improvements in pruritus severity and reductions in serum bile acid levels compared to placebo  and was well tolerated.6Furthermore  Bylvay is in late-stage development for biliary atresia (BA). It is currently being investigated in the BOLD study  the first  prospective double-blind  Phase III clinical trial in BA  a rare  pediatric liver disease that can result in cirrhosis and liver failure and is the leading cause of liver transplantation among children.7 Orphan drug designations have been granted in both ALGS and BA indications in the U.S. and E.U.As part of the transaction  Ipsen will also acquire Albireo’s clinical stage asset A3907  a novel oral systemic apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) inhibitor currently in development for adult cholestatic liver disease  such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)  which could complement Ipsen´s existing development programs. In addition to Bylvay and A3907  Albireo’s pipeline includes A2342  an oral systemic sodium-taurocholate co-transporting peptide (NTCP) inhibitor being evaluated for viral and cholestatic diseases  which is moving ahead in investigational new drug (IND)-enabling trials.Financial highlightsThe acquisition of Albireo will provide immediate incremental sales and strengthen Ipsen’s rare disease infrastructure. Albireo guided for total Bylvay revenues of $24 million for 2022. Given the level of ongoing R&D expenses  the transaction is expected to be dilutive to Ipsen’s core operating income until the end of 2024. This is in line with Ipsen’s medium-term outlook regarding its strategic focus on building a high-value and sustainable pipeline through external innovation. The Group will provide its annual guidance for 2023 in February.Transaction detailsUnder the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  Ipsen  through a fully-owned subsidiary  will initiate a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Albireo at a price of $42.00 per share in cash at the closing of the transaction  for an initial estimated aggregate consideration of $952 million plus one contingent value right (CVR) per share. Each CVR will entitle its holder to deferred cash payments of $10.00 per CVR payable upon the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Bylvay in the Biliary Atresia indication at the latest by 31 December 2027  allowing for a potential increase in the number of patients in the BOLD study.The $42.00 per-share cash consideration represents a premium of 104% compared to Albireo’s 1-month volume-weighted average price of $20.60 preceding announcement of the transaction. The transaction will be fully financed by Ipsen’s existing cash and lines of credit. The Board of Directors of Albireo has unanimously approved the transaction and recommended that the stockholders of Albireo tender their shares in the tender offer.The closing of the tender offer will be subject to customary conditions  including the tender of shares which represent at least a majority of the total number of Albireo’s outstanding shares  the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and the receipt of consents of  or filings with  any governmental body or pursuant to certain foreign antitrust laws and the expiration of any applicable waiting period and other customary conditions. Upon the successful completion of the tender offer  Ipsen would acquire all shares not acquired in the tender offer through a second-step merger for the same consideration that the tendering stockholders will receive in the tender offer. It is anticipated the transaction will close by end of Q1  2023.AdvisorsGoldman Sachs is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Ipsen and Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP as legal counsel to Ipsen. Centerview Partners is serving as exclusive financial advisor to Albireo. Chestnut Partners also provided advice to Albireo. Paul  Weiss  Rifkind  Wharton & Garrison and Mintz  Levin  Cohn  Ferris  Glovsky and Popeo  P.C are serving as legal counsel to Albireo.Conference callA conference call and webcast for investors and analysts will begin today at 3pm  Paris time. Participants can access the call and its details by registering here; webcast details can be found here. A recording will be available on ipsen.com.About Bylvay® (odevixibat)Bylvay (odevixibat) is a potent  non-systemic ileal bile acid transport inhibitor (IBATi). It is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of pruritus in patients three months of age and older with PFIC 1 where it has orphan exclusivity. Bylvay is launched in the U.S.  where it is supported by a program designed to assist with access to treatment and patient support. Bylvay is also approved in the E.U. for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older.2 It has launched in over nine countries and has secured public reimbursement across several major markets including Germany  Italy  UK  France and Belgium.View full E.U. prescribing information here: Bylvay  INN-odevixibat (europa.eu)View full U.S. prescribing information here: label (fda.gov)A second potential indication for Bylvay in patients with ALGS has been submitted as a supplemental New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a variation application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in December 2022.Bylvay is being investigated in biliary atresia  a severe and potentially fatal pediatric liver disease  in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial.About PFICPFIC is a spectrum8-11 of autosomal recessive genetic disorders in which cholestasis may lead to end-stage liver disease.12 The estimated global incidence of PFIC is 1 in 100 000 live births.12 Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 500 PFIC patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment. Subtypes PFIC1  PFIC2 and PFIC3 are the most common.12 In addition  other rare forms of PFIC exist with varying degrees of cholestasis.13 Patients with PFIC have impaired bile flow  or cholestasis  and the resulting bile build-up in liver cells causes liver disease and symptoms. The most debilitating symptom of PFIC is pruritus (itching)  which may be so severe that it leads to skin mutilation  loss of sleep  irritability  poor attention and impaired school performance.11 Up to 80% of PFIC patients suffer from severe pruritus  associated with abrasions  skin mutilation  hemorrhage or scarring.14About PEDFIC 1 and 2The PEDFIC trials (NCT03566238 and NCT03659916) represented the largest trials ever completed in children with PFIC. PEDFIC 1 was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III trial aiming to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Bylvay in reducing pruritus and serum bile acids (sBAs) in children with PFIC. All patients enrolled in PEDFIC-1 were eligible to participate in PEDFIC 2  a long-term  open-label extension phase.About Alagille syndromeALGS is an inherited rare  genetic disorder that can affect multiple organ systems in the body including the liver  heart  skeleton  eyes and kidneys. Liver damage may result from having fewer than normal  narrowed or malformed bile ducts  which leads to toxic bile acid build-up  which in turn can cause scarring and progressive liver disease.15 Approximately 95% of patients with the condition present with chronic cholestasis  usually within the first three months of life and as many as 88% also present with severe  intractable pruritus.16 17 The estimated global incidence of ALGS is 3 in 100 000 live births.18 Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 1 300 patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment.About ASSERTASSERT (NCT04674761) is a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Bylvay (odevixibat) for 24 weeks in patients with ALGS up to 17 years of age. The primary endpoint evaluates the impact of odevixibat on pruritus score compared to placebo. Key secondary endpoints measure changes in serum bile acid levels and safety and tolerability. Top-line results were presented at the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) Conference in November 2022  supporting the efficacy and safety of Bylvay in patients with ALGS: Improvement in pruritus scores and reduction in serum bile acid levels were statistically significant compared to placebo. Additionally  Bylvay led to significant sleep improvements over time. There were no trial discontinuations and all patients completed the initial 24 weeks treatment duration  with 96% rolled over into the open-label extension trial. Low rates of diarrhea were reported during the trial.About biliary atresiaBA is a rare pediatric liver disease. Symptoms typically develop about two to eight weeks after birth and there are no approved pharmacological therapies. Damaged or absent bile ducts outside the liver result in bile and bile acids being trapped inside the liver  quickly resulting in cirrhosis and liver failure requiring liver transplantation. At the time of diagnosis  a hepatic portoenterostomy (HPE) called Kasai procedure is performed to create a conduit allowing biliary drainage. The rate of success in re-establishing bile flow is dependent on the age of the infant when the HPE is performed. Kasai procedure is not curative and most patients who have BA have progressive disease  with at least 80% requiring liver transplantation by age 20 years.19 Of those who survive into the third decade after birth  almost all have portal hypertension or other complications of cirrhosis.20 New therapies are therefore needed to delay or avoid the need for liver transplantation following Kasai procedure.21 There are currently no approved pharmacological treatments for biliary atresia. There is an estimated incidence of 5/6 per 100 000 live births worldwide with BA22. Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 750 patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment.About BOLDBOLD (NCT04336722) is a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bylvay (odevixibat) in children who have biliary atresia and have undergone a Kasai procedure before age three months. Children in the treatment arm receive Bylvay 120 μg/kg orally once daily for 24 months. The primary efficacy endpoint is improvement in the proportion of patients who are alive and have not undergone a liver transplant after two years of treatment compared to placebo  and secondary outcome measures include time to onset of any sentinel events  total bilirubin levels and sBA levels.About AlbireoAlbireo is a rare disease company focused on the development of novel bile acid modulators to treat pediatric and adult liver diseases. Albireo’s lead product  Bylvay  was approved by the U.S. FDA as the first drug for the treatment of pruritus in all types of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC)  and in Europe for the treatment of PFIC. Bylvay is also being developed to treat other rare pediatric cholestatic liver diseases with a completed Phase III trial in ALGS  an ongoing Phase III study in biliary atresia  as well as Open-label Extension (OLE) studies for PFIC and ALGS. The company has also completed a Phase I clinical trial for A3907 to advance development in adult cholestatic liver disease  with IND-enabling studies progressing with A2342 for viral and cholestatic liver disease.

The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof and  other than as required by applicable law  none of the Albireo  Ipsen or any of their respective affiliates undertakes any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information or statements.Ipsen’s forward-looking statementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.comAbout the OfferThe tender offer for the outstanding shares of Albireo common stock referenced in this press release has not yet commenced.

It is not a regulated market  but a multilateral trading facility organized within the meaning of article 525-1 of the General regulations of the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF). Its organizational rules are approved by the AMF.The Board of Directors considers that this proposed transfer would allow the Company to have its securities admitted to trading on a market more commensurate with its size and market capitalization. The transfer to Euronext Growth Paris should enable the Company to reduce its obligations and constraints (under the conditions detailed below) and  as a result  reduce the costs associated with its listing  while maintaining the shares' tradability on a financial market.Main consequences of the proposed Transfer (non-exhaustive list)In accordance with articles L. 421-14 of the Monetary and Financial Code and 223-36 of the General regulation of the AMF  the Company hereby informs its shareholders of the main consequences of the Transfer.With regards to the periodic information:The half-yearly report  including the half-yearly (and consolidated) financial statements and an activity report relating to these half-yearly financial statements  would be published within four months following the end of the first half of the Company's fiscal year  instead of the period of three months following the end of the first half of the fiscal year applicable to companies whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market; in addition  the review of the half-yearly financial statements by the statutory auditors would no longer be required.Lighter information will be required in the management report and the corporate governance report.The Company will continue to prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS.The Company will continue with its current reporting frequency with regards to quarterly updates.With regards to the permanent information:As Euronext Growth Paris is a multilateral trading facility  the Company would remain subject to the provisions applicable to permanent market disclosure  and  in particular  to the provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 16  2014 on market abuse (“MAR”).

of statutory thresholds to be reported to the Company.However  both the public tender offer regulations and the threshold disclosure requirements applicable to companies whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market would remain applicable for three years from the date of admission of the Company's securities to the Euronext Growth Paris multilateral trading facility.With regards to the general meetings  the publication and reporting requirements would be slightly modified  principally as follows:The documents relating to shareholder meetings provided to shareholders should be published on the Company's website only on the date of the convening of meeting  as opposed to 21 days before the date of the meeting.The notice of availability of the preparatory documents for the

Euronext Growth Paris could result in a change in the liquidity of the shares which could differ from the liquidity observed since the beginning of the Company's listing on the Euronext Paris regulated market.Indicative timetable for the proposed Transfer (subject to its validation by Euronext Paris)If the Company’s shareholders approve the contemplated Transfer  and subject to the market

16141,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4568386-unibail-rodamco-westfield-big-dividend-yield,Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield: A 10% Dividend Yield In 2024 Is Likely (OTCMKTS:UNBLF),Unibail is making progress with its asset disposals and assets are sold at smaller than expected discounts. Find out why I'm bullish on the stock.,"Manuel Milan/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield (OTCPK:UNBLF) (OTC:URMCY) is one of the largest commercial real estate REITs in the world. While the REIT seemed to have bitten off more than it could chew with the pre-COVID acquisition of Westfield  an Australia-based commercial real estate REIT  it spent the past few years on getting itself sorted out. The management took the courageous but wise decision to cancel the dividend for a few years. This enables Unibail to retain hundreds of millions in cash to protect its balance sheet while it is also selling assets. It looks like the market has given up on Unibail due to the lack of a dividend  but I think the REIT could be in a stronger position than ever before by the end of this year.Yahoo FinanceUnibail has its primary listing on Euronext Amsterdam where it's trading with URW as its ticker symbol. The average daily volume in Amsterdam is just under 700 000 shares  representing a monetary value of 35M EUR (and close to $40M). As Amsterdam offers the best liquidity to trade in Unibail’s shares  I would strongly recommend to use that exchange to trade in the company’s securities. I will use the Euro as base currency throughout this article.Selling the US portfolio is slower than I had expected – but the prices are betterWhen I discussed Unibail in 2022  the REIT had just organized a capital markets date with an encouraging update and outlook for 2024. The REIT mentioned it planned to entirely exit the US market and focus on quality.One of the most important slides presented during the capital markets day was this sensitivity analysis. Unibail provided investors with how the sale of the US portfolio would impact the LTV ratios of the REIT on post-deal basis. I was perhaps a bit surprised the REIT even provided the outcome of a scenario where the US assets would be sold at a 50% discount (!) to their respective book values but even in this scenario the LTV ratio would stay below 39% and even if one would include the hybrid bond (deeply subordinated debt which is actually added to the equity portion of the balance sheet due to its status)  the LTV ratio would be a very manageable 43.6%.Unibail Investor RelationsThis actually was one of the main reasons why I started keeping close tabs on Unibail again. While the scenario of selling the US assets at a 50% discount sounded ridiculous  I would have been perfectly fine with the ""minus 30% scenario"" as in that scenario the LTV ratio would also be a very manageable 33%. So whatever happens to the US portfolio  Unibail will emerge as a stronger REIT. Sure there will be earnings implications but for a REIT whose existence was threatened during the COVID pandemic  strengthening the balance sheet is priority number one.Subsequent to the capital markets day  Unibail announced the sale of two European assets. I admittedly scratched my head as I was expecting the US asset sales to be prioritized  but this doesn’t mean this was a bad move by Unibail. The 116M EUR sale of a German property was completed at a premium to book value while the sale of a Dutch mall was completed at book value. These two transactions already helped to rapidly reduce the gross debt and net debt on the balance sheet. And at the end of the third quarter  Unibail sold a French mall which allowed it to reach a total disposal value of 3.2B EUR of the 4B EUR it was eyeing to sell. The average sales price of those assets was a premium of approximately 5% to the book value.I thought that was great  but the market didn’t care and in the weeks subsequent to the completion of the sale of the French mall  Unibail’s shares traded at a level we hadn’t seen since Q4 2020.I did understand the impatience of the market  as everyone was waiting for the sale of the US portfolio but investors had to wait for about five months after the capital markets day before seeing the first substantial US asset sale. The Westfield Santa Ana asset was sold for $537.5M which represented a discount of less than 11% on the book value.A second noteworthy sale in the USA was completed right before the end of the financial year as Unibail sold the San Fernando Valley asset for $325M  again at a discount of less than 11% to the book value.While selling assets at a discount to their book value never is a good thing to do  the in excess of $1B in US asset sales confirm one thing: The discount to the book value is lower than I had anticipated. Even my conservative scenario of conceding a 30% discount to the book value now appears to be too conservative. Which means that Unibail now has a very good chance to reach an LTV ratio of less than 30% upon the completion of the sale of the US assets. That would make the balance sheet one of the best and most robust in the European commercial real estate segment of the market.Subsequent to the capital markets day  Unibail did provide a new sensitivity analysis taking the asset sales up until the end of Q3 but excluding the Westfield Santa Ana sale into account.Unibail Investor RelationsSo even if the remainder of the US portfolio would be sold at a 20% discount  the LTV ratio would be less than 30%.The recent asset disposals will help to protect the book value  while the earnings will remain strongThe downside of selling assets is quite obviously that a REIT is no longer able to collect the rent. This means the net rental income and cash flows will suffer. That being said  it will also allow Unibail to repay some of its most expensive debt which means the actual net impact on the FFO should remain limited.Unibail reports its FFO as AREPS  Annual Recurring EPS. It basically is the net income but excluding the property valuations which can have an impact on the bottom line. Although REPS is not a European standard (that would be EPRA earnings) and although Unibail does not report the US-equivalent FFO  we should consider the REPS to be the FFO-equivalent.Unfortunately Unibail only provides detailed financial statements every six months  but the Q3 Trading Update did contain some interesting information. The net debt decreased by 800M EUR during the third quarter to 23.3B EUR  and Unibail’s sale of the San Fernando Valley asset in combination with retained earnings  will for sure result in a net debt level of less than 23B EUR as of the end of 2022. Unibail also had 3B EUR in cash on hand and had access to 10B EUR in credit lines so liquidity for sure is not an issue at this time. The REIT estimates that its existing cash and credit lines could take care of all of its financing needs for the next three years (including dividend payments and the repayment of a hybrid bond).The REIT also hiked its AREPS guidance from 8.90 EUR to 9.10 EUR. This indeed means the REIT is currently trading at just six times its AREPS which by itself is cheap. Too cheap.Sure  the AREPS will decrease as Unibail completes its asset disposal program  but Unibail will also be able to rapidly reduce its interest expenses so I expect the net impact to be relatively limited. Unibail paid 225M EUR in net finance expenses in the first half of this year (335M EUR in interest expenses partially offset by roughly 110M EUR in interest income on derivatives).Unibail Investor RelationsThe higher interest rates on the market does mean I will have to fine-tune my expectations for 2024. Unibail originally expected to generate a Net Rental Income of 1.57B EUR. I will use 1.65B EUR as updated basis given the current strong performance.I'm slightly lowering my G&A expenses to 170M EUR (a 20% decrease from FY 2021 with inflation partially offsetting the cost savings related to exiting the US market) but I’m afraid I will have to strongly increase my anticipated interest expenses. Assuming the gross debt will decrease to 12B EUR while the average interest rate increases to 4% (the full effect will only be felt from 2026 on as Unibail has hedged its entire interest rate exposure)  the new interest expense will increase to 480M EUR. This would indicate Unibail’s ARE would come in at 1B EUR. We would still have to deduct the 50M EUR in payments on the deeply subordinated debt and about 75M EUR in annual earnings attributable to non-controlling interests.Unibail Investor RelationsThis would indicate the shareholders of Unibail can look forward to 875M EUR in Annual Recurring Earnings and divided over 139M shares  the AREPS would be 6.3 EUR per share. Applying a multiple of 12 which really isn’t unreasonable considering the LTV ratio will likely be less than 30% would result in a fair value of 75 EUR per share.More importantly  applying a payout ratio of 75% would indicate a dividend of 4.8 UR per share. And should Unibail decide to repay it hybrid debt securities  the 75% payout ratio would imply a dividend of 5.1 EUR per share. I think it is increasingly likely Unibail will call the hybrid securities as the interest rate will reset this year and based on the current five-year Euro-midswap  Unibail would have to start paying 4.5-5% on these securities.Unibail Investor RelationsInvestment thesisI initiated a small long position in October and am looking to expand this position during 2023. My preferred way to gain additional exposure is by writing put options with various strike prices and expiry dates. The market is pricing the options as if it doesn’t believe Unibail will execute on its transformation plan. I think the REIT will be able to sell its US assets at a decent price and even if it takes longer than anticipated  so be it. I also wouldn’t mind if the very first distribution after the reinstatement would be a small one if that would allow Unibail to hoard a few hundred million euro of additional cash.As mentioned  the option premiums to write put options are surprisingly high. You can write a P50 or P45 for March for an option premium of respectively 3.25 EUR and 1.80 EUR. Meanwhile  a P45 for September can be written for 4.65 EUR while a P35 for September would still get you an option premium of in excess of 2 EUR. I personally don’t think the share price will drop to those levels but I think I’d be happy to pick up tock at those levels. And for those who would want to go a little bit more aggressive: the P60 for December of this year has an option premium of 13.00 EUR. Which means that you either pocket the 13 EUR premium if the option isn’t exercised  or you’d establish a position at 60-13 = 47 EUR per share.The market isn’t giving Unibail enough credit for what it has already done and I think the market is wrong. The immediate and acute balance sheet danger no longer exists and I’m fine with Unibail selling down its US portfolio asset by asset. I expect the REIT to generate north of 6 EUR per share in FFO after completing the asset sales while the dividend yield could easily approach 10%.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Our clinical and regulatory development teams have done a remarkable job  particularly in discussions with the European regulatory authorities (EMA) for our Phase 2/3 study ACTISAVE  in order to advance the preparation of a marketing authorization application for glenzocimab in stroke. We have fully met our patient enrollment goals in 2022 and are involving new countries and hospitals in 2023. We are proud that the enrollment of patients in the Phase 2/3 GREEN study  promoted by the AP-HP in the framework of the RHU BOOSTER  has started. We look forward to continuing the clinical development of glenzocimab in the treatment of myocardial infarction in partnership with the University of Birmingham (UK). We will keep up our efforts to provide a therapeutic solution to this unmet medical need in cardiovascular emergencies.”1) ACTISAVE: Phase 2/3 clinical study in strokeStudy design and regulatory discussionsACTISAVE (NCT05070260) is a multinational  adaptive  multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group Phase 2/3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a single dose of glenzocimab used in combination with standard of care (thrombolysis +/- thrombectomy) for acute ischemic stroke. The study is being conducted in 7 European countries  UK  Israel  and the USA.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the adaptive design strategy and validated the choice of a dual primary endpoint: an ordinal endpoint of the difference between the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)1 and a binary endpoint of the percentage of patients with severe disability or death  i.e. an mRS score of 4-6. The recognition of this pivotal study design supports a future application for marketing authorization for glenzocimab in stroke in Europe.In the context of the ""PRIME"" status received in July 2022  a program aimed at optimizing the development plan to speed up patient access to the drug candidate  the company is continuing its interactions with the EMA.In the United States  discussions are underway with the American regulatory agency (FDA) to set up a Type C meeting to validate the design and statistical analysis of the study in support of a future Biologic License Application (BLA) in the United States. An amendment to the study protocol allowing the use of the two recognized thrombolytic agents in stroke management  tenecteplase (TNK) and alteplase  was submitted to the FDA in November 2022  and is awaiting approval by the Ethics Review Board (IRB). Two patients have been enrolled to date. This amendment should accelerate enrollment  given the massive use of TNK in U.S. hospitals.Number of patients recruited to date: 203 patients.Next clinical step: an initial futility analysis is planned when 100 patients will be enrolled with thrombolysis + thrombectomy  treated and followed for 90 days to confirm the safety of the study and ensure that the preliminary results are consistent with the original trial assumptions. Results of this futility study are expected in the 3rd quarter 2023.2) GREEN: Phase 2/3 clinical trial in strokeStudy designGREEN (NCT05559398) is a randomized  double-blind  multicenter  placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 study of the efficacy and safety of glenzocimab as an adjunct to mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke. The GREEN study is conducted under the auspices of the Paris Public Hospitals (Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris)  and is part of the RHU BOOSTER  receiving financial support from the French National Research Agency (Agence Nationale de la Recherche) and the Government’s ‘Investments for the Future’ program (Programme Investissements d’Avenir).The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of glenzocimab in combination with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) versus EVT alone on 90-day functional outcome (mRS). Secondary objectives are to evaluate the impact of glenzocimab on overall survival  reperfusion  clinical improvement at 24 hours  symptomatic and asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage  serious adverse events (SAEs)  serious unexpected adverse events (SUSARs) and quality of life. This study will include nearly 260 patients eligible for mechanical thrombectomy in 11 French neurovascular units and institutions of excellence.Number of patients recruited to date: 1 patient.Next clinical step: an interim analysis will be performed after the first 78 patients are included and is expected end of 2023.3) LIBERATE: Phase 2b clinical trial in the treatment of myocardial infarctionStudy designLIBERATE (IRAS -1005400) is a randomized  double-blind  Phase 2b study that will include more than 200 patients in the acute phase of myocardial infarction to test the safety and efficacy of glenzocimab 1000 mg versus placebo in reducing cardiac damage remote from the infarction. This study is being conducted in partnership with the University of Birmingham (UK)  with expert clinicians from the Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust.Current status of the study: file being submitted to the UK regulatory authorities.Next clinical step: Inclusion of the first patient planned for the second quarter of 2023.4) Other indications for cardiovascular emergenciesAt this stage of development  Acticor Biotech has decided to focus its efforts on the development of glenzocimab in stroke and myocardial infarction with three ongoing studies (ACTISAVE  GREEN and LIBERATE) and to postpone the launch of its Phase 2 study  BREATHE in pulmonary embolism.About ACTICOR BIOTECHActicor Biotech is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company  a spin-off from INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research)  which is aiming to develop an innovative treatment for cardiovascular emergencies  including ischemic stroke.Acticor Biotech is developing glenzocimab (ACT017)  a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) fragment directed against a novel target of major interest  platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI). Glenzocimab inhibits platelet binding to the thrombus without affecting physiological hemostasis  thereby limiting the bleeding risk  particularly in the brain.In May 2022  Acticor Biotech presented positive results from its Phase 1b/2a study  ACTIMIS  at the ESOC  confirming the safety profile and showing a reduction in mortality and intracerebral hemorrhage in the glenzocimab-treated group in patients with stroke. The efficacy of glenzocimab is now being evaluated in an international Phase 2/3 study  ACTISAVE  which will include 1 000 patients. In July 2022  Acticor Biotech was granted ""PRIME"" status by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for glenzocimab in the treatment of stroke. This designation will allow the company to strengthen its interactions and obtain early dialogues with regulatory authorities.Acticor Biotech is supported by a panel of European and international investors (Karista  Go Capital  Newton Biocapital  CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited  A&B (HK) Limited  Mirae Asset Capital  Anaxago  Primer Capital  Mediolanum Farmaceutici and the Armesa foundation).

The proceeds of the bonds will be allocated to partially redeem the outstanding bank loan guaranteed by the French State issued in May 2020. This transaction will contribute to improving Air France–KLM Group’s financial flexibility through debt reprofiling and will provide additional support to its decarbonization trajectory.Air France-KLM (the “Company”) has successfully placed its first sustainability-linked bonds today  for a nominal amount of €1.0bn  linked to the Company’s target to reduce its well-to-wake scope 1 and 3 jet fuel greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per revenue tonne kilometer (RTK) by 10% by 2025  compared to a 2019 baseline  as part of its 2030 SBTi approved objective.The offering is composed of two tranches:a €500 million with a 3.3-year maturity and a coupon of 7.250%; anda €500 million with a 5.3-year maturity and a coupon of 8.125%.Strong investor demand  with an orderbook around €2.6bn that covered c.2.6x the size of the bonds  is a testament to investors’ confidence in Air France-KLM’s measures taken to restore the Company’s creditworthiness following the Covid-19 crisis.The transaction will smoothen Air France-KLM’s debt redemption profile over the coming years and provide additional leeway for the Company to deliver on its sustainable transformation plan  including the renewal of its fleet.The proceeds will be used to pursue further partial redemption of the outstanding bank loan guaranteed by the French State (“PGE”’  issued in May 2020 during the Covid-19 crisis).

In that context  the SBTi’s Target Validation Team approved in December 2022 the Group’s scope 1 and scope 3 emissions reduction targets and has confirmed that they are in line with a well-below 2°C objective  as determined by the Paris Agreement signed in 2015.The Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework and the Second-Party Opinion are available at: https://www.airfranceklm.com/en/finance/investors-and-analysts/debtAn application will be made for the bonds to be admitted to trading on Euronext Paris.Natixis acted as sole sustainability structuring advisor and Deutsche Bank  HSBC  Natixis  Société Générale and Crédit Agricole CIB acted as joint bookrunners of the transaction.Investor RelationsFrédéric Kahane Michiel Klinkersfrkahane@airfranceklm.com michiel.klinkers@airfranceklm.comWebsite: www.airfranceklm.comAttachment,neutral,0.1,0.89,0.0,mixed,0.41,0.16,0.43,True,English,"['inaugural sustainability-linked bonds', 'total aggregate amount', 'Air France-KLM', 'successful issuance', 'bn', 'Frédéric Kahane Michiel Klinkers', '3 jet fuel greenhouse gas protocol emissions', 'Société Générale', 'first public sustainability-linked bond issuance', 'Crédit Agricole CIB', 'sole sustainability structuring advisor', 'Air France–KLM Group', 'French State support package', 'scope 3 emissions reduction targets', 'The Air France-KLM Group', 'Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles', 'Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework', 'first sustainability-linked bonds', 'sustainable transformation plan', 'sustainable aviation industry', 'strong investor interest', 'outstanding bank loan', 'Strong investor demand', 'total aggregate amount', 'Second Party Opinion', 'wider decarbonization roadmap', 'revenue tonne kilometre', 'Target Validation Team', 'inaugural sustainability-linked bonds', 'debt redemption profile', 'GHG) emissions', 'decarbonization targets', 'successful issuance', 'additional support', 'Deutsche Bank', 'Investor Relations', 'debt reprofiling', 'nominal amount', 'Second-Party Opinion', 'decarbonization trajectory', 'transaction issuance', 'financial flexibility', 'two tranches', '3.3-year maturity', '5.3-year maturity', 'Covid-19 crisis', 'coming years', 'additional leeway', 'partial redemption', 'recovery path', 'Significant contribution', 'financial strategy', 'environmental objectives', 'additional milestone', 'airline sector', 'environmental footprint', 'responsible approach', 'joint bookrunners', 'inaugural transaction', 'Bonds’ coupons', 'investors’ confidence', 'Investors Services', 'Paris Agreement', 'Euronext Paris', 'liquidity measures', 'sustainability ambition', '2°C objective', '9 January', 'offer', 'orderbook', 'size', 'wake', 'RTK', 'proceeds', 'May', 'Company', '2019 baseline', '2030 SBTi', 'testament', 'creditworthiness', 'renewal', 'fleet', 'PGE', 'determination', 'combination', 'SLBP', 'ICMA', 'June', 'Moody', 'qualification', 'leader', 'airlines', 'transparent', 'context', 'December', 'airfranceklm', 'finance', 'analysts', 'application', 'Natixis', 'HSBC', 'Website', 'Attachment', '7.', '8.1']",2023-01-09,2023-01-10,marketscreener.com

The survey will cover the entire project  including the recently acquired claims. The survey is expected to be flown in April / May of 2023.Gama Explorations Inc.  Tuesday  January 10  2023  Press release pictureLeading up to the airborne survey  the Company will conduct a remote sensing study on the Tyee Nickel Project. This remote sensing study will mostly include multi-spectral satellite data. The combined datasets will be interpreted to define ground follow-up targets for a 2-phase ground exploration program. Phase 1 will be conducted in July/August and may include ground geophysics  prospecting  and trenching. Phase 2 would include a drill-test of the best targets following from phase 1 and may commence as early as fall 2023.The Tyee Nickel project is located 130 km North of Havre St. Pierre  Quebec and covers 505.29 km2 of the Havre St. Pierre anorthosite complex  which contains known nickel  copper  and PGE occurrences. Gama Explorations is one of the largest landholders in the district. The Tyee claims contain some of the most anomalous sediment samples from known nickel  copper  and PGE occurrences in the complex  in addition to geophysical features similar to Go Metal's adjacent HSP Nickel-Copper discovery. A distinct magnetic anomaly is present within the claims  which could represent a mafic to ultramafic feeder to the surrounding anorthosite complex. This feature will be a key focus for exploration as these types of feeders and conduits are prospective for nickel-copper sulphide cumulate systems.The Big Onion Copper-Molybdenum Project  British Columbia.In 2022  the Company completed a soil and prospecting survey and initiated a thorough historical data review. The Company is also post-processing certain geophysical data to assess the potential to extend the know resource and identify a higher grade core at depth. Once the historical data review is complete more detail on an exploration program for 2023 will be announced.The Big Onion copper-molybdenum porphyry project in located ~16km east of the township of Smithers in northern British Columbia. Big Onion is characterised by a drill-proven copper-molybdenum porphyry system with several adjacent Induced Polarization (IP) geophysical anomalies and numerous targets defined by elevated Cu and Mo soil geochemistry and rock chips beyond the historic resource envelope. Exploration work at Big Onion will focus on identifying a higher-grade core either adjacent to or at depth of the current mineral resource.Frankfurt Stock Exchange ListingGama is pleased to announce the listing of its common shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (""FSE"") under the trading symbol ""N79"".

The order amounts to more than CAD 5.3 million and will be fully recognized in sales and earnings in fiscal year 2023. Already in October 2022  the customer from the Canadian province of Alberta ordered VFDs from SFC Energy with a total value of more than CAD 10 million.The VFD systems operate electric pumps (ESPs) for oil production. The unique integration capabilities and specific ESP VFD firmware significantly reduce installation and operating costs. The VFDs only deliver the amount of energy to the ESP drives that they need to operate. This noticeably improves efficiency  as the VFDs make the motors much more effective and energy efficient. This optimizes pump operation  extends motor life and ensures more efficient pump run times. In addition  the VFDs reduce the customer's carbon footprint.“From his practical experience  our customer knows about the advantages of the fully integrated frequency converters and the renewed order shows the high level of satisfaction with our efficient energy control systems. For the customer it pays off twice: On the one hand he improves his CO 2 balance with the VFDs from SFC Energy  on the other hand he benefits economically to a high degree. We are pleased that with our almost 30 years of experience in VFDs we can provide our customer with an ideal power management solution for his applications ” says Hans Pol  CEO of SFC Energy AG.For more information on SFC Energy's Clean Energy and Clean Power Management solutions  visit sfc.com.About SFC Energy AGSFC Energy AG is a leading provider of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions.

Shareholders may also contact the Company’s Investor Relations team at ag2023nicox@nicox.com for any question on the voting process.Story continuesIn the event the quorum is not reached on first call  Nicox will convene an ordinary shareholder meeting on second call on Tuesday February 28  2023 at 2:00 pm CEST in the offices of BuroClub - Drakkar 2 - Bâtiment D - 2405 route des Dolines - 06560 Valbonne - France.Proposed Transfer of the listing of Nicox’s securities to the Euronext Growth marketThis ordinary shareholder meeting will decide on the proposed transfer of the listing of securities issued by the Company from the Euronext Paris regulated market to the Euronext Growth Paris multilateral trading facility (the “Transfer”)  and will be asked to grant the Board of Directors all the powers necessary to carry out this Transfer.Euronext Growth Paris is a market organized by Euronext Paris. It is not a regulated market  but a multilateral trading facility organized within the meaning of article 525-1 of the General regulations of the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF). Its organizational rules are approved by the AMF.The Board of Directors considers that this proposed transfer would allow the Company to have its securities admitted to trading on a market more commensurate with its size and market capitalization. The transfer to Euronext Growth Paris should enable the Company to reduce its obligations and constraints (under the conditions detailed below) and  as a result  reduce the costs associated with its listing  while maintaining the shares' tradability on a financial market.Main consequences of the proposed Transfer (non-exhaustive list)In accordance with articles L. 421-14 of the Monetary and Financial Code and 223-36 of the General regulation of the AMF  the Company hereby informs its shareholders of the main consequences of the Transfer.With regards to the periodic information:The half-yearly report  including the half-yearly (and consolidated) financial statements and an activity report relating to these half-yearly financial statements  would be published within four months following the end of the first half of the Company's fiscal year  instead of the period of three months following the end of the first half of the fiscal year applicable to companies whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market; in addition  the review of the half-yearly financial statements by the statutory auditors would no longer be required.Lighter information will be required in the management report and the corporate governance report.The Company will continue to prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS.The Company will continue with its current reporting frequency with regards to quarterly updates.With regards to the permanent information:As Euronext Growth Paris is a multilateral trading facility  the Company would remain subject to the provisions applicable to permanent market disclosure  and  in particular  to the provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 16  2014 on market abuse (“MAR”). Any company listed on Euronext Growth Paris must ensure the effective and full dissemination of the so-called regulated information.In addition  the Company's managers and persons having a close relationship with them would remain subject to the obligation to report transactions on the shares or debt securities of the Company pursuant to article 19 of MAR.With regards to the protection of minority shareholders  the Company would be subject to the regulations applicable to companies listed on Euronext Growth Paris:Unless an exemption is granted  the protection of minority shareholders is ensured on Euronext Growth Paris by the mechanism of a mandatory public tender offer in the event that the threshold of 50% of the share capital or voting rights is crossed  directly or indirectly  alone or in concert.Only the crossing  upwards or downwards  of the thresholds of 50% and 95% of the share capital or voting rights must be reported to the AMF and the Company  subject to the crossing of statutory thresholds to be reported to the Company.However  both the public tender offer regulations and the threshold disclosure requirements applicable to companies whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market would remain applicable for three years from the date of admission of the Company's securities to the Euronext Growth Paris multilateral trading facility.With regards to the general meetings  the publication and reporting requirements would be slightly modified  principally as follows:The documents relating to shareholder meetings provided to shareholders should be published on the Company's website only on the date of the convening of meeting  as opposed to 21 days before the date of the meeting.The notice of availability of the preparatory documents for the general meeting would no longer be required.The publication on the Company's website of the results of the votes and the minutes of the general meeting would no longer be required.Principal additional changes are as follows:The Company would no longer be subject to the ""say on pay"" regulation  which provides for an ex-ante vote by the shareholders on executive’s compensation policy  an ex-post vote on the report on compensation and the approval of individual executive compensation.The Company would no longer be required to report on internal control or risk management.The Company would no longer be subject to the provisions of articles L. 823-19 et seq. of the French Commercial Code relating to audit committees.As Euronext Growth Paris is not a regulated market  the transfer to Euronext Growth Paris could result in a change in the liquidity of the shares which could differ from the liquidity observed since the beginning of the Company's listing on the Euronext Paris

By their nature  forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that are outside of our control and impossible to predict and may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts  analyses and projections about the industry in which we operate and management's beliefs and assumptions about possible future events. You are cautioned not to put undue reliance on these forward-looking statements  which only express views as at the date of this press release and are neither predictions nor guarantees of possible future events or circumstances.We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events  except as may be required under applicable securities law.Alternative performance measuresThe financial information in this release includes non-IFRS financial measures and ratios (e.g. non-IFRS metrics  such as adjusted EBITDA) that are not recognized as measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measures presented are measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of the business and operations and  have therefore not been audited or reviewed. Furthermore  they may not be indicative of the historical operating results  nor are they meant to be predictive of future results. These non-IFRS measures are presented because they are considered important supplementary measurements of FL Entertainment N.V.'s (the ""Company"") performance  and we believe that these and similar measures are widely used in the industry in which the Company operates as a way to evaluate a company’s operating performance and liquidity. Not all companies calculate non-IFRS financial measures in the same manner or on a consistent basis. As a result  these measures and ratios may not be comparable to measures used by other companies under the same or similar names. Further information on the non-IFRS measures can be found in our [reference to report].DisclaimerNot for distribution in the United States  Australia  Canada or Japan.

The solutions provided by Memory bring together strong subject matter expertise and cutting-edge technology for processing and analyzing large quantities of data originating from different sources. This double expertise empowers Memory's platform with unique decision-making tools  both for retailers and for brand managers.With this new acquisition -- arriving on the heels of the purchase of MarketHub (Ireland) at the beginning of last year -- SES-imagotag continues building out its Data management and analytics capabilities. These new platforms complement Captana  specialized in real-time analysis of store shelves via the analysis of images and the use of artificial intelligence  as well as several other solutions within the VUSION platform.The objective of this acquisition is to offer retailers and brand managers a complete range of tools around data management across all channels  including physical stores. Physical retail is currently the channel in which data is the least available  but for which access to data offers the most upside. The technologies provided by the Internet of Things  applied to physical stores (digital shelf labels  and connected cameras and sensors) for which SES-imagotag is a specialist and the global leader  will enable the capture of significant amounts of in-store data in near real-time  and the ability to communicate with consumers. To be useful  this exponential production of data must be processed and analyzed by specialized tools  with the objective of transforming this data into action in the most automated way possible  thus rendering stores ultra-efficient environments that meet the expectations of each consumer.SES-imagotag's goal is to bring together under the VUSION platform IoT and Data expertise  at the service of commerce. This is the strategic framework that underlies the recently presented VUSION '27 plan  and under which the Memory acquisition will be made.The letter of intent signed by both companies foresees the acquisition by SES-imagotag of 100% of the share capital of Memory  to be paid in cash. The transaction is expected to be completed in January 2023.Thierry Gadou  Chairman and CEO of SES-imagotag commented: “I am delighted by the prospect of welcoming Memory's staff and their talented founders Audrey  Alexis and Maxime. Memory is a gem among French companies with significant potential for international development. We intend to accelerate the development of Memory  while at the same time capitalizing on the potential synergies with other SES-imagotag entities. The future of retail lies in data  which will enable retailers to improve their operating performance and their collaboration with manufacturers  leading them to develop new sources of monetization and of advertising revenue streams. The expertise provided by Memory will be essential to us in improving our IoT and Data solutions  to ensure that they are the most relevant to decision-making needs. Conversely  the new data coming from digital sources will enable extended value creation of Memory's solutions  while expanding ROI of the digitization of stores. Our customers will be the beneficiaries of this acquisition.”Alexis Mau  President of In The Memory added: “We are convinced of the advantages of this merger with SES-imagotag. Four years after the founding of Memory  this partnership comes from a shared vision of the digital transformation of retail and will enable us to accelerate our international growth. Together  we will be able to extend our store data solutions captured via the VUSION platform  and to develop new products by leveraging the complementarity of our solutions with SES-imagotag's IoT & Data solutions. Retailers and their partner brands will thus have at their disposal tools that are more robust  able to help them in their operational and strategic decision-making.”About SES-imagotag and the VUSION Retail IoT platformSES-imagotag is a world leader in smart digital labels and IoT solutions for physical retail  serving over 350 large retailer groups around the world in Europe  Asia and North America.SES-imagotag has developed the VUSION Retail IOT technology platform to help retailers transform their physical stores into high value digital assets  more automated  data-driven  and connected in real-time to suppliers and consumers. VUSION improves the agility  precision and accuracy of prices  whilst ensuring the omnichannel synchronization of prices  product information and marketing campaigns.

Here are 3 oil stocks for protection,The global oil market remains tight according to Saudi Aramco  the largest oil producer in the world. And that does not bode well for a world that still relies heavily on fossil fuels. Disclaimer: We adhere to strict standards of editorial integrity to help you make decisions with confidence.,© KARIM SAHIB/AFP via Getty Images World's largest oil supplier issues dire warningThe global oil market remains tight according to Saudi Aramco  the largest oil producer in the world. And that does not bode well for a world that still relies heavily on fossil fuels.Disclaimer: We adhere to strict standards of editorial integrity to help you make decisions with confidence. All links marked with an asterisk ( * ) are paid links.“Today there is spare capacity that is extremely low ” Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said at a recent conference in London. “If China opens up  [the] economy starts improving or the aviation industry starts asking for more jet fuel  you will erode this spare capacity.”Nasser warns that oil prices could quickly spike — again.“When you erode that spare capacity the world should be worried. There will be no space for any hiccup — any interruption  any unforeseen events anywhere around the world.”If you share Nasser’s view  here are three oil stocks to bet on. Wall Street also sees upside in this trio.Don’t missShellHeadquartered in London  Shell (NYSE:SHEL) is a multinational energy giant with operations in more than 70 countries. It produces around 3.2 barrels of oil equivalent per day  has an interest in 10 refineries  and sold 64.2 million tons of liquefied natural gas last year.It’s a staple for global investors  too. Shell is listed on the London Stock Exchange  Euronext Amsterdam  and the New York Stock Exchange.The company’s NYSE-listed shares are up 23% over the last year.Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd sees an opportunity in the oil and gas supermajor. In December  the analyst reiterated an ‘overweight’ rating on Shell at a price target of $70.Considering that Shell trades at around $57 per share today  Todd’s new price target implies a potential upside of 22%.ChevronChevron (NYSE:CVX) is another oil and gas supermajor that’s benefiting from the commodity boom.For Q3  the company reported earnings of $11.2 billion  which represented an 84% increase from the same period last year. Sales and other operating revenues totaled $64 billion for the quarter  up 49% year over year.Read more: 4 simple ways to protect your money against white-hot inflation (without being a stock market genius)Last January  Chevron’s board approved a 6% increase to the quarterly dividend rate to $1.42 per share. That gives the company an annual dividend yield of 3.3%.The stock has enjoyed a nice rally too  climbing 40.38% over the last year.Barclays analyst Jeanine Wai maintained an 'overweight' rating on Chevron  recently raising the target price to $212 from $196.Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott has an ‘equal weight’ rating on Chevron (not the most bullish rating) but raised the price target from $193 to $196 in October. That implies a potential upside of 21% from the current levels.Exxon MobilCommanding a market cap of over $430 billion  Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is bigger than Shell and Chevron.The company also boasts the strongest stock price performance among the three in 2022 — Exxon shares are up 59.61% over the last year.It’s not hard to see why investors like the stock: the oil-producing giant gushes profits and cash flow in this commodity price environment. In the first nine months of 2022  Exxon earned $43.0 billion in profits  a huge increase from the $14.2 billion in the year-ago period. Free cash flow totaled $49.8 billion for the first nine months  compared to $22.9 billion in the same period last year.Solid financials allow the company to return cash to investors. Exxon pays quarterly dividends of 91 cents per share  translating to an annual yield of 3.4%.Jefferies analyst Lloyd Byrne has a ‘buy’ rating on Exxon and a price target of $133 — around 22% above where the stock sits today.What to read nextThe average home insurance policy is nearly 40% higher than it was 12 years ago — compare rates with Smart Financial* and spend less on peace of mind'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile  refrigerator  or whatever' — here are 3 better recession-proof buysBecome Uncle Sam's landlord: Earn up to an 8.8% yield with these REITs that rent to the US governmentThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.
