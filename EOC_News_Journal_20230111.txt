(CSE:GAMA)(FSE:N79) (""Gama"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to provide a corporate update on work plans for 2023 at its Tyee Nickel...","VANCOUVER  BC / ACCESSWIRE / January 10  2023 / Gama Explorations Inc. (CSE:GAMA)(FSE:N79) (""Gama"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to provide a corporate update on work plans for 2023 at its Tyee Nickel Project in Quebec and Big Onion Project in British Columbia.""The 2022 year was a formative one for the company""  stated Dr. Mick Carew  CEO of Gama. ""Having listed on the Canadian Stock Exchange in April  the Company is now well positioned to commence exploration work in 2023 with a healthy treasury and two projects in its portfolio  including the Tyee Nickel Project situated within one of Canada's newest and most exciting nickel districts.""Our Tyee Nickel Project covers over 500 km2 of the Havre St. Pierre anorthosite complex  which means we will be able to cost-effectively evaluate a large region in this new and prospective nickel district. 2023 will see Gama move its exploration assets forward as well as continue to evaluate other assets in the battery metals space.""Tyee Nickel Project  QuebecThe Company has completed its airborne survey design and has selected SkyTEM  a leading company in the airborne EM space to collect the data using their SkyTEM312-FAST system. This system collects high-resolution data both at surface and at depth and is expected to respond well to conductive sulphide mineralization at up to 500m depth. The survey will cover the entire project  including the recently acquired claims. The survey is expected to be flown in April / May of 2023.Gama Explorations Inc.  Tuesday  January 10  2023  Press release pictureLeading up to the airborne survey  the Company will conduct a remote sensing study on the Tyee Nickel Project. This remote sensing study will mostly include multi-spectral satellite data. The combined datasets will be interpreted to define ground follow-up targets for a 2-phase ground exploration program. Phase 1 will be conducted in July/August and may include ground geophysics  prospecting  and trenching. Phase 2 would include a drill-test of the best targets following from phase 1 and may commence as early as fall 2023.The Tyee Nickel project is located 130 km North of Havre St. Pierre  Quebec and covers 505.29 km2 of the Havre St. Pierre anorthosite complex  which contains known nickel  copper  and PGE occurrences. Gama Explorations is one of the largest landholders in the district. The Tyee claims contain some of the most anomalous sediment samples from known nickel  copper  and PGE occurrences in the complex  in addition to geophysical features similar to Go Metal's adjacent HSP Nickel-Copper discovery. A distinct magnetic anomaly is present within the claims  which could represent a mafic to ultramafic feeder to the surrounding anorthosite complex. This feature will be a key focus for exploration as these types of feeders and conduits are prospective for nickel-copper sulphide cumulate systems.The Big Onion Copper-Molybdenum Project  British Columbia.In 2022  the Company completed a soil and prospecting survey and initiated a thorough historical data review. The Company is also post-processing certain geophysical data to assess the potential to extend the know resource and identify a higher grade core at depth. Once the historical data review is complete more detail on an exploration program for 2023 will be announced.The Big Onion copper-molybdenum porphyry project in located ~16km east of the township of Smithers in northern British Columbia. Big Onion is characterised by a drill-proven copper-molybdenum porphyry system with several adjacent Induced Polarization (IP) geophysical anomalies and numerous targets defined by elevated Cu and Mo soil geochemistry and rock chips beyond the historic resource envelope. Exploration work at Big Onion will focus on identifying a higher-grade core either adjacent to or at depth of the current mineral resource.Frankfurt Stock Exchange ListingGama is pleased to announce the listing of its common shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (""FSE"") under the trading symbol ""N79"".

The order amounts to more than CAD 5.3 million and will be fully recognized in sales and earnings in fiscal year 2023. Already in October 2022  the customer from the Canadian province of Alberta ordered VFDs from SFC Energy with a total value of more than CAD 10 million.The VFD systems operate electric pumps (ESPs) for oil production. The unique integration capabilities and specific ESP VFD firmware significantly reduce installation and operating costs. The VFDs only deliver the amount of energy to the ESP drives that they need to operate. This noticeably improves efficiency  as the VFDs make the motors much more effective and energy efficient. This optimizes pump operation  extends motor life and ensures more efficient pump run times. In addition  the VFDs reduce the customer's carbon footprint.“From his practical experience  our customer knows about the advantages of the fully integrated frequency converters and the renewed order shows the high level of satisfaction with our efficient energy control systems. For the customer it pays off twice: On the one hand he improves his CO 2 balance with the VFDs from SFC Energy  on the other hand he benefits economically to a high degree. We are pleased that with our almost 30 years of experience in VFDs we can provide our customer with an ideal power management solution for his applications ” says Hans Pol  CEO of SFC Energy AG.For more information on SFC Energy's Clean Energy and Clean Power Management solutions  visit sfc.com.About SFC Energy AGSFC Energy AG is a leading provider of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions.

The solutions provided by Memory bring together strong subject matter expertise and cutting-edge technology for processing and analyzing large quantities of data originating from different sources. This double expertise empowers Memory's platform with unique decision-making tools  both for retailers and for brand managers.With this new acquisition -- arriving on the heels of the purchase of MarketHub (Ireland) at the beginning of last year -- SES-imagotag continues building out its Data management and analytics capabilities. These new platforms complement Captana  specialized in real-time analysis of store shelves via the analysis of images and the use of artificial intelligence  as well as several other solutions within the VUSION platform.The objective of this acquisition is to offer retailers and brand managers a complete range of tools around data management across all channels  including physical stores. Physical retail is currently the channel in which data is the least available  but for which access to data offers the most upside. The technologies provided by the Internet of Things  applied to physical stores (digital shelf labels  and connected cameras and sensors) for which SES-imagotag is a specialist and the global leader  will enable the capture of significant amounts of in-store data in near real-time  and the ability to communicate with consumers. To be useful  this exponential production of data must be processed and analyzed by specialized tools  with the objective of transforming this data into action in the most automated way possible  thus rendering stores ultra-efficient environments that meet the expectations of each consumer.SES-imagotag's goal is to bring together under the VUSION platform IoT and Data expertise  at the service of commerce. This is the strategic framework that underlies the recently presented VUSION '27 plan  and under which the Memory acquisition will be made.The letter of intent signed by both companies foresees the acquisition by SES-imagotag of 100% of the share capital of Memory  to be paid in cash. The transaction is expected to be completed in January 2023.Thierry Gadou  Chairman and CEO of SES-imagotag commented: “I am delighted by the prospect of welcoming Memory's staff and their talented founders Audrey  Alexis and Maxime. Memory is a gem among French companies with significant potential for international development. We intend to accelerate the development of Memory  while at the same time capitalizing on the potential synergies with other SES-imagotag entities. The future of retail lies in data  which will enable retailers to improve their operating performance and their collaboration with manufacturers  leading them to develop new sources of monetization and of advertising revenue streams. The expertise provided by Memory will be essential to us in improving our IoT and Data solutions  to ensure that they are the most relevant to decision-making needs. Conversely  the new data coming from digital sources will enable extended value creation of Memory's solutions  while expanding ROI of the digitization of stores. Our customers will be the beneficiaries of this acquisition.”Alexis Mau  President of In The Memory added: “We are convinced of the advantages of this merger with SES-imagotag. Four years after the founding of Memory  this partnership comes from a shared vision of the digital transformation of retail and will enable us to accelerate our international growth. Together  we will be able to extend our store data solutions captured via the VUSION platform  and to develop new products by leveraging the complementarity of our solutions with SES-imagotag's IoT & Data solutions. Retailers and their partner brands will thus have at their disposal tools that are more robust  able to help them in their operational and strategic decision-making.”About SES-imagotag and the VUSION Retail IoT platformSES-imagotag is a world leader in smart digital labels and IoT solutions for physical retail  serving over 350 large retailer groups around the world in Europe  Asia and North America.SES-imagotag has developed the VUSION Retail IOT technology platform to help retailers transform their physical stores into high value digital assets  more automated  data-driven  and connected in real-time to suppliers and consumers. VUSION improves the agility  precision and accuracy of prices  whilst ensuring the omnichannel synchronization of prices  product information and marketing campaigns.

The difficulties in delivering some orders at the end of the year resulted in a shortfall of a few million euros of revenue in Q4 2022 which will be shipped in early 2023 without causing major disruption to customers.At the same time  business activity and order intake remained vigorous in Q4.Robust momentum for all business lines with over 38% increase in software and servicesThe Group's brisk growth in 2022 was fueled by strong demand for all its product lines  particularly for Optical Transport solutions (up 29% in 2022) which was boosted by the success of 200 Gb/s and 400 Gb/s WDM systems  notably in North America.Access solutions reported annual growth of 20%  mainly driven by the sharp rebound in business in France.The share of Software & Services continued to grow  representing 15% of Group revenue in 2022. Full-year revenue generated by Software & Services rose by over 38%  driven by sales of software which facilitates network functions' virtualization and by a company focus on providing more services.Strong growth internationally with 56% increase in North America2022 was characterized by international growth which remained dynamic  up 17% for the full year. International business accounted for 64% in 2022 (vs. 67% for FY 2021).Story continuesIn North America  activity continued to record robust growth with business volumes totaling €29.8m versus €19.1m in 2021  representing a very significant increase of 56% (+39% in USD). Ekinops benefited from strong demand for Optical Transport equipment in the region. North America represented 23% of Group's total sales in 2022 (vs. 18% in 2021).Asia-Pacific posted a strong growth trajectory in 2022  up 38% on a full-year basis. The region accounted for 7% of Ekinops' total business activity in 2022 (vs. 6% in 2021).EMEA (Europe  excluding France  the Middle-East and Africa)  generated FY 2022 revenue of €43.5m  slightly down by 2% versus the prior year  largely owing to a base effect (note that the EMEA region delivered the strongest growth in 2021 at +29%).

The hydrogen is stored and converted into electricity when needed by a fuel cell.Its business model is based on the sale of hydrogen created by solar energy  its conversion into electricity during the night and sale to the wholesale market or through the network of own gas stations and hydrogenerators that will be created.H2PLT WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY FOR 160 000 PEOPLE PER YEAR.H2PLT already has 80 hectares in the El Pedernoso Solar Park (Cuenca  Spain) and from next year will have the potential to generate 2.5 tons of hydrogen per day and a capacity of up to 40 MW.The company plans to start selling to the wholesale market from the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition  it has already begun planning the construction of one of Spain's largest electric refueling stations in El Pedernoso  Cuenca  with more than 20 electric refueling stations  to which will be added the possibility of refueling hydrogen  which will be operational in the coming months.Story continuesAt total capacity  according to a Power-to-Power model  which allows converting green hydrogen into electricity through fuel cells  the plant can supply renewable electricity to the equivalent of a population of 160 000 people per year.The Power-to-Power model solves the problem of the intermittency of renewable energy and allows renewable energy produced during the day to be harnessed and used at night.The company plans to go public on Euronext in the second half of 2023  and is considering dual-listing in the United States at a later date.Founded in February 2022 with an initial capital of 210 000 euros  its current team amounts to six people  including international reference specialists in the fuel cell industry.THE FOUNDER OF H2PLT IS SISCO SAPENAThe founder and CEO of the project is Sisco Sapena  known for having founded in 1995 the listed Lleida.net  European leader in the industry of certified electronic signature  notification and contracting.Lleida.net is listed on Euronext Growth in Paris  OTC Markets in New York and BME Growth in Madrid. It has subsidiaries in 19 countries and some 200 employees. It was the company that rose the most on the stock market in Europe in 2020  with a valuation of around 300 million euros  and has more than 3 000 shareholders.The company plans to file at least 15 patents on new applications and processes linked to hydrogen generation.Sisco Sapena is already a signatory of more than 220 patents on the subject  and his profile has been picked up by global media such as Financial Times  Bloomberg or Reuters.Green hydrogen is produced using renewable energy sources  such as wind or solar power  to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.

This nonrefundable grant is intended to support projects helping drive the sustainable transformation of key sectors in the French economy through technological innovation. Two other funding requests for a total of 1.5 million euros are currently being examined by Bpifrance. A response is expected during the first quarter of 2023.The PRECESTO Phase IIa clinical trial aims primarily to validate the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation treatments and particularly nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) with a view to developing an innovative treatment method by associating NFL-101 with other smoking cessation methods (see press release from November 8  2022).Ignacio Faus  NFL Biosciences’ Chief Executive Officer: “For nicotine addiction research  the cost of clinical trials is relatively low compared with other indications  particularly because patients are monitored on an outpatient basis  yet smoking cessation offers a very strong level of commercial potential on account of the number of smokers and the limitations involved with current treatments. As we maintain a very low fixed cost structure  the vast majority of the funds are allocated to financing clinical trials and therefore serve to increase the potential value of NFL Biosciences’ projects. We would like to warmly thank our partners on this operation  and particularly BPI Occitanie”.PRECESTO: a clinical trial that will be launched at the start of 2023 with a view to explore the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation drugsPRECESTO is a proof-of-concept clinical trial with the primary objective to validate the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation treatments and particularly nicotine replacement therapies (transdermal patches  tablets  chewing gums  inhalers and nicotine sprays) with a view to developing an innovative treatment method by associating NFL-101 with other smoking cessation methods. The PRECESTO trial will compare against a placebo the ability of NFL-101 to reduce smoking satisfaction and cravings among 34 smokers with a cross-over design. Each participant will be his or her own control and will receive  on a random and alternating basis  either NFL-101 or the placebo at the start of each of the two periods during which they will assess smoking satisfaction and desire to smoke using standardized international questionnaires. The trial will be carried out at the Eurofins-Optimed research institute in Grenoble  with the first recruitments scheduled for the start of 2023 and the results expected for the third quarter of 2023.About NFL BiosciencesNFL Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company based in the Montpellier area which develops botanical drug candidates for the treatment of addictions.

Name : EKINOPS ISIN Code : FR0011466069 Mnemonic code : EKI Number of shares: 26 431 086  Attachments   Original Link   Original Document…,"PARIS  January 11  2023 - 6:00 pm - EKINOPS (Euronext Paris - FR0011466069 - EKI)  a leading supplier of telecommunication solutions for telecom operators and enterprises  has published its revenue for the 2022 financial year  ending on December 31  2022.Ekinops ended FY 2022 with consolidated revenue of €127.6m  up 23% from the previous year (+19% at constant exchange rates).Q4 2022 revenue totaled €31.5m versus €28.7 million a year earlier  representing an increase of 10% (+6% at constant exchange rates) despite the particularly strong pressure on the supply chain at year-end. The difficulties in delivering some orders at the end of the year resulted in a shortfall of a few million euros of revenue in Q4 2022 which will be shipped in early 2023 without causing major disruption to customers.At the same time  business activity and order intake remained vigorous in Q4.The Group's brisk growth in 2022 was fueled by strong demand for all its product lines  particularly for Optical Transport solutions (up 29% in 2022) which was boosted by the success of 200 Gb/s and 400 Gb/s WDM systems  notably in North America.Access solutions reported annual growth of 20%  mainly driven by the sharp rebound in business in France.The share of Software & Services continued to grow  representing 15% of Group revenue in 2022. Full-year revenue generated by Software & Services rose by over 38%  driven by sales of software which facilitates network functions' virtualization and by a company focus on providing more services.2022 was characterized by international growth which remained dynamic  up 17% for the full year. International business accounted for 64% in 2022 (vs. 67% for FY 2021).In North America  activity continued to record robust growth with business volumes totaling €29.8m versus €19.1m in 2021  representing a very significant increase of 56% (+39% in USD). Ekinops benefited from strong demand for Optical Transport equipment in the region. North America represented 23% of Group's total sales in 2022 (vs. 18% in 2021).Asia-Pacific posted a strong growth trajectory in 2022  up 38% on a full-year basis. The region accounted for 7% of Ekinops' total business activity in 2022 (vs. 6% in 2021).EMEA (Europe  excluding France  the Middle-East and Africa)  generated FY 2022 revenue of €43.5m  slightly down by 2% versus the prior year  largely owing to a base effect (note that the EMEA region delivered the strongest growth in 2021 at +29%). EMEA represented 34% of Ekinops' total business activity (vs. 43% in 2021).The Group restored sharp growth in France; in its domestic market  Ekinops' 2022 sales amounted to €45.9m  significantly up by 36% (vs. -0.3% in 2021)  representing 36% of Group total revenue (vs. 33% in 2021). This growth is the result of a strong increase in sales achieved with Ekinops' long-standing customers.FY 2022 was marked by the accelerated growth momentum reported in 2021  despite persistent supply problems for certain electronic components which only now seem to ease.Bolstered by this successful performance  Ekinops confirms its annual guidance for 2022:gross margin between 52% and 56% ;; EBITDA margin between 14% and 18%.Ekinops will publish its 2022 annual results on March 7  2022.Didier Brédy  Chairman and CEO of Ekinops  said:""2022 reflects a considerable acceleration in our growth  from +12% in 2021 to +23% in 2022  despite a disrupted market environment and a challenging year-end for production.2023 is off to an excellent start  with high demand  illustrated by our record order intake for this period of the year. We continue to win market share thanks to our differentiated offer in our segments  coupled with our ability to meet better than others the lead times required by existing and new customers.We can already foresee yet another year of double-digit growth for Ekinops.""Ekinops is a leading provider of open  trusted and innovative network connectivity solutions to service providers around the world.

Now  building off that momentum  throughout January and February  ThriveDX Enterprise CEO  Roy Zur  is launching the full suite of human factor security solutions to Exclusive Networks' European ecosystem  specifically in the United Kingdom  France  Germany  Italy  Spain  the Netherlands  Sweden  Poland and additional countries. ThriveDX provides a 360° approach to human-factor security with employee education  training and simulations that goes beyond traditional security awareness programs  offering relevant cyber training for every position in the organization  including application security for developers and engineers  beyond awareness training for non-technical roles  specialized executive training  as well as cybersecurity bootcamps and talent solutions.ThriveDX recently conducted a Global Cybersecurity Awareness Study with 1 900 CISOs and some of the results indicated that 97% of respondents are convinced that cybersecurity awareness training leads to greater corporate security. The timing for ThriveDX and Exclusive Networks strategic partnership is perfect because the study also indicated that 99% of the respondents recognize a positive influence on the culture of errors in the company with security awareness training.“Executives and security professionals globally are realizing that technology alone cannot keep their enterprises safe from increasing cyber threats. Rather  they need solutions that directly address the role of the human factor as the weakest link in cybersecurity. ThriveDX is the only company providing a 360° approach to solving the human risk factor  going beyond awareness with effective solutions to address the lack of skills ” said Roy Zur  CEO  ThriveDX Enterprise. “We look forward to working with thousands of our current and new European partners and customers and creating a human firewall across their organizations.”ThriveDX serves customers in more than 60 countries globally and already has millions of users in Europe including Fortune-500 companies and top European banks  tech companies  manufacturers  health care providers  universities  governments and more.

The presence of a reference shareholder in our capital such as Guerbet responds to this challenge. It provides us with the ability to penetrate our target markets much more rapidly and efficiently through an enriched offering and the optimization of our visibility within the global medical imaging ecosystem. We are delighted with this opportunity for Intrasense and welcome the great complementarity of our proposals""  comments Nicolas Reymond  CEO of Intrasense.""Our acquisition of a stake in Intrasense is a concrete expression of our desire to leverage the digital imaging technology and algorithms that we have developed over the past several years. This strategic partnership will enable us to benefit from proven expertise in the integration of artificial intelligence into the clinical routine of practitioners in imaging and oncology""  said David Hale  CEO of Guerbet.Story continuesA joint development project in Artificial IntelligenceIntrasense has recognized expertise in the field of software solutions that facilitate and secure diagnosis  decision making and therapeutic follow-up in medical imaging  in particular thanks to its clinical orchestration capabilities of artificial intelligence  within the daily practice of clinicians.Guerbet  a leading global player in the medical imaging market  has diversified its activities in the digital sector in recent years  notably by developing innovative artificial intelligence algorithms enabling the detection of liver lesions  prostate and pancreatic cancers and bone metastases. In November 2022  Guerbet took over all the algorithms developed in the framework of its partnership with Merative (IBM Watson) as well as their intellectual property  giving it the strategic latitude necessary to plan the marketing of these solutions.Guerbet's acquisition of a stake in Intrasense will enable Intrasense to enhance its product offering and benefit from the support of a major shareholder to carry out the investments required to implement its growth plan. It will enable Guerbet to enhance the value of its technology and artificial intelligence algorithms.As part of this project  Intrasense and Guerbet plan to enter into a licensing agreement in the first half of 2023 that would enable Intrasense to integrate and market Guerbet's artificial intelligence algorithms within its software platforms  thereby complementing the various partnerships already concluded in oncology. A collaboration agreement has been in place since October 2022 to study the technical feasibility of this integration and the two companies have also recently entered into a non-binding agreement on the main terms and conditions of the envisaged licensing agreement. This agreement was negotiated at arm's length. More specifically  it will enable Intrasense to integrate the algorithms developed by Guerbet for the detection of liver lesions  prostate cancer  pancreatic cancer and bone lesions into its Myrian product offering and into its new oncology product line.

The Group continues to grow outside of the war zone (around +11%). However  the Company is impacted by the geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe and the health situation in China. Therefore  the Company anticipates a consolidated turnover of circa €3.8M by December 31  2022  with an overall decrease of approximately 9% in revenues compared to the previous year.Intrasense is also diversifying its activities in new geographies such as Brazil. Despite the health situation  China performed well with a +25% growth in activity. These results therefore validate the choices made over the last few months  as well as the resilience and responsiveness of the Company.Restated operating profit before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) would be between €-2.3 million and €-2.9 million for the year 2022  including €-0.6 million IFRS 2 impacts. This operating result is the result of the investment policy decided in mid-2021 in the context of the development of the new product line related to oncology and remains monitored and controlled.Intrasense's gross cash position is expected to be circa €+1.4 million on December 31  2022  after taking into account the State Guaranteed Loan (SGL) of €547 000 obtained by Intrasense on December 23  2022. Thus  Intrasense's cash position net of financial debt on December 31  2022 should be circa €+1.0 million.By 2026  Intrasense aims  through its strategy of integrating artificial intelligence technology from third parties  including Guerbet  at doubling its revenues compared to fiscal year 2022  and at reaching operational balance (in terms of EBITDA).DisclaimerThe Share Capital Increase did not give rise to the approval of a prospectus by the AMF.At the request of the Company  the listing of Intrasense shares will resume on January 12  2023 at markets opening.About IntrasenseFounded in 2004  Intrasense develops and markets a unique medical device  Myrian®  a software platform that facilitates and secures diagnosis  decision making and therapeutic follow-up.Thanks to Myrian®  more than 1 000 healthcare institutions in 40 countries benefit from a single  integrated platform for reading all types of images (MRI  CT  etc.).

The group's performance was particularly strong in France  as reflected by a solid B2C subscriber growth of over 8% as of December 31  2022 compared to December 31  2021 (with the global B2C subscriber count remaining flat year-over-year).Further to delivering double-digit revenue growth  Deezer was able to significantly improve its estimated adjusted EBITDA loss  expected to be in the range of €57-60 million in 2022 (compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of €65 million in 2021). The group has strongly improved its operating performance  which allowed it to make substantial incremental spending  of approximately €7 million  in product development and innovation  notably for the development of the Zen application launched in December 2022.Deezer will release its full-year 2022 results on February 28  2023.OutlookWith respect to 2023  in order to mitigate execution risks in the current market conditions and secure its path to profitability by 2025  Deezer has decided to prioritize its profitability  while still delivering double- digit revenue growth compared to 2022.In 2023  the group will continue to execute on its four strategic priorities  seeking to further optimize its B2C business with a clear focus on improving unit economics  and continuing to expand its B2B business in its targeted geographies.Consequently  Deezer expects for 2023:Double-digit revenue growth  in excess of 10% compared to 2022 3   mainly driven by the further expansion of the B2B segment;revenue growth  in excess of 10% compared to 2022   mainly driven by the further expansion of the B2B segment; A further significant reduction in adjusted EBITDA loss compared to 2022.Given its focus on profitable growth  Deezer confirms it remains on a path to generate a positive cash flow4 in 2024 and to achieve a positive adjusted EBITDA in 2025  while delivering double-digit annual revenue growth over the period5.Unaudited. This compares to a guidance of revenue of approximately €455 million for 2022  representing a growth of approximately 14% compared to 2021. This compares to the previous objective of revenue of approximately €560 million for 2023  representing a growth of approximately 24% compared to 2022. Cash flow pre-funding. In this context  and in a new challenging macroeconomic environment  the previous ambition to generate revenue of €1 billion and a cash flow pre-funding superior to €50 million in 2025 might be delayed.1,neutral,0.06,0.93,0.0,mixed,0.24,0.12,0.64,True,English,"['strong focus', '2022 results', '2023 outlook', 'profitability', 'new challenging macroeconomic environment', 'global B2C subscriber count', 'solid B2C subscriber growth', 'double- digit revenue growth', 'double-digit annual revenue growth', 'substantial incremental spending', 'current market conditions', 'four strategic priorities', 'positive cash flow4', 'positive adjusted EBITDA', 'double-digit revenue growth', 'B2C business', 'profitable growth', 'EBITDA loss', 'full-year 2022 results1', 'full-year 2023 budget', 'strong acceleration', 'Zen application', 'execution risks', 'unit economics', 'B2B business', 'B2B segment', 'significant reduction', 'previous objective', 'previous ambition', 'strong focus', 'clear focus', 'Euronext Paris', 'operating performance', 'product development', '2023 outlook', 'profitability', 'Board', 'Directors', 'Deezer', 'DEEZR', 'group', 'regard', 'figures', 'France', 'December', 'range', 'innovation', 'February', 'respect', 'order', 'path', 'targeted', 'geographies', 'excess', 'expansion', 'period', 'guidance', 'funding', 'context']",2023-01-11,2023-01-11,marketscreener.com

This nonrefundable grant is intended to support projects helping drive the sustainable transformation of key sectors in the French economy through technological innovation. Two other funding requests for a total of 1.5 million euros are currently being examined by Bpifrance. A response is expected during the first quarter of 2023.The PRECESTO Phase IIa clinical trial aims primarily to validate the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation treatments and particularly nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) with a view to developing an innovative treatment method by associating NFL-101 with other smoking cessation methods (see press release from November 8  2022).Ignacio Faus  NFL Biosciences’ Chief Executive Officer: “For nicotine addiction research  the cost of clinical trials is relatively low compared with other indications  particularly because patients are monitored on an outpatient basis  yet smoking cessation offers a very strong level of commercial potential on account of the number of smokers and the limitations involved with current treatments. As we maintain a very low fixed cost structure  the vast majority of the funds are allocated to financing clinical trials and therefore serve to increase the potential value of NFL Biosciences’ projects. We would like to warmly thank our partners on this operation  and particularly BPI Occitanie”.PRECESTO: a clinical trial that will be launched at the start of 2023 with a view to explore the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation drugsPRECESTO is a proof-of-concept clinical trial with the primary objective to validate the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation treatments and particularly nicotine replacement therapies (transdermal patches  tablets  chewing gums  inhalers and nicotine sprays) with a view to developing an innovative treatment method by associating NFL-101 with other smoking cessation methods. The PRECESTO trial will compare against a placebo the ability of NFL-101 to reduce smoking satisfaction and cravings among 34 smokers with a cross-over design. Each participant will be his or her own control and will receive  on a random and alternating basis  either NFL-101 or the placebo at the start of each of the two periods during which they will assess smoking satisfaction and desire to smoke using standardized international questionnaires. The trial will be carried out at the Eurofins-Optimed research institute in Grenoble  with the first recruitments scheduled for the start of 2023 and the results expected for the third quarter of 2023.About NFL BiosciencesNFL Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company based in the Montpellier area which develops botanical drug candidates for the treatment of addictions.

Had the Company not been willing to agree to submit the issuance of the Kreos Subscription Rights to the EGM  Kreos Capital VII (UK) Limited would probably not have been willing to (or only at terms less favourable to the Company  if at all) provide the Loan Facility to the Company.The net proceeds paid to the Company by Kreos Capital VII (UK) Limited upon the drawdown by the Company of the Loan Facility (of which the issuance of the Kreos Subscription Rights formed a part) form an important source of funding that allow the Company to finance its development and activities (which is in the interest of the Company and its stakeholders).Furthermore  while it cannot be guaranteed that the Kreos Subscription Rights will ultimately be exercised  the exercise of the proposed Kreos Subscription Rights by Kreos  and the payment of the relevant exercise price of the Kreos Subscription Rights by Kreos  if any  will enable the Company to obtain additional cash resources  which can be further used to fund the Company's business activities  and to strengthen its balance sheet. The board of directors notes that any dilution resulting from the exercise of the Kreos Subscription Rights is outweighed by the risks and disadvantages if the Company were not able to raise new funds (through the Loan Facility) to support its working capital and its going concern.The mechanisms pursuant to which the exercise prices of the Kreos Subscription Rights have been determined in the Conditions are the result of negotiations that occurred between the Company and Kreos Capital VII (UK) Limited in an at arm's length manner.The board of directors considers the proposed exercise prices of the Kreos Subscription Rights (i.e.  EUR 5.31 per new share for the Initial Kreos Subscription Rights and EUR 5.77 per new share for the Subsequent Kreos Subscription Rights) to be justified since (amongst other things)  as described above  the exercise prices have been determined in function of the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average price of the Company's shares traded on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels in a 30 day reference period prior to the closing of the Kreos Loan Agreement (for the Initial Kreos Subscription Rights) and the drawdown of",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.01,0.99,True,English,"['Sequana Medical N', 'Statutory Auditor', 'Report', 'Kreos Capital VII Aggregator SCSp', '1 Boulevard de la Foire', 'Initial Kreos Subscription Rights', 'Subsequent Kreos Subscription Rights', 'statutory preferential subscription right', 'extraordinary general meeting', 'Sequana Medical NV', 'additional cash resources', '30 day reference period', 'Kreos Loan Agreement', 'special limited partnership', 'relevant exercise price', 'Luxembourg Companies Register', 'working capital', 'membership rights', 'statutory auditor', 'Belgian Companies', 'issue/exercise price', 'average price', 'Loan Facility', 'financial information', 'Associations Code', 'financial data', 'fair view', 'material respects', 'Grand Duchy', 'legal successors', 'net proceeds', 'important source', 'balance sheet', 'new funds', 'going concern', 'length manner', 'new share', 'other things', 'arithmetic average', 'daily volume', 'regulated market', 'Euronext Brussels', 'exercise prices', 'permitted successors', 'business activities', 'UK) Limited', 'Review report', 'accounting', 'board', 'directors', 'articles', 'Conclusion', 'attention', 'justification', 'cancellation', 'effects', 'property', 'shareholders', 'true', 'operation', 'fact', 'favor', 'laws', 'office', 'number', 'assigns', 'decision', 'issuance', 'benefit', 'elements', 'Company', 'consideration', 'willingness', 'affiliate', '19 July', 'EGM', 'terms', 'drawdown', 'funding', 'development', 'interest', 'stakeholders', 'payment', 'dilution', 'risks', 'disadvantages', 'mechanisms', 'Conditions', 'result', 'negotiations', 'arm', 'function', 'shares', 'closing']",2023-01-11,2023-01-11,marketscreener.com

Founded and promoted by the entrepreneur Sisc…,"BARCELONA  Spain  Jan. 11  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- H2PLT  a new renewable energy company based on green hydrogen and solar energy  just began operations to create Spain's first green hydrogen microgeneration network.Founded and promoted by the entrepreneur Sisco Sapena  president and founder of the public company Lleida.net  H2PLT has developed a proprietary model that allows innovative uses of hydrogen in underdeveloped applications  such as its use as a vector for reelectrification and application in electro-power stations or hydro generators.Sisco Sapena  CEO and founder of H2PLTIts headquarters are in the city of Lleida.The company seeks to promote electrified mobility and its innovative uses through ""H2aX"" applications and the development of small photovoltaic power plants dedicated exclusively to the generation of green hydrogen  through a model that can be replicated in a modular way in different parts of Spain and Europe.To this end  it uses small photovoltaic farms and surplus solar electricity to manufacture green hydrogen by electrolysis. The hydrogen is stored and converted into electricity when needed by a fuel cell.Its business model is based on the sale of hydrogen created by solar energy  its conversion into electricity during the night and sale to the wholesale market or through the network of own gas stations and hydrogenerators that will be created.H2PLT WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY FOR 160 000 PEOPLE PER YEAR.H2PLT already has 80 hectares in the El Pedernoso Solar Park (Cuenca  Spain) and from next year will have the potential to generate 2.5 tons of hydrogen per day and a capacity of up to 40 MW.The company plans to start selling to the wholesale market from the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition  it has already begun planning the construction of one of Spain's largest electric refueling stations in El Pedernoso  Cuenca  with more than 20 electric refueling stations  to which will be added the possibility of refueling hydrogen  which will be operational in the coming months.At total capacity  according to a Power-to-Power model  which allows converting green hydrogen into electricity through fuel cells  the plant can supply renewable electricity to the equivalent of a population of 160 000 people per year.The Power-to-Power model solves the problem of the intermittency of renewable energy and allows renewable energy produced during the day to be harnessed and used at night.The company plans to go public on Euronext in the second half of 2023  and is considering dual-listing in the United States at a later date.Founded in February 2022 with an initial capital of 210 000 euros  its current team amounts to six people  including international reference specialists in the fuel cell industry.THE FOUNDER OF H2PLT IS SISCO SAPENAThe founder and CEO of the project is Sisco Sapena  known for having founded in 1995 the listed Lleida.net  European leader in the industry of certified electronic signature  notification and contracting.Lleida.net is listed on Euronext Growth in Paris  OTC Markets in New York and BME Growth in Madrid. It has subsidiaries in 19 countries and some 200 employees. It was the company that rose the most on the stock market in Europe in 2020  with a valuation of around 300 million euros  and has more than 3 000 shareholders.The company plans to file at least 15 patents on new applications and processes linked to hydrogen generation.Sisco Sapena is already a signatory of more than 220 patents on the subject  and his profile has been picked up by global media such as Financial Times  Bloomberg or Reuters.Green hydrogen is produced using renewable energy sources  such as wind or solar power  to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. It is a clean  renewable fuel for transportation  electricity generation and other applications.At the moment  there is undoubted geopolitical interest on the part of the European Union to accelerate the adoption of hydrogen generation networks.Recently  the European Commission announced the launch of the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance  in the absence of an ecosystem to address the energy needs required in the next 15 years.Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1972437/Sisco_Sapena.jpgSOURCE H2PLT",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,True,English,"['first green hydrogen microgeneration network', 'Sisco Sapena', 'H2PLT', 'company', 'Spain', 'first green hydrogen microgeneration network', 'largest electric refueling stations', 'small photovoltaic power plants', 'El Pedernoso Solar Park', 'European Clean Hydrogen Alliance', 'H2PLT IS SISCO SAPENA', 'small photovoltaic farms', '20 electric refueling stations', 'new renewable energy company', 'international reference specialists', 'certified electronic signature', 'clean, renewable fuel', 'renewable energy sources', 'surplus solar electricity', 'fuel cell industry', 'hydrogen generation networks', 'solar energy', 'solar power', 'electro-power stations', 'gas stations', 'New York', 'new applications', 'fuel cells', 'European leader', 'European Union', 'European Commission', 'energy needs', 'renewable electricity', 'innovative uses', 'underdeveloped applications', 'hydro generators', 'electrified mobility', 'H2aX"" applications', 'modular way', 'different parts', 'wholesale market', 'fourth quarter', 'coming months', 'second half', 'United States', 'later date', 'initial capital', 'current team', 'OTC Markets', 'BME Growth', 'stock market', 'global media', 'Financial Times', 'water molecules', 'other applications', 'geopolitical interest', 'next 15 years', 'Power model', 'proprietary model', 'business model', 'Lleida.net', 'GENERATE ELECTRICITY', 'electricity generation', 'The Power', 'public company', 'SOURCE H2PLT', 'total capacity', 'Euronext Growth', '300 million euros', 'next year', 'six people', '210,000 euros', '160,000 PEOPLE', 'Spain', 'Jan.', 'PRNewswire', 'operations', 'president', 'founder', 'vector', 'reelectrification', 'CEO', 'headquarters', 'development', 'end', 'electrolysis', 'conversion', 'night', 'hydrogenerators', '80 hectares', 'Cuenca', 'potential', '2.5 tons', 'day', '40 MW', 'addition', 'construction', 'possibility', 'equivalent', 'population', 'problem', 'intermittency', 'dual-listing', 'February', 'project', 'notification', 'contracting', 'Paris', 'Madrid', 'subsidiaries', '19 countries', '200 employees', '3,000 shareholders', '15 patents', 'processes', 'signatory', '220 patents', 'subject', 'profile', 'Bloomberg', 'Reuters', 'wind', 'oxygen', 'transportation', 'moment', 'adoption', 'launch', 'absence', 'ecosystem', 'Sisco_Sapena']",2023-01-11,2023-01-11,prnewswire.co.uk

The difficulties in delivering some orders at the end of the year resulted in a shortfall of a few million euros of revenue in Q4 2022 which will be shipped in early 2023 without causing major disruption to customers.At the same time  business activity and order intake remained vigorous in Q4.Robust momentum for all business lines with over 38% increase in software and servicesThe Group's brisk growth in 2022 was fueled by strong demand for all its product lines  particularly for Optical Transport solutions (up 29% in 2022) which was boosted by the success of 200 Gb/s and 400 Gb/s WDM systems  notably in North America.Access solutions reported annual growth of 20%  mainly driven by the sharp rebound in business in France.The share of Software & Services continued to grow  representing 15% of Group revenue in 2022. Full-year revenue generated by Software & Services rose by over 38%  driven by sales of software which facilitates network functions' virtualization and by a company focus on providing more services.Strong growth internationally with 56% increase in North America2022 was characterized by international growth which remained dynamic  up 17% for the full year.

Ekinops benefited from strong demand for Optical Transport equipment in the region. North America represented 23% of Group's total sales in 2022 (vs. 18% in 2021).Asia-Pacific posted a strong growth trajectory in 2022  up 38% on a full-year basis. The region accounted for 7% of Ekinops' total business activity in 2022 (vs. 6% in 2021).EMEA (Europe  excluding France  the Middle-East and Africa)  generated FY 2022 revenue of €43.5m  slightly down by 2% versus the prior year  largely owing to a base effect (note that the EMEA region delivered the strongest growth in 2021 at +29%). EMEA represented 34% of Ekinops' total business activity (vs. 43% in 2021).The Group restored sharp growth in France; in its domestic market  Ekinops' 2022 sales amounted to €45.9m  significantly up by 36% (vs. -0.3% in 2021)  representing 36% of Group total revenue (vs. 33% in 2021). This growth is the result of a strong increase in sales achieved with Ekinops' long-standing customers.2022 guidance confirmed for gross margin and EBITDAFY 2022 was marked by the accelerated growth momentum reported in 2021  despite persistent supply problems for certain electronic components which only now seem to ease.Bolstered by this successful performance  Ekinops confirms its annual guidance for 2022:gross margin between 52% and 56% ;; EBITDA margin between 14% and 18%.Ekinops will publish its 2022 annual results on March 7  2022.Didier Brédy  Chairman and CEO of Ekinops  said:""2022 reflects a considerable acceleration in our growth  from +12% in 2021 to +23% in 2022  despite a disrupted market environment and a challenging year-end for production.2023 is off to an excellent start  with high demand  illustrated by our record order intake for this period of the year.

Following this acquisition  Guerbet plans to file in the near future  on a voluntary basis  a proposed tender offer for the balance of the shares of Intrasense at a price of 0.44 euro per share  and for the securities giving access to the share capital of the Company (the ""Offer"")  in order to offer to Intrasense’s shareholders  and to holders of securities giving access to the share capital of the Company  an immediate liquidity under the same price conditions  without any intent to delist Intrasense.

The presence of a reference shareholder in our capital such as Guerbet responds to this challenge. It provides us with the ability to penetrate our target markets much more rapidly and efficiently through an enriched offering and the optimization of our visibility within the global medical imaging ecosystem. We are delighted with this opportunity for Intrasense and welcome the great complementarity of our proposals""  comments Nicolas Reymond  CEO of Intrasense. ""Our acquisition of a stake in Intrasense is a concrete expression of our desire to leverage the digital imaging technology and algorithms that we have developed over the past several years. This strategic partnership will enable us to benefit from proven expertise in the integration of artificial intelligence into the clinical routine of practitioners in imaging and oncology""  said David Hale  CEO of Guerbet. A joint development project in Artificial Intelligence Intrasense has recognized expertise in the field of software solutions that facilitate and secure diagnosis  decision making and therapeutic follow-up in medical imaging  in particular thanks to its clinical orchestration capabilities of artificial intelligence  within the daily practice of clinicians.Guerbet  a leading global player in the medical imaging market  has diversified its activities in the digital sector in recent years  notably by developing innovative artificial intelligence algorithms enabling the detection of liver lesions  prostate and pancreatic cancers and bone metastases. In November 2022  Guerbet took over all the algorithms developed in the framework of its partnership with Merative (IBM Watson) as well as their intellectual property  giving it the strategic latitude necessary to plan the marketing of these solutions. Guerbet's acquisition of a stake in Intrasense will enable Intrasense to enhance its product offering and benefit from the support of a major shareholder to carry out the investments required to implement its growth plan. It will enable Guerbet to enhance the value of its technology and artificial intelligence algorithms. As part of this project  Intrasense and Guerbet plan to enter into a licensing agreement in the first half of 2023 that would enable Intrasense to integrate and market Guerbet's artificial intelligence algorithms within its software platforms  thereby complementing the various partnerships already concluded in oncology. A collaboration agreement has been in place since October 2022 to study the technical feasibility of this integration and the two companies have also recently entered into a non-binding agreement on the main terms and conditions of the envisaged licensing agreement. This agreement was negotiated at arm's length. More specifically  it will enable Intrasense to integrate the algorithms developed by Guerbet for the detection of liver lesions  prostate cancer  pancreatic cancer and bone lesions into its Myrian product offering and into its new oncology product line. Intrasense will be responsible for the clinical validation and regulatory registration of the products for which it will be the legal manufacturer. Integration of numerous artificial intelligence technologies from Guerbet and third parties is in line with the ‘clinical routine tools’ strategy already initiated by Intrasense. The delivery of this strategy will strengthen Intrasense's high value-added offering in the global imaging market. As a world leader in medical imaging  Guerbet is recognized for its expertise and has a global marketing and sales presence. Intrasense will benefit from this unique insight into various markets around the world  notably through a stronger presence at major world imaging conferences. Thanks to these numerous assets  Intrasense  an autonomous structure linked to Guerbet  aims to continue to grow in its markets.

Consequently  no squeeze-out will be implemented at the end of the Offer  even if the legal and regulatory conditions are met. The Offer will be financed by Guerbet through the use of its existing credit facilities and will not be subject to any regulatory approval or other conditions. The Offer and the offeror's draft tender offer document will remain subject to review by the AMF  which will assess their compliance with the applicable legal and regulatory provisions. Appointment of an independent expert in connection with the proposed Offer An investment agreement was signed today between the Company and Guerbet for the purposes of the completion of the Share Capital Increase and the launch of the Offer (the ""Investment Agreement""). The Investment Agreement  the content of which will be detailed in Guerbet's draft tender offer document in the context of the proposed Offer  is intended to govern the terms and conditions of Guerbet's investment in the share capital of the Company as well as the governance of the Company following the Offer. In accordance with article 261-1-III of the general regulations of the AMF  the Board of Directors of Intrasense set up an ad hoc committee on December 23  2022  composed of the following members: Ms. Michèle Lesieur  independent director  Chair of the ad hoc committee;Ms. Anne Larpin  independent director;Mr. Patrice Rullier  independent director. It is specified that the purpose of the ad hoc committee is (i) to propose to the Board of Directors the appointment of the independent expert  (ii) to ensure the follow-up of the work of the independent expert  and (iii) to prepare a draft reasoned opinion concerning the proposed Offer. The Board of Directors met today and unanimously appointed  in accordance with the recommendation of the ad hoc committee  Paper Audit & Conseil  represented by Mr Xavier Paper  as independent expert. The latter will be in charge of drafting a report on the financial conditions of the proposed Offer  pursuant to article 261-1-I  1°  2°  4° and 5° of the AMF's general regulations.

In light of the conclusions of the independent expert's report  the Board of Directors of the Company will meet in order to decide on the interest of the Offer and on the consequences of the latter for the Company  its shareholders and its employees. The report of the independent expert and the reasoned opinion of the Board of Directors of Intrasense will be included in the draft response document prepared by the Company  which will be filed with the Autorité des marchés financiers (""AMF"") in order to obtain a declaration of compliance  in accordance with applicable regulations. Guerbet and the Company will inform Intrasense’s shareholders of key developments relating to the Offer as soon as possible. Update on fiscal year 2022 activity and outlook for Intrasense On this occasion  Intrasense announces its first unaudited business results for the year 2022. The Group continues to grow outside of the war zone (around +11%). However  the Company is impacted by the geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe and the health situation in China. Therefore  the Company anticipates a consolidated turnover of circa €3.8M by December 31  2022  with an overall decrease of approximately 9% in revenues compared to the previous year. Intrasense is also diversifying its activities in new geographies such as Brazil. Despite the health situation  China performed well with a +25% growth in activity. These results therefore validate the choices made over the last few months  as well as the resilience and responsiveness of the Company. Restated operating profit before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) would be between €-2.3 million and €-2.9 million for the year 2022  including €-0.6 million IFRS 2 impacts. This operating result is the result of the investment policy decided in mid-2021 in the context of the development of the new product line related to oncology and remains monitored and controlled. Intrasense's gross cash position is expected to be circa €+1.4 million on December 31  2022  after taking into account the State Guaranteed Loan (SGL) of €547 000 obtained by Intrasense on December 23  2022. Thus  Intrasense's cash position net of financial debt on December 31  2022 should be circa €+1.0 million. By 2026  Intrasense aims  through its strategy of integrating artificial intelligence technology from third parties  including Guerbet  at doubling its revenues compared to fiscal year 2022  and at reaching operational balance (in terms of EBITDA). Disclaimer The Share Capital Increase did not give rise to the approval of a prospectus by the AMF.At the request of the Company  the listing of Intrasense shares will resume on January 12  2023 at markets opening.

The Group continues to grow outside of the war zone (around +11%). However  the Company is impacted by the geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe and the health situation in China. Therefore  the Company anticipates a consolidated turnover of circa €3.8M by December 31  2022  with an overall decrease of approximately 9% in revenues compared to the previous year.Intrasense is also diversifying its activities in new geographies such as Brazil. Despite the health situation  China performed well with a +25% growth in activity. These results therefore validate the choices made over the last few months  as well as the resilience and responsiveness of the Company.Restated operating profit before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) would be between €-2.3 million and €-2.9 million for the year 2022  including €-0.6 million IFRS 2 impacts. This operating result is the result of the investment policy decided in mid-2021 in the context of the development of the new product line related to oncology and remains monitored and controlled.Intrasense's gross cash position is expected to be circa €+1.4 million on December 31  2022  after taking into account the State Guaranteed Loan (SGL) of €547 000 obtained by Intrasense on December 23  2022. Thus  Intrasense's cash position net of financial debt on December 31  2022 should be circa €+1.0 million.By 2026  Intrasense aims  through its strategy of integrating artificial intelligence technology from third parties  including Guerbet  at doubling its revenues compared to fiscal year 2022  and at reaching operational balance (in terms of EBITDA).DisclaimerThe Share Capital Increase did not give rise to the approval of a prospectus by the AMF.At the request of the Company  the listing of Intrasense shares will resume on January 12  2023 at markets opening.About IntrasenseFounded in 2004  Intrasense develops and markets a unique medical device  Myrian®  a software platform that facilitates and secures diagnosis  decision making and therapeutic follow-up.Thanks to Myrian®  more than 1 000 healthcare institutions in 40 countries benefit from a single  integrated platform for reading all types of images (MRI  CT  etc.).

Air France-KLM already redeemed EUR500 million of the loan in December 2021 and made another early repayment of EUR1 billion in November 2022.In an investors presentation seen by ch-aviation  the group stressed that the bonds  which are unrated  are part of its “sustainability-linked financing framework”  which will focus on what it said “is the most material key performance indicator” in the aviation sector  namely greenhouse gas emissions intensity (the amount of CO2 emitted per revenue ton kilometre  or tCO2/RTK). If it fails to meet pre-specified metrics within a certain timeframe  the interest it pays on the bonds rises.Under the overall framework  which it said was the first from the sector  the group commits to reducing emissions intensity by 10% by 2025 and 30% by 2030  from a 2019 baseline. Fleet renewal through the acquisition of new aircraft  including 100 Airbus narrowbodies that were ordered in December 2021 with options for an additional 60  will help it achieve this  it said.It aims to reach net zero emissions by 2050  through a combination of fleet renewal (21%)  operational efficiency (10%)  new technology such as “new turbine and aerodynamic frameworks” (16%)  and sustainable aviation fuels (45%).
