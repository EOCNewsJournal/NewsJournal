The difficulties in delivering some orders at the end of the year resulted in a shortfall of a few million euros of revenue in Q4 2022 which will be shipped in early 2023 without causing major disruption to customers.At the same time  business activity and order intake remained vigorous in Q4.Robust momentum for all business lines with over 38% increase in software and servicesThe Group's brisk growth in 2022 was fueled by strong demand for all its product lines  particularly for Optical Transport solutions (up 29% in 2022) which was boosted by the success of 200 Gb/s and 400 Gb/s WDM systems  notably in North America.Access solutions reported annual growth of 20%  mainly driven by the sharp rebound in business in France.The share of Software & Services continued to grow  representing 15% of Group revenue in 2022. Full-year revenue generated by Software & Services rose by over 38%  driven by sales of software which facilitates network functions' virtualization and by a company focus on providing more services.Strong growth internationally with 56% increase in North America2022 was characterized by international growth which remained dynamic  up 17% for the full year. International business accounted for 64% in 2022 (vs. 67% for FY 2021).Story continuesIn North America  activity continued to record robust growth with business volumes totaling €29.8m versus €19.1m in 2021  representing a very significant increase of 56% (+39% in USD). Ekinops benefited from strong demand for Optical Transport equipment in the region. North America represented 23% of Group's total sales in 2022 (vs. 18% in 2021).Asia-Pacific posted a strong growth trajectory in 2022  up 38% on a full-year basis. The region accounted for 7% of Ekinops' total business activity in 2022 (vs. 6% in 2021).EMEA (Europe  excluding France  the Middle-East and Africa)  generated FY 2022 revenue of €43.5m  slightly down by 2% versus the prior year  largely owing to a base effect (note that the EMEA region delivered the strongest growth in 2021 at +29%). EMEA represented 34% of Ekinops' total business activity (vs. 43% in 2021).The Group restored sharp growth in France; in its domestic market  Ekinops' 2022 sales amounted to €45.9m  significantly up by 36% (vs. -0.3% in 2021)  representing 36% of Group total revenue (vs. 33% in 2021). This growth is the result of a strong increase in sales achieved with Ekinops' long-standing customers.2022 guidance confirmed for gross margin and EBITDAFY 2022 was marked by the accelerated growth momentum reported in 2021  despite persistent supply problems for certain electronic components which only now seem to ease.Bolstered by this successful performance  Ekinops confirms its annual guidance for 2022:gross margin between 52% and 56% ;EBITDA margin between 14% and 18%.Ekinops will publish its 2022 annual results on March 7  2022.Didier Brédy  Chairman and CEO of Ekinops  said:""2022 reflects a considerable acceleration in our growth  from +12% in 2021 to +23% in 2022  despite a disrupted market environment and a challenging year-end for production.2023 is off to an excellent start  with high demand  illustrated by our record order intake for this period of the year. We continue to win market share thanks to our differentiated offer in our segments  coupled with our ability to meet better than others the lead times required by existing and new customers.We can already foresee yet another year of double-digit growth for Ekinops.""All press releases are published after the close of trading on Euronext Paris.EKINOPS ContactDidier BrédyChairman and CEOcontact@ekinops.comInvestorsMathieu OmnesInvestor relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 92momnes@actus.frPhoto: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1981654/ekinops_2022_Q4.jpgLogo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/814911/Ekinops_Logo.jpgEkinops Logo (PRNewsfoto/Ekinops)CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ekinops-delivers-23-revenue-growth-in-2022-at-record-127-6-million-301719460.htmlSOURCE Ekinops France SA",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.63,0.1,0.28,True,English,"['23% revenue growth', 'Ekinops', 'record', 'SOURCE Ekinops France SA', 'constant exchange rates', ""network functions' virtualization"", 'Optical Transport equipment', 'Didier Brédy', 'persistent supply problems', 'Optical Transport solutions', 'total business activity', 'strong growth trajectory', 'Group total revenue', 'record order intake', ""Ekinops' long-standing customers"", 'supply chain', 'telecommunication solutions', 'Access solutions', 'strong pressure', 'strong demand', 'business lines', 'International business', 'business volumes', 'leading supplier', 'telecom operators', 'audited data', 'million euros', 'major disruption', 'same time', 'Robust momentum', 'The Group', 'product lines', 'North America', 'sharp rebound', 'company focus', 'total sales', 'full-year basis', 'base effect', 'domestic market', 'gross margin', 'electronic components', 'successful performance', '2022 annual results', 'considerable acceleration', 'market environment', 'excellent start', 'high demand', 'differentiated offer', 'lead times', 'new customers', 'press releases', 'Mathieu Omnes', 'Investor relation', 'original content', 'brisk growth', 'annual growth', 'international growth', 'robust growth', 'strongest growth', 'sharp growth', 'growth momentum', 'double-digit growth', 'H1 revenue', 'H2 revenue', '12-month revenue', 'consolidated revenue', 'Group revenue', 'Full-year revenue', '23% revenue growth', 'Euronext Paris', '2022 financial year', 'previous year', 'full year', 'prior year', 'strong increase', 'annual guidance', 'EBITDA margin', 'challenging year-end', 'market share', 'EKINOPS Contact', 'significant increase', 'Q4 2022 revenue', 'FY 2022 revenue', 'Ekinops Logo', 'EMEA region', '2022 guidance', '38% increase', '56% increase', 'Q4.', '2022 sales', 'Jan.', 'PRNewswire', 'enterprises', 'December', 'IFRS', 'SixSq', 'November', 'difficulties', 'orders', 'shortfall', 'early', 'software', 'services', '200 Gb/s', '400 Gb', 'Story', 'USD', 'Asia-Pacific', 'Europe', 'Middle-East', 'Africa', 'March', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'production', 'period', 'segments', 'ability', 'others', 'existing', 'close', 'trading', 'Investors', 'Tel.', 'momnes', 'Photo', 'Ekinops_Logo', 'PRNewsfoto', 'Cision', 'news-releases', '23-revenue', '64', '2021', '33', '1 53']",2023-01-11,2023-01-12,finance.yahoo.com

The hydrogen is stored and converted into electricity when needed by a fuel cell.Its business model is based on the sale of hydrogen created by solar energy  its conversion into electricity during the night and sale to the wholesale market or through the network of own gas stations and hydrogenerators that will be created.H2PLT WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY FOR 160 000 PEOPLE PER YEAR.H2PLT already has 80 hectares in the El Pedernoso Solar Park (Cuenca  Spain) and from next year will have the potential to generate 2.5 tons of hydrogen per day and a capacity of up to 40 MW.The company plans to start selling to the wholesale market from the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition  it has already begun planning the construction of one of Spain's largest electric refueling stations in El Pedernoso  Cuenca  with more than 20 electric refueling stations  to which will be added the possibility of refueling hydrogen  which will be operational in the coming months.Story continuesAt total capacity  according to a Power-to-Power model  which allows converting green hydrogen into electricity through fuel cells  the plant can supply renewable electricity to the equivalent of a population of 160 000 people per year.The Power-to-Power model solves the problem of the intermittency of renewable energy and allows renewable energy produced during the day to be harnessed and used at night.The company plans to go public on Euronext in the second half of 2023  and is considering dual-listing in the United States at a later date.Founded in February 2022 with an initial capital of 210 000 euros  its current team amounts to six people  including international reference specialists in the fuel cell industry.THE FOUNDER OF H2PLT IS SISCO SAPENAThe founder and CEO of the project is Sisco Sapena  known for having founded in 1995 the listed Lleida.net  European leader in the industry of certified electronic signature  notification and contracting.Lleida.net is listed on Euronext Growth in Paris  OTC Markets in New York and BME Growth in Madrid. It has subsidiaries in 19 countries and some 200 employees. It was the company that rose the most on the stock market in Europe in 2020  with a valuation of around 300 million euros  and has more than 3 000 shareholders.The company plans to file at least 15 patents on new applications and processes linked to hydrogen generation.Sisco Sapena is already a signatory of more than 220 patents on the subject  and his profile has been picked up by global media such as Financial Times  Bloomberg or Reuters.Green hydrogen is produced using renewable energy sources  such as wind or solar power  to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. It is a clean  renewable fuel for transportation  electricity generation and other applications.At the moment  there is undoubted geopolitical interest on the part of the European Union to accelerate the adoption of hydrogen generation networks.Recently  the European Commission announced the launch of the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance  in the absence of an ecosystem to address the energy needs required in the next 15 years.Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1972437/Sisco_Sapena.jpgCisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sisco-sapena-launches-h2plt-the-company-behind-spains-first-green-hydrogen-microgeneration-network-301707692.htmlSOURCE H2PLT",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.47,0.14,0.4,True,English,"['first green hydrogen microgeneration network', 'Sisco Sapena', 'H2PLT', 'company', 'Spain', 'first green hydrogen microgeneration network', 'largest electric refueling stations', 'small photovoltaic power plants', 'El Pedernoso Solar Park', 'European Clean Hydrogen Alliance', 'H2PLT IS SISCO SAPENA', 'small photovoltaic farms', '20 electric refueling stations', 'new renewable energy company', 'international reference specialists', 'certified electronic signature', 'clean, renewable fuel', 'renewable energy sources', 'surplus solar electricity', 'fuel cell industry', 'hydrogen generation networks', 'solar energy', 'electro-power stations', 'gas stations', 'New York', 'new applications', 'solar power', 'fuel cells', 'European leader', 'European Union', 'European Commission', 'energy needs', 'renewable electricity', 'innovative uses', 'underdeveloped applications', 'hydro generators', 'electrified mobility', 'H2aX"" applications', 'modular way', 'different parts', 'wholesale market', 'fourth quarter', 'coming months', 'second half', 'United States', 'later date', 'initial capital', 'current team', 'OTC Markets', 'BME Growth', 'stock market', 'global media', 'Financial Times', 'water molecules', 'other applications', 'geopolitical interest', 'next 15 years', 'original content', 'proprietary model', 'business model', 'Power model', 'Lleida.net', 'GENERATE ELECTRICITY', 'electricity generation', 'SOURCE H2PLT', 'public company', 'total capacity', 'Euronext Growth', '300 million euros', 'next year', 'six people', '210,000 euros', '160,000 PEOPLE', 'Spain', 'Jan.', 'PRNewswire', 'operations', 'CEO', 'founder', 'president', 'vector', 'reelectrification', 'headquarters', 'development', 'end', 'electrolysis', 'conversion', 'night', 'hydrogenerators', '80 hectares', 'Cuenca', 'potential', '2.5 tons', 'day', '40 MW', 'addition', 'construction', 'possibility', 'Story', 'equivalent', 'population', 'problem', 'intermittency', 'dual-listing', 'February', 'project', 'notification', 'contracting', 'Paris', 'Madrid', 'subsidiaries', '19 countries', '200 employees', '3,000 shareholders', '15 patents', 'processes', 'signatory', '220 patents', 'subject', 'profile', 'Bloomberg', 'Reuters', 'wind', 'oxygen', 'transportation', 'moment', 'adoption', 'launch', 'absence', 'ecosystem', 'Sisco_Sapena', 'Cision', 'multimedia', 'news-releases', 'sisco-sapena', 'first-green-hydrogen-microgeneration-network']",2023-01-11,2023-01-12,finance.yahoo.com

This nonrefundable grant is intended to support projects helping drive the sustainable transformation of key sectors in the French economy through technological innovation. Two other funding requests for a total of 1.5 million euros are currently being examined by Bpifrance. A response is expected during the first quarter of 2023.The PRECESTO Phase IIa clinical trial aims primarily to validate the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation treatments and particularly nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) with a view to developing an innovative treatment method by associating NFL-101 with other smoking cessation methods (see press release from November 8  2022).Ignacio Faus  NFL Biosciences’ Chief Executive Officer: “For nicotine addiction research  the cost of clinical trials is relatively low compared with other indications  particularly because patients are monitored on an outpatient basis  yet smoking cessation offers a very strong level of commercial potential on account of the number of smokers and the limitations involved with current treatments. As we maintain a very low fixed cost structure  the vast majority of the funds are allocated to financing clinical trials and therefore serve to increase the potential value of NFL Biosciences’ projects. We would like to warmly thank our partners on this operation  and particularly BPI Occitanie”.PRECESTO: a clinical trial that will be launched at the start of 2023 with a view to explore the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation drugsPRECESTO is a proof-of-concept clinical trial with the primary objective to validate the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation treatments and particularly nicotine replacement therapies (transdermal patches  tablets  chewing gums  inhalers and nicotine sprays) with a view to developing an innovative treatment method by associating NFL-101 with other smoking cessation methods. The PRECESTO trial will compare against a placebo the ability of NFL-101 to reduce smoking satisfaction and cravings among 34 smokers with a cross-over design. Each participant will be his or her own control and will receive  on a random and alternating basis  either NFL-101 or the placebo at the start of each of the two periods during which they will assess smoking satisfaction and desire to smoke using standardized international questionnaires. The trial will be carried out at the Eurofins-Optimed research institute in Grenoble  with the first recruitments scheduled for the start of 2023 and the results expected for the third quarter of 2023.About NFL BiosciencesNFL Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company based in the Montpellier area which develops botanical drug candidates for the treatment of addictions.

Name : EKINOPS ISIN Code : FR0011466069 Mnemonic code : EKI Number of shares: 26 431 086  Attachments   Original Link   Original Document…,"PARIS  January 11  2023 - 6:00 pm - EKINOPS (Euronext Paris - FR0011466069 - EKI)  a leading supplier of telecommunication solutions for telecom operators and enterprises  has published its revenue for the 2022 financial year  ending on December 31  2022.Ekinops ended FY 2022 with consolidated revenue of €127.6m  up 23% from the previous year (+19% at constant exchange rates).Q4 2022 revenue totaled €31.5m versus €28.7 million a year earlier  representing an increase of 10% (+6% at constant exchange rates) despite the particularly strong pressure on the supply chain at year-end. The difficulties in delivering some orders at the end of the year resulted in a shortfall of a few million euros of revenue in Q4 2022 which will be shipped in early 2023 without causing major disruption to customers.At the same time  business activity and order intake remained vigorous in Q4.The Group's brisk growth in 2022 was fueled by strong demand for all its product lines  particularly for Optical Transport solutions (up 29% in 2022) which was boosted by the success of 200 Gb/s and 400 Gb/s WDM systems  notably in North America.Access solutions reported annual growth of 20%  mainly driven by the sharp rebound in business in France.The share of Software & Services continued to grow  representing 15% of Group revenue in 2022. Full-year revenue generated by Software & Services rose by over 38%  driven by sales of software which facilitates network functions' virtualization and by a company focus on providing more services.2022 was characterized by international growth which remained dynamic  up 17% for the full year. International business accounted for 64% in 2022 (vs. 67% for FY 2021).In North America  activity continued to record robust growth with business volumes totaling €29.8m versus €19.1m in 2021  representing a very significant increase of 56% (+39% in USD). Ekinops benefited from strong demand for Optical Transport equipment in the region. North America represented 23% of Group's total sales in 2022 (vs. 18% in 2021).Asia-Pacific posted a strong growth trajectory in 2022  up 38% on a full-year basis. The region accounted for 7% of Ekinops' total business activity in 2022 (vs. 6% in 2021).EMEA (Europe  excluding France  the Middle-East and Africa)  generated FY 2022 revenue of €43.5m  slightly down by 2% versus the prior year  largely owing to a base effect (note that the EMEA region delivered the strongest growth in 2021 at +29%). EMEA represented 34% of Ekinops' total business activity (vs. 43% in 2021).The Group restored sharp growth in France; in its domestic market  Ekinops' 2022 sales amounted to €45.9m  significantly up by 36% (vs. -0.3% in 2021)  representing 36% of Group total revenue (vs. 33% in 2021).

The timing for ThriveDX and Exclusive Networks strategic partnership is perfect because the study also indicated that 99% of the respondents recognize a positive influence on the culture of errors in the company with security awareness training.“Executives and security professionals globally are realizing that technology alone cannot keep their enterprises safe from increasing cyber threats. Rather  they need solutions that directly address the role of the human factor as the weakest link in cybersecurity. ThriveDX is the only company providing a 360° approach to solving the human risk factor  going beyond awareness with effective solutions to address the lack of skills ” said Roy Zur  CEO  ThriveDX Enterprise. “We look forward to working with thousands of our current and new European partners and customers and creating a human firewall across their organizations.”ThriveDX serves customers in more than 60 countries globally and already has millions of users in Europe including Fortune-500 companies and top European banks  tech companies  manufacturers  health care providers  universities  governments and more.

The presence of a reference shareholder in our capital such as Guerbet responds to this challenge. It provides us with the ability to penetrate our target markets much more rapidly and efficiently through an enriched offering and the optimization of our visibility within the global medical imaging ecosystem. We are delighted with this opportunity for Intrasense and welcome the great complementarity of our proposals""  comments Nicolas Reymond  CEO of Intrasense.""Our acquisition of a stake in Intrasense is a concrete expression of our desire to leverage the digital imaging technology and algorithms that we have developed over the past several years. This strategic partnership will enable us to benefit from proven expertise in the integration of artificial intelligence into the clinical routine of practitioners in imaging and oncology""  said David Hale  CEO of Guerbet.Story continuesA joint development project in Artificial IntelligenceIntrasense has recognized expertise in the field of software solutions that facilitate and secure diagnosis  decision making and therapeutic follow-up in medical imaging  in particular thanks to its clinical orchestration capabilities of artificial intelligence  within the daily practice of clinicians.Guerbet  a leading global player in the medical imaging market  has diversified its activities in the digital sector in recent years  notably by developing innovative artificial intelligence algorithms enabling the detection of liver lesions  prostate and pancreatic cancers and bone metastases. In November 2022  Guerbet took over all the algorithms developed in the framework of its partnership with Merative (IBM Watson) as well as their intellectual property  giving it the strategic latitude necessary to plan the marketing of these solutions.Guerbet's acquisition of a stake in Intrasense will enable Intrasense to enhance its product offering and benefit from the support of a major shareholder to carry out the investments required to implement its growth plan. It will enable Guerbet to enhance the value of its technology and artificial intelligence algorithms.As part of this project  Intrasense and Guerbet plan to enter into a licensing agreement in the first half of 2023 that would enable Intrasense to integrate and market Guerbet's artificial intelligence algorithms within its software platforms  thereby complementing the various partnerships already concluded in oncology. A collaboration agreement has been in place since October 2022 to study the technical feasibility of this integration and the two companies have also recently entered into a non-binding agreement on the main terms and conditions of the envisaged licensing agreement. This agreement was negotiated at arm's length. More specifically  it will enable Intrasense to integrate the algorithms developed by Guerbet for the detection of liver lesions  prostate cancer  pancreatic cancer and bone lesions into its Myrian product offering and into its new oncology product line. Intrasense will be responsible for the clinical validation and regulatory registration of the products for which it will be the legal manufacturer.Integration of numerous artificial intelligence technologies from Guerbet and third parties is in line with the ‘clinical routine tools’ strategy already initiated by Intrasense. The delivery of this strategy will strengthen Intrasense's high value-added offering in the global imaging market.As a world leader in medical imaging  Guerbet is recognized for its expertise and has a global marketing and sales presence. Intrasense will benefit from this unique insight into various markets around the world  notably through a stronger presence at major world imaging conferences.Thanks to these numerous assets  Intrasense  an autonomous structure linked to Guerbet  aims to continue to grow in its markets.Main characteristics of the Share Capital IncreaseTerms and conditions of the issuanceIn the context of the Share Capital Increase  20 000 000 new Intrasense shares (the ""New Shares"") were issued at an issuance price of 0.44 euro per share (including 0.05 euro of nominal value per share and an issuance premium of 0.39 euro per share) in favour of Guerbet  i.e. a premium of 34.15% compared to the closing price of the Intrasense share on January 10  2023 (being the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Share Capital Increase) and of 35.21% compared to the volume-weighted average price during the fifteen (15) trading days prior to the pricing of the Share Capital Increase.

Consequently  no squeeze-out will be implemented at the end of the Offer  even if the legal and regulatory conditions are met.The Offer will be financed by Guerbet through the use of its existing credit facilities and will not be subject to any regulatory approval or other conditions.The Offer and the offeror's draft tender offer document will remain subject to review by the AMF  which will assess their compliance with the applicable legal and regulatory provisions.Appointment of an independent expert in connection with the proposed OfferAn investment agreement was signed today between the Company and Guerbet for the purposes of the completion of the Share Capital Increase and the launch of the Offer (the ""Investment Agreement""). The Investment Agreement  the content of which will be detailed in Guerbet's draft tender offer document in the context of the proposed Offer  is intended to govern the terms and conditions of Guerbet's investment in the share capital of the Company as well as the governance of the Company following the Offer.In accordance with article 261-1-III of the general regulations of the AMF  the Board of Directors of Intrasense set up an ad hoc committee on December 23  2022  composed of the following members:Ms. Michèle Lesieur  independent director  Chair of the ad hoc committee;Ms. Anne Larpin  independent director;Mr. Patrice Rullier  independent director.It is specified that the purpose of the ad hoc committee is (i) to propose to the Board of Directors the appointment of the independent expert  (ii) to ensure the follow-up of the work of the independent expert  and (iii) to prepare a draft reasoned opinion concerning the proposed Offer.The Board of Directors met today and unanimously appointed  in accordance with the recommendation of the ad hoc committee  Paper Audit & Conseil  represented by Mr Xavier Paper  as independent expert. The latter will be in charge of drafting a report on the financial conditions of the proposed Offer  pursuant to article 261-1-I  1°  2°  4° and 5° of the AMF's general regulations.In accordance with the applicable stock exchange regulations  the independent expert will submit his final report at the end of a minimum period of twenty trading days from his appointment. In light of the conclusions of the independent expert's report  the Board of Directors of the Company will meet in order to decide on the interest of the Offer and on the consequences of the latter for the Company  its shareholders and its employees.The report of the independent expert and the reasoned opinion of the Board of Directors of Intrasense will be included in the draft response document prepared by the Company  which will be filed with the Autorité des marchés financiers (""AMF"") in order to obtain a declaration of compliance  in accordance with applicable regulations.Guerbet and the Company will inform Intrasense’s shareholders of key developments relating to the Offer as soon as possible.Update on fiscal year 2022 activity and outlook for IntrasenseOn this occasion  Intrasense announces its first unaudited business results for the year 2022. The Group continues to grow outside of the war zone (around +11%). However  the Company is impacted by the geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe and the health situation in China. Therefore  the Company anticipates a consolidated turnover of circa €3.8M by December 31  2022  with an overall decrease of approximately 9% in revenues compared to the previous year.Intrasense is also diversifying its activities in new geographies such as Brazil. Despite the health situation  China performed well with a +25% growth in activity. These results therefore validate the choices made over the last few months  as well as the resilience and responsiveness of the Company.Restated operating profit before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) would be between €-2.3 million and €-2.9 million for the year 2022  including €-0.6 million IFRS 2 impacts. This operating result is the result of the investment policy decided in mid-2021 in the context of the development of the new product line related to oncology and remains monitored and controlled.Intrasense's gross cash position is expected to be circa €+1.4 million on December 31  2022  after taking into account the State Guaranteed Loan (SGL) of €547 000 obtained by Intrasense on December 23  2022. Thus  Intrasense's cash position net of financial debt on December 31  2022 should be circa €+1.0 million.By 2026  Intrasense aims  through its strategy of integrating artificial intelligence technology from third parties  including Guerbet  at doubling its revenues compared to fiscal year 2022  and at reaching operational balance (in terms of EBITDA).DisclaimerThe Share Capital Increase did not give rise to the approval of a prospectus by the AMF.At the request of the Company  the listing of Intrasense shares will resume on January 12  2023 at markets opening.About IntrasenseFounded in 2004  Intrasense develops and markets a unique medical device  Myrian®  a software platform that facilitates and secures diagnosis  decision making and therapeutic follow-up.Thanks to Myrian®  more than 1 000 healthcare institutions in 40 countries benefit from a single  integrated platform for reading all types of images (MRI  CT  etc.).

The group's performance was particularly strong in France  as reflected by a solid B2C subscriber growth of over 8% as of December 31  2022 compared to December 31  2021 (with the global B2C subscriber count remaining flat year-over-year).Further to delivering double-digit revenue growth  Deezer was able to significantly improve its estimated adjusted EBITDA loss  expected to be in the range of €57-60 million in 2022 (compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of €65 million in 2021). The group has strongly improved its operating performance  which allowed it to make substantial incremental spending  of approximately €7 million  in product development and innovation  notably for the development of the Zen application launched in December 2022.Deezer will release its full-year 2022 results on February 28  2023.OutlookWith respect to 2023  in order to mitigate execution risks in the current market conditions and secure its path to profitability by 2025  Deezer has decided to prioritize its profitability  while still delivering double- digit revenue growth compared to 2022.In 2023  the group will continue to execute on its four strategic priorities  seeking to further optimize its B2C business with a clear focus on improving unit economics  and continuing to expand its B2B business in its targeted geographies.Consequently  Deezer expects for 2023:Double-digit revenue growth  in excess of 10% compared to 2022 3   mainly driven by the further expansion of the B2B segment;revenue growth  in excess of 10% compared to 2022   mainly driven by the further expansion of the B2B segment; A further significant reduction in adjusted EBITDA loss compared to 2022.Given its focus on profitable growth  Deezer confirms it remains on a path to generate a positive cash flow4 in 2024 and to achieve a positive adjusted EBITDA in 2025  while delivering double-digit annual revenue growth over the period5.Unaudited. This compares to a guidance of revenue of approximately €455 million for 2022  representing a growth of approximately 14% compared to 2021. This compares to the previous objective of revenue of approximately €560 million for 2023  representing a growth of approximately 24% compared to 2022. Cash flow pre-funding. In this context  and in a new challenging macroeconomic environment  the previous ambition to generate revenue of €1 billion and a cash flow pre-funding superior to €50 million in 2025 might be delayed.1,neutral,0.06,0.93,0.0,mixed,0.24,0.12,0.64,True,English,"['strong focus', '2022 results', '2023 outlook', 'profitability', 'new challenging macroeconomic environment', 'global B2C subscriber count', 'solid B2C subscriber growth', 'double- digit revenue growth', 'double-digit annual revenue growth', 'substantial incremental spending', 'current market conditions', 'four strategic priorities', 'positive cash flow4', 'positive adjusted EBITDA', 'double-digit revenue growth', 'B2C business', 'profitable growth', 'EBITDA loss', 'full-year 2022 results1', 'full-year 2023 budget', 'strong acceleration', 'Zen application', 'execution risks', 'unit economics', 'B2B business', 'B2B segment', 'significant reduction', 'previous objective', 'previous ambition', 'strong focus', 'clear focus', 'Euronext Paris', 'operating performance', 'product development', '2023 outlook', 'profitability', 'Board', 'Directors', 'Deezer', 'DEEZR', 'group', 'regard', 'figures', 'France', 'December', 'range', 'innovation', 'February', 'respect', 'order', 'path', 'targeted', 'geographies', 'excess', 'expansion', 'period', 'guidance', 'funding', 'context']",2023-01-11,2023-01-12,marketscreener.com

This nonrefundable grant is intended to support projects helping drive the sustainable transformation of key sectors in the French economy through technological innovation. Two other funding requests for a total of 1.5 million euros are currently being examined by Bpifrance. A response is expected during the first quarter of 2023.The PRECESTO Phase IIa clinical trial aims primarily to validate the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation treatments and particularly nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) with a view to developing an innovative treatment method by associating NFL-101 with other smoking cessation methods (see press release from November 8  2022).Ignacio Faus  NFL Biosciences’ Chief Executive Officer: “For nicotine addiction research  the cost of clinical trials is relatively low compared with other indications  particularly because patients are monitored on an outpatient basis  yet smoking cessation offers a very strong level of commercial potential on account of the number of smokers and the limitations involved with current treatments. As we maintain a very low fixed cost structure  the vast majority of the funds are allocated to financing clinical trials and therefore serve to increase the potential value of NFL Biosciences’ projects. We would like to warmly thank our partners on this operation  and particularly BPI Occitanie”.PRECESTO: a clinical trial that will be launched at the start of 2023 with a view to explore the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation drugsPRECESTO is a proof-of-concept clinical trial with the primary objective to validate the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation treatments and particularly nicotine replacement therapies (transdermal patches  tablets  chewing gums  inhalers and nicotine sprays) with a view to developing an innovative treatment method by associating NFL-101 with other smoking cessation methods. The PRECESTO trial will compare against a placebo the ability of NFL-101 to reduce smoking satisfaction and cravings among 34 smokers with a cross-over design. Each participant will be his or her own control and will receive  on a random and alternating basis  either NFL-101 or the placebo at the start of each of the two periods during which they will assess smoking satisfaction and desire to smoke using standardized international questionnaires. The trial will be carried out at the Eurofins-Optimed research institute in Grenoble  with the first recruitments scheduled for the start of 2023 and the results expected for the third quarter of 2023.About NFL BiosciencesNFL Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company based in the Montpellier area which develops botanical drug candidates for the treatment of addictions.

Had the Company not been willing to agree to submit the issuance of the Kreos Subscription Rights to the EGM  Kreos Capital VII (UK) Limited would probably not have been willing to (or only at terms less favourable to the Company  if at all) provide the Loan Facility to the Company.The net proceeds paid to the Company by Kreos Capital VII (UK) Limited upon the drawdown by the Company of the Loan Facility (of which the issuance of the Kreos Subscription Rights formed a part) form an important source of funding that allow the Company to finance its development and activities (which is in the interest of the Company and its stakeholders).Furthermore  while it cannot be guaranteed that the Kreos Subscription Rights will ultimately be exercised  the exercise of the proposed Kreos Subscription Rights by Kreos  and the payment of the relevant exercise price of the Kreos Subscription Rights by Kreos  if any  will enable the Company to obtain additional cash resources  which can be further used to fund the Company's business activities  and to strengthen its balance sheet. The board of directors notes that any dilution resulting from the exercise of the Kreos Subscription Rights is outweighed by the risks and disadvantages if the Company were not able to raise new funds (through the Loan Facility) to support its working capital and its going concern.The mechanisms pursuant to which the exercise prices of the Kreos Subscription Rights have been determined in the Conditions are the result of negotiations that occurred between the Company and Kreos Capital VII (UK) Limited in an at arm's length manner.The board of directors considers the proposed exercise prices of the Kreos Subscription Rights (i.e.  EUR 5.31 per new share for the Initial Kreos Subscription Rights and EUR 5.77 per new share for the Subsequent Kreos Subscription Rights) to be justified since (amongst other things)  as described above  the exercise prices have been determined in function of the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average price of the Company's shares traded on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels in a 30 day reference period prior to the closing of the Kreos Loan Agreement (for the Initial Kreos Subscription Rights) and the drawdown of",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.01,0.99,True,English,"['Sequana Medical N', 'Statutory Auditor', 'Report', 'Kreos Capital VII Aggregator SCSp', '1 Boulevard de la Foire', 'Initial Kreos Subscription Rights', 'Subsequent Kreos Subscription Rights', 'statutory preferential subscription right', 'extraordinary general meeting', 'Sequana Medical NV', 'additional cash resources', '30 day reference period', 'Kreos Loan Agreement', 'special limited partnership', 'relevant exercise price', 'Luxembourg Companies Register', 'working capital', 'membership rights', 'statutory auditor', 'Belgian Companies', 'issue/exercise price', 'average price', 'Loan Facility', 'financial information', 'Associations Code', 'financial data', 'fair view', 'material respects', 'Grand Duchy', 'legal successors', 'net proceeds', 'important source', 'balance sheet', 'new funds', 'going concern', 'length manner', 'new share', 'other things', 'arithmetic average', 'daily volume', 'regulated market', 'Euronext Brussels', 'exercise prices', 'permitted successors', 'business activities', 'UK) Limited', 'Review report', 'accounting', 'board', 'directors', 'articles', 'Conclusion', 'attention', 'justification', 'cancellation', 'effects', 'property', 'shareholders', 'true', 'operation', 'fact', 'favor', 'laws', 'office', 'number', 'assigns', 'decision', 'issuance', 'benefit', 'elements', 'Company', 'consideration', 'willingness', 'affiliate', '19 July', 'EGM', 'terms', 'drawdown', 'funding', 'development', 'interest', 'stakeholders', 'payment', 'dilution', 'risks', 'disadvantages', 'mechanisms', 'Conditions', 'result', 'negotiations', 'arm', 'function', 'shares', 'closing']",2023-01-11,2023-01-12,marketscreener.com

Founded and promoted by the entrepreneur Sisc…,"BARCELONA  Spain  Jan. 11  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- H2PLT  a new renewable energy company based on green hydrogen and solar energy  just began operations to create Spain's first green hydrogen microgeneration network.Founded and promoted by the entrepreneur Sisco Sapena  president and founder of the public company Lleida.net  H2PLT has developed a proprietary model that allows innovative uses of hydrogen in underdeveloped applications  such as its use as a vector for reelectrification and application in electro-power stations or hydro generators.Sisco Sapena  CEO and founder of H2PLTIts headquarters are in the city of Lleida.The company seeks to promote electrified mobility and its innovative uses through ""H2aX"" applications and the development of small photovoltaic power plants dedicated exclusively to the generation of green hydrogen  through a model that can be replicated in a modular way in different parts of Spain and Europe.To this end  it uses small photovoltaic farms and surplus solar electricity to manufacture green hydrogen by electrolysis. The hydrogen is stored and converted into electricity when needed by a fuel cell.Its business model is based on the sale of hydrogen created by solar energy  its conversion into electricity during the night and sale to the wholesale market or through the network of own gas stations and hydrogenerators that will be created.H2PLT WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY FOR 160 000 PEOPLE PER YEAR.H2PLT already has 80 hectares in the El Pedernoso Solar Park (Cuenca  Spain) and from next year will have the potential to generate 2.5 tons of hydrogen per day and a capacity of up to 40 MW.The company plans to start selling to the wholesale market from the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition  it has already begun planning the construction of one of Spain's largest electric refueling stations in El Pedernoso  Cuenca  with more than 20 electric refueling stations  to which will be added the possibility of refueling hydrogen  which will be operational in the coming months.At total capacity  according to a Power-to-Power model  which allows converting green hydrogen into electricity through fuel cells  the plant can supply renewable electricity to the equivalent of a population of 160 000 people per year.The Power-to-Power model solves the problem of the intermittency of renewable energy and allows renewable energy produced during the day to be harnessed and used at night.The company plans to go public on Euronext in the second half of 2023  and is considering dual-listing in the United States at a later date.Founded in February 2022 with an initial capital of 210 000 euros  its current team amounts to six people  including international reference specialists in the fuel cell industry.THE FOUNDER OF H2PLT IS SISCO SAPENAThe founder and CEO of the project is Sisco Sapena  known for having founded in 1995 the listed Lleida.net  European leader in the industry of certified electronic signature  notification and contracting.Lleida.net is listed on Euronext Growth in Paris  OTC Markets in New York and BME Growth in Madrid.

The difficulties in delivering some orders at the end of the year resulted in a shortfall of a few million euros of revenue in Q4 2022 which will be shipped in early 2023 without causing major disruption to customers.At the same time  business activity and order intake remained vigorous in Q4.Robust momentum for all business lines with over 38% increase in software and servicesThe Group's brisk growth in 2022 was fueled by strong demand for all its product lines  particularly for Optical Transport solutions (up 29% in 2022) which was boosted by the success of 200 Gb/s and 400 Gb/s WDM systems  notably in North America.Access solutions reported annual growth of 20%  mainly driven by the sharp rebound in business in France.The share of Software & Services continued to grow  representing 15% of Group revenue in 2022.

The region accounted for 7% of Ekinops' total business activity in 2022 (vs. 6% in 2021).EMEA (Europe  excluding France  the Middle-East and Africa)  generated FY 2022 revenue of €43.5m  slightly down by 2% versus the prior year  largely owing to a base effect (note that the EMEA region delivered the strongest growth in 2021 at +29%). EMEA represented 34% of Ekinops' total business activity (vs. 43% in 2021).The Group restored sharp growth in France; in its domestic market  Ekinops' 2022 sales amounted to €45.9m  significantly up by 36% (vs. -0.3% in 2021)  representing 36% of Group total revenue (vs. 33% in 2021).

The difficulties in delivering some orders at the end of the year resulted in a shortfall of a few million euros of revenue in Q4 2022 which will be shipped in early 2023 without causing major disruption to customers.At the same time  business activity and order intake remained vigorous in Q4.Robust momentum for all business lines with over 38% increase in software and servicesThe Group's brisk growth in 2022 was fueled by strong demand for all its product lines  particularly for Optical Transport solutions (up 29% in 2022) which was boosted by the success of 200 Gb/s and 400 Gb/s WDM systems  notably in North America.Access solutions reported annual growth of 20%  mainly driven by the sharp rebound in business in France.The share of Software & Services continued to grow  representing 15% of Group revenue in 2022.

The region accounted for 7% of Ekinops' total business activity in 2022 (vs. 6% in 2021).EMEA (Europe  excluding France  the Middle-East and Africa)  generated FY 2022 revenue of €43.5m  slightly down by 2% versus the prior year  largely owing to a base effect (note that the EMEA region delivered the strongest growth in 2021 at +29%). EMEA represented 34% of Ekinops' total business activity (vs. 43% in 2021).The Group restored sharp growth in France; in its domestic market  Ekinops' 2022 sales amounted to €45.9m  significantly up by 36% (vs. -0.3% in 2021)  representing 36% of Group total revenue (vs. 33% in 2021).

Signify now expects a comparable sales decline of 8.8% for the quarter  resulting in a comparable sales growth of 1.2% for the full year 2022  compared to the previous range of 2-3% for the year.While the gross margin stabilized  fixed costs did not keep pace with lower sales volumes. Signify therefore expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 10% for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2022. This compares with the previous full-year guidance of the lower end of the 11.0-11.4% range.During the final quarter  Signify significantly reduced its inventory  leading to a better than expected working capital performance. The company now expects to report a full year 2022 free cash flow of approximately EUR 445 million or 5.9% of sales  compared to the previous guidance of the lower end of the 5-7% range.Signify will publish its fourth quarter and full-year results 2022 on January 27  2023.--- END ---For further information  please contact:Signify Investor RelationsThelke GerdesTel: +31 6 1801 7131E-mail: thelke.gerdes@signify.comSignify Corporate CommunicationsLeanne CarmodyTel: +31 6 3928 0201E-mail: leanne.carmody@signify.comAbigail LeveneTel: +31 6 2939 3895E-mail: abigail.levene@signify.comFinancial calendar 2023January 27  2023 Fourth quarter and full-year results 2022February 28  2023 Annual Report 2022May 3  2023 Q1 results 2023July 28  2023 Q2 and half-year results 2023October 27  2023 Q3 results 2023Story continuesAbout SignifySignify (Euronext: LIGHT) is the world leader in lighting for professionals and consumers and lighting for the Internet of Things.

It acts as a powerful reminder to stop  reflect and celebrate our accomplishments over the past year as the first step towards a bolder tomorrow.Images and video of stunt to be available at https://lion.app.box.com/s/gcovvuhoizxuuu03bmeq2l8lyi8ohom8By freezing in their tracks  the stunt highlighted what's missing in modern society – the courage to stop endlessly chasing the next big win. It comes as new research reveals that Gen Z and Millennials (1) in Southeast Asia are putting so much pressure on themselves to achieve  they aren't celebrating the wins of today.Unprecedented pressures on young adults exacerbated by social media""A Bolder Tomorrow""  the new research report from Tiger Beer  conducted by independent research agency YouGov  reveals that 90% of Gen Z and Millennial Southeast Asians admit to putting pressure on themselves  with a shocking 58% feeling pressured to live up to an ""impossible standard"". The research reveals that the top pressures they are putting on themselves are:- To be more confident (49%)- To be more active / fitter (44%)- To be more sociable (37%)Surprisingly  the research revealed 57% of young adult Southeast Asians admit that they are even putting more pressure on themselves than their parents did. Social media is playing a role in the pressure to achieve  with nearly two thirds (64%) of respondents feeling their achievements aren't significant when they compare them to those they see on social media.Pressure to achieve stops celebration of the small winsSadly  the unrealistic pressures that Gen Z and Millennials are putting on themselves are stopping them from celebrating the small wins  with just one in 10 of those surveyed saying that they always celebrate the small wins. Of those who don't always celebrate small wins  30% say it's because they feel that whatever they do  it's never good enough. In fact  the majority (59%) of young Southeast Asians say they don't feel that they've accomplished anything significant this year.Story continuesYoung adult Southeast Asians are also shy of sharing their wins  making them more likely to feel comfortable sharing a photo of their dinner on social media (33%) than their achievements (22%).Commenting on the stunt  Sean O'Donnell  Global Brand Director  Tiger Beer said: ""Tiger Beer believes that we are all born with a Tiger inside us - a version of ourselves that knows no limits to what is possible. But sometimes it can feel like the more we achieve  the further we're expected to go. Our research uncovered that young adults in Asia are putting an unprecedented amount of pressure on themselves and aren't stopping to celebrate life's small wins. So  Tiger Beer is reminding everyone to stop and celebrate the successes that got them where they are today by unveiling a stunt which sees hundreds of people freeze in their tracks in one of Southeast Asia's busiest downtown areas. Stopping to celebrate your achievements is the first step towards achieving even bolder ambitions in 2023.""Time to stop  reflect and celebrate wins makes people feel betterDespite the reluctance  58% agree it's important to celebrate life's small wins and say they feel better when they take a moment to give recognition to their achievements (68%). And it seems there are lots of reasons to celebrate  including:- A promotion or pay rise (52%)- Buying a house (49%)- Winning an award for work (40%)- Achieving fitness goals (34%).As we approach Lunar New Year  young adult Southeast Asians are feeling reflective (35%) and ready for a new challenge (37%). As they plan for 2023  two-fifths (41%) plan to care less about what other people think and over a third (35%) plan to acknowledge their achievements more - an important first step towards achieving their goals in 2023.Notes to editorA full range of media assets to be available at https://lion.app.box.com/s/gcovvuhoizxuuu03bmeq2l8lyi8ohom8 - including the full research report and images (from 3pm) and video of the stunt (7pm)Follow @tigerbeer on Instagram and Facebook for more updates on the campaign.Research methodologyThe findings from this release are the result of a survey conducted by YouGov in December 2022.The sample consisted of a nationally representative sample of 3 000+ Gen Z and Millennial Singaporeans  Malaysians and Vietnamese (aged 18 - 42).

It acts as a powerful reminder to stop  reflect and celebrate our accomplishments over the past year as the first step towards a bolder tomorrow.By freezing in their tracks  the stunt highlighted what's missing in modern society – the courage to stop endlessly chasing the next big win. It comes as new research reveals that Gen Z and Millennials[1] in Southeast Asia are putting so much pressure on themselves to achieve  they aren't celebrating the wins of today.Images and video of stunt to be available here at 3pm and 7pm respectivelyUnprecedented pressures on young adults exacerbated by social media""A Bolder Tomorrow""  the new research report from Tiger Beer  conducted by independent research agency YouGov  reveals that 90% of Gen Z and Millennial Southeast Asians admit to putting pressure on themselves  with a shocking 58% feeling pressured to live up to an ""impossible standard"". The research reveals that the top pressures they are putting on themselves are:To be more confident (49%)To be more active / fitter (44%)To be more sociable (37%)Surprisingly  the research revealed 57% of young adult Southeast Asians admit that they are even putting more pressure on themselves than their parents did. Social media is playing a role in the pressure to achieve  with nearly two thirds (64%) of respondents feeling their achievements aren't significant when they compare them to those they see on social media.Pressure to achieve stops celebration of the small winsSadly  the unrealistic pressures that Gen Z and Millennials are putting on themselves are stopping them from celebrating the small wins  with just one in 10 of those surveyed saying that they always celebrate the small wins. Of those who don't always celebrate small wins  30% say it's because they feel that whatever they do  it's never good enough. In fact  the majority (59%) of young adult Southeast Asians say they don't feel that they've accomplished anything significant this year.Story continuesYoung adult Southeast Asians are also shy of sharing their wins  making them more likely to feel comfortable sharing a photo of their dinner on social media (33%) than their achievements (22%).Commenting on the stunt  Sean O'Donnell  Global Brand Director  Tiger Beer said: ""Tiger Beer believes that we are all born with a Tiger inside us – a version of ourselves that knows no limits to what is possible. But sometimes it can feel like the more we achieve  the further we're expected to go. Our research uncovered that young adults in Asia are putting an unprecedented amount of pressure on themselves and aren't stopping to celebrate life's small wins. So  Tiger Beer is reminding everyone to stop and celebrate the successes that got them where they are today by unveiling a stunt which sees hundreds of people freeze in their tracks in one of Southeast Asia's busiest downtown areas. Stopping to celebrate your achievements is the first step towards achieving even bolder ambitions in 2023.""Time to stop  reflect and celebrate wins makes people feel betterDespite the reluctance  58% agree it's important to celebrate life's small wins and say they feel better when they take a moment to give recognition to their achievements (68%). And it seems there are lots of reasons to celebrate  including:A promotion or pay rise (52%)Buying a house (49%)Winning an award for work (40%)Achieving fitness goals (34%).As we approach Lunar New Year  young adult Southeast Asians are feeling reflective (35%) and ready for a new challenge (37%). As they plan for 2023  two-fifths (41%) plan to care less about what other people think and over a third (35%) plan to acknowledge their achievements more - an important first step towards achieving their goals in 2023.Notes to editorA full range of media assets to be available here - including the full research report and images (from 3pm) and video of the stunt (7pm)Follow @tigerbeer on Instagram and Facebook for more updates on the campaign.Research methodologyThe findings from this release are the result of a survey conducted by YouGov in December 2022.The sample consisted of a nationally representative sample of 3 000+ Gen Z and Millennial Singaporeans  Malaysians and Vietnamese (aged 18 - 42).

Titled  “The Road Map Towards a Transformational Well-Being Culture”  the research report is part of Accor’s ongoing and insightful Health to Wealth series  designed to explore the world’s state of well-being and the defining issues of our time. Health to Wealth has already released an illuminating 12-episode podcast featuring leading thinkers as well as an entrepreneurial wellness start-up challenge in Paris in collaboration with VivaTech.Accor is seeking to drive transformational change  supporting a shift toward the emergence of a well-being economy  with an earnest desire to help people  businesses  and communities achieve their priorities for alignment and prosperity ” said. The Health to Wealth white paper demonstrates that well-being must be recognized as an imperative for all if we are to maintain the equilibrium of our lives  our society  and our planet. Emlyn Brown  Global Vice President  Well-Being  AccorThe white paper highlights eight key pathways for businesses  governments and organizations to consider as they plot their own roadmaps toward a culture of well-being  enabling them to thrive in the future economy. These findings draw on the rich body of insights shared by the speakers in the Health to Wealth podcast series. Key pathways to progress include:Well-being is body and mind – The link between mental and physical well-being has been widely documented and these learnings are yielding innovative neuroscientific technology with psychological and physiological benefits. Measurement can optimize well-being – Governments  health organizations  and corporations are called upon to collect more comprehensive and meaningful health data – and act on it to improve the numbers. Our well-being starts with our finances – With a longer-term goal to achieve a more equal distribution of wealth  it is essential to help people manage money and financial stress  while offering affordable well-being solutions. Access to well-being needs to be fully democratic – Well-being must be inclusive  available  accessible  and achievable for everyone  regardless of wealth  gender  race  nationality  sexuality  or ability. Joined-up thinking is required – As organizations  corporations  and nations connect their ideas and actions to a wider eco-system  the improving health of their populations leads to richer  more robust economies. Technology must become a positive force – Empowering individuals to have control over their data  privacy  and safety  while improving the quality of data that is shared  collected  and used  is a positive force for change. Our own well-being is entwined with our planet – How we use the world’s precious resources is critical to a sense of well-being in the world  ensuring our air  food and water supplies are safe  nourishing  and sustainable. Well-being transcends cultural differences – The desire to be well is a universal aspiration and essential to being human; if recognized as a cornerstone of public policy  it can be the engine that transforms the world.Like the Health to Wealth podcast series  the white paper was curated by Well Intelligence  in partnership with Accor. Well Intelligence is a UK-based international business advisory group that champions the relevance and cultural lifeblood brought on by investments in well-being  guiding corporations in their quest to establish impactful well-being programs  fitter workforces  and healthier communities.To read and download “The Road Map Towards a Transformational Well-Being Culture” in full  please click here.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

The resort is nestled deep in the South African wilderness  between Gqeberha and Grahamstown  within a 20 000 hectares conservation area. On this land  6 500 species of plants flourish – 2 000 of which cannot be found anywhere else in the world. The place is also home to 421 species of birds and 48 species of large mammals including rhinos  giraffes  warthogs  zebras and antelopes.Learn How the Mantis Founders Lodge Is Making a Difference Through Its Legacy Conservation ProjectsHave a look back at our 2nd episode to hear how our teams near Marseille contribute to local biodiversity here.Conservation has long been the cornerstone of the Mantis CollectionTo help all the Mantis Collection properties carry out their conservation work  an Impact Division has been created  that is dedicated to the sustainable conservation of wildlife and wilderness areas through community partnerships.To help achieve this  an official Mantis foundation was registered as a non-profit company called Community Conservation Fund Africa (CCFA). Founded in 2018  from the collaboration between Mantis and Accor  the CCFA was created in order to find sustainable solutions to the global conservation crisis through community-based projects.Mantis Founders Lodge Has Set Three Main Biodiversity Priorities: Rhinos  Bees and Indigenous TreesRhino Conservation : The Mantis Founders Lodge is home to a breeding herd of the Southern White Rhino  a keynote species upon which other life in the ecosystem depends. Maintaining rhinos’ safety and welfare is important and resource intensive; it involves high-tech security surveillance cameras  collaborating with anti-poaching rangers and providing additional feed to keep them healthy. Rhinos also receive regular check-ups to ensure future breeding. In an effort to educate and spread awareness  guests are also invited to take part in rhino monitoring activities. The teams pride themselves in the project’s record: as the lodge’s rhino population is thriving  feeding well and breeding  soon 2 sub-adult male rhinos will be rehomed.: The Mantis Founders Lodge is home to a breeding herd of the Southern White Rhino  a keynote species upon which other life in the ecosystem depends.

Indigenous Tree Planting Program: Guests are encouraged to join the Lodge’s efforts to reduce carbon footprint and bolster biodiversity by planting native trees under the guidance of a dedicated hotel team. Guest-sponsored trees can be personalized with name tags  which gives lodgers a reason to return to check in on ‘their’ tree.Since the program launch in 2022  24 trees from 6 different species have been planted so far.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYAfter a very strong performance in November (+6.3%)  December was slightly down with -1%  including the January dividend payment for which the record date was set in December.Although CLO debt performed relatively well  Volta suffered from the underperformance of the USD against the Euro as well as slightly negative performances in December on Volta non-CLO exposures.Volta’s underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** were as follow: -0.3% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +0.5% for CLO Equity tranches  +1.3% for CLO Debt tranches; and -3.6% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (which represent circa 2.3% of the fund’s NAV).December usually is a relatively quiet month in terms of CLO Equity distributions. Over the month  Volta received the equivalent of €0.3m of interests and coupons. Over the usual 6-month-basis time frame Volta received €22.5m of interests and coupons  ie. a 21.1% annualized cash flow to NAV.We purchased two European CLO Equity positions from the secondary market in December for a total nominal amount of €2.5m  at an average purchase price of 59.75%. The projected yield of said purchases is - under reasonable assumptions regarding future underlying losses - in the 22% context.Fundamentals-wise  December saw significantly more downgrades than upgrades especially in the US Loan market. Even though we are still waiting for December trustee reports  expectations are that CCC/Caa1 loan buckets increased on average by 1.5 to 2% in the US through the course of the month.Story continuesIn terms of default rates  we now have the full list of defaults for 2022. Default rates were still very low  at 0.4% for European Loans and 0.7% for US loans. After the invasion of Ukraine  rating agencies were forecasting 2022 default rates to reach between 2% and 2.5% for the US and European loan markets… We closed the year far from those levels.As we regularly highlight in this report  the main reason for such low default rates is the benefit of inflation  despite the economic slowdown. When companies’ revenues are growing fast  even if said companies suffer from margins pressure  profits and EBITDA still manage to grow (at a lower pace than revenues but they still do grow on average).When considering rating agencies and most banks’ research  default rates are expected to reach 3.5% to 5.5% for 2023. Our default rates view for 2023 still lands in the 3% area for both US and European Loans as we still believe that debt erosion (thanks to inflation) and significant increase in revenues will help avoiding some defaults ; despite the fact that margins are already under pressure and that they should remain under pressure for a few more quarters. Since the vast majority of loans are covenant lite  the deterioration of interest coverage ratios - while being a source of stress - do not mechanically lead to a default. It is the level of EBITDA and where rates will be when companies need to refinance their debt that will really matter. We do not see many companies that have to refinance in 2023.Such kind of default pattern should not materially impact the distribution of interests of Volta’s assets in the near term. We believe that we can maintain a high level of coupons in the coming quarters and are actively looking to seize investment opportunities with the extra cash that is being generated.As at the end of December 2022  Volta’s NAV was €213.5m or €5.84 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 6.6% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 1.3% as at 30 November 2022  4.7% was at 30 October 2022  0.6% was at 30 September 2022.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

Its products are used by all the major chip-manufacturing companies worldwide. Photograph: Yuichi YamazakiYou’ve probably never heard of this technology company. But without it  the worldwide technology industry would revert by at least a couple of decades. No other company anywhere can do what it does.We can perhaps imagine a world without Google or Amazon or Apple or Microsoft – after all  there are alternatives to each. But we would not have a tech industry at all today without ASML (Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography).The intricate patterns of transistors on the surface of semiconductor are laid out using a process called photo-lithography. First  a glass stencil mask is made from a pattern. Then  in an upside down microscope  light is shone through the mask and a series of lenses.The resulting tiny image is focused onto the surface of a silicon wafer coated with a light-sensitive polymer. Regions in the mask shadow remain protected  but those exposed to the light can be washed away. The process is repeated  with multiple masks  each exquisitely aligned. The transistor patterns are thus traced onto the silicon  albeit at miniscule dimensions.READ MOREA human hair is typically about 0.06mm in diameter. The four-nanometre patterns used in the Apple A16 processor  at the heart of the “Pro” models of its iPhones  are hence about 15 000 times thinner. A single A16 chip in an iPhone contains about 16 billion transistors. If each transistor was enlarged to a single grain of sand  then 16 billion of them would occupy 2 000 litres – the size of a large domestic fuel tank.Tiny dimensionsASML is the sole supplier of lithographic equipment capable of tracing patterns at such extraordinarily tiny dimensions. Its products are used by all the major chip-manufacturing companies worldwide  including TSMC (Taiwan)  Samsung (South Korea) and Intel (USA). Each of ASML’s high-end products has about 100 000 parts and requires 40 shipping containers to transport.ASML is headquartered in Veldhoven  a 90-minute drive south of Amsterdam. It had €18.5 billion in revenue in 2021  and is expected to report about €21 billion for 2022. Its market valuation is about €227 billion today  placing it in the top 30 most valuable companies worldwide.How did this European company come to dominate global technology?The original work was led by Herman van Heek  a researcher at Philips Laboratories in Eindhoven in 1971. He created a prototype machine which repeatedly stepped a reverse-magnified photomask above the surface of a silicon wafer  enabling high-precision etching.However it was relatively slow  and competitive 1:1 systems (thus  without reverse-magnification) were preferred by the industry at large. A faster prototype was then developed.Philips wanted to use the technology  but thought it too expensive in low volumes. It decided to try and bring the machine to the market  but wanted a partner experienced in the global chip manufacturing industry. Many intense but fruitless discussions with various potential American partners followed.The solution was a small Dutch company just 10 minutes down the road from Eindhoven. Advanced Semiconductor Materials International (ASMI) was a distributor of various semiconductor tooling products.Extreme ultra-violetIts entrepreneurial chief executive  Arthur del Prado  was seeking partnership opportunities but it took a full year to convince the Philips board of directors. In 1984  ASML started as a joint venture between Philips and ASMI  in a temporary shed.The small company initially struggled against better-known American suppliers. Then  in 1988  a global downturn in the technology sector resulted in ASMI selling its ASML shares back to Philips. Philips was also reducing its costs and laying off staff  but Philips board member Henk Bodt nevertheless persuaded his colleagues to provide one last refinancing to ASML.Within a year  ASML produced its PAS 5500 product  groundbreaking in lithographic resolution and productivity. The company turned profitable and  in 1995  launched an IPO on the Euronext in Amsterdam and Nasdaq in New York. Philips sold half of its holding at the IPO  and the remainder of its holding over the next few years.While the first lithographic machines used visible light for etching  ultra-violet light was later adopted because it enabled finer traces on silicon. The next advance was to have been extreme ultra-violet (EUV). Because EUV is absorbed by both glass and air  any EUV machine would have to operate with a vacuum and avoid using glass lenses.It seemed impossible  and ASML competitors Canon and Nikon gave up trying. In 2018 – and after two decades of research – ASML became the sole and world leader in EUV lithography. Philips may rue its divestment: today ASML is about 15 times more valuable than Philips.What lies ahead? Last week  the New York Times noted that the US remobilisation of its domestic chip industry represents the country’s biggest investment in manufacturing since the second World War. Since the Trump and Biden administrations greatly restricted export of American high technology to China  China is scrambling to build its own indigenous chip industry. ASML is in a highly significant global position and its continuing R&D may well advance its leadership position.,neutral,0.29,0.71,0.0,mixed,0.2,0.09,0.72,True,English,"['unsung Dutch company', 'global tech industry', 'survival', 'large domestic fuel tank', 'top 30 most valuable companies', 'Advanced Semiconductor Materials International', 'various potential American partners', 'Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography', 'various semiconductor tooling products', 'global chip manufacturing industry', 'major chip-manufacturing companies', 'domestic chip industry', 'upside down microscope', 'Herman van Heek', 'Arthur del Prado', 'one last refinancing', 'single A16 chip', 'resulting tiny image', 'first lithographic machines', 'Apple A16 processor', 'New York Times', 'small Dutch company', 'worldwide technology industry', 'glass stencil mask', 'Philips board member', 'American suppliers', 'global technology', 'global downturn', 'single grain', 'small company', 'EUV lithography', 'lithographic equipment', 'tiny dimensions', 'lithographic resolution', 'Yuichi Yamazaki', 'technology company', 'other company', 'light-sensitive polymer', 'mask shadow', 'multiple masks', 'miniscule dimensions', 'human hair', 'Pro” models', 'South Korea', 'high-end products', '40 shipping containers', 'European company', 'original work', 'reverse-magnified photomask', 'competitive 1:1 systems', 'faster prototype', 'low volumes', 'Many intense', 'fruitless discussions', 'Extreme ultra-violet', 'chief executive', 'partnership opportunities', 'joint venture', 'temporary shed', 'technology sector', 'Henk Bodt', 'PAS 5500 product', 'finer traces', 'US remobilisation', 'sole supplier', 'prototype machine', 'intricate patterns', 'four-nanometre patterns', 'silicon wafer', '16 billion transistors', 'market valuation', 'high-precision etching', 'full year', 'visible light', 'ultra-violet light', 'next advance', 'glass lenses', 'two decades', 'world leader', 'Philips Laboratories', 'ASML shares', 'EUV machine', 'ASML competitors', 'transistor patterns', 'Photograph', 'couple', 'Google', 'Amazon', 'Microsoft', 'alternatives', 'surface', 'series', 'Regions', 'READ', '0.06mm', 'diameter', 'heart', 'iPhones', 'sand', '2,000 litres', 'size', 'TSMC', 'Taiwan', 'Samsung', 'Intel', 'USA', '100,000 parts', 'Veldhoven', 'Amsterdam', 'revenue', 'researcher', 'Eindhoven', 'reverse-magnification', 'road', 'ASMI', 'distributor', 'directors', 'known', 'costs', 'staff', 'colleagues', 'productivity', 'IPO', 'Euronext', 'Nasdaq', 'half', 'holding', 'remainder', 'years', 'vacuum', 'Canon', 'Nikon', 'divestment']",2023-01-12,2023-01-12,irishtimes.com

This revolution in maritime history is an ambitious undertaking that pushes the limits…,140 years after the launch of its first luxury trains  the Orient Express legend continues with the unveiling of the world's largest sailing ship  Orient Express Silenseas. This revolution in maritime history is an ambitious undertaking that pushes the limits of what is possible. The result of a unique French partnership between world leader in hospitality Accor and Chantiers de l'Atlantique  a globally leading shipbuilding company  this extraordinary sailing yacht of the future with spectacular interiors will set sail in 2026.With Orient Express Silenseas  we are beginning a new chapter in our history  taking the experience and excellence of luxury travel and transposing it onto the world’s most beautiful seas. This exceptional sailing yacht  with roots in Orient Express’ history  will offer unparalleled service and refined design spaces  reminiscent of the golden age of mythical cruises. Innovation is at the heart of this ultra-modern ship that will revolutionize the maritime world with new technology to meet today’s sustainability challenges. It is a boat designed to make dreams a reality  a showcase for the best of French savoir-faire. Sébastien Bazin  Chairman and CEO  Accor.With a signed letter of intent to order two ships  Chantiers de l'Atlantique is proud to herald a new era in the shipbuilding industry with Silenseas. This concept  born in our design offices in 2018  is the quintessence of our savoir-faire in the fields of naval architecture  the construction of sophisticated hulls  as well as the design of luxurious spaces. In addition  the installation of three SolidSail rigs  a revolutionary 1 500-square-meter unit wind propulsion system  for which we have developed and tested a first prototype  will contribute significantly to the propulsion of the ship. Combined with a hybrid propulsion system running on liquefied natural gas (LNG)  Silenseas will thus become the ship of reference in terms of environmentally-friendly operation and design. Laurent Castaing  Managing Director  Chantiers de l'Atlantique.In 1867  Georges Nagelmackers boarded the transatlantic ships connecting Europe to America and set off on a journey of discovery to the United States. Fascinated by the grandeur of these huge boats  the founder of Orient Express trains explored the luxurious travelers' suites  with their rich and sumptuous decor  adorned with exceptional marquetry. He experienced the social scene in the restaurants and the unique ambiance of the lounges  libraries and entertainment venues. This sea travel experience would later inspire the 1883 launch of his now legendary train: the Orient Express.Inspired by the Golden Age of the French Riviera  Orient Express Silenseas will echo the glorious era when writers  artists  painters  princesses and movie stars spent time between Monte-Carlo  the beaches of Saint-Tropez  Cap d'Antibes  Cannes and its famous Croisette and discovered a refinement tinged with exquisite insouciance and joie de vivre  inviting them to extreme escapades.A 220-meter-long ocean treasure with a tonnage of 22 300 UMS  Orient Express Silenseas will feature 54 Suites measuring on average 70-square-meters  including a monumental 1 415- square-meter Presidential Suite (including a 530-square-meter private terrace)  two swimming pools including a lap pool  two restaurants and a speakeasy bar. The singular cruise ship will celebrate the Art of Travel à la Orient Express: the quintessence of luxury  absolute comfort and dreams.A tribute to artists and culture  Orient Express Silenseas will invite guests to experience incredible shows in its Amphitheatre-Cabaret and a private recording studio will give a voice to the most beautiful melodies. This unique travel experience  guided by the winds  will feature spa treatments  meditation sessions and stopover explorations to discover cultural treasures that allow guests to completely unplug from reality and stop time.Capitalizing on the experience of these experts in ocean racing  Orient Express Silenseas will sail with a revolutionary technological design known as 'SolidSail': three rigid sails with a surface area of 1 500 meters each will be hoisted on a balestron rig  with three tilting masts reaching more than 100 meters high  able to ensure up to 100% of the propulsion in suitable weather conditions. This hybrid propulsion formula will combine wind power with a state-of-the-art engine running on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and plans to use green hydrogen once the technology is approved for ocean passenger ships  launching a new  more environmentally friendly vision of sea travel.The latest feat from the Chantiers de l'Atlantique is a true sailing yacht of the future combining the finest French talents. Renowned architect Maxime d'Angeac will design the interior layout and decor and Nantes-based design company Stirling Design International will handle the exterior architecture. Hetland Maritime also assisted Accor in creating the project and in the ongoing discussions with Chantiers de l'Atlantique. The entire project will be financed up to 70- 80% by commercial banks  with the remainder provided by a consortium of equity partners in which Accor will have a minority stake.ABOUT ORIENT EXPRESS  PART OF ACCORArtisan of travel since 1883  Orient Express sublimates the Art of Travel with its luxury trains  uniqueexperiences  and collections of rare objects.

Signify now expects a comparable sales decline of 8.8% for the quarter  resulting in a comparable sales growth of 1.2% for the full year 2022  compared to the previous range of 2-3% for the year.While the gross margin stabilized  fixed costs did not keep pace with lower sales volumes. Signify therefore expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 10% for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2022. This compares with the previous full-year guidance of the lower end of the 11.0-11.4% range.During the final quarter  Signify significantly reduced its inventory  leading to a better than expected working capital performance. The company now expects to report a full year 2022 free cash flow of approximately EUR 445 million or 5.9% of sales  compared to the previous guidance of the lower end of the 5-7% range.Signify will publish its fourth quarter and full-year results 2022 on January 27  2023.--- END ---For further information  please contact:Signify Investor RelationsThelke GerdesTel: +31 6 1801 7131E-mail: thelke.gerdes@signify.comSignify Corporate CommunicationsLeanne CarmodyTel: +31 6 3928 0201E-mail: leanne.carmody@signify.comAbigail LeveneTel: +31 6 2939 3895E-mail: abigail.levene@signify.comFinancial calendar 2023January 27  2023 Fourth quarter and full-year results 2022February 28  2023 Annual Report 2022May 3  2023 Q1 results 2023July 28  2023 Q2 and half-year results 2023October 27  2023 Q3 results 2023About SignifySignify (Euronext: LIGHT) is the world leader in lighting for professionals and consumers and lighting for the Internet of Things.

According to BKM  the Interbank Card Center in Turkey  e-commerce grew 37 to 40% per annum between 2017 and 2020. This accelerated in 2021 with a stunning 75% as the pandemic shifted consumer spending to the online world. Current figures show no signs of this trend slowing down. With such an impressive digital marketplace  the country is ready to be tapped into by ambitious international online businesses looking to do cross-border commerce there. Official Turkish Government statistics disclose:• A population of 86 million• 77.2% penetration of both internet and smartphones (2021)• 2021 e-commerce sales of $24.4 billion• E-commerce sales growth in 2021 was 75%However  the online payment landscape is driven by cards and dominated by local transactions  with a staggering 95% of card transactions made locally. Offering this form of payment increases access to local consumers significantly. Furthermore  there are a number of other key challenges facing potential entrants to this market  such as low approval rates  high cost of cross-border payments  FX risks and local entity requirements.Understanding these difficulties and having a payment solution to overcome them is absolutely critical to achieving success in this highly desirable market. Worldline  in conjunction with Lidio  seeks to do just that and its new solution supports international merchants and their consumers with:• A one-stop-shop approach for processing in Turkey without the requirement of a local entity• Access to the most popular payment methods  including Troy card scheme• Increased payments performance through access to local acquiring• Reduction in traditional high costs of cross-border payments• Limited foreign exchange risks through same-day exchange in your preferred currencyThe solution therefore minimises the time and investment required to start processing and accepting payments from Turkey  while maximising conversion rates and driving payment performance - not forgetting seamless compliance with local regulations and legislation.Guillaume Tournand  Head of Growth for Merchant Services at Worldline  added: “This new solution is part of our strategic approach to help global online businesses enter high growth markets. It follows solutions already launched for Brazil  China  India and South Korea. To support merchants in their efforts to enter and grow in these unique ecosystems  Worldline conducts extensive analysis to ensure that businesses comply with local governmental regulatory standards and tailor solutions to the preferences of the consumer to help drive cross-border growth.”Emre Güzer  Co-Founder & CEO of Lidio  said: “We are very pleased to be working with Worldline to bring this solution to the market here in Turkey.

The levelling of demand  soaring freight prices and the surge and subsequent collapse of the dollar all put pressure on our industry's profit margins. Thanks to our proven expertise in this sector  our flexibility and our ability to adapt our pricing policy  we are the only company to have remained profitable[2].We enter 2022-2023 with confidence  while external factors appear to be stabilising after benching the most vulnerable players. We therefore aim to get gradually back on track this year thanks to the initial impact of growth investments made in logistics  deliveries and the marketplace to boost customer satisfaction.”Full-year revenues down but gradual return to growthAfter four consecutive quarters of decline following the surge in European household online purchases during lockdowns  Vente-Unique.com returned to growth in Q4 2021-2022 with revenues up 5.1%  in line with the target. This increase is entirely organic  with new logistics outsourcing and marketplace services impacting the next financial year.Full-year revenues totalled €143.4 million  down 12.3% year-on-year but up 20.7% versus the previous year. Business volumes remained significantly higher than pre-Covid levels  demonstrating the inevitable continuation of the digital transformation trend underpinning the European furniture market.16th consecutive profitable yearWhile the Company managed to curtail the impact of negative trends in H1 2021-2022 through forecasting (securing supplies) and by adjusting its pricing policy  the cumulative effect of rising freight prices and fluctuating exchange rates had a significant impact on the second half gross margin. This resulted in a full-year gross margin of 53.0%  down four percentage points year-on-year and close to the 2019-2020 level.Against this backdrop  the Company reduced its recurring operating expenses by 6% to partly offset business losses. However  Vente-Unique.com has implemented a robust organisational system capable of handling the growth expected over the coming years and maintaining a high level of service quality in order to drive its medium-term development plan. As a result  the Company posted adjusted EBITDA of €8.4 million for the 2021-2022 financial year.After depreciation  amortisation and provisions  which increased to €2.0 million due to technological investments (proprietary ERP system upgrade  marketplace launch) and the valuation of bonus share plans (recognised impact of €1.5 million)  underlying EBIT came to €4.8 million. After other expenses and a €1.4 million tax charge  full-year net income amounted to €2.7 million.As such  Vente-Unique.com recorded its 16th consecutive profitable year.Strong cash position bolstering investment and shareholder returnsThanks to a strong opening cash position of €22.8 million boosted by gross operating cash flow of €5.4 million  Vente-Unique.com was able to invest in inventories (€7.0 million) and growth drivers related to logistics and the marketplace (€1.9 million). Closing cash and cash equivalents amounted to €18.9 million. Furthermore  the Company has no outstanding bank borrowings.In December  Vente-Unique.com paid out a €0.28 dividend per share for a total amount of €2.7 million  thus confirming its customary shareholder return policy without impacting its financial options.Forecast gradual return to growth and improved marginsVente-Unique.com is confident about the new financial year. The competitive landscape is currently being streamlined and the groundwork towards improving customer satisfaction has now been recognised  as illustrated by the 2023 Customer Service of the Year award in the home furniture and décor category[3].In addition  this year the Company began to step up its BtoB strategy by integrating Vente-Unique.com and third-party logistics management at the Amblainville platform (€6 million revenues in 2021-2022) on 1 October 2022 (purchase of Distri Service business assets for €2.8 million) and by launching the marketplace. The ramp-up scheduled from September 2022 is proceeding according to plan in France  with international roll-out set for the coming weeks and focusing on Southern Europe.These factors are expected to favour a gradual return to growth and improvement in earnings in 2022-2023 thanks to continued tight management of operating and capital expenditure. As such  Vente-Unique.com plans to resume its medium-term targets.Next publication: Q1 2022-2023 revenues Thursday  9 February 2023Read more on bourse.vente-unique.comAbout Vente- unique .comFounded in 2006  Vente-unique.com (Euronext Growth – ALVU)  a subsidiary of the Cafom Group (Euronext – CAFO)  is a European specialist in online furniture and home décor sales.

As the world’s lead…,"English FrenchParis  France – January 12  2023 – Atos today announces that it has been selected by Austrian AVL List GmbH to deliver a new high-performance computing cluster based on BullSequana XH2000 servers along with a five-year maintenance service. As the world’s leading mobility technology provider for development  simulation and testing in the automotive industry  the company will rely on Atos’ supercomputer to drive more complex and powerful simulations  while optimizing its energy consumption.As a global supplier to the automotive industry  AVL provides its customers with highly complex computer simulations for the design  development and testing of powertrains  workpieces  drive units and large engines. Every step of the way  the processes are represented digitally and require high  reliable computer performance as well as storage capacity. The cluster is used for a wide range of applications  from finite element analysis (FEA) for structural optimization and crash simulations to fluid mechanics simulations of combustion processes and battery cooling. Commercial software packages of well-known manufacturers as well as AVL-List's own Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software package FIRE are used for this task.The new computer network implemented by Atos has more than doubled the computational performance in engineering and therefore the processing times of computational tasks in customer projects could be reduced by more than half. In addition  it is possible to offer a greater variety of calculation results without having to access external compute resources such as cloud instances. This results in rapid and efficient adaptations of engineering workflows to new tasks.With this cluster  AVL also benefits from a highly energy-efficient system  including Atos’ Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC). This technology has been developed to avoid overheating. It consumes significantly less electricity than conventional cooling systems while ensuring almost noiseless  particularly stable operation.""AVL’s passion is innovation and Atos’ supercomputer meets that requirement in terms of performance and energy-efficiency. The Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC) technology of the XH2000 cluster has opened up an unprecedented performance range  with minimal energy requirements and a green footprint  because 95 per cent of the waste heat is not released into the environment  but is put to further use via the cooling water circuit "" explained Günter Bachler  Senior IT System Administrator  AVL List GmbH.Stefan Kero  Head of Advanced Computing  Central Eastern Europe  Atos  added: ""High-performance computers are among the key technologies of our time and have become indispensable in Sciences  Medical Research  Weather Forecast but also in the Industry  especially in digital product development. With HPC  industrial players can accelerate the construction of digital prototypes – which can be run through quickly and as often as desired in a multitude of variants – therefore gain flexibility and innovative strength. We are glad to be supporting AVL to simulate and test automotive technologies  for a safer mobility.""***About AtosAtos is a global leader in digital transformation with 112 000 employees and annual revenue of c. € 11 billion.

As the world’s leading mobility technology provider for development  simulation and testing in the automotive industry  the company will rely on Atos’ supercomputer to drive more complex and powerful simulations  while optimizing its energy consumption.As a global supplier to the automotive industry  AVL provides its customers with highly complex computer simulations for the design  development and testing of powertrains  workpieces  drive units and large engines. Every step of the way  the processes are represented digitally and require high  reliable computer performance as well as storage capacity. The cluster is used for a wide range of applications  from finite element analysis (FEA) for structural optimization and crash simulations to fluid mechanics simulations of combustion processes and battery cooling. Commercial software packages of well-known manufacturers as well as AVL-List's own Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software package FIRE are used for this task.The new computer network implemented by Atos has more than doubled the computational performance in engineering and therefore the processing times of computational tasks in customer projects could be reduced by more than half. In addition  it is possible to offer a greater variety of calculation results without having to access external compute resources such as cloud instances. This results in rapid and efficient adaptations of engineering workflows to new tasks.With this cluster  AVL also benefits from a highly energy-efficient system  including Atos’ Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC). This technology has been developed to avoid overheating. It consumes significantly less electricity than conventional cooling systems while ensuring almost noiseless  particularly stable operation.""AVL’s passion is innovation and Atos’ supercomputer meets that requirement in terms of performance and energy-efficiency. The Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC) technology of the XH2000 cluster has opened up an unprecedented performance range  with minimal energy requirements and a green footprint  because 95 per cent of the waste heat is not released into the environment  but is put to further use via the cooling water circuit "" explained Günter Bachler  Senior IT System Administrator  AVL List GmbH.Stefan Kero  Head of Advanced Computing  Central Eastern Europe  Atos  added: ""High-performance computers are among the key technologies of our time and have become indispensable in Sciences  Medical Research  Weather Forecast but also in the Industry  especially in digital product development. With HPC  industrial players can accelerate the construction of digital prototypes – which can be run through quickly and as often as desired in a multitude of variants – therefore gain flexibility and innovative strength. We are glad to be supporting AVL to simulate and test automotive technologies  for a safer mobility.""***About AtosAtos is a global leader in digital transformation with 112 000 employees and annual revenue of c. € 11 billion.
