Signify now expects a comparable sales decline of 8.8% for the quarter  resulting in a comparable sales growth of 1.2% for the full year 2022  compared to the previous range of 2-3% for the year.While the gross margin stabilized  fixed costs did not keep pace with lower sales volumes. Signify therefore expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 10% for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2022. This compares with the previous full-year guidance of the lower end of the 11.0-11.4% range.During the final quarter  Signify significantly reduced its inventory  leading to a better than expected working capital performance. The company now expects to report a full year 2022 free cash flow of approximately EUR 445 million or 5.9% of sales  compared to the previous guidance of the lower end of the 5-7% range.Signify will publish its fourth quarter and full-year results 2022 on January 27  2023.--- END ---For further information  please contact:Signify Investor RelationsThelke GerdesTel: +31 6 1801 7131E-mail: thelke.gerdes@signify.comSignify Corporate CommunicationsLeanne CarmodyTel: +31 6 3928 0201E-mail: leanne.carmody@signify.comAbigail LeveneTel: +31 6 2939 3895E-mail: abigail.levene@signify.comFinancial calendar 2023January 27  2023 Fourth quarter and full-year results 2022February 28  2023 Annual Report 2022May 3  2023 Q1 results 2023July 28  2023 Q2 and half-year results 2023October 27  2023 Q3 results 2023Story continuesAbout SignifySignify (Euronext: LIGHT) is the world leader in lighting for professionals and consumers and lighting for the Internet of Things.

Titled  ""The Road Map Towards a Transformational Well-Being Culture""  the research report is part of Accor's ongoing and insightful Health to Wealth series  designed to explore the world's state of well-being and the defining issues of our time. Health to Wealth has already released an illuminating 12-episode podcast featuring leading thinkers as well as an entrepreneurial wellness start-up challenge in Paris in collaboration with VivaTech.Accor’s new white paper highlights eight key pathways for businesses  governments and organizations to consider as they plot their own roadmaps toward a culture of well-being  enabling them to thrive in the future economy. (CNW Group/Accor)""Accor is seeking to drive transformational change  supporting a shift toward the emergence of a well-being economy  with an earnest desire to help people  businesses  and communities achieve their priorities for alignment and prosperity "" said Emlyn Brown  Global Vice President  Well-Being  Accor. ""The Health to Wealth white paper demonstrates that well-being must be recognized as an imperative for all if we are to maintain the equilibrium of our lives  our society  and our planet.""The white paper highlights eight key pathways for businesses  governments and organizations to consider as they plot their own roadmaps toward a culture of well-being  enabling them to thrive in the future economy. These findings draw on the rich body of insights shared by the speakers in the Health to Wealth podcast series. Key pathways to progress include:Well-being is body and mind – The link between mental and physical well-being has been widely documented and these learnings are yielding innovative neuroscientific technology with psychological and physiological benefits.Measurement can optimize well-being – Governments  health organizations  and corporations are called upon to collect more comprehensive and meaningful health data – and act on it to improve the numbers.Our well-being starts with our finances – With a longer-term goal to achieve a more equal distribution of wealth  it is essential to help people manage money and financial stress  while offering affordable well-being solutions.Access to well-being needs to be fully democratic – Well-being must be inclusive  available  accessible  and achievable for everyone  regardless of wealth  gender  race  nationality  sexuality  or ability.Joined-up thinking is required – As organizations  corporations  and nations connect their ideas and actions to a wider eco-system  the improving health of their populations leads to richer  more robust economies.Technology must become a positive force – Empowering individuals to have control over their data  privacy  and safety  while improving the quality of data that is shared  collected  and used  is a positive force for change.Our own well-being is entwined with our planet – How we use the world's precious resources is critical to a sense of well-being in the world  ensuring our air  food and water supplies are safe  nourishing  and sustainable.Well-being transcends cultural differences – The desire to be well is a universal aspiration and essential to being human; if recognized as a cornerstone of public policy  it can be the engine that transforms the world.Story continuesLike the the Health to Wealth podcast series  the white paper was curated by Well Intelligence  in partnership with Accor. Well Intelligence is a UK-based international business advisory group that champions the relevance and cultural lifeblood brought on by investments in well-being  guiding corporations in their quest to establish impactful well-being programs  fitter workforces  and healthier communities.To read and download ""The Road Map Towards a Transformational Well-Being Culture"" in full  please click hereABOUT ACCORAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

The research reveals that the top pressures they are putting on themselves are:- To be more confident (49%)- To be more active / fitter (44%)- To be more sociable (37%)Surprisingly  the research revealed 57% of young adult Southeast Asians admit that they are even putting more pressure on themselves than their parents did.

Titled  “The Road Map Towards a Transformational Well-Being Culture”  the research report is part of Accor’s ongoing and insightful Health to Wealth series  designed to explore the world’s state of well-being and the defining issues of our time. Health to Wealth has already released an illuminating 12-episode podcast featuring leading thinkers as well as an entrepreneurial wellness start-up challenge in Paris in collaboration with VivaTech.Accor is seeking to drive transformational change  supporting a shift toward the emergence of a well-being economy  with an earnest desire to help people  businesses  and communities achieve their priorities for alignment and prosperity ” said. The Health to Wealth white paper demonstrates that well-being must be recognized as an imperative for all if we are to maintain the equilibrium of our lives  our society  and our planet. Emlyn Brown  Global Vice President  Well-Being  AccorThe white paper highlights eight key pathways for businesses  governments and organizations to consider as they plot their own roadmaps toward a culture of well-being  enabling them to thrive in the future economy. These findings draw on the rich body of insights shared by the speakers in the Health to Wealth podcast series. Key pathways to progress include:Well-being is body and mind – The link between mental and physical well-being has been widely documented and these learnings are yielding innovative neuroscientific technology with psychological and physiological benefits. Measurement can optimize well-being – Governments  health organizations  and corporations are called upon to collect more comprehensive and meaningful health data – and act on it to improve the numbers. Our well-being starts with our finances – With a longer-term goal to achieve a more equal distribution of wealth  it is essential to help people manage money and financial stress  while offering affordable well-being solutions. Access to well-being needs to be fully democratic – Well-being must be inclusive  available  accessible  and achievable for everyone  regardless of wealth  gender  race  nationality  sexuality  or ability. Joined-up thinking is required – As organizations  corporations  and nations connect their ideas and actions to a wider eco-system  the improving health of their populations leads to richer  more robust economies. Technology must become a positive force – Empowering individuals to have control over their data  privacy  and safety  while improving the quality of data that is shared  collected  and used  is a positive force for change. Our own well-being is entwined with our planet – How we use the world’s precious resources is critical to a sense of well-being in the world  ensuring our air  food and water supplies are safe  nourishing  and sustainable. Well-being transcends cultural differences – The desire to be well is a universal aspiration and essential to being human; if recognized as a cornerstone of public policy  it can be the engine that transforms the world.Like the Health to Wealth podcast series  the white paper was curated by Well Intelligence  in partnership with Accor. Well Intelligence is a UK-based international business advisory group that champions the relevance and cultural lifeblood brought on by investments in well-being  guiding corporations in their quest to establish impactful well-being programs  fitter workforces  and healthier communities.To read and download “The Road Map Towards a Transformational Well-Being Culture” in full  please click here.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

The resort is nestle…,Taryn Gillson  Executive Director of the Impact Division & Community Conservation Fund Africa at Mantis Collection outlines the three pillars of engagement to which each Mantis property adheres: Conservation  Sustainability and Community. The resort is nestled deep in the South African wilderness  between Gqeberha and Grahamstown  within a 20 000 hectares conservation area. On this land  6 500 species of plants flourish – 2 000 of which cannot be found anywhere else in the world. The place is also home to 421 species of birds and 48 species of large mammals including rhinos  giraffes  warthogs  zebras and antelopes.Learn How the Mantis Founders Lodge Is Making a Difference Through Its Legacy Conservation ProjectsHave a look back at our 2nd episode to hear how our teams near Marseille contribute to local biodiversity here.Conservation has long been the cornerstone of the Mantis CollectionTo help all the Mantis Collection properties carry out their conservation work  an Impact Division has been created  that is dedicated to the sustainable conservation of wildlife and wilderness areas through community partnerships.To help achieve this  an official Mantis foundation was registered as a non-profit company called Community Conservation Fund Africa (CCFA). Founded in 2018  from the collaboration between Mantis and Accor  the CCFA was created in order to find sustainable solutions to the global conservation crisis through community-based projects.Mantis Founders Lodge Has Set Three Main Biodiversity Priorities: Rhinos  Bees and Indigenous TreesRhino Conservation : The Mantis Founders Lodge is home to a breeding herd of the Southern White Rhino  a keynote species upon which other life in the ecosystem depends. Maintaining rhinos’ safety and welfare is important and resource intensive; it involves high-tech security surveillance cameras  collaborating with anti-poaching rangers and providing additional feed to keep them healthy. Rhinos also receive regular check-ups to ensure future breeding. In an effort to educate and spread awareness  guests are also invited to take part in rhino monitoring activities. The teams pride themselves in the project’s record: as the lodge’s rhino population is thriving  feeding well and breeding  soon 2 sub-adult male rhinos will be rehomed.: The Mantis Founders Lodge is home to a breeding herd of the Southern White Rhino  a keynote species upon which other life in the ecosystem depends.

To support bee life  the resort has built 3 beehives that can each house 60 to 80 thousand bees. Indigenous Tree Planting Program: Guests are encouraged to join the Lodge’s efforts to reduce carbon footprint and bolster biodiversity by planting native trees under the guidance of a dedicated hotel team. Guest-sponsored trees can be personalized with name tags  which gives lodgers a reason to return to check in on ‘their’ tree.Since the program launch in 2022  24 trees from 6 different species have been planted so far.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYAfter a very strong performance in November (+6.3%)  December was slightly down with -1%  including the January dividend payment for which the record date was set in December.Although CLO debt performed relatively well  Volta suffered from the underperformance of the USD against the Euro as well as slightly negative performances in December on Volta non-CLO exposures.Volta’s underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** were as follow: -0.3% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +0.5% for CLO Equity tranches  +1.3% for CLO Debt tranches; and -3.6% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (which represent circa 2.3% of the fund’s NAV).December usually is a relatively quiet month in terms of CLO Equity distributions. Over the month  Volta received the equivalent of €0.3m of interests and coupons. Over the usual 6-month-basis time frame Volta received €22.5m of interests and coupons  ie. a 21.1% annualized cash flow to NAV.We purchased two European CLO Equity positions from the secondary market in December for a total nominal amount of €2.5m  at an average purchase price of 59.75%. The projected yield of said purchases is - under reasonable assumptions regarding future underlying losses - in the 22% context.Fundamentals-wise  December saw significantly more downgrades than upgrades especially in the US Loan market. Even though we are still waiting for December trustee reports  expectations are that CCC/Caa1 loan buckets increased on average by 1.5 to 2% in the US through the course of the month.Story continuesIn terms of default rates  we now have the full list of defaults for 2022. Default rates were still very low  at 0.4% for European Loans and 0.7% for US loans. After the invasion of Ukraine  rating agencies were forecasting 2022 default rates to reach between 2% and 2.5% for the US and European loan markets… We closed the year far from those levels.As we regularly highlight in this report  the main reason for such low default rates is the benefit of inflation  despite the economic slowdown. When companies’ revenues are growing fast  even if said companies suffer from margins pressure  profits and EBITDA still manage to grow (at a lower pace than revenues but they still do grow on average).When considering rating agencies and most banks’ research  default rates are expected to reach 3.5% to 5.5% for 2023. Our default rates view for 2023 still lands in the 3% area for both US and European Loans as we still believe that debt erosion (thanks to inflation) and significant increase in revenues will help avoiding some defaults ; despite the fact that margins are already under pressure and that they should remain under pressure for a few more quarters. Since the vast majority of loans are covenant lite  the deterioration of interest coverage ratios - while being a source of stress - do not mechanically lead to a default. It is the level of EBITDA and where rates will be when companies need to refinance their debt that will really matter. We do not see many companies that have to refinance in 2023.Such kind of default pattern should not materially impact the distribution of interests of Volta’s assets in the near term. We believe that we can maintain a high level of coupons in the coming quarters and are actively looking to seize investment opportunities with the extra cash that is being generated.As at the end of December 2022  Volta’s NAV was €213.5m or €5.84 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 6.6% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 1.3% as at 30 November 2022  4.7% was at 30 October 2022  0.6% was at 30 September 2022.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

This revolution in maritime history is an ambitious undertaking that pushes the limits…,140 years after the launch of its first luxury trains  the Orient Express legend continues with the unveiling of the world's largest sailing ship  Orient Express Silenseas. This revolution in maritime history is an ambitious undertaking that pushes the limits of what is possible. The result of a unique French partnership between world leader in hospitality Accor and Chantiers de l'Atlantique  a globally leading shipbuilding company  this extraordinary sailing yacht of the future with spectacular interiors will set sail in 2026.With Orient Express Silenseas  we are beginning a new chapter in our history  taking the experience and excellence of luxury travel and transposing it onto the world’s most beautiful seas. This exceptional sailing yacht  with roots in Orient Express’ history  will offer unparalleled service and refined design spaces  reminiscent of the golden age of mythical cruises. Innovation is at the heart of this ultra-modern ship that will revolutionize the maritime world with new technology to meet today’s sustainability challenges. It is a boat designed to make dreams a reality  a showcase for the best of French savoir-faire. Sébastien Bazin  Chairman and CEO  Accor.With a signed letter of intent to order two ships  Chantiers de l'Atlantique is proud to herald a new era in the shipbuilding industry with Silenseas. This concept  born in our design offices in 2018  is the quintessence of our savoir-faire in the fields of naval architecture  the construction of sophisticated hulls  as well as the design of luxurious spaces. In addition  the installation of three SolidSail rigs  a revolutionary 1 500-square-meter unit wind propulsion system  for which we have developed and tested a first prototype  will contribute significantly to the propulsion of the ship. Combined with a hybrid propulsion system running on liquefied natural gas (LNG)  Silenseas will thus become the ship of reference in terms of environmentally-friendly operation and design. Laurent Castaing  Managing Director  Chantiers de l'Atlantique.In 1867  Georges Nagelmackers boarded the transatlantic ships connecting Europe to America and set off on a journey of discovery to the United States. Fascinated by the grandeur of these huge boats  the founder of Orient Express trains explored the luxurious travelers' suites  with their rich and sumptuous decor  adorned with exceptional marquetry. He experienced the social scene in the restaurants and the unique ambiance of the lounges  libraries and entertainment venues. This sea travel experience would later inspire the 1883 launch of his now legendary train: the Orient Express.Inspired by the Golden Age of the French Riviera  Orient Express Silenseas will echo the glorious era when writers  artists  painters  princesses and movie stars spent time between Monte-Carlo  the beaches of Saint-Tropez  Cap d'Antibes  Cannes and its famous Croisette and discovered a refinement tinged with exquisite insouciance and joie de vivre  inviting them to extreme escapades.A 220-meter-long ocean treasure with a tonnage of 22 300 UMS  Orient Express Silenseas will feature 54 Suites measuring on average 70-square-meters  including a monumental 1 415- square-meter Presidential Suite (including a 530-square-meter private terrace)  two swimming pools including a lap pool  two restaurants and a speakeasy bar. The singular cruise ship will celebrate the Art of Travel à la Orient Express: the quintessence of luxury  absolute comfort and dreams.A tribute to artists and culture  Orient Express Silenseas will invite guests to experience incredible shows in its Amphitheatre-Cabaret and a private recording studio will give a voice to the most beautiful melodies. This unique travel experience  guided by the winds  will feature spa treatments  meditation sessions and stopover explorations to discover cultural treasures that allow guests to completely unplug from reality and stop time.Capitalizing on the experience of these experts in ocean racing  Orient Express Silenseas will sail with a revolutionary technological design known as 'SolidSail': three rigid sails with a surface area of 1 500 meters each will be hoisted on a balestron rig  with three tilting masts reaching more than 100 meters high  able to ensure up to 100% of the propulsion in suitable weather conditions. This hybrid propulsion formula will combine wind power with a state-of-the-art engine running on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and plans to use green hydrogen once the technology is approved for ocean passenger ships  launching a new  more environmentally friendly vision of sea travel.The latest feat from the Chantiers de l'Atlantique is a true sailing yacht of the future combining the finest French talents. Renowned architect Maxime d'Angeac will design the interior layout and decor and Nantes-based design company Stirling Design International will handle the exterior architecture. Hetland Maritime also assisted Accor in creating the project and in the ongoing discussions with Chantiers de l'Atlantique. The entire project will be financed up to 70- 80% by commercial banks  with the remainder provided by a consortium of equity partners in which Accor will have a minority stake.ABOUT ORIENT EXPRESS  PART OF ACCORArtisan of travel since 1883  Orient Express sublimates the Art of Travel with its luxury trains  uniqueexperiences  and collections of rare objects.

Signify now expects a comparable sales decline of 8.8% for the quarter  resulting in a comparable sales growth of 1.2% for the full year 2022  compared to the previous range of 2-3% for the year.While the gross margin stabilized  fixed costs did not keep pace with lower sales volumes. Signify therefore expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 10% for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2022. This compares with the previous full-year guidance of the lower end of the 11.0-11.4% range.During the final quarter  Signify significantly reduced its inventory  leading to a better than expected working capital performance. The company now expects to report a full year 2022 free cash flow of approximately EUR 445 million or 5.9% of sales  compared to the previous guidance of the lower end of the 5-7% range.Signify will publish its fourth quarter and full-year results 2022 on January 27  2023.--- END ---For further information  please contact:Signify Investor RelationsThelke GerdesTel: +31 6 1801 7131E-mail: thelke.gerdes@signify.comSignify Corporate CommunicationsLeanne CarmodyTel: +31 6 3928 0201E-mail: leanne.carmody@signify.comAbigail LeveneTel: +31 6 2939 3895E-mail: abigail.levene@signify.comFinancial calendar 2023January 27  2023 Fourth quarter and full-year results 2022February 28  2023 Annual Report 2022May 3  2023 Q1 results 2023July 28  2023 Q2 and half-year results 2023October 27  2023 Q3 results 2023About SignifySignify (Euronext: LIGHT) is the world leader in lighting for professionals and consumers and lighting for the Internet of Things.

According to BKM  the Interbank Card Center in Turkey  e-commerce grew 37 to 40% per annum between 2017 and 2020. This accelerated in 2021 with a stunning 75% as the pandemic shifted consumer spending to the online world. Current figures show no signs of this trend slowing down. With such an impressive digital marketplace  the country is ready to be tapped into by ambitious international online businesses looking to do cross-border commerce there. Official Turkish Government statistics disclose:• A population of 86 million• 77.2% penetration of both internet and smartphones (2021)• 2021 e-commerce sales of $24.4 billion• E-commerce sales growth in 2021 was 75%However  the online payment landscape is driven by cards and dominated by local transactions  with a staggering 95% of card transactions made locally. Offering this form of payment increases access to local consumers significantly. Furthermore  there are a number of other key challenges facing potential entrants to this market  such as low approval rates  high cost of cross-border payments  FX risks and local entity requirements.Understanding these difficulties and having a payment solution to overcome them is absolutely critical to achieving success in this highly desirable market. Worldline  in conjunction with Lidio  seeks to do just that and its new solution supports international merchants and their consumers with:• A one-stop-shop approach for processing in Turkey without the requirement of a local entity• Access to the most popular payment methods  including Troy card scheme• Increased payments performance through access to local acquiring• Reduction in traditional high costs of cross-border payments• Limited foreign exchange risks through same-day exchange in your preferred currencyThe solution therefore minimises the time and investment required to start processing and accepting payments from Turkey  while maximising conversion rates and driving payment performance - not forgetting seamless compliance with local regulations and legislation.Guillaume Tournand  Head of Growth for Merchant Services at Worldline  added: “This new solution is part of our strategic approach to help global online businesses enter high growth markets. It follows solutions already launched for Brazil  China  India and South Korea. To support merchants in their efforts to enter and grow in these unique ecosystems  Worldline conducts extensive analysis to ensure that businesses comply with local governmental regulatory standards and tailor solutions to the preferences of the consumer to help drive cross-border growth.”Emre Güzer  Co-Founder & CEO of Lidio  said: “We are very pleased to be working with Worldline to bring this solution to the market here in Turkey. As one of the most rapidly expanding marketplaces that uniquely crosses the divide between Asia and Europe  we seek to facilitate and participate in this growth. Our joint e-commerce proposition enables us to offer customers a seamless solution and ensure maximum satisfaction.”Roman Tazetdinov  Head of Turkey Geo Expansion at Worldline  commented: “We are delighted with this strategic partnership with Lidio. Our joint offering will go a significant way to ensure that the widest possible array of international digital merchants have access to this hugely exciting market and are best placed to secure a successful implementation of their ambitions here.”Ece Berkol  Chief Commercial Officer of Lidio  added: “We’re extremely excited to bring this e-commerce solution to market together with our valued partner Worldline. Our partnership undoubtedly presents a great opportunity for online merchants looking to take advantage of Turkey’s digital market that is growing at a rapid pace.”,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.62,0.07,0.32,True,English,"['Lidio Payment Services', 'Wordline', 'Turkey', 'Official Turkish Government statistics', 'local governmental regulatory standards', 'Limited foreign exchange risks', 'ambitious international online businesses', 'Lidio Payment Services Inc', 'leading Fintech companies', 'other key challenges', 'Emre Güzer', 'widest possible array', 'Chief Commercial Officer', 'Interbank Card Center', 'impressive digital marketplace', 'Troy card scheme', 'traditional high costs', 'low approval rates', 'popular payment methods', 'online payment landscape', 'global online businesses', 'local entity requirements', 'joint e-commerce proposition', 'high growth markets', 'international digital merchants', 'Turkish e-commerce market', 'Turkey Geo Expansion', 'valued partner Worldline', 'E-commerce sales growth', 'FX risks', 'international merchants', 'same-day exchange', '2021 e-commerce sales', 'online merchants', 'card transactions', 'Merchant Services', 'global leader', 'conversion rates', 'payment performance', 'joint offering', 'payments services', 'local transactions', 'local acquiring', 'local regulations', 'online world', 'payment solution', 'e-commerce solution', 'Current figures', 'cross-border commerce', 'potential entrants', 'one-stop-shop approach', 'preferred currency', 'seamless compliance', 'Guillaume Tournand', 'strategic approach', 'South Korea', 'unique ecosystems', 'extensive analysis', 'cross-border growth', 'expanding marketplaces', 'maximum satisfaction', 'Roman Tazetdinov', 'significant way', 'successful implementation', 'Ece Berkol', 'great opportunity', 'rapid pace', 'local consumers', 'cross-border payments', 'payments performance', 'desirable market', 'new solution', 'seamless solution', 'exciting market', 'strategic partnership', 'consumer spending', 'Source', 'Euronext', 'WLN', 'BKM', 'pandemic', 'signs', 'trend', 'country', 'population', '77.2% penetration', 'internet', 'smartphones', 'cards', 'access', 'number', 'difficulties', 'conjunction', 'processing', 'Reduction', 'time', 'investment', 'legislation', 'Head', 'solutions', 'Brazil', 'China', 'India', 'efforts', 'preferences', 'Founder', 'CEO', 'divide', 'Asia', 'Europe', 'customers', 'ambitions', 'advantage']",2023-01-12,2023-01-13,finextra.com

Vente-Unique.com  a European specialist in online furniture sales  today announces its unaudited results for the 2021-2022 financial year (1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022). The Board of Directors approved the financial statements on 11 January 2023. The annual financial report will be published on 30 January 2023 after the completion of audit procedures.IFRS (€m) 2019-2020 2020-2021 2021-2022 Revenues 118.9 163.5 143.4 Gross margin 63.1 93.2 75.9 % of revenues 53.1% 57.0% 53.0% Adjusted EBITDA[1] 10.0 21.6 8.4 % of revenues 8.4% 13.2% 5.8% Underlying EBIT 8.1 19.5 4.8 % of revenues 6.8% 11.9% 3.3% EBIT 7.7 19.4 4.4 Net financial income/(expense) (0.0) (0.0) (0.2) Income tax (3.0) (5.2) (1.4) Net income 4.7 14.2 2.7Vente-Unique.com CEO Sacha Vigna said: “Following the sharp acceleration of the digital transformation of our European furniture market  which has driven our entire industry for almost two years  in 2022 we saw an accumulation of adverse factors affecting all players. The levelling of demand  soaring freight prices and the surge and subsequent collapse of the dollar all put pressure on our industry's profit margins. Thanks to our proven expertise in this sector  our flexibility and our ability to adapt our pricing policy  we are the only company to have remained profitable[2].We enter 2022-2023 with confidence  while external factors appear to be stabilising after benching the most vulnerable players. We therefore aim to get gradually back on track this year thanks to the initial impact of growth investments made in logistics  deliveries and the marketplace to boost customer satisfaction.”Full-year revenues down but gradual return to growthAfter four consecutive quarters of decline following the surge in European household online purchases during lockdowns  Vente-Unique.com returned to growth in Q4 2021-2022 with revenues up 5.1%  in line with the target. This increase is entirely organic  with new logistics outsourcing and marketplace services impacting the next financial year.Full-year revenues totalled €143.4 million  down 12.3% year-on-year but up 20.7% versus the previous year. Business volumes remained significantly higher than pre-Covid levels  demonstrating the inevitable continuation of the digital transformation trend underpinning the European furniture market.16th consecutive profitable yearWhile the Company managed to curtail the impact of negative trends in H1 2021-2022 through forecasting (securing supplies) and by adjusting its pricing policy  the cumulative effect of rising freight prices and fluctuating exchange rates had a significant impact on the second half gross margin. This resulted in a full-year gross margin of 53.0%  down four percentage points year-on-year and close to the 2019-2020 level.Against this backdrop  the Company reduced its recurring operating expenses by 6% to partly offset business losses. However  Vente-Unique.com has implemented a robust organisational system capable of handling the growth expected over the coming years and maintaining a high level of service quality in order to drive its medium-term development plan. As a result  the Company posted adjusted EBITDA of €8.4 million for the 2021-2022 financial year.After depreciation  amortisation and provisions  which increased to €2.0 million due to technological investments (proprietary ERP system upgrade  marketplace launch) and the valuation of bonus share plans (recognised impact of €1.5 million)  underlying EBIT came to €4.8 million. After other expenses and a €1.4 million tax charge  full-year net income amounted to €2.7 million.As such  Vente-Unique.com recorded its 16th consecutive profitable year.Strong cash position bolstering investment and shareholder returnsThanks to a strong opening cash position of €22.8 million boosted by gross operating cash flow of €5.4 million  Vente-Unique.com was able to invest in inventories (€7.0 million) and growth drivers related to logistics and the marketplace (€1.9 million). Closing cash and cash equivalents amounted to €18.9 million. Furthermore  the Company has no outstanding bank borrowings.In December  Vente-Unique.com paid out a €0.28 dividend per share for a total amount of €2.7 million  thus confirming its customary shareholder return policy without impacting its financial options.Forecast gradual return to growth and improved marginsVente-Unique.com is confident about the new financial year. The competitive landscape is currently being streamlined and the groundwork towards improving customer satisfaction has now been recognised  as illustrated by the 2023 Customer Service of the Year award in the home furniture and décor category[3].In addition  this year the Company began to step up its BtoB strategy by integrating Vente-Unique.com and third-party logistics management at the Amblainville platform (€6 million revenues in 2021-2022) on 1 October 2022 (purchase of Distri Service business assets for €2.8 million) and by launching the marketplace. The ramp-up scheduled from September 2022 is proceeding according to plan in France  with international roll-out set for the coming weeks and focusing on Southern Europe.These factors are expected to favour a gradual return to growth and improvement in earnings in 2022-2023 thanks to continued tight management of operating and capital expenditure. As such  Vente-Unique.com plans to resume its medium-term targets.Next publication: Q1 2022-2023 revenues Thursday  9 February 2023Read more on bourse.vente-unique.comAbout Vente- unique .comFounded in 2006  Vente-unique.com (Euronext Growth – ALVU)  a subsidiary of the Cafom Group (Euronext – CAFO)  is a European specialist in online furniture and home décor sales.

As the world’s leading mobility technology provider for development  simulation and testing in the automotive industry  the company will rely on Atos’ supercomputer to drive more complex and powerful simulations  while optimizing its energy consumption.As a global supplier to the automotive industry  AVL provides its customers with highly complex computer simulations for the design  development and testing of powertrains  workpieces  drive units and large engines. Every step of the way  the processes are represented digitally and require high  reliable computer performance as well as storage capacity. The cluster is used for a wide range of applications  from finite element analysis (FEA) for structural optimization and crash simulations to fluid mechanics simulations of combustion processes and battery cooling. Commercial software packages of well-known manufacturers as well as AVL-List's own Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software package FIRE are used for this task.The new computer network implemented by Atos has more than doubled the computational performance in engineering and therefore the processing times of computational tasks in customer projects could be reduced by more than half. In addition  it is possible to offer a greater variety of calculation results without having to access external compute resources such as cloud instances. This results in rapid and efficient adaptations of engineering workflows to new tasks.With this cluster  AVL also benefits from a highly energy-efficient system  including Atos’ Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC). This technology has been developed to avoid overheating. It consumes significantly less electricity than conventional cooling systems while ensuring almost noiseless  particularly stable operation.""AVL’s passion is innovation and Atos’ supercomputer meets that requirement in terms of performance and energy-efficiency. The Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC) technology of the XH2000 cluster has opened up an unprecedented performance range  with minimal energy requirements and a green footprint  because 95 per cent of the waste heat is not released into the environment  but is put to further use via the cooling water circuit "" explained Günter Bachler  Senior IT System Administrator  AVL List GmbH.Stefan Kero  Head of Advanced Computing  Central Eastern Europe  Atos  added: ""High-performance computers are among the key technologies of our time and have become indispensable in Sciences  Medical Research  Weather Forecast but also in the Industry  especially in digital product development.

Its one thousand seven hundred and eighteen (1 718) old shares will therefore be cancelled.Date of the reverse split: the reverse split will take effect on February 27  2023  i.e. 30 days after the date of commencement of the reverse split operationsExchange period: thirty (30) days as from the date of commencement of the consolidation operations  i.e. from January 26  2023 to February 24  2023 inclusiveFractional shares: the conversion of the old shares into new shares will be carried out according to the automatic procedure.Fractional shares: the shareholders who do not have a number of old shares corresponding to a whole number of new shares will have to make their own purchase or sale of the old shares forming fractional shares in order to obtain a multiple of three thousand seven hundred (3 700) until February 24  2023.After this period  the shareholders who would not have been able to obtain a multiple of three thousand seven hundred (3 700) shares will be compensated within thirty (30) days as from February 27  2023 by their financial intermediary.In application of articles L. 228-6-1 and R. 228-12 of the French Commercial Code  at the end of a period of thirty (30) days as from January 26  2023  the new shares which could not be allotted individually and corresponding to fractional shares will be sold on the stock exchange by the account holders and the sums resulting from the sale will be distributed in proportion to the fractional rights of the holders of these shares.The ungrouped shares will be delisted at the end of the regrouping period.Voting rights: the new shares will immediately benefit from double voting rights  subject to being held in registered form  if on the date of the reverse split of the old shares from which they originate  each of these old shares benefited from double voting rights. In the event of a reverse split of old shares that have been registered since different dates  the period used to assess the double voting rights of the new shares will be deemed to begin on the most recent date on which the old shares were registered.Centralization: all transactions relating to the reverse stock split will take place at Uptevia (ex.

Continue reading at TweakTown >,"Ubisoft share value drops by over 12% as the company shocks investors with a new announcement.2VIEW GALLERY - 2 IMAGESUbisoft isn't in a great place right now and is prepared to take a short-term loss to get itself back on track. Ubisoft executive management held a conference to outline a new business plan that will make the publisher more lean and better equipped to navigate the current inflation- and recession-driven market.The plan includes a few things that investors won't like. Ubisoft expects to record a 500 million Euro loss in non-IFRS operating income for Fiscal Year 2023. The loss is driven by the cancellation of three in-development projects  which has led to the depreciation of half a billion Euros of capitalized R&D. The company has previously expected non-IFRS operating income of about 400 million Euros  which would have represented the third straight year of declining profits.Net bookings is also expected to slide by 10% year-over-year to deliver around 1.9 billion Euros.""Ubisoft is revising its full year targets with net bookings expected to be down more than 10% year-on-year versus a prior expectation of up more than 10%. Non-IFRS operating income  reflecting lower net bookings  the postponement of Skull and Bones and the depreciation of capitalized R&D for around €500m  is now expected at -€500m versus €400m previously.""Read Also: Ubisoft may sell game franchises to reduce costsThe company says that these game cancellations will allow it to re-focus its efforts on live services and more guaranteed hits in popular brands. The idea is to reduce risks while also lowering spending and costs wherever possible.On the day of the announcement  Ubisoft shares dived from 23.87 Euros on Euronext Paris to 18.83 Euros. Shares have somewhat stabilized at 20.79 Euros as of today.Ubisoft's operating income is expected to stabilize during next year's Fiscal Year 2024 period and achieve 400 million Euros.

Its products are used by all the major chip-manufacturing companies worldwide. Photograph: Yuichi YamazakiYou’ve probably never heard of this technology company. But without it  the worldwide technology industry would revert by at least a couple of decades. No other company anywhere can do what it does.We can perhaps imagine a world without Google or Amazon or Apple or Microsoft – after all  there are alternatives to each. But we would not have a tech industry at all today without ASML (Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography).The intricate patterns of transistors on the surface of semiconductor are laid out using a process called photo-lithography. First  a glass stencil mask is made from a pattern. Then  in an upside down microscope  light is shone through the mask and a series of lenses.The resulting tiny image is focused onto the surface of a silicon wafer coated with a light-sensitive polymer. Regions in the mask shadow remain protected  but those exposed to the light can be washed away. The process is repeated  with multiple masks  each exquisitely aligned. The transistor patterns are thus traced onto the silicon  albeit at miniscule dimensions.READ MOREA human hair is typically about 0.06mm in diameter. The four-nanometre patterns used in the Apple A16 processor  at the heart of the “Pro” models of its iPhones  are hence about 15 000 times thinner. A single A16 chip in an iPhone contains about 16 billion transistors. If each transistor was enlarged to a single grain of sand  then 16 billion of them would occupy 2 000 litres – the size of a large domestic fuel tank.Tiny dimensionsASML is the sole supplier of lithographic equipment capable of tracing patterns at such extraordinarily tiny dimensions. Its products are used by all the major chip-manufacturing companies worldwide  including TSMC (Taiwan)  Samsung (South Korea) and Intel (USA). Each of ASML’s high-end products has about 100 000 parts and requires 40 shipping containers to transport.ASML is headquartered in Veldhoven  a 90-minute drive south of Amsterdam. It had €18.5 billion in revenue in 2021  and is expected to report about €21 billion for 2022. Its market valuation is about €227 billion today  placing it in the top 30 most valuable companies worldwide.How did this European company come to dominate global technology?The original work was led by Herman van Heek  a researcher at Philips Laboratories in Eindhoven in 1971. He created a prototype machine which repeatedly stepped a reverse-magnified photomask above the surface of a silicon wafer  enabling high-precision etching.However it was relatively slow  and competitive 1:1 systems (thus  without reverse-magnification) were preferred by the industry at large. A faster prototype was then developed.Philips wanted to use the technology  but thought it too expensive in low volumes. It decided to try and bring the machine to the market  but wanted a partner experienced in the global chip manufacturing industry. Many intense but fruitless discussions with various potential American partners followed.The solution was a small Dutch company just 10 minutes down the road from Eindhoven. Advanced Semiconductor Materials International (ASMI) was a distributor of various semiconductor tooling products.Extreme ultra-violetIts entrepreneurial chief executive  Arthur del Prado  was seeking partnership opportunities but it took a full year to convince the Philips board of directors. In 1984  ASML started as a joint venture between Philips and ASMI  in a temporary shed.The small company initially struggled against better-known American suppliers. Then  in 1988  a global downturn in the technology sector resulted in ASMI selling its ASML shares back to Philips. Philips was also reducing its costs and laying off staff  but Philips board member Henk Bodt nevertheless persuaded his colleagues to provide one last refinancing to ASML.Within a year  ASML produced its PAS 5500 product  groundbreaking in lithographic resolution and productivity. The company turned profitable and  in 1995  launched an IPO on the Euronext in Amsterdam and Nasdaq in New York. Philips sold half of its holding at the IPO  and the remainder of its holding over the next few years.While the first lithographic machines used visible light for etching  ultra-violet light was later adopted because it enabled finer traces on silicon. The next advance was to have been extreme ultra-violet (EUV). Because EUV is absorbed by both glass and air  any EUV machine would have to operate with a vacuum and avoid using glass lenses.It seemed impossible  and ASML competitors Canon and Nikon gave up trying. In 2018 – and after two decades of research – ASML became the sole and world leader in EUV lithography. Philips may rue its divestment: today ASML is about 15 times more valuable than Philips.What lies ahead? Last week  the New York Times noted that the US remobilisation of its domestic chip industry represents the country’s biggest investment in manufacturing since the second World War. Since the Trump and Biden administrations greatly restricted export of American high technology to China  China is scrambling to build its own indigenous chip industry. ASML is in a highly significant global position and its continuing R&D may well advance its leadership position.,neutral,0.12,0.87,0.0,mixed,0.2,0.09,0.72,True,English,"['global tech industry', 'Dutch company', 'little', 'survival', 'large domestic fuel tank', 'top 30 most valuable companies', 'Advanced Semiconductor Materials International', 'various potential American partners', 'Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography', 'various semiconductor tooling products', 'global chip manufacturing industry', 'major chip-manufacturing companies', 'domestic chip industry', 'upside down microscope', 'Herman van Heek', 'Arthur del Prado', 'one last refinancing', 'single A16 chip', 'resulting tiny image', 'first lithographic machines', 'Apple A16 processor', 'New York Times', 'small Dutch company', 'worldwide technology industry', 'glass stencil mask', 'Philips board member', 'American suppliers', 'global technology', 'global downturn', 'single grain', 'small company', 'EUV lithography', 'lithographic equipment', 'tiny dimensions', 'lithographic resolution', 'Yuichi Yamazaki', 'technology company', 'other company', 'light-sensitive polymer', 'mask shadow', 'multiple masks', 'miniscule dimensions', 'human hair', 'Pro” models', 'South Korea', 'high-end products', '40 shipping containers', 'European company', 'original work', 'reverse-magnified photomask', 'competitive 1:1 systems', 'faster prototype', 'low volumes', 'Many intense', 'fruitless discussions', 'Extreme ultra-violet', 'chief executive', 'partnership opportunities', 'joint venture', 'temporary shed', 'technology sector', 'Henk Bodt', 'PAS 5500 product', 'finer traces', 'US remobilisation', 'sole supplier', 'prototype machine', 'intricate patterns', 'four-nanometre patterns', 'silicon wafer', '16 billion transistors', 'market valuation', 'high-precision etching', 'full year', 'visible light', 'ultra-violet light', 'next advance', 'glass lenses', 'two decades', 'world leader', 'Philips Laboratories', 'ASML shares', 'EUV machine', 'ASML competitors', 'transistor patterns', 'Photograph', 'couple', 'Google', 'Amazon', 'Microsoft', 'alternatives', 'surface', 'series', 'Regions', 'READ', '0.06mm', 'diameter', 'heart', 'iPhones', 'sand', '2,000 litres', 'size', 'TSMC', 'Taiwan', 'Samsung', 'Intel', 'USA', '100,000 parts', 'Veldhoven', 'Amsterdam', 'revenue', 'researcher', 'Eindhoven', 'reverse-magnification', 'road', 'ASMI', 'distributor', 'directors', 'known', 'costs', 'staff', 'colleagues', 'productivity', 'IPO', 'Euronext', 'Nasdaq', 'half', 'holding', 'remainder', 'years', 'vacuum', 'Canon', 'Nikon', 'divestment']",2023-01-12,2023-01-13,irishtimes.com

The goal of this program is to develop a vision of a startup ecosystem which creates value for its clients  the startups themselves  and Wavestone's employees. Today  Shake'Up has formed a community of nearly 45 startups  and 150 employees of the firm are invested in their development. Thanks to the success of the project appeals that allowed us to welcome the likes of Yuka  Phoenix Mobility  Isahit  Olvid  and Hackuity  Shake'Up launches its 5th project call this year.For this new edition  and in accordance with its commitment to responsible consulting  the firm wants to focus on the theme of Sustainability. Thus  the most promising startup will be offered tailor-made and personalized support.Call for projects 2023: encouraging startups committed to four key dimensions of sustainable developmentShake'Up's 2023 project call aims at promoting the theme of sustainability under four precise aspects: the circularity of the consumer goods  the energy efficiency of the buildings  responsible mobility and responsible digital practices.Wavestone works with start-ups which have already defined their business model and which wish to be accompanied in their development thanks to the triple business  technological and sustainable development expertise of the team. Start-ups will also benefit from business connections with Wavestone's clients. The winning companies of this project call will be accompanied by Shake'up for one year. They will be welcomed in the offices of the firm if necessary and will benefit from coaching on their global strategy (business model  value proposition  technological contribution  etc.) They will also be able to benefit from the entire international network of Wavestone offices.For Eva Rosilio  Manager of Shake'Up  ""This 2023 edition  dedicated to sustainable development  required serious preparation. Indeed  we have put everything in place to reorient our objectives and act for a better future  following the commitments taken by the Wavestone firm. We want to discover and select the best innovations and boost them freely with all the skills and assets we have within the firm"".Applications opened on Monday  November 7  a few days before the start of COP 27. Startups will have had several weeks to apply by providing information needed to understand their model and value proposition.After the first selection made by the Shake'Up team  the companies that stand out during this first phase will then be invited to pitch their projects on March 30  2023  in Wavestone's offices in La Défense. The jury will be composed of Wavestone experts  partners of the firm and journalists who follow the start-up market:Cédric BAECHER  Partner Sustainability at WavestoneServane METZGER  Deputy Director of Public Affairs at France DigitaleWadie MAANINOU  Co-founder of TOLVCarine KRAUS  Director of Engagement at CarrefourEtienne PORTAIS  journalist and co-founder of MaddynessCharlie PERREAU  Head of Service at Echos StartThe award ceremony will be followed by a cocktail event.For Wadie Maaninou  CEO of TOLV (ex-Phoenix Mobility)  ""Being incubated by Shake'Up helped us a lot on the technical and the methodological side of things  as well as helping with our business plan where we had real contacts thanks to Wavestone. We are consequently very happy to be part of the jury for the next projects dedicated to the topic of sustainability  which is really close to our heart "".The selection process is based on 3 main steps:Until January 18th: constitution of a file to be uploaded on the Forinov platformconstitution of a file to be uploaded on the Forinov platform Until March 17 : evaluation and pre-selection of five propositions by the members of Shake'Up.: evaluation and pre-selection of five propositions by the members of Shake'Up. March 30th: pitch of the pre-selected start-ups and prize-giving ceremony in Wavestone's offices in La Défense.About Shake'UpThrough Shake'up  Wavestone's ambition is to contribute to the development of young businesses  while leaving them entirely independent.

Titled  ""The Road Map Towards a Transformational Well-Being Culture""  the research report is part of Accor's ongoing and insightful Health to Wealth series  designed to explore the world's state of well-being and the defining issues of our time. Health to Wealth has already released an illuminating 12-episode podcast featuring leading thinkers as well as an entrepreneurial wellness start-up challenge in Paris in collaboration with VivaTech.""Accor is seeking to drive transformational change  supporting a shift toward the emergence of a well-being economy  with an earnest desire to help people  businesses  and communities achieve their priorities for alignment and prosperity "" said Emlyn Brown  Global Vice President  Well-Being  Accor. ""The Health to Wealth white paper demonstrates that well-being must be recognized as an imperative for all if we are to maintain the equilibrium of our lives  our society  and our planet.""The white paper highlights eight key pathways for businesses  governments and organizations to consider as they plot their own roadmaps toward a culture of well-being  enabling them to thrive in the future economy. These findings draw on the rich body of insights shared by the speakers in the Health to Wealth podcast series. Key pathways to progress include:Well-being is body and mind – The link between mental and physical well-being has been widely documented and these learnings are yielding innovative neuroscientific technology with psychological and physiological benefits.Measurement can optimize well-being – Governments  health organizations  and corporations are called upon to collect more comprehensive and meaningful health data – and act on it to improve the numbers.Our well-being starts with our finances – With a longer-term goal to achieve a more equal distribution of wealth  it is essential to help people manage money and financial stress  while offering affordable well-being solutions.Access to well-being needs to be fully democratic – Well-being must be inclusive  available  accessible  and achievable for everyone  regardless of wealth  gender  race  nationality  sexuality  or ability.Joined-up thinking is required – As organizations  corporations  and nations connect their ideas and actions to a wider eco-system  the improving health of their populations leads to richer  more robust economies.Technology must become a positive force – Empowering individuals to have control over their data  privacy  and safety  while improving the quality of data that is shared  collected  and used  is a positive force for change.Our own well-being is entwined with our planet – How we use the world's precious resources is critical to a sense of well-being in the world  ensuring our air  food and water supplies are safe  nourishing  and sustainable.Well-being transcends cultural differences – The desire to be well is a universal aspiration and essential to being human; if recognized as a cornerstone of public policy  it can be the engine that transforms the world.Like the the Health to Wealth podcast series  the white paper was curated by Well Intelligence  in partnership with Accor. Well Intelligence is a UK-based international business advisory group that champions the relevance and cultural lifeblood brought on by investments in well-being  guiding corporations in their quest to establish impactful well-being programs  fitter workforces  and healthier communities.To read and download ""The Road Map Towards a Transformational Well-Being Culture"" in full  please click hereABOUT ACCORAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

Product …,"CrayoNano AS (NOTC:CNANO) issues the following operational update prior to its fourth quarter and full year results for the period ending 31 December 2022  which are scheduled to be announced on 16 February 2023.Product UpdatesOn 6 October 2022  CrayoNano launched the CrayoLED™ H-Series (CLH-N3S)  an ultraviolet-C light emitting diode (UV-C LED) semiconductor packaged component. CrayoLED's quality-driven design meets the high standards for reliability and performance in the fast-growing disinfection and sanitization markets.The CrayoLED™ H-series is optimized for disinfection at a typical peak wavelength of 275 nm. Its small package footprint (3.5mm x 3.5mm) and high-power performance easily integrates into systems for residential  municipal  industrial and commercial segments  enabling system miniaturization and longer lasting solutions.Preliminary results of the CrayoLED™ CLH-N3S H-Series UV-C LED Room Temperature Operating Life (RTOL) test also conducted by an independent  accredited third-party testing and qualification expert company was released and made available to customers for reducing the customer design-in timeline and accelerating time to revenues.The lifetime tests aim to demonstrate the quality and reliability of the CrayoLED™ and generate data for our customers design-in support and facilitating a reduced design-in time.Market and CustomersIn the short period of time since product launch on October 6  CrayoNano has reached out to more than 100 customers for the CrayoLED H-series. We have registered 140 new customer leads and have shipped product samples to 40 customers - working directly with a smaller number of customers for their design-in execution. This is in line with our controlled market entry plan - although exceeding internal expectations on the number of customer engagements for the initial phase.Our customers cover European  US  Canadian and some Southeast Asian markets  spanning a wide range of application areas - with the majority of the customer applications in the water disinfection market - both Point of Use and Point of Entry applications.CrayoNano is expecting the average design-in cycle of customers to be 6 to 12 months  depending on the start of production as well as their requirements for internal characterization and qualification.OperationsAs previously communicated  CrayoNano has signed the first frame order for manufacturing of the CrayoLED H-series product to cover the initial ramp-up plan and has spent the majority of Q3-22 and Q4-22 to successfully qualify and improve the manufacturing to acceptable final yields of the CrayoLED H-series product. A high final yield is required to build a sustainable business line and allow the company to ramp-up production throughout 2023  preparing for high-volume manufacturing in 2024.The initial inventory of products in our Norway warehouse supports fulfillment of initial pilot customer orders as well as sampling products to customers in support of their design-in and qualification process.The CrayoNano Taiwan warehouse is expected to be operational in Q1-23  ready to fulfill the majority of volume for our global customer base.In the CrayoNano Taiwan branch 'CrayoNano Fab2' - the CrayoNano clean-room was installed  tested  and commissioned during Q4-22. The build and commissioning of the clean-room was on-budget  and the internal wafer manufacturing capacity will support the company's transition from a fab-less to a fab-lite model.Financial UpdateAs announced in August 2022  CrayoNano has signed an agreement with DNB Markets and SpareBank1 Markets as finance advisors to the company and has decided to move forward with a targeted private placement of total NOK 200 million. The company has signed a term sheet with the European Innovation Council (EIC) for an investment of EUR 5m  subject to certain term and conditions  and has received significant interest from both existing shareholders and new investors to participate in the capital increase. The term sheet with the EIC Fund has been extended to March 31st  2023.On 12 January 2023  CrayoNano signed a loan agreement with its three largest shareholders of total NOK 27.5 million. Provided that the private placement is successful  the full loan amount will be converted into equity at equal terms.For more information  please contact:CEO Jo UthusMail: investor@crayonano.comPhone: +47 72 90 98 60About CrayoNanoFounded in 2012  CrayoNano develops and manufactures nanomaterials-based semiconductor components using proprietary technologies.

A recent peer-reviewed paper published in Nature Communications  entitled ""Electronic photoreceptors enable prosthetic visual acuity matching the natural resolution in rats""  outlined results from the testing of the new implant in rats  which demonstrated:A high-resolution prosthetic vision based on a novel design of a photovoltaic array  where field confinement is achieved by dynamic current steeringComputational modeling of the field confinement in such an optically controlled circuit validated by in vitro and in vivo measurementsThe grating acuity in vivo with 40mm pixels matches the pixel pitch  while with 20mm pixels it reaches the 28mm limit of the natural visual resolution in ratsCustomized field shaping adapting to individual retinal thickness and distance from the implant  paving the way to higher acuity of prosthetic vision in AMD patientsThese results pave the way to prosthetic vision with acuity exceeding 20/100  over five times higher than the current best prosthetic acuity  and with electronic magnification  it may reach 20/20.The full paper is available online here.""Our new second generation PRIMA implant represents a huge leap forward in prosthetic vision and offers a real chance to restore sight close to natural vision in patients blinded by retinal degeneration "" said Lloyd Diamond  Chief Executive Officer of Pixium Vision. ""Working closely with our partners at Stanford University  we have leveraged the design of our existing PRIMA system  which is already the most advanced prosthetic currently in use in clinical trials. By redesigning the electric circuitry and exponentially increasing the number of electrodes in the new implant  we have achieved selective stimulation of the inner retinal neurons with five times the resolution of our current implant. With this level of visual acuity  we expect to be able to restore vision in those affected by dry AMD to the extent where they can not only read comfortably but also recognize faces  which would be an unprecedented achievement in treating blindness in these patients.""These next generation implants are now being optimized for clinical trials  which could be initiated within the next couple of years. They are based on the design of the original PRIMA implants  which were also co-developed by Pixium Vision and Stanford University. Two additional peer-reviewed papers recently published in the Journal of Neural Engineering describe how the number of pixels and the resolution of the photovoltaic retinal implants could be increased using the original (bipolar) PRIMA pixels and the novel (monopolar) pixel design in human patients.""Pixel size limit of the PRIMA implants: from humans to rodents and back"" outlines how an increase in the width of the PRIMA implant from 2 to 3 mm and a reduction in the pixel size from 100 to 75mm would nearly quadrupole the number of pixels  which would be very beneficial for patients by increasing their field of view.The full paper is available online here.""Photovoltaic implant simulator reveals resolution limits in subretinal prosthesis"" demonstrated that by utilizing monopolar pixels as both anodes and cathodes to suppress crosstalk  most patients may achieve resolution no worse than 48mm. Closer proximity between the electrodes and the inner nuclear layer enhances the stimulus strength and contrast and may enable 24mm resolution with 20mm pixels  at least in some patients. A resolution of 24mm on the retina corresponds to 5 times higher acuity than the clinical average with the current implant  promising a significant improvement of central vision for many AMD patients.The full paper is available online here.""We are very pleased with the current clinical results and with the progress we are making with Pixium Vision in the development of the next generation of PRIMA implants  described in these three peer-reviewed papers "" said Professor Daniel Palanker from the Department of Ophthalmology at Stanford University and senior author of the Nature Communications and Journal of Neural Engineering papers. ""The new implants are showing great potential in providing much higher resolution  as well as adjustable field confinement in the retina  which can be optimized for every patient. We are looking forward to investigating these implants in clinical settings  and hope that they will alleviate the visual impairment in many AMD patients.""About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy. Pixium Vision’s bionic vision systems are associated with a surgical intervention and a rehabilitation period.

A recent peer-reviewed paper published in Nature Communications  entitled ""Electronic photoreceptors enable prosthetic visual acuity matching the natural resolution in rats""  outlined results from the testing of the new implant in rats  which demonstrated:A high-resolution prosthetic vision based on a novel design of a photovoltaic array  where field confinement is achieved by dynamic current steeringComputational modeling of the field confinement in such an optically controlled circuit validated by in vitro and in vivo measurementsThe grating acuity in vivo with 40mm pixels matches the pixel pitch  while with 20mm pixels it reaches the 28mm limit of the natural visual resolution in ratsCustomized field shaping adapting to individual retinal thickness and distance from the implant  paving the way to higher acuity of prosthetic vision in AMD patientsThese results pave the way to prosthetic vision with acuity exceeding 20/100  over five times higher than the current best prosthetic acuity  and with electronic magnification  it may reach 20/20.The full paper is available online here.""Our new second generation PRIMA implant represents a huge leap forward in prosthetic vision and offers a real chance to restore sight close to natural vision in patients blinded by retinal degeneration "" said Lloyd Diamond  Chief Executive Officer of Pixium Vision. ""Working closely with our partners at Stanford University  we have leveraged the design of our existing PRIMA system  which is already the most advanced prosthetic currently in use in clinical trials. By redesigning the electric circuitry and exponentially increasing the number of electrodes in the new implant  we have achieved selective stimulation of the inner retinal neurons with five times the resolution of our current implant. With this level of visual acuity  we expect to be able to restore vision in those affected by dry AMD to the extent where they can not only read comfortably but also recognize faces  which would be an unprecedented achievement in treating blindness in these patients.""These next generation implants are now being optimized for clinical trials  which could be initiated within the next couple of years. They are based on the design of the original PRIMA implants  which were also co-developed by Pixium Vision and Stanford University. Two additional peer-reviewed papers recently published in the Journal of Neural Engineering describe how the number of pixels and the resolution of the photovoltaic retinal implants could be increased using the original (bipolar) PRIMA pixels and the novel (monopolar) pixel design in human patients.""Pixel size limit of the PRIMA implants: from humans to rodents and back"" outlines how an increase in the width of the PRIMA implant from 2 to 3 mm and a reduction in the pixel size from 100 to 75mm would nearly quadrupole the number of pixels  which would be very beneficial for patients by increasing their field of view.The full paper is available online here.""Photovoltaic implant simulator reveals resolution limits in subretinal prosthesis"" demonstrated that by utilizing monopolar pixels as both anodes and cathodes to suppress crosstalk  most patients may achieve resolution no worse than 48mm. Closer proximity between the electrodes and the inner nuclear layer enhances the stimulus strength and contrast and may enable 24mm resolution with 20mm pixels  at least in some patients. A resolution of 24mm on the retina corresponds to 5 times higher acuity than the clinical average with the current implant  promising a significant improvement of central vision for many AMD patients.The full paper is available online here.""We are very pleased with the current clinical results and with the progress we are making with Pixium Vision in the development of the next generation of PRIMA implants  described in these three peer-reviewed papers "" said Professor Daniel Palanker from the Department of Ophthalmology at Stanford University and senior author of the Nature Communications and Journal of Neural Engineering papers. ""The new implants are showing great potential in providing much higher resolution  as well as adjustable field confinement in the retina  which can be optimized for every patient. We are looking forward to investigating these implants in clinical settings  and hope that they will alleviate the visual impairment in many AMD patients.""About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy. Pixium Vision’s bionic vision systems are associated with a surgical intervention and a rehabilitation period.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYAfter a very strong performance in November (+6.3%)  December was slightly down with -1%  including the January dividend payment for which the record date was set in December.Although CLO debt performed relatively well  Volta suffered from the underperformance of the USD against the Euro as well as slightly negative performances in December on Volta non-CLO exposures.Volta’s underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** were as follow: -0.3% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +0.5% for CLO Equity tranches  +1.3% for CLO Debt tranches; and -3.6% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (which represent circa 2.3% of the fund’s NAV).December usually is a relatively quiet month in terms of CLO Equity distributions. Over the month  Volta received the equivalent of €0.3m of interests and coupons. Over the usual 6-month-basis time frame Volta received €22.5m of interests and coupons  ie. a 21.1% annualized cash flow to NAV.We purchased two European CLO Equity positions from the secondary market in December for a total nominal amount of €2.5m  at an average purchase price of 59.75%. The projected yield of said purchases is - under reasonable assumptions regarding future underlying losses - in the 22% context.Fundamentals-wise  December saw significantly more downgrades than upgrades especially in the US Loan market. Even though we are still waiting for December trustee reports  expectations are that CCC/Caa1 loan buckets increased on average by 1.5 to 2% in the US through the course of the month.In terms of default rates  we now have the full list of defaults for 2022. Default rates were still very low  at 0.4% for European Loans and 0.7% for US loans. After the invasion of Ukraine  rating agencies were forecasting 2022 default rates to reach between 2% and 2.5% for the US and European loan markets… We closed the year far from those levels.As we regularly highlight in this report  the main reason for such low default rates is the benefit of inflation  despite the economic slowdown. When companies’ revenues are growing fast  even if said companies suffer from margins pressure  profits and EBITDA still manage to grow (at a lower pace than revenues but they still do grow on average).When considering rating agencies and most banks’ research  default rates are expected to reach 3.5% to 5.5% for 2023. Our default rates view for 2023 still lands in the 3% area for both US and European Loans as we still believe that debt erosion (thanks to inflation) and significant increase in revenues will help avoiding some defaults ; despite the fact that margins are already under pressure and that they should remain under pressure for a few more quarters. Since the vast majority of loans are covenant lite  the deterioration of interest coverage ratios - while being a source of stress - do not mechanically lead to a default. It is the level of EBITDA and where rates will be when companies need to refinance their debt that will really matter. We do not see many companies that have to refinance in 2023.Such kind of default pattern should not materially impact the distribution of interests of Volta’s assets in the near term. We believe that we can maintain a high level of coupons in the coming quarters and are actively looking to seize investment opportunities with the extra cash that is being generated.As at the end of December 2022  Volta’s NAV was €213.5m or €5.84 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 6.6% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 1.3% as at 30 November 2022  4.7% was at 30 October 2022  0.6% was at 30 September 2022.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

The infectious disease specialist company  which has reported recent breakthroughs in treatments for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza  is already listed on London’s AIM.But Nasdaq is the world’s premier listing venue for technology and life sciences stocks  and offers access to a broader range of investors and deeper pools of capital  said Mr Friel.Poolbeg Pharma is the third life sciences company to come out of Raglan Capital. The first  Amryt Pharma  was launched in 2014 out of a reverse takeover of oil and gas explorer Fastnet.The transaction gave Amryt an immediate listing on Euronext Dublin and AIM. The company debuted on the Nasdaq in July 2020  when it raised $20m in fresh equity  going on to complete two major acquisitions before selling to Chiesi.Poolbeg appears to be on a similar timeline  having been spun out of Raglan’s Open Orphan (now called HVivo) in early 2021 before listing on AIM that summer.Some of Amryt’s original group of investors are understood to have funded Poolbeg on similar terms and stand to make another killing if Mr Friel pulls off another $1bn deal.A small group of Amryt backers are set to get up to €525 000 each for committing $150 000 to convertible loan notes when the company was first getting off the ground.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.06,0.94,True,English,"['Poolbeg Pharma', 'Nasdaq listing', '$1bn sale', 'bid', 'infectious disease specialist company', 'three-to-five year life cycle', 'third life sciences company', 'life sciences stocks', 'large trade buyer', 'house pharmaceutical companies', 'deep-pocketed industry buyers', 'respiratory syncytial virus', 'two major acquisitions', 'convertible loan notes', 'premier listing venue', 'Nasdaq-listed Raglan project', 'chairman Cathal Friel', 'Big Pharma buyer', 'initial public offering', 'Raglan Capital investors', 'immediate listing', 'Mr Friel', 'New York', '$1bn exit', 'potential move', '1.4bn) sale', 'billion valuation', 'eight years', 'public markets', 'underperforming assets', 'asset-acquiring phase', 'recent breakthroughs', 'broader range', 'deeper pools', 'reverse takeover', 'gas explorer', 'Euronext Dublin', 'fresh equity', 'similar timeline', 'Open Orphan', 'original group', 'similar terms', 'small group', 'early investors', 'Poolbeg Pharma', 'Amryt Pharma', '$1bn deal', 'Amryt backers', 'discussions', 'advisors', 'IPO', 'exchange', 'end', 'bid', '$1.48bn', 'Italy', 'Chiesi', 'money', 'work', 'plan', 'exercise', 'less', 'founder', 'firms', 'funds', 'things', 'treatments', 'RSV', 'influenza', 'London', 'AIM', 'world', 'technology', 'access', 'oil', 'Fastnet', 'transaction', 'July', 'killing', 'ground']",2023-01-12,2023-01-13,independent.ie
