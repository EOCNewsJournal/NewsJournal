Product …,"CrayoNano AS (NOTC:CNANO) issues the following operational update prior to its fourth quarter and full year results for the period ending 31 December 2022  which are scheduled to be announced on 16 February 2023.Product UpdatesOn 6 October 2022  CrayoNano launched the CrayoLED™ H-Series (CLH-N3S)  an ultraviolet-C light emitting diode (UV-C LED) semiconductor packaged component. CrayoLED's quality-driven design meets the high standards for reliability and performance in the fast-growing disinfection and sanitization markets.The CrayoLED™ H-series is optimized for disinfection at a typical peak wavelength of 275 nm. Its small package footprint (3.5mm x 3.5mm) and high-power performance easily integrates into systems for residential  municipal  industrial and commercial segments  enabling system miniaturization and longer lasting solutions.Preliminary results of the CrayoLED™ CLH-N3S H-Series UV-C LED Room Temperature Operating Life (RTOL) test also conducted by an independent  accredited third-party testing and qualification expert company was released and made available to customers for reducing the customer design-in timeline and accelerating time to revenues.The lifetime tests aim to demonstrate the quality and reliability of the CrayoLED™ and generate data for our customers design-in support and facilitating a reduced design-in time.Market and CustomersIn the short period of time since product launch on October 6  CrayoNano has reached out to more than 100 customers for the CrayoLED H-series. We have registered 140 new customer leads and have shipped product samples to 40 customers - working directly with a smaller number of customers for their design-in execution. This is in line with our controlled market entry plan - although exceeding internal expectations on the number of customer engagements for the initial phase.Our customers cover European  US  Canadian and some Southeast Asian markets  spanning a wide range of application areas - with the majority of the customer applications in the water disinfection market - both Point of Use and Point of Entry applications.CrayoNano is expecting the average design-in cycle of customers to be 6 to 12 months  depending on the start of production as well as their requirements for internal characterization and qualification.OperationsAs previously communicated  CrayoNano has signed the first frame order for manufacturing of the CrayoLED H-series product to cover the initial ramp-up plan and has spent the majority of Q3-22 and Q4-22 to successfully qualify and improve the manufacturing to acceptable final yields of the CrayoLED H-series product. A high final yield is required to build a sustainable business line and allow the company to ramp-up production throughout 2023  preparing for high-volume manufacturing in 2024.The initial inventory of products in our Norway warehouse supports fulfillment of initial pilot customer orders as well as sampling products to customers in support of their design-in and qualification process.The CrayoNano Taiwan warehouse is expected to be operational in Q1-23  ready to fulfill the majority of volume for our global customer base.In the CrayoNano Taiwan branch 'CrayoNano Fab2' - the CrayoNano clean-room was installed  tested  and commissioned during Q4-22. The build and commissioning of the clean-room was on-budget  and the internal wafer manufacturing capacity will support the company's transition from a fab-less to a fab-lite model.Financial UpdateAs announced in August 2022  CrayoNano has signed an agreement with DNB Markets and SpareBank1 Markets as finance advisors to the company and has decided to move forward with a targeted private placement of total NOK 200 million. The company has signed a term sheet with the European Innovation Council (EIC) for an investment of EUR 5m  subject to certain term and conditions  and has received significant interest from both existing shareholders and new investors to participate in the capital increase. The term sheet with the EIC Fund has been extended to March 31st  2023.On 12 January 2023  CrayoNano signed a loan agreement with its three largest shareholders of total NOK 27.5 million. Provided that the private placement is successful  the full loan amount will be converted into equity at equal terms.For more information  please contact:CEO Jo UthusMail: investor@crayonano.comPhone: +47 72 90 98 60About CrayoNanoFounded in 2012  CrayoNano develops and manufactures nanomaterials-based semiconductor components using proprietary technologies.

16499,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4569730-eurofins-scientific-buy-any-further-pullback,Eurofins Scientific: Buy On Any Further Pullback (OTCMKTS:ERFSF),Eurofins Scientific isn't cheap  but as the leader in many domains  it likely will never get cheap. Here's my investment thesis for Eurofins Scientific stock.,Borisenkov Andrei/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionThe last time I discussed Eurofins Scientific (OTCPK:ERFSF) (OTCPK:ERRFY)  the stock was trading at almost 700 EUR per share  67 EUR per share adjusted for the 10:1 share split which has occurred since). Back in 2020  I thought Eurofins stood to benefit from the COVID pandemic as it is one of the best regarded lab testing companies in the world and the surge in COVID tests would for sure result in an increased demand for its services. My hunch was correct as Eurofins' share price increased by in excess of 70% during 2021. Over the past decade  Eurofins saw its revenue increase much faster than any of its peers.Eurofins Investor RelationsEurofins has its primary listing on Euronext Paris where it's trading with ERF as its ticker symbol. The average daily volume in Paris is just over 430 000 shares per day. There are currently 192.7M shares outstanding  resulting in a market capitalization of approximately 12.5B EUR. Given the superior liquidity on its Paris listing  I would strongly recommend using Euronext Paris to trade in Eurofins' shares.Yahoo FinanceThe COVID windfall is over  but that doesn't mean Eurofins has no valueAs explained in my previous article  Eurofins Scientific is one of the world's largest companies providing lab testing services to several key players of the food and health industry. Eurofins is active with in excess of 900 laboratories in 54 countries and recently improved its brand recognition as one of the largest independent labs testing for COVID-19 in Belgium  the Netherlands  Germany and France. Although this does provide a nice boost in the financial results  the core expertise of Eurofins isn't just medical testing as it conducts hundreds of tests per year across all sectors.Eurofins Investor RelationsAnd on top of those 'larger' markets  Eurofins is also penetrating five specific niche markets which don't account for a large portion of the revenue yet but could become more important in the future.Eurofins Investor RelationsBetween 2019 and 2021  the company's revenue increased by approximately 50% while the adjusted EBITDA more than doubled. 2021 likely was the 'peak year' for a while for Eurofins as the 2022 EBITDA result will come in lower and as the need for COVID tests continues to decrease there will be more pressure on that front. That being said  Eurofins is very active in other sectors and the organic growth in other test work should offset the lower COVID test work volumes from 2023 on.Eurofins Investor RelationsThis doesn't mean 2022 will be bad. When the company released its H1 results  it provided an updated revenue and EBITDA guidance. The total revenue for this year is anticipated to be 6.7B EUR  of which just under 10% will be COVID related. The adjusted EBITDA should be 1.6B EUR  resulting in a free cash flow result of 900M EUR  excluding the (non-maintenance) additional investments in its facilities.Eurofins Investor RelationsThe company only publishes detailed financial statements every semester which means that we have to work with the H1 2022 financial statements and the Q3 trading update.In the first half of 2022  the company reported a total revenue of 3.4B EUR  resulting in an EBITDA of 800M EUR and an EBIT of 495M EUR. The total amount of finance costs came in at 72M EUR  resulting in a pre-tax income of 424M EUR and a net income of 308M EUR.Eurofins Investor RelationsAbout 1.7M EUR of losses were attributable to non-controlling interests  which means the net income attributable to the shareholders of Eurofins was 310M EUR  for an EPS of 1.61 EUR per share. Eurofins also has hybrid securities outstanding which are so deeply subordinated they are accounted for as equity which means the coupon payments on these hybrid securities are not reported as an interest payment but rather come out of the net income. The net income per share after taking care of those coupons was 1.55 EUR per share.As you can see on the income statement  this included about 88M EUR in exceptional items (related to integration and reorganization expenses as well as discontinued operations and other non-recurring items)  and excluding those  the underlying net income per share would have been 1.98 EUR after making the coupon payments on the hybrid securities.The cash flow statement uses the 424M EUR in pre-tax income as starting point. The reported operating cash flow was 468M EUR  but a few corrections are needed. First of all  the company made almost 180M EUR in cash tax payments although the income statement shows only 116M EUR was due for the first half of this year. This means we need to add back 64M EUR. Additionally  the operating cash flow includes a 103M EUR investment in the working capital position  but excludes the 15M EUR in interest payments  20M EUR in payments to the hybrid securityholders and the 78M EUR in lease payments.Eurofins Investor RelationsAfter taking all these adjustments into consideration  the adjusted operating cash flow generated in the first half of the year was approximately 522M EUR. The total capex was 299M EUR (including intangible assets)  resulting in an underlying adjusted free cash flow of 323M EUR.That being said  in the first half of the year  only 191M EUR of the capex was not related to the purchase and development of owned sites. And although that 191M EUR will for sure contain some growth and improvement capex  it does provide a fair representation of Eurofins' investing needs.Eurofins Investor RelationsThis also means that if we would use the 'normalized' 191M EUR capex in the first half of the year  the underlying sustaining free cash flow result was approximately 420M EUR. And as there are 192.7M shares outstanding  the underlying free cash flow per share was approximately 2.18 EUR per share.Considering the H2 EBITDA should also be roughly 800M EUR (given the full-year guidance of 1.6B EUR in EBITDA)  we can expect a similar free cash flow performance in the second half of the year. While Eurofins called a substantial portion of its hybrid capital  it also issued a new 2029 bond with a 4% coupon so although the payments on hybrid securities will decrease  the interest expenses will increase. The silver lining: those interest expenses are a cost while the payment on the hybrid securities had to be paid out from the after-tax profits.Eurofins Investor Relations Eurofins Investor RelationsInvestment thesisEurofins Scientific isn't cheap  but as the leader in many domains  it likely will never get cheap. Assuming a stable EBITDA result of 1.6B EUR and 500M EUR in depreciation and amortization expenses as well as 40M EUR in interest expenses  the pre-tax income should come in at 1.06B EUR. Applying an average tax rate of 25% means the net income will likely be somewhere around 800M EUR or just over 4 EUR Per share. The EBITDA excluding lease payments should be roughly 1.45B EUR and with a net debt position (excluding lease liabilities) of 2.1B EUR  the stock is currently trading at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 10.Am I willing to pay 16 times earnings at this point? Not immediately. But I noticed the option premiums are nice enough for me to write an out of the money put option while waiting for the share price to come down a little bit. A P52 expiring in June has an option premium of 1.70 EUR which means that - if exercised - I would be buying Eurofins at just over 12 times earnings. Looking further ahead  a P50 for September has an option premium of approximately 2.30. At 50 EUR per share  the EV/EBITDA ratio is 8 (assuming the net debt doesn't decrease any further).So rather than buying the stock right now  I will likely write an out of the money put option while waiting for the share price to come down a little bit.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
