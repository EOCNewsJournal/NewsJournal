16511,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://artlyst.com/news/deutsche-borse-photography-foundation-announce-2023-prize-and-exhibition/,Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Announce 2023 Shortlist And Exhibition,The Photographers’ Gallery London has revealed exhibition details of the 2023 edition of the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize.,The Photographers’ Gallery London has revealed exhibition details of the 2023 edition and the shortlist for the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize.The 2023 exhibition will feature work by the four international shortlisted artists: Bieke Depoorter  Samuel Fosso  Arthur Jafa and Frida Orupabo  at The Photographers’ Gallery  London  from 3 March until 11 June 2023. The exhibition will tour to the Muzeum Fotografii w Krakowie  Krakow  Poland (30 June to 17 September 2023).The winner of the £30 000 prize will be announced at a special evening award ceremony on 11 May 2023  with the other finalists each receiving £5 000.Originally established in 1996 and organised in partnership with the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation in Frankfurt/Main since 2016  this long-standing and influential annual Prize identifies and rewards artists and their projects considered to have made the most significant contribution to photography over the previous 12 months.Over its 27-year history  the Prize has become renowned as one of the most important international awards for photographers  as well as a barometer of photographic development  foregrounding outstanding  innovative and thought-provoking work. This year’s shortlisted artists all push the boundaries of photography and exemplify its resonance and relevance as a cultural force today.The complex ethical relationship and boundaries which have rarely been explored between the photographer and their subject provide the focus for Bieke Depoorter’s intense scrutiny of her relationship with her subjects. Drawing upon the West African tradition of studio portraiture  Samuel Fosso repurposes this genre through self portraiture by creating startling new identities  based on social archetypes as well as real historical figures. Drawing from a rich collection of images  film footage and music  Arthur Jafa uncompromisingly articulates Black experience  providing us with an exercise in visual literacy  confronting us with a new Black aesthetic which avoids fixed hierarchies and linear storytelling. Giving sculptural form to photo collage  Frida Orupabo reimagines the historical Black female body through her extraordinary multilayered collages and Instagram posts using material circulated online.The Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize exhibition will feature a selection of work from the nominated projects of the four 2023 shortlisted artists. Their nominated projects areBieke Depoorter – for her exhibition A Chance Encounter at C/O Berlin (30 April –7 September 2022). Top PhotoBieke Depoorter (b. 1986  Kortrijk  Belgium) blurs the traditional relationship between photographer and subject. She questions the role and responsibilities of the photographer  the possibility or impossibility of truth in representation and grapples with personal and professional boundaries. Her nominated project presents two unfolding  ongoing  bodies of work  Michael and Agata. In both  a chance encounter develops into an enduring personal relationship and  thereafter  into an interrogation of the medium. A selection of work from the Michael project will be on display at The Photographers’ Gallery.In Michael  Depoorter examines the life and the disappearance of a man she met on the streets of Portland  Oregon in 2015. Gifted three suitcases of Michael’s personal items  sketchbooks and essays  his subsequent disappearance turns Depoorter detective. Depoorter’s work documents her immersive  perhaps obsessive  quest to find Michael and to understand his life. In Agata  a first meeting in a Parisian strip-club in 2017 evolves with complex tension into an intricate  changing narrative. The project explores questions of collaboration  the limits of a creative friendship  performance  boundaries and authorship.Samuel Fosso – for his exhibition Samuel Fosso at the Maison Européenne de la Photographie  Paris  (10 November 2021 – 13 March 2022). Top PhotoSince the mid-1970s  Samuel Fosso (b. 1962  Kumba  Cameroon) has dedicated his artistic practice to self-portraits and performative photography. Fosso’s retrospective exhibition traces a career of almost 50 years  bringing together iconic series  lesser known works  archival material and previously unpublished images.Raised in Nigeria  Fosso fled the Biafran War as a young boy  and in 1972 was taken in by an uncle in Bangui in the Central African Republic. In 1975  at the age of thirteen  Fosso opened his Studio Photo Nationale. Alongside commercial work  Fosso immediately began a series of self-portraits – a mode of representation he has never abandoned. Playing the role of key historical figures and social archetypes in front of the camera  Fosso embodies a powerful way of existing in the world  and a vivid demonstration of photography’s role in the construction of myths.Arthur Jafa – for his exhibition Live Evil at Luma  Arles (14 April – 13 November 2022).Arthur Jafa (b. 1960  Tupelo  Mississippi  United States) is an artist and filmmaker. Nominated for the largest and most comprehensive exhibition of his work to date  Jafa draws upon a substantial collection of film and still images  creating visceral  dynamic films and room-sized installations. In the gallery space and on the screen  Jafa derives power from astute juxtaposition and lyrical  syncopated editing. Since the 1980s  Jafa has been accumulating and assembling pictures from books and magazines  arranging this imagery in new constellations within notebooks and latterly within dynamic artworks. For ready-made moving images  YouTube remains a favourite resource  alongside news footage and home video. By placing one resonant cultural artefact next to another Jafa references and questions the universal and specific articulations of Black experience. Eschewing a linear narrative  Jafa organises his material through formal and affective associations  linking his images through visual resemblance or thematic resonance. In this way Jafa aspires to an art that harnesses “the power  beauty  and alienation of black music.”Frida Orupabo – for her exhibition I have seen a million pictures of my face and still I have no idea  Fotomuseum Winterthur (26 February – 29 May 2022).The sculptural collages and digital works of Frida Orupabo (b. 1986  Sarpsborg  Norway) are multi-layered formations  exploring questions of race  sexuality and identity. Orupabo  a Norwegian Nigerian artist and sociologist  grounds her inquiry in her own experience of cultural belonging. Utilising visual material circulating online  spanning colonial-era photographs and ethnographic relics to contemporary imagery  Orupabo’s hand-wrought works re-arrange and re-make the archive. The resulting images take the shape of fragmented Black  mostly female-bodied  figures. These figures  first dislocated  are reassembled layer by layer in a complex and poetic manoeuvre that simultaneously denounces one-dimensional depictions of Black lives. Her collaged cut-outs hold our gaze and invite various readings of the stories and lives of the people depicted  many of whom are entirely absent from the archives. In this way Orupabo invites a consideration of how photography significantly contributes to the formation and perpetuation of colonial power relations and violence.A fully illustrated catalogue with newly commissioned essays on the shortlisted artists and their nominated projects will be on sale in The Photographers’ Gallery shop and online. Writer and curator Awa Konaté  founder of the interdisciplinary research platform Culture Art Society  writes on the work of Frida Orupabo. Gideon Jacobs  writer  artist and former Creative Director of Magnum Photos  writes on Bieke Depoorter. Curator and cultural historian Mark Sealy  Director of Autograph APB  explores the work of Samuel Fosso. New York-based American DJ  writer and interdisciplinary artist Jace Clayton considers Arthur Jafa’s work.A programme of talks and events will take place during the exhibition about the artists and their work. On 1 February  ‘On Photography’ – an online roundtable talk – will explore the role of photography and the most urgent issues facing photographers today.Read MoreVisitRelated Posts[jetpack-related-posts],neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.35,0.21,0.44,True,English,"['Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation', '2023 Shortlist', 'Exhibition', 'The Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize exhibition', 'Maison Européenne de la Photographie', 'Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize', 'special evening award ceremony', 'two unfolding, ongoing, bodies', 'historical Black female body', 'The Photographers’ Gallery London', 'four international shortlisted artists', 'influential annual Prize', 'important international awards', 'real historical figures', 'key historical figures', 'four 2023 shortlisted artists', 'Muzeum Fotografii w', 'West African tradition', 'startling new identities', 'new Black aesthetic', 'extraordinary multilayered collages', 'intricate, changing narrative', 'lesser known works', 'Central African Republic', 'A Chance Encounter', 'complex ethical relationship', 'enduring personal relationship', 'performative photography', 'Black experience', 'complex tension', 'traditional relationship', 'exhibition details', 'retrospective exhibition', 'comprehensive exhibition', 'Frida Orupabo', 'other finalists', 'significant contribution', 'previous 12 months', '27-year history', 'photographic development', 'cultural force', 'intense scrutiny', 'self portraiture', 'social archetypes', 'rich collection', 'film footage', 'visual literacy', 'fixed hierarchies', 'linear storytelling', 'sculptural form', 'photo collage', 'Instagram posts', 'C/O Berlin', 'Top Photo', 'three suitcases', 'personal items', 'first meeting', 'Parisian strip-club', 'creative friendship', 'artistic practice', 'Biafran War', 'young boy', 'Photo Nationale', 'powerful way', 'vivid demonstration', 'United States', 'Arthur Jafa', '£30,000 prize', 'Bieke Depoorter', 'Depoorter detective', 'Samuel Fosso', 'studio portraiture', 'subsequent disappearance', 'iconic series', 'unpublished images', 'nominated projects', 'thought-provoking work', 'professional boundaries', 'commercial work', 'Michael project', '2023 exhibition', '2023 edition', '3 March', '11 June', 'Krakowie', 'Poland', '17 September', 'winner', '11 May', 'partnership', 'Frankfurt/Main', 'long-standing', 'barometer', 'innovative', 'resonance', 'relevance', 'subject', 'focus', 'genre', 'music', 'exercise', 'material', 'selection', 'Kortrijk', 'Belgium', 'role', 'possibility', 'truth', 'representation', 'Agata', 'medium', 'display', 'life', 'man', 'streets', 'Portland', 'Oregon', 'sketchbooks', 'essays', 'quest', 'collaboration', 'limits', 'authorship', 'mid-1970s', 'Kumba', 'Cameroon', 'self-portraits', 'career', '50 years', 'Nigeria', 'uncle', 'Bangui', 'mode', 'front', 'camera', 'world', 'construction', 'myths', 'Luma', 'Arles', 'April', '13 November', 'Tupelo', 'Mississippi', 'filmmaker', 'largest', 'date']",2023-01-16,2023-01-16,artlyst.com

16513,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/veon-ceo-letter-2023-noteholders-063000785.html,VEON CEO letter to 2023 Noteholders,Amsterdam  16 January 2023 – VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online...,VEON Ltd.Amsterdam  16 January 2023 – VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  has today contacted holders (the “2023 Noteholders”) of interests in the 5.95% notes due February 2023 and the 7.25% notes due April 2023 (together  the “2023 Notes”) issued by VEON Holdings BV (“VEON Holdings”) in relation to the English Scheme of Arrangement (the “Scheme”) that aims to extend the maturities of the 2023 Notes by eight months from their respective maturity dates.In the letter  VEON’s Chief Executive Officer Kaan Terzioğlu requested the assistance and cooperation of 2023 Noteholders in connection with the Scheme  and specifically requested them to vote in favour of the Scheme at the forthcoming scheme meeting taking place on 24 January 2023. The deadline by which 2023 Noteholders must submit their Voting and Proxy Forms (or  if the 2023 Noteholder holds their 2023 Notes through DTC  procure that their DTC participant submits on their behalf) is 5.00 p.m. (London time) on 20 January 2023. The letter further explained:“We understand the significance of what we are asking and take our obligations to our stakeholders  including the repayment of our debts in full and on time  very seriously.However  despite strong operational results and a strong balance sheet  given the current circumstances  we must consider the repayment of the 2023 Notes within the context of our future debt obligations beyond 2023 and the difficulties VEON currently faces in raising debt or equity on the international capital markets on commercially acceptable terms. It is this which has led us to take the decision to launch the Scheme  as we believe it would provide the best route to us repaying you in advance of VEON Holdings’ other future debt obligations.Your support and the resultant implementation of the proposal set out in the Scheme will enable us to avoid the near-term inefficient use of cash that would result from a significant portion of the principal repayment (relating to 2023 Notes held via the Russian National Settlement Depository (“NSD”)) being trapped in international clearing systems (with no clear prospect of such monies being returned to VEON). VEON and its legal advisors have spent significant time and efforts exploring potential options to avoid having cash trapped in the international clearing systems  but at present there does not appear to be a clearly viable path to avoid this unattractive outcome. At a time that  due to Russian Decree 430  the Group potentially can no longer rely on payments to the international clearing systems effectively being recognised by its Russian noteholders as a full discharge of the underlying liability  the proposed maturity extension will provide additional time for the impact of Decree 430 on VimpelCom and the Group (as set out in the Scheme documentation) to become clearer and for the Group to mitigate  where possible  the associated risk of double payments. The Scheme proposal would also provide time to progress our asset monetization strategy anchored by the sale of our Russian business (the “VimpelCom Disposal”)  as announced on 24 November 2022. We believe that the VimpelCom Disposal represents the single-most material deleveraging action available to VEON Holdings and increases the prospects of VEON regaining access to the international capital markets  and thereby refinancing its indebtedness  on commercially acceptable terms.Story continuesAs set out more fully in the Scheme documents  in return for granting us with a modest extension  we have sought to compensate the 2023 Noteholders with the benefit of an amendment fee and a put right. As announced on 11 January 2023  the Company has further amended the terms of the proposal set out in the Scheme and entered into undertakings to vote in favour of the Scheme with certain 2023 Noteholders holding approximately 10.4% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes. Each of these amendments improves the terms of the proposal for the benefit of the 2023 Noteholders.If the Scheme fails  the directors of VEON Holdings will need to continue to assess the Company’s solvency and liquidity position up to the original maturity date of the February 2023 Notes. Whilst VEON Holdings will have sufficient cash to pay the 2023 Notes on their original maturity dates  we cannot exclude the possibility that the directors may determine that the best action for VEON Holdings to take is not to pay on maturity while the double-payment risk continues. We consider that  by providing further runway to allow the sale of VimpelCom to complete  the Scheme will greatly reduce the risks of non-payment and impact on our stakeholders.We are pleased that good progress has already been made in respect of the implementation of the Scheme (and strive to continue this progress). In particular  on 26 December  we announced that VEON Holdings was granted an OFAC License (if you would like to see a copy of the OFAC License  you can request a copy by email to bonds@veon.com). Following receipt of this license  VEON Holdings believes that no further licenses are required in order to permit eligible noteholders to vote on the Scheme. In addition  we are in active dialogue with the Netherlands Ministry of Finance and the UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation in respect of the licenses we have sought from those regulators  which will be required to implement the amendments contemplated by the Scheme.Therefore in consideration of the steps taken above  we request your support and encourage you to vote in favour of the Scheme at the forthcoming scheme meeting. By doing so  you will provide us with crucial time to mitigate the risks of trapped cash and potential double-payment and to undertake the VimpelCom Disposal and our wider asset monetization programme  thus allowing VEON to deleverage and provide the best-available route for the repayment of your notes.For all relevant information in relation to the Scheme please visit https://is.kroll.com/veon  and any further questions on the voting process can be addressed to Kroll Issuer Services Limited (as the Company’s information agent) by email to veon@is.kroll.com or by telephone on + 44 20 7704 0880.Finally  we acknowledge the questions which have been raised by several of you to us and to our advisors and hope that we have been able to address them. However should you have any questions on the Scheme  other topics covered in this letter  or other matters related to VEON Group  please contact bonds@veon.com .Thank you for your continued trust in and support of our company.”DisclaimerThis press release contains “forward-looking statements”  as the phrase is defined in Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933  as amended  and Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934  as amended.

The studies were conducted by Innate and Sanofi and published in Nature Biotechnology on January 12  2023.The study shows that expression of CD64 on AML blasts confers resistance to anti-CD123 antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and redirecting NK cells against cancer targets through binding to CD16a and NKp46 circumvents this resistance. Moreover  through their binding to NKp46  CD123-NKCE specifically target NK cells and has potent antitumor activity against primary AML blasts; it induces NK cell activation and cytokine secretion only in the presence of AML cells. In vivo  its antitumor activity in a mouse tumor model exceeds that of the comparator anti-CD123 antibody. The efficacy of CD123-NKCE in vitro in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in vivo in nonhuman primates was associated with the induction of low pro-inflammatory cytokine release and no signs of toxicity.These results support clinical development of CD123-NKCE. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial by Sanofi is ongoing  evaluating IPH6101/SAR’579 (SAR443579)  the first NKp46/CD16-based CD123-targeted ANKETTM NK cell engager  in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS).Eric Vivier  DVM  PhD  Chief Scientific Officer of Innate Pharma:“The activity  safety  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data provided here demonstrate the superiority of CD123-NKCEs over comparator cytotoxic antibodies in terms of antitumor activity  and their favorable safety profiles relative to T cell therapies for the treatment of AML. IPH6101/SAR’579 is a multi-specific NKCE targeting CD123 currently in a Phase 1 trial in AML sponsored by Sanofi. At Innate Pharma  we are developing a broad portfolio of NK Cell Engager programs via our proprietary platform ANKETTM that can address different types of cancer.”Valeria Fantin  Ph.D.  Global Head of Oncology Research at Sanofi:“At Sanofi  we are building a diverse oncology portfolio including next-generation NK-based assets and bringing new approaches to fighting cancer. We're pleased with our productive collaboration with Innate Pharma  and data like this reinforce our confidence in proceeding to clinical evaluation of this novel NK cell engager.""About ANKETTMANKETTM (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics) is Innate's proprietary platform for developing next-generation  multi-specific natural killer (NK) cell engagers to treat certain types of cancer.This versatile  fit-for-purpose technology is creating an entirely new class of molecules to induce synthetic immunity against cancer.

In November 2021  Euronext announced its ambition to internalise the clearing activity of its cash and derivatives flows  today operated by third-party providers. As a result Euronext Clearing will become Euronext’s clearing house (“CCP”) of choice for cash equity1  listed derivatives and commodities markets.Combined with the successful migration of its Core Data Centre in June 2022 from Basildon (United Kingdom) to Bergamo (Italy) and the planned migration of the Borsa Italiana capital markets to Optiq®  Euronext’s proprietary trading platform  the expansion of Euronext Clearing will allow Euronext to manage the entire trading value chain of its markets by the end of 2024. Euronext will directly operate clearing activities for its cash  listed derivatives and commodities markets  and create value through a harmonised clearing framework across Euronext venues. It will provide one single platform for clients to access information on collateral  risk  and clearing. Euronext Clearing will bring margin efficiencies to clients with the implementation of a new Value-at-Risk methodology  offering the financial ecosystem with increasingly efficient and resilient solutions for risk capture and allocation within the system. This move will also bring efficiencies across all asset classes  with transparency on data  particularly on settlement  leveraging Euronext Securities to access the Target-2-Securities (T2S) settlement platform. Euronext Clearing will allow Euronext to significantly increase its footprint in the post-trade space and align strategic priorities between trading and clearing. Euronext will be in an ideal position to innovate and improve time-to-market  notably on derivatives products  to serve the evolving needs of its clients.Positioning of Euronext Clearing as the CCP of choice across its cash equity markets1As announced on 3 November 2022  Euronext confirms the first phase of the expansion of Euronext Clearing with the expected positioning of Euronext Clearing as the Euronext CCP of choice for its cash equity markets1 by the end of Q4 2023. Euronext will continue to offer an open access CCP model for cash equity clearing.Migration2 of Euronext listed derivatives and commodities markets to Euronext Clearing expected in Q3 2024Euronext confirms it expects to migrate the listed financial derivatives and commodities markets of Euronext Amsterdam  Euronext Brussels  Euronext Lisbon  Oslo Børs and Euronext Paris from LCH SA to Euronext Clearing by Q3 2024. As a reminder  Euronext Clearing already clears Euronext Milan listed derivatives.The migration of Euronext listed derivatives and commodities markets is the final step of the European expansion of Euronext Clearing set up as part of Euronext ‘Growth for Impact 2024’ strategic plan. It will unlock innovation capabilities  notably on derivatives products. Furthermore  the migration will maximise value extraction through a harmonised clearing framework across Euronext venues and deliver on the announced targeted run-rate annual synergies for 2024.Euronext and LCH SA are committed to working together to ensure an orderly migration of clearing flows from LCH SA to Euronext Clearing.Notification of early termination of the derivatives clearing agreement (the “Agreement”) with LCH SAAs Euronext Clearing undertakes derivatives clearing services in Europe  Euronext has decided to terminate the existing Agreement with LCH SA  under the terms of the Agreement.

16525,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/guerbet-2023-strategic-priorities-174000731.html,Guerbet: 2023 Strategic Priorities,2023 Strategic Priorities Diagnostic Imaging: increase EluciremTM sales and strengthen international positionsInterventional Imaging: prioritise Lipiodol...,GUERBET2023 Strategic PrioritiesDiagnostic Imaging : increase Elucirem TM sales and strengthen international positionsInterventional Imaging : prioritise Lipiodol sales with the development of innovative indicationsArtificial Intelligence: execution of the roadmap for the emergence of a major AI player dedicated to medical imaging in oncologyVillepinte  16 January 2023: Guerbet (FR0000032526 GBT)  a global specialist in contrast agents and solutions for medical imaging has announced its strategic priorities for 2023 in a complex international environment characterised by persistent inflationary pressures and the revelation of new business opportunities for products listed in developing markets.For several quarters  the Group has operated in an environment marked by a favorable trend in the contrast agent market  where structural volume growth seems to be accompanied by positive price effects over time  particularly in the face of difficult purchasing conditions (notably for iodine).In this demanding yet promising context  Guerbet intends to capitalise on its core target activities and established positions  allocate its resources to developing recognised products adapted to the immediate needs of professionals  and mobilising its teams around three main ambitions:Diagnostic Imaging: strategic reinforcementIn this market where Guerbet generates nearly 90% of its revenue  2023 will mark an important milestone with the market release in the United States of the first batches of the brand new EluciremTM  which is attracting strong interest from the scientific community and ordering parties. In Europe  the European Medicines Agency (EMA) review is expected in the second half of the year. In addition to ElucirmTM  the Group intends to strengthen its solid positions in diagnostic imaging (world’s number 2 in the MRI  number 4 in X-Rays) by supporting customer needs as close as possible with its comprehensive  interconnected offering  including contrast agents  injection systems  and digital solutions.Story continuesInterventional Imaging: resources allocated to the growth of established productsCommercial development and expansion of applications of LipiodolEstablished for 40 years as a standard in the treatment of liver cancer  Lipiodol also has a strong foothold in other areas – including vascular embolization  lymphography  and hysterosalpingography (HSG) – which now account for a significant portion of sales volumes and future growth. The potential for development of new innovative indications appears to be significant  particularly in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders  venous diseases  and post-surgery and cancer disorders. Research and development efforts will thus be accelerated in order to explore new applications for Lipiodol.Microcatheter activity divestment planIn connection with the evolution of its strategy aimed at leveraging key assets  Guerbet is planning the gradual divestment of its microcatheter activities historically housed within Accurate Medical Therapeutics. Since its acquisition in 2018  the microcatheters portfolio has been significantly expanded  now containing 38 references across the two SeQure® and DraKon™ microcatheter ranges for peripheral embolization procedures. This activity has is not significant revenue contributor at the Group level and currently requires specialised  reinforced sales teams and significant investments to achieve its full commercial potential. These necessities are no longer in line with the Group’s development strategy.Guerbet also plans to divest the Occlugel technology acquired in 2018  including several ranges of microspheres for use in embolization.Artificial Intelligence: acceleration of the roadmapFollowing the termination of its collaboration with Merative (formerly IBM Watson Health) announced in October 2022  Guerbet has regained all the necessary latitude to roll out the commercial strategy while maintaining full ownership of the developed assets (application software source codes and algorithms) and their intellectual property. Very promising results were already obtained in 2022 in the detection of liver damage and prostate cancer. The commercial development of the solutions will benefit from the licensing agreement expected to be signed in the first half of 2023 with Intrasense following Guerbet’s acquisition of a stake in the company announced on 11 January. Guerbet ultimately aims to enable the development of a major player in artificial intelligence applied to medical imaging in oncology.Upcoming events:Publication of 2022 full-year revenueFebruary 9  2023  after tradingAbout GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

16532,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://fortune.com/recommends/article/what-is-the-new-york-stock-exchange/,What is the New York Stock Exchange?,The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is the world’s largest stock exchange.,This article was originally published on Bankrate.com.The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is the world’s largest stock exchange. It’s headquartered on 11 Wall Street and 18 Broad Street in New York City and is arguably the world’s most famous and recognizable stock exchange. Established in 1792  the organization became a publicly-traded company in 2006; from 1971 until 2006  it was a not-for-profit corporation.What is a stock exchange?A stock exchange is where shares of publicly-traded companies are bought and sold. While at one time  the trading floor at the NYSE was one of the busiest — imagine scurrying stockbrokers  yelling and hundreds of phones — trading action has moved primarily online. That said  the iconic image of someone ringing the opening and closing bells still remains one of the hallmarks of the NYSE.NYSE trading hoursThe core trading session runs from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern time  Monday through Friday. The pre-opening session starts at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.NYSE holidaysThe stock exchange is closed on a number of federal holidays — but not all. Here are the NYSE days off:New Year’s DayMartin Luther King  Jr. DayWashington’s BirthdayGood FridayMemorial DayJuneteenthIndependence DayLabor DayThanksgiving DayChristmas DayHistory of the New York Stock ExchangeIn New York City on May 17  1792  two dozen stock brokers and merchants signed the “Buttonwood Agreement ” supposedly named for the type of tree under which the earliest transactions took place. The short document outlined the basic rules for trading securities  such as commissions  hours and a non-compete agreement among the brokers. The agreement was in response to the financial panic in March and April of the same year.Trading was informal at first  and took place primarily in nearby coffeehouses. In 1817  however  the organization adopted a constitution and created the New York Stock & Exchange Board. It later adopted the name we know today. In 1865 the New York Stock Exchange moved to Broad Street  where it’s still partially located  although it has expanded in the interim years.The stock ticker debuted in 1867  and in 1878  telephones were installed on the trading floor. The exchange continued to change and grow  and in 1903 moved into its current building  designed by George B. Post. The Classical Revival building  complete with columns and portico  is a National Historic Landmark and a popular tourist attraction. It was also the first place in North America to be air-conditioned. Computers were first introduced in the 1960s to help process data.While technology and online trading have played major roles in the NYSE for decades  it wasn’t until the COVID-19 pandemic that the exchange moved purely to electronic trading and operated without a trading floor. It didn’t last long  however. After closing in March 2020  the floor reopened in late May.Who owns the NYSE?In 2013  Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE: ICE) acquired the NYSE and remains the parent organization. ICE is an American company that was founded in 2000.Over its 200-year existence  the NYSE has acquired and merged with various companies  including the American Stock Exchange.What is the oldest stock exchange?There’s debate over the origin of the first stock exchange. Some scholars point to the founding of the Dutch East India Company in 1602 as the start of easily transferable shares. By 1680  the public engaged in transactions you’d recognize today  such as futures and options trading. The company eventually became the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. After a merger with a few other exchanges in 2000  it became Euronext.Another contender is the Frankfurt Stock Exchange  also known as Borse Frankfurt. The exchange claims it was established in 1585. At a city fair that year  merchants met to establish uniform exchange rates. Additionally  the Frankfurt Stock Exchange traces its roots back to medieval fairs in the 11th and 12th centuries that hosted commercial and monetary transactions  eventually leading to Frankfurt becoming a banking and trading hub in the early 1500s.What is the largest stock exchange?The NYSE is the largest equities-based exchange in the world by market capitalization. As of late 2022  Nasdaq and the Shanghai Stock Exchange are the second and third largest  respectively.NYSE vs. NasdaqTo start  Nasdaq is much younger than the NYSE. Founded in 1971  it was the world’s first electronic stock market. More importantly  Nasdaq doesn’t have a trading floor  unlike the NYSE. Instead  all trades are electronic and its physical location in Times Square  MarketSite  is a broadcast studio. Nasdaq has lower listing fees and minimum earning requirements than the NYSE  which makes it more accessible to smaller companies.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  has today contacted holders (the “2023 Noteholders”) of interests in the 5.95% notes due February 2023 and the 7.25% notes due April 2023 (together  the “2023 Notes”) issued by VEON Holdings BV (“VEON Holdings”) in relation to the English Scheme of Arrangement (the “Scheme”) that aims to extend the maturities of the 2023 Notes by eight months from their respective maturity dates.In the letter  VEON’s Chief Executive Officer Kaan Terzioğlu requested the assistance and cooperation of 2023 Noteholders in connection with the Scheme  and specifically requested them to vote in favour of the Scheme at the forthcoming scheme meeting taking place on 24 January 2023. The deadline by which 2023 Noteholders must submit their Voting and Proxy Forms (or  if the 2023 Noteholder holds their 2023 Notes through DTC  procure that their DTC participant submits on their behalf) is 5.00 p.m. (London time) on 20 January 2023. The letter further explained:“We understand the significance of what we are asking and take our obligations to our stakeholders  including the repayment of our debts in full and on time  very seriously.However  despite strong operational results and a strong balance sheet  given the current circumstances  we must consider the repayment of the 2023 Notes within the context of our future debt obligations beyond 2023 and the difficulties VEON currently faces in raising debt or equity on the international capital markets on commercially acceptable terms. It is this which has led us to take the decision to launch the Scheme  as we believe it would provide the best route to us repaying you in advance of VEON Holdings’ other future debt obligations.Your support and the resultant implementation of the proposal set out in the Scheme will enable us to avoid the near-term inefficient use of cash that would result from a significant portion of the principal repayment (relating to 2023 Notes held via the Russian National Settlement Depository (“NSD”)) being trapped in international clearing systems (with no clear prospect of such monies being returned to VEON). VEON and its legal advisors have spent significant time and efforts exploring potential options to avoid having cash trapped in the international clearing systems  but at present there does not appear to be a clearly viable path to avoid this unattractive outcome. At a time that  due to Russian Decree 430  the Group potentially can no longer rely on payments to the international clearing systems effectively being recognised by its Russian noteholders as a full discharge of the underlying liability  the proposed maturity extension will provide additional time for the impact of Decree 430 on VimpelCom and the Group (as set out in the Scheme documentation) to become clearer and for the Group to mitigate  where possible  the associated risk of double payments. The Scheme proposal would also provide time to progress our asset monetization strategy anchored by the sale of our Russian business (the “VimpelCom Disposal”)  as announced on 24 November 2022. We believe that the VimpelCom Disposal represents the single-most material deleveraging action available to VEON Holdings and increases the prospects of VEON regaining access to the international capital markets  and thereby refinancing its indebtedness  on commercially acceptable terms.As set out more fully in the Scheme documents  in return for granting us with a modest extension  we have sought to compensate the 2023 Noteholders with the benefit of an amendment fee and a put right. As announced on 11 January 2023  the Company has further amended the terms of the proposal set out in the Scheme and entered into undertakings to vote in favour of the Scheme with certain 2023 Noteholders holding approximately 10.4% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes. Each of these amendments improves the terms of the proposal for the benefit of the 2023 Noteholders.If the Scheme fails  the directors of VEON Holdings will need to continue to assess the Company’s solvency and liquidity position up to the original maturity date of the February 2023 Notes. Whilst VEON Holdings will have sufficient cash to pay the 2023 Notes on their original maturity dates  we cannot exclude the possibility that the directors may determine that the best action for VEON Holdings to take is not to pay on maturity while the double-payment risk continues. We consider that  by providing further runway to allow the sale of VimpelCom to complete  the Scheme will greatly reduce the risks of non-payment and impact on our stakeholders.We are pleased that good progress has already been made in respect of the implementation of the Scheme (and strive to continue this progress). In particular  on 26 December  we announced that VEON Holdings was granted an OFAC License (if you would like to see a copy of the OFAC License  you can request a copy by email to bonds@veon.com). Following receipt of this license  VEON Holdings believes that no further licenses are required in order to permit eligible noteholders to vote on the Scheme. In addition  we are in active dialogue with the Netherlands Ministry of Finance and the UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation in respect of the licenses we have sought from those regulators  which will be required to implement the amendments contemplated by the Scheme.Therefore in consideration of the steps taken above  we request your support and encourage you to vote in favour of the Scheme at the forthcoming scheme meeting. By doing so  you will provide us with crucial time to mitigate the risks of trapped cash and potential double-payment and to undertake the VimpelCom Disposal and our wider asset monetization programme  thus allowing VEON to deleverage and provide the best-available route for the repayment of your notes.For all relevant information in relation to the Scheme please visit https://is.kroll.com/veon  and any further questions on the voting process can be addressed to Kroll Issuer Services Limited (as the Company’s information agent) by email to veon@is.kroll.com or by telephone on + 44 20 7704 0880.Finally  we acknowledge the questions which have been raised by several of you to us and to our advisors and hope that we have been able to address them. However should you have any questions on the Scheme  other topics covered in this letter  or other matters related to VEON Group  please contact bonds@veon.com .Thank you for your continued trust in and support of our company.”DisclaimerThis press release contains “forward-looking statements”  as the phrase is defined in Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933  as amended  and Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934  as amended.

SiC power semiconductors can be used in producing a strong as well as a very hard material. SiC power semiconductors can be implemented in various sectors such as telecommunication  energy and power  automotive  renewable power generation  and in different other areas. They are basically considered due to higher maximum thermal conductive properties that have widened the area of application. SiC power semiconductors are devices that are considered high-frequency power devices that are majorly applicable in wireless communications. SiC semiconductor offers ten times the dielectric breakdown field strength  three times the thermal conductivity  and three times the bandgap as compared to a silicon semiconductor. The SiC semiconductor has taken over the market because of its high performance and efficiency. The SiC power semiconductor offers to work at high voltage and current and offers low on-resistance in addition to being efficient at high temperatures. The combination of silicon carbide has thus proved to be a better and optimum choice of semiconductor.Market DriversAdvent Of SiC Power SemiconductorsThere are very useful properties of SiC as a semiconductor material. In applications such as inverters  motor drives  and battery chargers  silicon carbide (SiC) devices offer many advantages  such as improved power density  reduced cooling requirements  and reduced overall system cost. These advantages are enough to make SiC power semiconductors at the high efficient stage.The energy lost by SiC during the reverse recovery phase is only 1% of the energy lost by silicon which creates a huge difference in the efficiency of the material. The virtual absence of a tail current allows a faster turn–off  and it makes lower losses. Since there is less energy to dissipate  a SiC device able to switch at higher frequencies and improve efficiency. The more efficient  small size  and lower weight of SiC as compared to other materials can create a higher-rated solution or a smaller design with reduced cooling requirements. Thus  the advent of SiC power semiconductors is a major factor expected to drive the growth of the Global SiC power semiconductor market.Rising Penetration of Electronic VehiclesThe world is changing so fast  and it is turning towards renewable energy.

In Europe  the European Medicines Agency (EMA) review is expected in the second half of the year. In addition to ElucirmTM  the Group intends to strengthen its solid positions in diagnostic imaging (world’s number 2 in the MRI  number 4 in X-Rays) by supporting customer needs as close as possible with its comprehensive  interconnected offering  including contrast agents  injection systems  and digital solutions.Interventional Imaging: resources allocated to the growth of established productsCommercial development and expansion of applications of LipiodolEstablished for 40 years as a standard in the treatment of liver cancer  Lipiodol also has a strong foothold in other areas – including vascular embolization  lymphography  and hysterosalpingography (HSG) – which now account for a significant portion of sales volumes and future growth. The potential for development of new innovative indications appears to be significant  particularly in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders  venous diseases  and post-surgery and cancer disorders. Research and development efforts will thus be accelerated in order to explore new applications for Lipiodol.Microcatheter activity divestment planIn connection with the evolution of its strategy aimed at leveraging key assets  Guerbet is planning the gradual divestment of its microcatheter activities historically housed within Accurate Medical Therapeutics. Since its acquisition in 2018  the microcatheters portfolio has been significantly expanded  now containing 38 references across the two SeQure® and DraKon™ microcatheter ranges for peripheral embolization procedures. This activity has is not significant revenue contributor at the Group level and currently requires specialised  reinforced sales teams and significant investments to achieve its full commercial potential. These necessities are no longer in line with the Group’s development strategy.Guerbet also plans to divest the Occlugel technology acquired in 2018  including several ranges of microspheres for use in embolization.Artificial Intelligence: acceleration of the roadmapFollowing the termination of its collaboration with Merative (formerly IBM Watson Health) announced in October 2022  Guerbet has regained all the necessary latitude to roll out the commercial strategy while maintaining full ownership of the developed assets (application software source codes and algorithms) and their intellectual property. Very promising results were already obtained in 2022 in the detection of liver damage and prostate cancer. The commercial development of the solutions will benefit from the licensing agreement expected to be signed in the first half of 2023 with Intrasense following Guerbet’s acquisition of a stake in the company announced on 11 January. Guerbet ultimately aims to enable the development of a major player in artificial intelligence applied to medical imaging in oncology.Upcoming events:Publication of 2022 full-year revenueFebruary 9  2023  after tradingAbout GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

In Europe  the European Medicines Agency (EMA) review is expected in the second half of the year. In addition to ElucirmTM  the Group intends to strengthen its solid positions in diagnostic imaging (world’s number 2 in the MRI  number 4 in X-Rays) by supporting customer needs as close as possible with its comprehensive  interconnected offering  including contrast agents  injection systems  and digital solutions.Interventional Imaging: resources allocated to the growth of established productsCommercial development and expansion of applications of LipiodolEstablished for 40 years as a standard in the treatment of liver cancer  Lipiodol also has a strong foothold in other areas – including vascular embolization  lymphography  and hysterosalpingography (HSG) – which now account for a significant portion of sales volumes and future growth. The potential for development of new innovative indications appears to be significant  particularly in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders  venous diseases  and post-surgery and cancer disorders. Research and development efforts will thus be accelerated in order to explore new applications for Lipiodol.Microcatheter activity divestment planIn connection with the evolution of its strategy aimed at leveraging key assets  Guerbet is planning the gradual divestment of its microcatheter activities historically housed within Accurate Medical Therapeutics. Since its acquisition in 2018  the microcatheters portfolio has been significantly expanded  now containing 38 references across the two SeQure® and DraKon™ microcatheter ranges for peripheral embolization procedures. This activity has is not significant revenue contributor at the Group level and currently requires specialised  reinforced sales teams and significant investments to achieve its full commercial potential. These necessities are no longer in line with the Group’s development strategy.Guerbet also plans to divest the Occlugel technology acquired in 2018  including several ranges of microspheres for use in embolization.Artificial Intelligence: acceleration of the roadmapFollowing the termination of its collaboration with Merative (formerly IBM Watson Health) announced in October 2022  Guerbet has regained all the necessary latitude to roll out the commercial strategy while maintaining full ownership of the developed assets (application software source codes and algorithms) and their intellectual property. Very promising results were already obtained in 2022 in the detection of liver damage and prostate cancer. The commercial development of the solutions will benefit from the licensing agreement expected to be signed in the first half of 2023 with Intrasense following Guerbet’s acquisition of a stake in the company announced on 11 January. Guerbet ultimately aims to enable the development of a major player in artificial intelligence applied to medical imaging in oncology.Upcoming events:Publication of 2022 full-year revenueFebruary 9  2023  after tradingAbout GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

SiC power semiconductors can be used in producing a strong as well as a very hard material. SiC power semiconductors can be implemented in various sectors such as telecommunication  energy and power  automotive  renewable power generation  and in different other areas. They are basically considered due to higher maximum thermal conductive properties that have widened the area of application. SiC power semiconductors are devices that are considered high-frequency power devices that are majorly applicable in wireless communications. SiC semiconductor offers ten times the dielectric breakdown field strength  three times the thermal conductivity  and three times the bandgap as compared to a silicon semiconductor. The SiC semiconductor has taken over the market because of its high performance and efficiency. The SiC power semiconductor offers to work at high voltage and current and offers low on-resistance in addition to being efficient at high temperatures. The combination of silicon carbide has thus proved to be a better and optimum choice of semiconductor.Market DriversAdvent Of SiC Power SemiconductorsThere are very useful properties of SiC as a semiconductor material. In applications such as inverters  motor drives  and battery chargers  silicon carbide (SiC) devices offer many advantages  such as improved power density  reduced cooling requirements  and reduced overall system cost. These advantages are enough to make SiC power semiconductors at the high efficient stage.The energy lost by SiC during the reverse recovery phase is only 1% of the energy lost by silicon which creates a huge difference in the efficiency of the material. The virtual absence of a tail current allows a faster turn–off  and it makes lower losses. Since there is less energy to dissipate  a SiC device able to switch at higher frequencies and improve efficiency. The more efficient  small size  and lower weight of SiC as compared to other materials can create a higher-rated solution or a smaller design with reduced cooling requirements. Thus  the advent of SiC power semiconductors is a major factor expected to drive the growth of the Global SiC power semiconductor market.Rising Penetration of Electronic VehiclesThe world is changing so fast  and it is turning towards renewable energy. All sectors  market players  and government institutes are making more focus to build electric vehicle infrastructure and generate more demand for electric vehicles.As per the information from International Energy Agency (IEA)  16.5 million electric cars were on the road in 2021  a tripling in just three years  and this is a big number as compared to 2020. Electric car sales increased and doubled in China  continued to increase in Europe  and picked up in the U.S. in 2021. This data shows that there is a tremendous increase in the penetration of EVs in the market  which may positively affect the environment as well as the Global SiC power semiconductor market. SiC is highly efficient at high voltages  enabling fast battery charging times that are comparable to filling the tank of conventional vehicles. Silicon carbide power electronics are enabling a surge in 800-volt drive systems  paving the way for lighter EVs with greater range.Some of the major players operating in the SiC Power Semiconductor market are:WOLFSPEED  INC.

SiC power semiconductors can be used in producing a strong as well as a very hard material. SiC power semiconductors can be implemented in various sectors such as telecommunication  energy and power  automotive  renewable power generation  and in different other areas. They are basically considered due to higher maximum thermal conductive properties that have widened the area of application. SiC power semiconductors are devices that are considered high-frequency power devices that are majorly applicable in wireless communications. SiC semiconductor offers ten times the dielectric breakdown field strength  three times the thermal conductivity  and three times the bandgap as compared to a silicon semiconductor. The SiC semiconductor has taken over the market because of its high performance and efficiency. The SiC power semiconductor offers to work at high voltage and current and offers low on-resistance in addition to being efficient at high temperatures. The combination of silicon carbide has thus proved to be a better and optimum choice of semiconductor.Market DriversAdvent Of SiC Power SemiconductorsThere are very useful properties of SiC as a semiconductor material. In applications such as inverters  motor drives  and battery chargers  silicon carbide (SiC) devices offer many advantages  such as improved power density  reduced cooling requirements  and reduced overall system cost. These advantages are enough to make SiC power semiconductors at the high efficient stage.The energy lost by SiC during the reverse recovery phase is only 1% of the energy lost by silicon which creates a huge difference in the efficiency of the material. The virtual absence of a tail current allows a faster turn–off  and it makes lower losses. Since there is less energy to dissipate  a SiC device able to switch at higher frequencies and improve efficiency. The more efficient  small size  and lower weight of SiC as compared to other materials can create a higher-rated solution or a smaller design with reduced cooling requirements. Thus  the advent of SiC power semiconductors is a major factor expected to drive the growth of the Global SiC power semiconductor market.Rising Penetration of Electronic VehiclesThe world is changing so fast  and it is turning towards renewable energy. All sectors  market players  and government institutes are making more focus to build electric vehicle infrastructure and generate more demand for electric vehicles.As per the information from International Energy Agency (IEA)  16.5 million electric cars were on the road in 2021  a tripling in just three years  and this is a big number as compared to 2020. Electric car sales increased and doubled in China  continued to increase in Europe  and picked up in the U.S. in 2021. This data shows that there is a tremendous increase in the penetration of EVs in the market  which may positively affect the environment as well as the Global SiC power semiconductor market.

In November 2021  Euronext announced its ambition to internalise the clearing activity of its cash and derivatives flows  today operated by third-party providers. As a result Euronext Clearing will become Euronext’s clearing house (“CCP”) of choice for cash equity1  listed derivatives and commodities markets.Combined with the successful migration of its Core Data Centre in June 2022 from Basildon (United Kingdom) to Bergamo (Italy) and the planned migration of the Borsa Italiana capital markets to Optiq®  Euronext’s proprietary trading platform  the expansion of Euronext Clearing will allow Euronext to manage the entire trading value chain of its markets by the end of 2024. Euronext will directly operate clearing activities for its cash  listed derivatives and commodities markets  and create value through a harmonised clearing framework across Euronext venues. It will provide one single platform for clients to access information on collateral  risk  and clearing. Euronext Clearing will bring margin efficiencies to clients with the implementation of a new Value-at-Risk methodology  offering the financial ecosystem with increasingly efficient and resilient solutions for risk capture and allocation within the system. This move will also bring efficiencies across all asset classes  with transparency on data  particularly on settlement  leveraging Euronext Securities to access the Target-2-Securities (T2S) settlement platform. Euronext Clearing will allow Euronext to significantly increase its footprint in the post-trade space and align strategic priorities between trading and clearing. Euronext will be in an ideal position to innovate and improve time-to-market  notably on derivatives products  to serve the evolving needs of its clients.Story continuesPositioning of Euronext Clearing as the CCP of choice across its cash equity markets1As announced on 3 November 2022  Euronext confirms the first phase of the expansion of Euronext Clearing with the expected positioning of Euronext Clearing as the Euronext CCP of choice for its cash equity markets1 by the end of Q4 2023. Euronext will continue to offer an open access CCP model for cash equity clearing.Migration2 of Euronext listed derivatives and commodities markets to Euronext Clearing expected in Q3 2024Euronext confirms it expects to migrate the listed financial derivatives and commodities markets of Euronext Amsterdam  Euronext Brussels  Euronext Lisbon  Oslo Børs and Euronext Paris from LCH SA to Euronext Clearing by Q3 2024. As a reminder  Euronext Clearing already clears Euronext Milan listed derivatives.The migration of Euronext listed derivatives and commodities markets is the final step of the European expansion of Euronext Clearing set up as part of Euronext ‘Growth for Impact 2024’ strategic plan. It will unlock innovation capabilities  notably on derivatives products. Furthermore  the migration will maximise value extraction through a harmonised clearing framework across Euronext venues and deliver on the announced targeted run-rate annual synergies for 2024.Euronext and LCH SA are committed to working together to ensure an orderly migration of clearing flows from LCH SA to Euronext Clearing.Notification of early termination of the derivatives clearing agreement (the “Agreement”) with LCH SAAs Euronext Clearing undertakes derivatives clearing services in Europe  Euronext has decided to terminate the existing Agreement with LCH SA  under the terms of the Agreement. Therefore  on 16 January 2023  Euronext served LCH SA notice of termination for the purposes of the Agreement.As set up in the Agreement  Euronext will pay a termination fee of approximately €36.03 million toLCH SA  to be provisioned in its income statement as non-underlying expenses in Q1 2023  and payable in 2024. It is reminded that this amount is included in the €150 million of implementation costs related to the ‘Growth for Impact 2024’ strategic plan and already announced in November 2021.Following the notification of the early termination of the Agreement  LCH Group has the option to buy back Euronext's 11.1% stake in LCH SA. Further communications on the stake owned by Euronext in LCH SA will be made when appropriate.The termination of the Agreement does not impact the existing clearing agreement signed between MTS S.p.A and LCH SA nor the existing agreement related to the interoperability link on Italian Government Bonds between Euronext Clearing and LCH SA4.Stéphane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:“We are pleased to announce that the migration of Euronext derivatives clearing activities to Euronext Clearing is planned for Q3 2024  a few months after the migration of Euronext cash clearing activities. Combined with the successful migration of the Core Data Centre to Bergamo in June 2022 and the planned migration of the Borsa Italiana capital markets to Optiq® in 2023  the expansion of our clearing activities is a major step towards the delivery our “Growth for Impact 2024” strategic plan. This will significantly contribute to achieve the €100 million 2024 targeted run-rate annual synergies related to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition.Euronext has profoundly transformed itself over the past five years and is uniquely positioned to become the leading European market infrastructure. Euronext is now the leading listing venue and the largest liquidity pool in Europe  thanks to its single trading platform. The expansion of Euronext Clearing to Euronext markets is another significant transformational milestone  allowing Euronext to manage the entire trading value chain  and become a major player in the post-trade space.We look forward to completing these strategic milestones in the coming months. I would like to thank all the Euronext teams that have already been working on these key projects for more than a year and that will be critical to the delivery of these projects. I would like to thank LCH SA for the great collaboration during the past years.”CONTACT ANALYSTS & INVESTORS – ir@euronext.com Aurélie Cohen +33 1 70 48 24 27 ir@euronext.com Clément Kubiak +33 1 70 48 26 33 ir@euronext.comCONTACTS MEDIA – mediateam@euronext.com Aurélie Cohen (Europe) +33 1 70 48 24 45 parispressoffice@euronext.com Marianne Aalders (Amsterdam) +31 20 721 41 33 maalders@euronext.com Pascal Brabant (Brussels) +32 2 620 15 50 pbrabant@euronext.com Sandra Machado (Lisbon) +351 210 600 614 smachado@euronext.com Andrea Monzani (Europe/Milan/Rome) +39 02 72 42 62 13 Italypressoffice@euronext.com Cathrine Lorvik Segerlund (Oslo) +47 41 69 59 10 clsegerlund@euronext.com Sarah Mound (Paris/Dublin) +33 1 70 48 24 45 parispressoffice@euronext.comAbout EuronextEuronext is the leading pan-European market infrastructure  connecting European economies to global capital markets  to accelerate innovation and sustainable growth.
