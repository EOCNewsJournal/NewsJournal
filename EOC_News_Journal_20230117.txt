16513,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/veon-ceo-letter-2023-noteholders-063000785.html,VEON CEO letter to 2023 Noteholders,Amsterdam  16 January 2023 – VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online...,VEON Ltd.Amsterdam  16 January 2023 – VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  has today contacted holders (the “2023 Noteholders”) of interests in the 5.95% notes due February 2023 and the 7.25% notes due April 2023 (together  the “2023 Notes”) issued by VEON Holdings BV (“VEON Holdings”) in relation to the English Scheme of Arrangement (the “Scheme”) that aims to extend the maturities of the 2023 Notes by eight months from their respective maturity dates.In the letter  VEON’s Chief Executive Officer Kaan Terzioğlu requested the assistance and cooperation of 2023 Noteholders in connection with the Scheme  and specifically requested them to vote in favour of the Scheme at the forthcoming scheme meeting taking place on 24 January 2023. The deadline by which 2023 Noteholders must submit their Voting and Proxy Forms (or  if the 2023 Noteholder holds their 2023 Notes through DTC  procure that their DTC participant submits on their behalf) is 5.00 p.m. (London time) on 20 January 2023. The letter further explained:“We understand the significance of what we are asking and take our obligations to our stakeholders  including the repayment of our debts in full and on time  very seriously.However  despite strong operational results and a strong balance sheet  given the current circumstances  we must consider the repayment of the 2023 Notes within the context of our future debt obligations beyond 2023 and the difficulties VEON currently faces in raising debt or equity on the international capital markets on commercially acceptable terms. It is this which has led us to take the decision to launch the Scheme  as we believe it would provide the best route to us repaying you in advance of VEON Holdings’ other future debt obligations.Your support and the resultant implementation of the proposal set out in the Scheme will enable us to avoid the near-term inefficient use of cash that would result from a significant portion of the principal repayment (relating to 2023 Notes held via the Russian National Settlement Depository (“NSD”)) being trapped in international clearing systems (with no clear prospect of such monies being returned to VEON). VEON and its legal advisors have spent significant time and efforts exploring potential options to avoid having cash trapped in the international clearing systems  but at present there does not appear to be a clearly viable path to avoid this unattractive outcome. At a time that  due to Russian Decree 430  the Group potentially can no longer rely on payments to the international clearing systems effectively being recognised by its Russian noteholders as a full discharge of the underlying liability  the proposed maturity extension will provide additional time for the impact of Decree 430 on VimpelCom and the Group (as set out in the Scheme documentation) to become clearer and for the Group to mitigate  where possible  the associated risk of double payments. The Scheme proposal would also provide time to progress our asset monetization strategy anchored by the sale of our Russian business (the “VimpelCom Disposal”)  as announced on 24 November 2022. We believe that the VimpelCom Disposal represents the single-most material deleveraging action available to VEON Holdings and increases the prospects of VEON regaining access to the international capital markets  and thereby refinancing its indebtedness  on commercially acceptable terms.Story continuesAs set out more fully in the Scheme documents  in return for granting us with a modest extension  we have sought to compensate the 2023 Noteholders with the benefit of an amendment fee and a put right. As announced on 11 January 2023  the Company has further amended the terms of the proposal set out in the Scheme and entered into undertakings to vote in favour of the Scheme with certain 2023 Noteholders holding approximately 10.4% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes. Each of these amendments improves the terms of the proposal for the benefit of the 2023 Noteholders.If the Scheme fails  the directors of VEON Holdings will need to continue to assess the Company’s solvency and liquidity position up to the original maturity date of the February 2023 Notes. Whilst VEON Holdings will have sufficient cash to pay the 2023 Notes on their original maturity dates  we cannot exclude the possibility that the directors may determine that the best action for VEON Holdings to take is not to pay on maturity while the double-payment risk continues. We consider that  by providing further runway to allow the sale of VimpelCom to complete  the Scheme will greatly reduce the risks of non-payment and impact on our stakeholders.We are pleased that good progress has already been made in respect of the implementation of the Scheme (and strive to continue this progress). In particular  on 26 December  we announced that VEON Holdings was granted an OFAC License (if you would like to see a copy of the OFAC License  you can request a copy by email to bonds@veon.com). Following receipt of this license  VEON Holdings believes that no further licenses are required in order to permit eligible noteholders to vote on the Scheme. In addition  we are in active dialogue with the Netherlands Ministry of Finance and the UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation in respect of the licenses we have sought from those regulators  which will be required to implement the amendments contemplated by the Scheme.Therefore in consideration of the steps taken above  we request your support and encourage you to vote in favour of the Scheme at the forthcoming scheme meeting. By doing so  you will provide us with crucial time to mitigate the risks of trapped cash and potential double-payment and to undertake the VimpelCom Disposal and our wider asset monetization programme  thus allowing VEON to deleverage and provide the best-available route for the repayment of your notes.For all relevant information in relation to the Scheme please visit https://is.kroll.com/veon  and any further questions on the voting process can be addressed to Kroll Issuer Services Limited (as the Company’s information agent) by email to veon@is.kroll.com or by telephone on + 44 20 7704 0880.Finally  we acknowledge the questions which have been raised by several of you to us and to our advisors and hope that we have been able to address them. However should you have any questions on the Scheme  other topics covered in this letter  or other matters related to VEON Group  please contact bonds@veon.com .Thank you for your continued trust in and support of our company.”DisclaimerThis press release contains “forward-looking statements”  as the phrase is defined in Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933  as amended  and Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934  as amended.

The studies were conducted by Innate and Sanofi and published in Nature Biotechnology on January 12  2023.The study shows that expression of CD64 on AML blasts confers resistance to anti-CD123 antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and redirecting NK cells against cancer targets through binding to CD16a and NKp46 circumvents this resistance. Moreover  through their binding to NKp46  CD123-NKCE specifically target NK cells and has potent antitumor activity against primary AML blasts; it induces NK cell activation and cytokine secretion only in the presence of AML cells. In vivo  its antitumor activity in a mouse tumor model exceeds that of the comparator anti-CD123 antibody. The efficacy of CD123-NKCE in vitro in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in vivo in nonhuman primates was associated with the induction of low pro-inflammatory cytokine release and no signs of toxicity.These results support clinical development of CD123-NKCE. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial by Sanofi is ongoing  evaluating IPH6101/SAR’579 (SAR443579)  the first NKp46/CD16-based CD123-targeted ANKETTM NK cell engager  in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS).Eric Vivier  DVM  PhD  Chief Scientific Officer of Innate Pharma:“The activity  safety  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data provided here demonstrate the superiority of CD123-NKCEs over comparator cytotoxic antibodies in terms of antitumor activity  and their favorable safety profiles relative to T cell therapies for the treatment of AML. IPH6101/SAR’579 is a multi-specific NKCE targeting CD123 currently in a Phase 1 trial in AML sponsored by Sanofi. At Innate Pharma  we are developing a broad portfolio of NK Cell Engager programs via our proprietary platform ANKETTM that can address different types of cancer.”Valeria Fantin  Ph.D.  Global Head of Oncology Research at Sanofi:“At Sanofi  we are building a diverse oncology portfolio including next-generation NK-based assets and bringing new approaches to fighting cancer. We're pleased with our productive collaboration with Innate Pharma  and data like this reinforce our confidence in proceeding to clinical evaluation of this novel NK cell engager.""About ANKETTMANKETTM (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics) is Innate's proprietary platform for developing next-generation  multi-specific natural killer (NK) cell engagers to treat certain types of cancer.This versatile  fit-for-purpose technology is creating an entirely new class of molecules to induce synthetic immunity against cancer.

In November 2021  Euronext announced its ambition to internalise the clearing activity of its cash and derivatives flows  today operated by third-party providers. As a result Euronext Clearing will become Euronext’s clearing house (“CCP”) of choice for cash equity1  listed derivatives and commodities markets.Combined with the successful migration of its Core Data Centre in June 2022 from Basildon (United Kingdom) to Bergamo (Italy) and the planned migration of the Borsa Italiana capital markets to Optiq®  Euronext’s proprietary trading platform  the expansion of Euronext Clearing will allow Euronext to manage the entire trading value chain of its markets by the end of 2024. Euronext will directly operate clearing activities for its cash  listed derivatives and commodities markets  and create value through a harmonised clearing framework across Euronext venues. It will provide one single platform for clients to access information on collateral  risk  and clearing. Euronext Clearing will bring margin efficiencies to clients with the implementation of a new Value-at-Risk methodology  offering the financial ecosystem with increasingly efficient and resilient solutions for risk capture and allocation within the system. This move will also bring efficiencies across all asset classes  with transparency on data  particularly on settlement  leveraging Euronext Securities to access the Target-2-Securities (T2S) settlement platform. Euronext Clearing will allow Euronext to significantly increase its footprint in the post-trade space and align strategic priorities between trading and clearing. Euronext will be in an ideal position to innovate and improve time-to-market  notably on derivatives products  to serve the evolving needs of its clients.Positioning of Euronext Clearing as the CCP of choice across its cash equity markets1As announced on 3 November 2022  Euronext confirms the first phase of the expansion of Euronext Clearing with the expected positioning of Euronext Clearing as the Euronext CCP of choice for its cash equity markets1 by the end of Q4 2023. Euronext will continue to offer an open access CCP model for cash equity clearing.Migration2 of Euronext listed derivatives and commodities markets to Euronext Clearing expected in Q3 2024Euronext confirms it expects to migrate the listed financial derivatives and commodities markets of Euronext Amsterdam  Euronext Brussels  Euronext Lisbon  Oslo Børs and Euronext Paris from LCH SA to Euronext Clearing by Q3 2024. As a reminder  Euronext Clearing already clears Euronext Milan listed derivatives.The migration of Euronext listed derivatives and commodities markets is the final step of the European expansion of Euronext Clearing set up as part of Euronext ‘Growth for Impact 2024’ strategic plan. It will unlock innovation capabilities  notably on derivatives products. Furthermore  the migration will maximise value extraction through a harmonised clearing framework across Euronext venues and deliver on the announced targeted run-rate annual synergies for 2024.Euronext and LCH SA are committed to working together to ensure an orderly migration of clearing flows from LCH SA to Euronext Clearing.Notification of early termination of the derivatives clearing agreement (the “Agreement”) with LCH SAAs Euronext Clearing undertakes derivatives clearing services in Europe  Euronext has decided to terminate the existing Agreement with LCH SA  under the terms of the Agreement. Therefore  on 16 January 2023  Euronext served LCH SA notice of termination for the purposes of the Agreement.As set up in the Agreement  Euronext will pay a termination fee of approximately €36.03 million toLCH SA  to be provisioned in its income statement as non-underlying expenses in Q1 2023  and payable in 2024. It is reminded that this amount is included in the €150 million of implementation costs related to the ‘Growth for Impact 2024’ strategic plan and already announced in November 2021.Following the notification of the early termination of the Agreement  LCH Group has the option to buy back Euronext's 11.1% stake in LCH SA. Further communications on the stake owned by Euronext in LCH SA will be made when appropriate.The termination of the Agreement does not impact the existing clearing agreement signed between MTS S.p.A and LCH SA nor the existing agreement related to the interoperability link on Italian Government Bonds between Euronext Clearing and LCH SA4.Stéphane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:“We are pleased to announce that the migration of Euronext derivatives clearing activities to Euronext Clearing is planned for Q3 2024  a few months after the migration of Euronext cash clearing activities. Combined with the successful migration of the Core Data Centre to Bergamo in June 2022 and the planned migration of the Borsa Italiana capital markets to Optiq® in 2023  the expansion of our clearing activities is a major step towards the delivery our “Growth for Impact 2024” strategic plan. This will significantly contribute to achieve the €100 million 2024 targeted run-rate annual synergies related to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition.Euronext has profoundly transformed itself over the past five years and is uniquely positioned to become the leading European market infrastructure. Euronext is now the leading listing venue and the largest liquidity pool in Europe  thanks to its single trading platform.

16525,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/guerbet-2023-strategic-priorities-174000731.html,Guerbet: 2023 Strategic Priorities,2023 Strategic Priorities Diagnostic Imaging: increase EluciremTM sales and strengthen international positionsInterventional Imaging: prioritise Lipiodol...,GUERBET2023 Strategic PrioritiesDiagnostic Imaging : increase Elucirem TM sales and strengthen international positionsInterventional Imaging : prioritise Lipiodol sales with the development of innovative indicationsArtificial Intelligence: execution of the roadmap for the emergence of a major AI player dedicated to medical imaging in oncologyVillepinte  16 January 2023: Guerbet (FR0000032526 GBT)  a global specialist in contrast agents and solutions for medical imaging has announced its strategic priorities for 2023 in a complex international environment characterised by persistent inflationary pressures and the revelation of new business opportunities for products listed in developing markets.For several quarters  the Group has operated in an environment marked by a favorable trend in the contrast agent market  where structural volume growth seems to be accompanied by positive price effects over time  particularly in the face of difficult purchasing conditions (notably for iodine).In this demanding yet promising context  Guerbet intends to capitalise on its core target activities and established positions  allocate its resources to developing recognised products adapted to the immediate needs of professionals  and mobilising its teams around three main ambitions:Diagnostic Imaging: strategic reinforcementIn this market where Guerbet generates nearly 90% of its revenue  2023 will mark an important milestone with the market release in the United States of the first batches of the brand new EluciremTM  which is attracting strong interest from the scientific community and ordering parties. In Europe  the European Medicines Agency (EMA) review is expected in the second half of the year. In addition to ElucirmTM  the Group intends to strengthen its solid positions in diagnostic imaging (world’s number 2 in the MRI  number 4 in X-Rays) by supporting customer needs as close as possible with its comprehensive  interconnected offering  including contrast agents  injection systems  and digital solutions.Story continuesInterventional Imaging: resources allocated to the growth of established productsCommercial development and expansion of applications of LipiodolEstablished for 40 years as a standard in the treatment of liver cancer  Lipiodol also has a strong foothold in other areas – including vascular embolization  lymphography  and hysterosalpingography (HSG) – which now account for a significant portion of sales volumes and future growth. The potential for development of new innovative indications appears to be significant  particularly in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders  venous diseases  and post-surgery and cancer disorders. Research and development efforts will thus be accelerated in order to explore new applications for Lipiodol.Microcatheter activity divestment planIn connection with the evolution of its strategy aimed at leveraging key assets  Guerbet is planning the gradual divestment of its microcatheter activities historically housed within Accurate Medical Therapeutics. Since its acquisition in 2018  the microcatheters portfolio has been significantly expanded  now containing 38 references across the two SeQure® and DraKon™ microcatheter ranges for peripheral embolization procedures. This activity has is not significant revenue contributor at the Group level and currently requires specialised  reinforced sales teams and significant investments to achieve its full commercial potential. These necessities are no longer in line with the Group’s development strategy.Guerbet also plans to divest the Occlugel technology acquired in 2018  including several ranges of microspheres for use in embolization.Artificial Intelligence: acceleration of the roadmapFollowing the termination of its collaboration with Merative (formerly IBM Watson Health) announced in October 2022  Guerbet has regained all the necessary latitude to roll out the commercial strategy while maintaining full ownership of the developed assets (application software source codes and algorithms) and their intellectual property. Very promising results were already obtained in 2022 in the detection of liver damage and prostate cancer. The commercial development of the solutions will benefit from the licensing agreement expected to be signed in the first half of 2023 with Intrasense following Guerbet’s acquisition of a stake in the company announced on 11 January. Guerbet ultimately aims to enable the development of a major player in artificial intelligence applied to medical imaging in oncology.Upcoming events:Publication of 2022 full-year revenueFebruary 9  2023  after tradingAbout GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world’s first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world’s first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH® (ALDEI – code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010. The Company has 45 employees and relies on a network of world-class academic  technological  industrial and institutional partners.CONTACTSInvestorsMario AlcarazChief Financial and Administrative Officer+33 (0)4 48 19 01 00ir@deinove.comMediaATCG Partners+33 (0)9 81 87 46 72communication@deinove.comAttachment,neutral,0.09,0.91,0.01,mixed,0.24,0.15,0.61,True,English,"['receivership proceedings', 'DEINOVE', 'Update', 'procédure de redressement judiciaire', 'Phase II clinical trial', 'severe Clostridioides difficile infection', 'first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms', 'world-class academic, technological, industrial', 'microbial dark matter', 'several development programs', 'low concentrated compounds', 'first antibiotic candidate', 'complex chemical structures', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'urgent, global challenge', 'Montpellier Commercial Court', 'French biotech company', 'French biotechnology company', 'new bacterial micro-factories', 'first emergencies', 'industrial production', 'EURONEXT GROWTH®', 'English French', 'antibiotic resistance', 'global health', 'economic challenge', 'chemical synthesis', 'bacterial biodiversity', 'new domain', 'new therapies', 'bacterial extracts', 'The Company', 'receivership proceedings', 'metabolic potential', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'life-threatening infections', 'high speed', 'breakthrough approach', 'unique collection', 'other issue', 'Euromedecine park', 'institutional partners', 'Mario Alcaraz', 'Chief Financial', 'Administrative Officer', 'ATCG Partners', 'rare bacteria', '10,000 rare strains', 'DEINOVE', 'ALDEI', 'pioneer', 'exploration', 'exploitation', 'context', 'November', 'January', 'case', 'decision', 'listing', 'shares', 'superbugs', 'microbes', 'antimicrobials', 'rise', 'thousands', 'race', 'heart', 'code', 'ISIN', '45 employees', 'network', 'CONTACTS', 'Investors', 'Media', 'communication', 'Attachment', '9']",2023-01-16,2023-01-17,globenewswire.com

16532,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://fortune.com/recommends/article/what-is-the-new-york-stock-exchange/,What is the New York Stock Exchange?,The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is the world’s largest stock exchange.,This article was originally published on Bankrate.com.The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is the world’s largest stock exchange. It’s headquartered on 11 Wall Street and 18 Broad Street in New York City and is arguably the world’s most famous and recognizable stock exchange. Established in 1792  the organization became a publicly-traded company in 2006; from 1971 until 2006  it was a not-for-profit corporation.What is a stock exchange?A stock exchange is where shares of publicly-traded companies are bought and sold. While at one time  the trading floor at the NYSE was one of the busiest — imagine scurrying stockbrokers  yelling and hundreds of phones — trading action has moved primarily online. That said  the iconic image of someone ringing the opening and closing bells still remains one of the hallmarks of the NYSE.NYSE trading hoursThe core trading session runs from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern time  Monday through Friday. The pre-opening session starts at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.NYSE holidaysThe stock exchange is closed on a number of federal holidays — but not all. Here are the NYSE days off:New Year’s DayMartin Luther King  Jr. DayWashington’s BirthdayGood FridayMemorial DayJuneteenthIndependence DayLabor DayThanksgiving DayChristmas DayHistory of the New York Stock ExchangeIn New York City on May 17  1792  two dozen stock brokers and merchants signed the “Buttonwood Agreement ” supposedly named for the type of tree under which the earliest transactions took place. The short document outlined the basic rules for trading securities  such as commissions  hours and a non-compete agreement among the brokers. The agreement was in response to the financial panic in March and April of the same year.Trading was informal at first  and took place primarily in nearby coffeehouses. In 1817  however  the organization adopted a constitution and created the New York Stock & Exchange Board. It later adopted the name we know today. In 1865 the New York Stock Exchange moved to Broad Street  where it’s still partially located  although it has expanded in the interim years.The stock ticker debuted in 1867  and in 1878  telephones were installed on the trading floor. The exchange continued to change and grow  and in 1903 moved into its current building  designed by George B. Post. The Classical Revival building  complete with columns and portico  is a National Historic Landmark and a popular tourist attraction. It was also the first place in North America to be air-conditioned. Computers were first introduced in the 1960s to help process data.While technology and online trading have played major roles in the NYSE for decades  it wasn’t until the COVID-19 pandemic that the exchange moved purely to electronic trading and operated without a trading floor. It didn’t last long  however. After closing in March 2020  the floor reopened in late May.Who owns the NYSE?In 2013  Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE: ICE) acquired the NYSE and remains the parent organization. ICE is an American company that was founded in 2000.Over its 200-year existence  the NYSE has acquired and merged with various companies  including the American Stock Exchange.What is the oldest stock exchange?There’s debate over the origin of the first stock exchange. Some scholars point to the founding of the Dutch East India Company in 1602 as the start of easily transferable shares. By 1680  the public engaged in transactions you’d recognize today  such as futures and options trading. The company eventually became the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. After a merger with a few other exchanges in 2000  it became Euronext.Another contender is the Frankfurt Stock Exchange  also known as Borse Frankfurt. The exchange claims it was established in 1585. At a city fair that year  merchants met to establish uniform exchange rates. Additionally  the Frankfurt Stock Exchange traces its roots back to medieval fairs in the 11th and 12th centuries that hosted commercial and monetary transactions  eventually leading to Frankfurt becoming a banking and trading hub in the early 1500s.What is the largest stock exchange?The NYSE is the largest equities-based exchange in the world by market capitalization. As of late 2022  Nasdaq and the Shanghai Stock Exchange are the second and third largest  respectively.NYSE vs. NasdaqTo start  Nasdaq is much younger than the NYSE. Founded in 1971  it was the world’s first electronic stock market. More importantly  Nasdaq doesn’t have a trading floor  unlike the NYSE. Instead  all trades are electronic and its physical location in Times Square  MarketSite  is a broadcast studio. Nasdaq has lower listing fees and minimum earning requirements than the NYSE  which makes it more accessible to smaller companies. With this comes the potential of hosting more high-growth and volatile stocks than the NYSE.Bottom lineFor now  the NYSE is the largest stock exchange in the world  but that may not last as other exchanges close the gap. Regardless  its influence on the U.S. economy is enormous.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.56,0.16,0.29,True,English,"['New York Stock Exchange', 'The New York Stock Exchange', 'The Classical Revival building', 'Dutch East India Company', 'two dozen stock brokers', 'Labor Day Thanksgiving Day', 'Good Friday Memorial Day', 'first electronic stock market', 'New York City', 'Martin Luther King', 'George B.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  has today contacted holders (the “2023 Noteholders”) of interests in the 5.95% notes due February 2023 and the 7.25% notes due April 2023 (together  the “2023 Notes”) issued by VEON Holdings BV (“VEON Holdings”) in relation to the English Scheme of Arrangement (the “Scheme”) that aims to extend the maturities of the 2023 Notes by eight months from their respective maturity dates.In the letter  VEON’s Chief Executive Officer Kaan Terzioğlu requested the assistance and cooperation of 2023 Noteholders in connection with the Scheme  and specifically requested them to vote in favour of the Scheme at the forthcoming scheme meeting taking place on 24 January 2023. The deadline by which 2023 Noteholders must submit their Voting and Proxy Forms (or  if the 2023 Noteholder holds their 2023 Notes through DTC  procure that their DTC participant submits on their behalf) is 5.00 p.m. (London time) on 20 January 2023. The letter further explained:“We understand the significance of what we are asking and take our obligations to our stakeholders  including the repayment of our debts in full and on time  very seriously.However  despite strong operational results and a strong balance sheet  given the current circumstances  we must consider the repayment of the 2023 Notes within the context of our future debt obligations beyond 2023 and the difficulties VEON currently faces in raising debt or equity on the international capital markets on commercially acceptable terms. It is this which has led us to take the decision to launch the Scheme  as we believe it would provide the best route to us repaying you in advance of VEON Holdings’ other future debt obligations.Your support and the resultant implementation of the proposal set out in the Scheme will enable us to avoid the near-term inefficient use of cash that would result from a significant portion of the principal repayment (relating to 2023 Notes held via the Russian National Settlement Depository (“NSD”)) being trapped in international clearing systems (with no clear prospect of such monies being returned to VEON). VEON and its legal advisors have spent significant time and efforts exploring potential options to avoid having cash trapped in the international clearing systems  but at present there does not appear to be a clearly viable path to avoid this unattractive outcome. At a time that  due to Russian Decree 430  the Group potentially can no longer rely on payments to the international clearing systems effectively being recognised by its Russian noteholders as a full discharge of the underlying liability  the proposed maturity extension will provide additional time for the impact of Decree 430 on VimpelCom and the Group (as set out in the Scheme documentation) to become clearer and for the Group to mitigate  where possible  the associated risk of double payments. The Scheme proposal would also provide time to progress our asset monetization strategy anchored by the sale of our Russian business (the “VimpelCom Disposal”)  as announced on 24 November 2022. We believe that the VimpelCom Disposal represents the single-most material deleveraging action available to VEON Holdings and increases the prospects of VEON regaining access to the international capital markets  and thereby refinancing its indebtedness  on commercially acceptable terms.As set out more fully in the Scheme documents  in return for granting us with a modest extension  we have sought to compensate the 2023 Noteholders with the benefit of an amendment fee and a put right. As announced on 11 January 2023  the Company has further amended the terms of the proposal set out in the Scheme and entered into undertakings to vote in favour of the Scheme with certain 2023 Noteholders holding approximately 10.4% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes. Each of these amendments improves the terms of the proposal for the benefit of the 2023 Noteholders.If the Scheme fails  the directors of VEON Holdings will need to continue to assess the Company’s solvency and liquidity position up to the original maturity date of the February 2023 Notes. Whilst VEON Holdings will have sufficient cash to pay the 2023 Notes on their original maturity dates  we cannot exclude the possibility that the directors may determine that the best action for VEON Holdings to take is not to pay on maturity while the double-payment risk continues. We consider that  by providing further runway to allow the sale of VimpelCom to complete  the Scheme will greatly reduce the risks of non-payment and impact on our stakeholders.We are pleased that good progress has already been made in respect of the implementation of the Scheme (and strive to continue this progress). In particular  on 26 December  we announced that VEON Holdings was granted an OFAC License (if you would like to see a copy of the OFAC License  you can request a copy by email to bonds@veon.com). Following receipt of this license  VEON Holdings believes that no further licenses are required in order to permit eligible noteholders to vote on the Scheme. In addition  we are in active dialogue with the Netherlands Ministry of Finance and the UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation in respect of the licenses we have sought from those regulators  which will be required to implement the amendments contemplated by the Scheme.Therefore in consideration of the steps taken above  we request your support and encourage you to vote in favour of the Scheme at the forthcoming scheme meeting. By doing so  you will provide us with crucial time to mitigate the risks of trapped cash and potential double-payment and to undertake the VimpelCom Disposal and our wider asset monetization programme  thus allowing VEON to deleverage and provide the best-available route for the repayment of your notes.For all relevant information in relation to the Scheme please visit https://is.kroll.com/veon  and any further questions on the voting process can be addressed to Kroll Issuer Services Limited (as the Company’s information agent) by email to veon@is.kroll.com or by telephone on + 44 20 7704 0880.Finally  we acknowledge the questions which have been raised by several of you to us and to our advisors and hope that we have been able to address them. However should you have any questions on the Scheme  other topics covered in this letter  or other matters related to VEON Group  please contact bonds@veon.com .Thank you for your continued trust in and support of our company.”DisclaimerThis press release contains “forward-looking statements”  as the phrase is defined in Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933  as amended  and Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934  as amended.

SiC power semiconductors can be used in producing a strong as well as a very hard material. SiC power semiconductors can be implemented in various sectors such as telecommunication  energy and power  automotive  renewable power generation  and in different other areas. They are basically considered due to higher maximum thermal conductive properties that have widened the area of application. SiC power semiconductors are devices that are considered high-frequency power devices that are majorly applicable in wireless communications. SiC semiconductor offers ten times the dielectric breakdown field strength  three times the thermal conductivity  and three times the bandgap as compared to a silicon semiconductor. The SiC semiconductor has taken over the market because of its high performance and efficiency. The SiC power semiconductor offers to work at high voltage and current and offers low on-resistance in addition to being efficient at high temperatures. The combination of silicon carbide has thus proved to be a better and optimum choice of semiconductor.Market DriversAdvent Of SiC Power SemiconductorsThere are very useful properties of SiC as a semiconductor material. In applications such as inverters  motor drives  and battery chargers  silicon carbide (SiC) devices offer many advantages  such as improved power density  reduced cooling requirements  and reduced overall system cost. These advantages are enough to make SiC power semiconductors at the high efficient stage.The energy lost by SiC during the reverse recovery phase is only 1% of the energy lost by silicon which creates a huge difference in the efficiency of the material. The virtual absence of a tail current allows a faster turn–off  and it makes lower losses. Since there is less energy to dissipate  a SiC device able to switch at higher frequencies and improve efficiency. The more efficient  small size  and lower weight of SiC as compared to other materials can create a higher-rated solution or a smaller design with reduced cooling requirements. Thus  the advent of SiC power semiconductors is a major factor expected to drive the growth of the Global SiC power semiconductor market.Rising Penetration of Electronic VehiclesThe world is changing so fast  and it is turning towards renewable energy.

(the “Company”) refers to its prior announcements in relating to the Company’s proposed scheme of arrangement (the “Scheme”) in respect of the 5.95% notes due February 2023 and 7.25% notes due April 2023 issued by the Company (together  the “2023 Notes”). The Company has today provided an update on voting on the Scheme.Capitalised terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning given to them in the Explanatory Statement  which is available via the Scheme Website at https://deals.is.kroll.com/veon .As set out in the Explanatory Statement  in order to vote at the Scheme Meeting  eligible 2023 Noteholders are required to submit to the Information Agent validly completed Voting and Proxy Forms by 5pm London time on 20 January 2023 . The Voting and Proxy Form is available on the Scheme Website and may be submitted by completing the electronic form on the Scheme Website or by submitting a pdf of the completed Voting and Proxy Form to the Information Agent at veon@is.kroll.com.Following feedback from certain 2023 Noteholders  the Company is aware that certain intermediaries or custodians may not have processed custody instructions received in respect of the Scheme prior to the Custody Instruction Deadline at 5pm on 13 January 2023. To facilitate voting on the Scheme  the Company has therefore agreed to  subject to receipt of acceptable proof of holdings as outlined below by the Information Agent  accept otherwise validly completed Voting and Proxy Forms that are submitted to the Information Agent via the Scheme Website or by pdf submission to veon@is.kroll.com.As a result  any 2023 Noteholder holding in Euroclear or Clearstream (but not through an Account Holder  Intermediary  custodian or other member or participant in the Clearing Systems that is a Sanctions Disqualified Person) or DTC who was unable to submit custody instructions to block their 2023 Notes in the Clearing Systems prior to the Custody Instruction Deadline may now provide proof of holding for 2023 Noteholders to the Instruction Agent directly.

In essence  our index reveals the hypothetical financial result you would obtain if you were to invest in the world's top-selling artists to benefit financially from their success.Artprice100© vs. S&P 500 – Base 100 in January 2000[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/01/image1-artprice100-vs-sp500.png ]Artprice Global Index – Base 100 in January 2000[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/01/image2-artprice-global-index.png ]“In financial terms  investing in art masterpieces has never been so costly  with auction prices nowadays often reaching eight or nine figures in US dollars. But  at the same time  thanks to joint ownership solutions  it has never been so easy”  says thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice.The Artprice100© index is therefore an essential market benchmark: a purely theoretical exercise simulating investment in the art market's 100 most successful artists without any other aesthetic or preferential consideration. To calculate the index  we construct a portfolio of the world's 100 top-selling artists based on their auction revenue over the previous five years (in this case  1 January 2017 to 31 December 2021). We also apply a liquidity criterion: for each artist  at least ten works (excluding prints and multiples) must have been auctioned annually for them to be included in the calculations (see list of included artists below).The economic context and art market trendsIn global terms  the year 2022 was marked by a range of issues including the fallout and persistent economic impact of the global covid pandemic (inflation  China…) and the new economic challenges posed by the war in Ukraine  notably in terms of energy. Over the 12 months of 2022  the S&P 500 lost 19% of its value while crypto-currencies entered a bear market that substantially slowed NFT transactions.However  despite these drags on the global economy  the global art auction market had a prosperous year and  indeed  one of the best in its history. Artprice attributes this good performance primarily to the successes achieved by American auction houses  posting record sales with truly sensational results in the painting medium  but also in photography and tapestry. And  as you will see in our comprehensive 2022 Global Art Market Report (to be published at the beginning of March 2023 on www.artprice.com )  strong results in France  Germany  and Hong Kong also stabilized the global art auction market.Among the art market's principal trends in 2022  Artprice noted the more intense than ever competition for masterpieces from the most prestigious collections  which included the Hubert de Givenchy  Thomas Ammann  Yusaku Maezawa  and of course the Paul G. Allen collections. The year's results also showed a continuing voracious appetite for works by very young artists (Ultra-Contemporary Art)  to which Artprice devoted its last Annual Report.www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/the-contemporary-art-market-report-2022Our Global Artprice Index was down 18% in 2022  but our Artprice100© gained 3%Excepting the ultra-high-end of the art market  the global economic context nevertheless prompted art buyers to adopt a generally more cautious stance. With 1 million lots presented worldwide (as recorded by Artprice by Artmarket.com in 2022)  the offer has once again expanded to an unprecedented level  with more than half of the transactions (56% of lots sold) concluded below the threshold of $1 000 (including fees).So  while our Blue-chip 100 Artists Index shows slight growth over the past twelve months (+3%)  overall art market prices posted a contraction of 18%: almost the same contraction as the S&P 500 index. The causes are many and varied  starting with the suspension of art auctions in China and the weakening of the euro against the dollar.It should be noted that many artworks that reached sensational results in auction rooms during 2022 cannot be included in the calculation of our Artprice Global Index. Extremely rare works such as Georges Seurat's Les Poseuses (1888) or fresh canvases such as Avery Singer's Happening (2014) are not included in the calculation of the Global Indices either because there is no repeat sales history  or because there is not enough data to use a hedonic valuation method. For example  there may not be enough similar works in circulation or there is still too little hindsight to assess the value of these works on a regular basis (annually or quarterly).www.artprice.com/artist/26469/georges-seurat/painting/28444347/les-poseuses-ensemble-petite-versionwww.artprice.com/artist/611277/avery-singer/painting/26880003/happeningLastly  the progression of the Arptrice100© index may  in itself  seem weak considering the spectacular results recorded in 2022 for blue-chip artists. However  this index takes into consideration all the works sold by the 100 top-selling and most liquid signatures  and some of these works were much less successful than the most legendary pieces.For example  the third-best result of the year 2022 was hammered for Paul Cézanne's La Montagne Sainte-Victoire (1888-1890). Acquired in 2001 for $38.5 million  this painting was resold for $137.8 million (incl. fees) this year as part of the Paul G. Allen Collection. However  a few days later (17 November)  another painting by Cézanne  Maisons au Chou  à Pontoise (circa 1881)  acquired in 2007 for $6.8 million  was resold for just $3.7 million at Christie's in New York.So  if we compare the Artprice100© and the Global Artprice indices  we see that blue-chip artists managed to get through an economically challenging year with a slight increase in market value and that the rarest masterpieces by these blue-chip signatures clearly posted the best returns.The Artprice100© index: Artist + portfolio weighting in 20221.

The Voting and Proxy Form is available on the Scheme Website and may be submitted by completing the electronic form on the Scheme Website or by submitting a pdf of the completed Voting and Proxy Form to the Information Agent at veon@is.kroll.com.Following feedback from certain 2023 Noteholders  the Company is aware that certain intermediaries or custodians may not have processed custody instructions received in respect of the Scheme prior to the Custody Instruction Deadline at 5pm on 13 January 2023. To facilitate voting on the Scheme  the Company has therefore agreed to  subject to receipt of acceptable proof of holdings as outlined below by the Information Agent  accept otherwise validly completed Voting and Proxy Forms that are submitted to the Information Agent via the Scheme Website or by pdf submission to veon@is.kroll.com.As a result  any 2023 Noteholder holding in Euroclear or Clearstream (but not through an Account Holder  Intermediary  custodian or other member or participant in the Clearing Systems that is a Sanctions Disqualified Person) or DTC who was unable to submit custody instructions to block their 2023 Notes in the Clearing Systems prior to the Custody Instruction Deadline may now provide proof of holding for 2023 Noteholders to the Instruction Agent directly.

In November 2021  Euronext announced its ambition to internalise the clearing activity of its cash and derivatives flows  today operated by third-party providers. As a result Euronext Clearing will become Euronext’s clearing house (“CCP”) of choice for cash equity1  listed derivatives and commodities markets.Combined with the successful migration of its Core Data Centre in June 2022 from Basildon (United Kingdom) to Bergamo (Italy) and the planned migration of the Borsa Italiana capital markets to Optiq®  Euronext’s proprietary trading platform  the expansion of Euronext Clearing will allow Euronext to manage the entire trading value chain of its markets by the end of 2024. Euronext will directly operate clearing activities for its cash  listed derivatives and commodities markets  and create value through a harmonised clearing framework across Euronext venues. It will provide one single platform for clients to access information on collateral  risk  and clearing. Euronext Clearing will bring margin efficiencies to clients with the implementation of a new Value-at-Risk methodology  offering the financial ecosystem with increasingly efficient and resilient solutions for risk capture and allocation within the system. This move will also bring efficiencies across all asset classes  with transparency on data  particularly on settlement  leveraging Euronext Securities to access the Target-2-Securities (T2S) settlement platform. Euronext Clearing will allow Euronext to significantly increase its footprint in the post-trade space and align strategic priorities between trading and clearing. Euronext will be in an ideal position to innovate and improve time-to-market  notably on derivatives products  to serve the evolving needs of its clients.Story continuesPositioning of Euronext Clearing as the CCP of choice across its cash equity markets1As announced on 3 November 2022  Euronext confirms the first phase of the expansion of Euronext Clearing with the expected positioning of Euronext Clearing as the Euronext CCP of choice for its cash equity markets1 by the end of Q4 2023. Euronext will continue to offer an open access CCP model for cash equity clearing.Migration2 of Euronext listed derivatives and commodities markets to Euronext Clearing expected in Q3 2024Euronext confirms it expects to migrate the listed financial derivatives and commodities markets of Euronext Amsterdam  Euronext Brussels  Euronext Lisbon  Oslo Børs and Euronext Paris from LCH SA to Euronext Clearing by Q3 2024. As a reminder  Euronext Clearing already clears Euronext Milan listed derivatives.The migration of Euronext listed derivatives and commodities markets is the final step of the European expansion of Euronext Clearing set up as part of Euronext ‘Growth for Impact 2024’ strategic plan. It will unlock innovation capabilities  notably on derivatives products. Furthermore  the migration will maximise value extraction through a harmonised clearing framework across Euronext venues and deliver on the announced targeted run-rate annual synergies for 2024.Euronext and LCH SA are committed to working together to ensure an orderly migration of clearing flows from LCH SA to Euronext Clearing.Notification of early termination of the derivatives clearing agreement (the “Agreement”) with LCH SAAs Euronext Clearing undertakes derivatives clearing services in Europe  Euronext has decided to terminate the existing Agreement with LCH SA  under the terms of the Agreement. Therefore  on 16 January 2023  Euronext served LCH SA notice of termination for the purposes of the Agreement.As set up in the Agreement  Euronext will pay a termination fee of approximately €36.03 million toLCH SA  to be provisioned in its income statement as non-underlying expenses in Q1 2023  and payable in 2024. It is reminded that this amount is included in the €150 million of implementation costs related to the ‘Growth for Impact 2024’ strategic plan and already announced in November 2021.Following the notification of the early termination of the Agreement  LCH Group has the option to buy back Euronext's 11.1% stake in LCH SA. Further communications on the stake owned by Euronext in LCH SA will be made when appropriate.The termination of the Agreement does not impact the existing clearing agreement signed between MTS S.p.A and LCH SA nor the existing agreement related to the interoperability link on Italian Government Bonds between Euronext Clearing and LCH SA4.Stéphane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:“We are pleased to announce that the migration of Euronext derivatives clearing activities to Euronext Clearing is planned for Q3 2024  a few months after the migration of Euronext cash clearing activities. Combined with the successful migration of the Core Data Centre to Bergamo in June 2022 and the planned migration of the Borsa Italiana capital markets to Optiq® in 2023  the expansion of our clearing activities is a major step towards the delivery our “Growth for Impact 2024” strategic plan. This will significantly contribute to achieve the €100 million 2024 targeted run-rate annual synergies related to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition.Euronext has profoundly transformed itself over the past five years and is uniquely positioned to become the leading European market infrastructure. Euronext is now the leading listing venue and the largest liquidity pool in Europe  thanks to its single trading platform. The expansion of Euronext Clearing to Euronext markets is another significant transformational milestone  allowing Euronext to manage the entire trading value chain  and become a major player in the post-trade space.We look forward to completing these strategic milestones in the coming months. I would like to thank all the Euronext teams that have already been working on these key projects for more than a year and that will be critical to the delivery of these projects. I would like to thank LCH SA for the great collaboration during the past years.”CONTACT ANALYSTS & INVESTORS – ir@euronext.com Aurélie Cohen +33 1 70 48 24 27 ir@euronext.com Clément Kubiak +33 1 70 48 26 33 ir@euronext.comCONTACTS MEDIA – mediateam@euronext.com Aurélie Cohen (Europe) +33 1 70 48 24 45 parispressoffice@euronext.com Marianne Aalders (Amsterdam) +31 20 721 41 33 maalders@euronext.com Pascal Brabant (Brussels) +32 2 620 15 50 pbrabant@euronext.com Sandra Machado (Lisbon) +351 210 600 614 smachado@euronext.com Andrea Monzani (Europe/Milan/Rome) +39 02 72 42 62 13 Italypressoffice@euronext.com Cathrine Lorvik Segerlund (Oslo) +47 41 69 59 10 clsegerlund@euronext.com Sarah Mound (Paris/Dublin) +33 1 70 48 24 45 parispressoffice@euronext.comAbout EuronextEuronext is the leading pan-European market infrastructure  connecting European economies to global capital markets  to accelerate innovation and sustainable growth.

(Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today announces that revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 was ahead of the previous guidance.Based on preliminary and unaudited numbers  sales in Q4 2022 increased to around €720 million mainly due to better-than-expected supply chain conditions and higher conversion of the backlog as a result thereof  exceeding the previous guidance of €630-660 million published in our press release on November 28  2022. Although we are still faced with certain supply chain challenges  the situation improved more than expected. Thanks to solid execution by our suppliers and Global Operations team we were able to complete and ship additional tools in the final weeks of December.Orders amounted to approximately €820 million in Q4 2022  above the level that was implied by the guidance for a book-to-bill of a bit above 1 that we mentioned in our press release of November 28  2022. The upside was predominantly driven by the power/analog/wafer segment  including an exceptionally high order intake in our silicon carbide epitaxy business (LPE). Next to strong underlying demand  the increase in LPE’s orders was driven by some customers bringing forward orders that are scheduled for shipment in the latter part of 2023.Operating margin for Q4 2022 is expected to be approximately 26%  excluding PPA (purchase price allocation) amortization related to the acquisition of LPE.On February 28  2023  ASM will report fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results and will then also provide guidance for 2023 Q1 and Q2 revenue.About ASM InternationalASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

Corre Energy US Development Company LLC  a subsidiary of Corre Energy B.V.  has been formally launched to source and develop utility-scale compressed air energy storage (CAES) projects across North America.CAES is a commercially proven technology that can use renewable energy to compress air into underground salt caverns when power demand and prices are low. This energy is later released to the grid to increase supply when demand and prices are higher  enhancing the stability  reliability  and security of the network. When combustion of green hydrogen is included as part of the CAES plant’s technical design  the electricity it supplies has a zero-carbon footprint.The US Department of Energy ranks CAES1 as the lowest cost long duration energy storage technology. The relatively inexpensive nature of the physical hedge provided to Corre Energy’s customers allows them to ‘time shift’ the variable energy they produce and enhance the profitability of their renewable assets. In this way  CAES facilities can support the more rapid deployment of renewable generation assets across North America  accelerating the decarbonization of the generation fleet.In return for allowing renewable generators to store energy in its CAES plants and discharge that energy when its value is highest  Corre Energy will typically charge a set fee and share in the upside revenue earned by its customers  under what is termed an “offtake agreement.”Keith McGrane  Chief Executive Officer of Corre Energy  commented: “Last month we signed binding commercial terms for a 15-year offtake agreement with Eneco  a leading renewable energy supplier in the Netherlands  for the entire multi-day storage capacity of ZW1  our 320-megawatt project. That agreement confirms the attractiveness of our business model and will support development of a project portfolio in North America.” McGrane added: “As the market leader for long duration energy storage projects in Europe  we look forward to transferring our knowhow into the US and Canada. Our North American operations will also provide opportunities for investors mainly focused on the North American market to participate in financing the debt and equity requirements of our North American subsidiary and its CAES projects.”Story continuesChet Lyons  a pioneer in the energy storage industry  has been named president of Corre Energy US Development Company LLC. Lyons played an instrumental role in developing and commercializing merchant-based energy storage projects to perform frequency regulation ancillary services in the United States  Canada  and globally.Lyons commented: “The success of Corre Energy B.V. in Europe and new once-in-a-generation government incentives for long duration energy storage projects in both the US and Canada make this the perfect time to build our North American project portfolio.” Lyons added: “Investment Tax Credits of 30 to 40 percent of total project costs and Production Tax Credits for the use of hydrogen will have a beneficial impact on project economics and can make our projects carbon free  enabling us to play a key role in the decarbonization of North American power generation.”1 R.

By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world’s first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world’s first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH® (ALDEI – code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010.

Based on preliminary and unaudited numbers  sales in Q4 2022 in…,Almere  The NetherlandsJanuary 17  2023  17:45 p.m. CETASM International N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today announces that revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 was ahead of the previous guidance.Based on preliminary and unaudited numbers  sales in Q4 2022 increased to around €720 million mainly due to better-than-expected supply chain conditions and higher conversion of the backlog as a result thereof  exceeding the previous guidance of €630-660 million published in our press release on November 28  2022. Although we are still faced with certain supply chain challenges  the situation improved more than expected. Thanks to solid execution by our suppliers and Global Operations team we were able to complete and ship additional tools in the final weeks of December.Orders amounted to approximately €820 million in Q4 2022  above the level that was implied by the guidance for a book-to-bill of a bit above 1 that we mentioned in our press release of November 28  2022. The upside was predominantly driven by the power/analog/wafer segment  including an exceptionally high order intake in our silicon carbide epitaxy business (LPE). Next to strong underlying demand  the increase in LPE’s orders was driven by some customers bringing forward orders that are scheduled for shipment in the latter part of 2023.Operating margin for Q4 2022 is expected to be approximately 26%  excluding PPA (purchase price allocation) amortization related to the acquisition of LPE.On February 28  2023  ASM will report fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results and will then also provide guidance for 2023 Q1 and Q2 revenue.About ASM InternationalASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

(Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today announces that revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 was ahead of the previous guidance.Based on preliminary and unaudited numbers  sales in Q4 2022 increased to around €720 million mainly due to better-than-expected supply chain conditions and higher conversion of the backlog as a result thereof  exceeding the previous guidance of €630-660 million published in our press release on November 28  2022. Although we are still faced with certain supply chain challenges  the situation improved more than expected. Thanks to solid execution by our suppliers and Global Operations team we were able to complete and ship additional tools in the final weeks of December.Orders amounted to approximately €820 million in Q4 2022  above the level that was implied by the guidance for a book-to-bill of a bit above 1 that we mentioned in our press release of November 28  2022. The upside was predominantly driven by the power/analog/wafer segment  including an exceptionally high order intake in our silicon carbide epitaxy business (LPE). Next to strong underlying demand  the increase in LPE's orders was driven by some customers bringing forward orders that are scheduled for shipment in the latter part of 2023.Operating margin for Q4 2022 is expected to be approximately 26%  excluding PPA (purchase price allocation) amortization related to the acquisition of LPE.On February 28  2023  ASM will report fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results and will then also provide guidance for 2023 Q1 and Q2 revenue.About ASM InternationalASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

Next to strong underlying demand  the increase in LPE’s orders was driven by some customers bringing forward orders that are scheduled for shipment in the latter part of 2023.Operating margin for Q4 2022 is expected to be approximately 26%  excluding PPA (purchase price allocation) amortization related to the acquisition of LPE.On February 28  2023  ASM will report fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results and will then also provide guidance for 2023 Q1 and Q2 revenue.About ASM InternationalASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

In November 2021  Euronext announced its ambition to internalise the clearing activity of its cash and derivatives flows  today operated by third-party providers. As a result Euronext Clearing will become Euronext's clearing house (""CCP"") of choice for cash equity1  listed derivatives and commodities markets.Combined with the successful migration of its Core Data Centre in June 2022 from Basildon (United Kingdom) to Bergamo (Italy) and the planned migration of the Borsa Italiana capital markets to Optiq®  Euronext's proprietary trading platform  the expansion of Euronext Clearing will allow Euronext to manage the entire trading value chain of its markets by the end of 2024. Euronext will directly operate clearing activities for its cash  listed derivatives and commodities markets  and create value through a harmonised clearing framework across Euronext venues. It will provide one single platform for clients to access information on collateral  risk  and clearing. Euronext Clearing will bring margin efficiencies to clients with the implementation of a new Value-at-Risk methodology  offering the financial ecosystem with increasingly efficient and resilient solutions for risk capture and allocation within the system. This move will also bring efficiencies across all asset classes  with transparency on data  particularly on settlement  leveraging Euronext Securities to access the Target-2-Securities (T2S) settlement platform. Euronext Clearing will allow Euronext to significantly increase its footprint in the post-trade space and align strategic priorities between trading and clearing. Euronext will be in an ideal position to innovate and improve time-to-market  notably on derivatives products  to serve the evolving needs of its clients.Positioning of Euronext Clearing as the CCP of choice across its cash equity markets1As announced on 3 November 2022  Euronext confirms the first phase of the expansion of Euronext Clearing with the expected positioning of Euronext Clearing as the Euronext CCP of choice for its cash equity markets1 by the end of Q4 2023. Euronext will continue to offer an open access CCP model for cash equity clearing.Migration2 of Euronext listed derivatives and commodities markets to Euronext Clearing expected in Q3 2024Euronext confirms it expects to migrate the listed financial derivatives and commodities markets of Euronext Amsterdam  Euronext Brussels  Euronext Lisbon  Oslo Børs and Euronext Paris from LCH SA to Euronext Clearing by Q3 2024. As a reminder  Euronext Clearing already clears Euronext Milan listed derivatives.The migration of Euronext listed derivatives and commodities markets is the final step of the European expansion of Euronext Clearing set up as part of Euronext 'Growth for Impact 2024' strategic plan. It will unlock innovation capabilities  notably on derivatives products. Furthermore  the migration will maximise value extraction through a harmonised clearing framework across Euronext venues and deliver on the announced targeted run-rate annual synergies for 2024.Euronext and LCH SA are committed to working together to ensure an orderly migration of clearing flows from LCH SA to Euronext Clearing.Notification of early termination of the derivatives clearing agreement (the ""Agreement"") with LCH SAAs Euronext Clearing undertakes derivatives clearing services in Europe  Euronext has decided to terminate the existing Agreement with LCH SA  under the terms of the Agreement. Therefore  on 16 January 2023  Euronext served LCH SA notice of termination for the purposes of the Agreement.As set up in the Agreement  Euronext will pay a termination fee of approximately €36.03 million toLCH SA  to be provisioned in its income statement as non-underlying expenses in Q1 2023  and payable in 2024. It is reminded that this amount is included in the €150 million of implementation costs related to the 'Growth for Impact 2024' strategic plan and already announced in November 2021.Following the notification of the early termination of the Agreement  LCH Group has the option to buy back Euronext's 11.1% stake in LCH SA. Further communications on the stake owned by Euronext in LCH SA will be made when appropriate.The termination of the Agreement does not impact the existing clearing agreement signed between MTS S.p.A and LCH SA nor the existing agreement related to the interoperability link on Italian Government Bonds between Euronext Clearing and LCH SA4.Stéphane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:""We are pleased to announce that the migration of Euronext derivatives clearing activities to Euronext Clearing is planned for Q3 2024  a few months after the migration of Euronext cash clearing activities. Combined with the successful migration of the Core Data Centre to Bergamo in June 2022 and the planned migration of the Borsa Italiana capital markets to Optiq® in 2023  the expansion of our clearing activities is a major step towards the delivery our ""Growth for Impact 2024"" strategic plan. This will significantly contribute to achieve the €100 million 2024 targeted run-rate annual synergies related to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition.Euronext has profoundly transformed itself over the past five years and is uniquely positioned to become the leading European market infrastructure. Euronext is now the leading listing venue and the largest liquidity pool in Europe  thanks to its single trading platform. The expansion of Euronext Clearing to Euronext markets is another significant transformational milestone  allowing Euronext to manage the entire trading value chain  and become a major player in the post-trade space.We look forward to completing these strategic milestones in the coming months. I would like to thank all the Euronext teams that have already been working on these key projects for more than a year and that will be critical to the delivery of these projects. I would like to thank LCH SA for the great collaboration during the past years.""CONTACT ANALYSTS & INVESTORS - ir@euronext.com Aurélie Cohen +33 1 70 48 24 27 ir@euronext.com Clément Kubiak +33 1 70 48 26 33 ir@euronext.comCONTACTS MEDIA - mediateam@euronext.com Aurélie Cohen (Europe) +33 1 70 48 24 45 parispressoffice@euronext.com Marianne Aalders (Amsterdam) +31 20 721 41 33 maalders@euronext.com Pascal Brabant (Brussels) +32 2 620 15 50 pbrabant@euronext.com Sandra Machado (Lisbon) +351 210 600 614 smachado@euronext.com Andrea Monzani (Europe/Milan/Rome) +39 02 72 42 62 13 Italypressoffice@euronext.com Cathrine Lorvik Segerlund (Oslo) +47 41 69 59 10 clsegerlund@euronext.com Sarah Mound (Paris/Dublin) +33 1 70 48 24 45 parispressoffice@euronext.comAbout EuronextEuronext is the leading pan-European market infrastructure  connecting European economies to global capital markets  to accelerate innovation and sustainable growth.
