In an effort to encompass the broad – and at times vague – concept of the metaverse  the reports set it up as “an immersive  interoperable and synchronous digital world that will change how we interact  work and play.”Despite the hype around the metaverse  propelled by Facebook’s transformation into Meta Platforms back in 2021  the world has yet to witness or experience anything concrete.“It's an evolving concept. One that doesn’t have a standard definition yet ” said Cathy Li  head of media  entertainment and sport at WEF  during a Wednesday press conference.Open-ended questions about how the metaverse should be regulated also require extensive testing  said Huda Al Hashimi  deputy minister of cabinet affairs for strategic affairs in the United Arab Emirates  at the same event.“We also see that regulators will be acting more like referees rather than gatekeepers. And that code of conduct will actually take precedence over formulating policies ” Al Hashimi said.Later on Wednesday  a panel heard two very different visions for the metaverse.One came from Meta  whose Chief Product Officer Chris Cox said he believes that “one day that platform will become as important as the smartphone.”Cox likened the metaverse he’s building to Meta’s other social media asset  Instagram  which is “focused on giving tools to creators and builders.” It will include “spaces that are self-consistent  oftentimes offered by big companies ” as well as startups and shops  he said.He said  however  that the difficulty would be jumping from one ecosystem to another  with the ease with which you can go from  say  Wikipedia to Google Maps online  without losing coherence or connectivity. “Part of what doesn’t exist yet for the metaverse is the hyperlink ” Cox said.Story continuesRead more: Davos 2023: Crypto Is Down but Not OutFor fellow panelist Neal Stephenson  the influential sci-fi author  it’s clear what kind of model is needed.“It doesn’t happen unless you create an open system analogous to the early internet  [where] anyone interested can latch on to a shared protocol ” said Stephenson  who coined the term “metaverse” in his 1992 novel ""Snow Crash."" “Right now the image one has about Facebook  it’s very much a centralized top-downish organization.”(Keen to show no hard feelings  Cox invited his co-panelist to grab a coffee after the panel; Stephenson appeared to politely decline.)QUOTE OF THE DAY: “It’s Davos with no legs. It’s very cool.” – Nicholas Thompson  chief executive officer of The Atlantic  plugs WEF Metaverse the Global Collaboration Village.Pros and cons of virtual fiatMaking different digital ecosystems interact was  in a different way  also a topic for central bankers  who joined with financial infrastructure bosses inside the Congress Centre to discuss central bank digital currencies.Interoperability  as it’s known in the jargon  comes with plenty of difficulties  the discussion noted – not least as central banks don’t always trust each other. The obstacles as they apply to CBDCs are often about conflicting governance and legal systems rather than technology  South African central bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago told the panel.The panelists’ comments suggested there’s still a long way to go in getting benefits from virtual fiat – and plenty of ways in which it could actually end up damaging the world economy.“It is crucial that when we come up with new innovations  these can scale and these can guard against the potential cost of having digital islands ” said Javier Perez Tasso  chief executive officer of SWIFT  the messaging service used for making interbank transfers. Instead of unifying payments systems  central bank digital currencies could lead to further fragmentation  Tasso said.There have been some limited success stories in trying out CBDCs for settlements both for interbank and retail settlements – but they have their limits. Amir Yaron  an Israeli central bank governor  spoke glowingly of a trial he’s carrying out to enable cross-border retail payments with Sweden and Norway.But he admitted it hasn’t yet cracked the problem of anti-money laundering checks  one of the main reasons why cross-border payments using correspondent banking can be so slow and expensive in practice. There’s also a question about who will build any international hub – and whether it will be a grouping of central banks  the International Monetary Fund or some private-sector company that wins the prize.Lieve Mostrey of clearinghouse Euroclear  which is also taking part in a trial to tokenize government bonds with the French central bank  warned there were costs to such experiments involving instantaneous payments such as potential liquidity losses that could end up delaying trades  especially if the transition to any new system isn’t smooth. “It's about interoperability ” Mostrey said. “If we don't get that right  I think migration simply becomes impossible.”Read more: Blockchain’s Non-Crypto Applications Take Center Stage on Davos Day 2",negative,0.0,0.41,0.59,mixed,0.11,0.08,0.81,True,English,"['Davos Day', 'Conflicting Visions', 'Metaverse', 'CBDCs', 'South African central bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago', 'Chief Product Officer Chris Cox', 'Israeli central bank governor', 'central bank digital currencies', 'other social media asset', 'two very different visions', 'The World Economic Forum', 'fellow panelist Neal Stephenson', 'French central bank', 'chief executive officer', 'different digital ecosystems', 'United Arab Emirates', 'influential sci-fi author', 'centralized top-downish organization', 'financial infrastructure bosses', 'limited success stories', 'anti-money laundering checks', 'synchronous digital world', 'Global Collaboration Village', 'International Monetary Fund', 'potential liquidity losses', 'Huda Al Hashimi', 'Javier Perez Tasso', 'unifying payments systems', 'Wednesday press conference', 'cross-border retail payments', 'central bankers', 'central banks', 'digital islands', 'different way', 'cross-border payments', 'global economy', 'two reports', 'legal systems', 'world economy', 'potential cost', 'international hub', 'instantaneous payments', 'The Atlantic', 'immersive, interoperable', 'standard definition', 'Cathy Li', 'Open-ended questions', 'extensive testing', 'deputy minister', 'cabinet affairs', 'strategic affairs', 'same event', 'big companies', 'Google Maps', 'open system', 'early internet', 'shared protocol', 'Snow Crash', 'hard feelings', 'Nicholas Thompson', 'virtual fiat', 'Congress Centre', 'conflicting governance', 'panelists’ comments', 'long way', 'new innovations', 'messaging service', 'retail settlements', 'Amir Yaron', 'main reasons', 'correspondent banking', 'private-sector company', 'Lieve Mostrey', 'government bonds', 'evolving concept', 'interbank transfers', 'Meta Platforms', 'WEF Metaverse', 'DAVOS', 'Switzerland', 'Conversations', 'blockchain', 'architects', 'regulators', 'CBDC', 'harm', 'effort', 'broad', 'times', 'vague', 'hype', 'Facebook', 'transformation', 'head', 'entertainment', 'sport', 'referees', 'gatekeepers', 'code', 'conduct', 'precedence', 'policies', 'smartphone', 'Instagram', 'tools', 'creators', 'builders', 'spaces', 'startups', 'shops', 'difficulty', 'ease', 'Wikipedia', 'coherence', 'connectivity', 'Part', 'Story', 'Crypto', 'kind', 'model', 'term', '1992 novel', 'image', 'Keen', 'coffee', 'QUOTE', 'legs', 'Pros', 'cons', 'topic', 'Interoperability', 'plenty', 'difficulties', 'discussion', 'obstacles', 'technology', 'benefits', 'ways', 'SWIFT', 'fragmentation', 'limits', 'trial', 'Sweden', 'Norway', 'problem', 'practice', 'grouping', 'prize', 'Euroclear', 'costs', 'experiments']",2023-01-18,2023-01-19,finance.yahoo.com
16673,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artprice100-index-blue-chip-artists-070000672.html,The Artprice100© index of Blue-chip artists up 3% over 2022 Vs S&P 500 -19%,As a sales-based indicator  our Artprice100© index reflects a purely financial approach to art that in no way replaces the non-financial relationships...,"PARIS  Jan. 18  2023 /CNW/ -- As a sales-based indicator  our Artprice100© index reflects a purely financial approach to art that in no way replaces the non-financial relationships between art collectors and artists. In essence  our index reveals the hypothetical financial result you would obtain if you were to invest in the world's top-selling artists to benefit financially from their success.Artprice100© vs. S&P 500 – Base 100 in January 2000Artprice100© vs. S&P 500 – Base 100 in January 2000Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1985066/Artprice100_Infographic.jpgArtprice Global Index – Base 100 in January 2000Artprice Global Index – Base 100 in January 2000Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1985067/Artprice_Global_Infographic.jpg""In financial terms  investing in art masterpieces has never been so costly  with auction prices nowadays often reaching eight or nine figures in US dollars. But  at the same time  thanks to joint ownership solutions  it has never been so easy""  says thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice.The Artprice100© index is therefore an essential market benchmark: a purely theoretical exercise simulating investment in the art market's 100 most successful artists without any other aesthetic or preferential consideration. To calculate the index  we construct a portfolio of the world's 100 top-selling artists based on their auction revenue over the previous five years (in this case  1 January 2017 to 31 December 2021). We also apply a liquidity criterion: for each artist  at least ten works (excluding prints and multiples) must have been auctioned annually for them to be included in the calculations (see list of included artists below).The economic context and art market trendsIn global terms  the year 2022 was marked by a range of issues including the fallout and persistent economic impact of the global covid pandemic (inflation  China…) and the new economic challenges posed by the war in Ukraine  notably in terms of energy. Over the 12 months of 2022  the S&P 500 lost 19% of its value while crypto-currencies entered a bear market that substantially slowed NFT transactions.Story continuesHowever  despite these drags on the global economy  the global art auction market had a prosperous year and  indeed  one of the best in its history. Artprice attributes this good performance primarily to the successes achieved by American auction houses  posting record sales with truly sensational results in the painting medium  but also in photography and tapestry. And  as you will see in our comprehensive 2022 Global Art Market Report (to be published at the beginning of March 2023 on www.artprice.com)  strong results in France  Germany  and Hong Kong also stabilized the global art auction market.Among the art market's principal trends in 2022  Artprice noted the more intense than ever competition for masterpieces from the most prestigious collections  which included the Hubert de Givenchy  Thomas Ammann  Yusaku Maezawa  and of course the Paul G. Allen collections. The year's results also showed a continuing voracious appetite for works by very young artists (Ultra-Contemporary Art)  to which Artprice devoted its last Annual Report.www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/the-contemporary-art-market-report-2022Our Global Artprice Index was down 18% in 2022  but our Artprice100© gained 3%Excepting the ultra-high-end of the art market  the global economic context nevertheless prompted art buyers to adopt a generally more cautious stance. With 1 million lots presented worldwide (as recorded by Artprice by Artmarket.com in 2022)  the offer has once again expanded to an unprecedented level  with more than half of the transactions (56% of lots sold) concluded below the threshold of $1 000 (including fees).So  while our Blue-chip 100 Artists Index shows slight growth over the past twelve months (+3%)  overall art market prices posted a contraction of 18%: almost the same contraction as the S&P 500 index. The causes are many and varied  starting with the suspension of art auctions in China and the weakening of the euro against the dollar.It should be noted that many artworks that reached sensational results in auction rooms during 2022 cannot be included in the calculation of our Artprice Global Index. Extremely rare works such as Georges Seurat's Les Poseuses (1888) or fresh canvases such as Avery Singer's Happening (2014) are not included in the calculation of the Global Indices either because there is no repeat sales history  or because there is not enough data to use a hedonic valuation method. For example  there may not be enough similar works in circulation or there is still too little hindsight to assess the value of these works on a regular basis (annually or quarterly).www.artprice.com/artist/26469/georges-seurat/painting/28444347/les-poseuses-ensemble-petite-versionwww.artprice.com/artist/611277/avery-singer/painting/26880003/happeningLastly  the progression of the Arptrice100© index may  in itself  seem weak considering the spectacular results recorded in 2022 for blue-chip artists. However  this index takes into consideration all the works sold by the 100 top-selling and most liquid signatures  and some of these works were much less successful than the most legendary pieces.For example  the third-best result of the year 2022 was hammered for Paul Cézanne's La Montagne Sainte-Victoire (1888-1890). Acquired in 2001 for $38.5 million  this painting was resold for $137.8 million (incl. fees) this year as part of the Paul G. Allen Collection. However  a few days later (17 November)  another painting by Cézanne  Maisons au Chou  à Pontoise (circa 1881)  acquired in 2007 for $6.8 million  was resold for just $3.7 million at Christie's in New York.So  if we compare the Artprice100© and the Global Artprice indices  we see that blue-chip artists managed to get through an economically challenging year with a slight increase in market value and that the rarest masterpieces by these blue-chip signatures clearly posted the best returns.The Artprice100© index: Artist + portfolio weighting in 20221.

In essence  our index reveals the hypothetical financial result you would obtain if you were to invest in the world's top-selling artists to benefit financially from their success.Artprice100© vs. S&P 500 – Base 100 in January 2000Artprice100© vs. S&P 500 – Base 100 in January 2000 Artprice Global Index – Base 100 in January 2000Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1985066/Artprice100_Infographic.jpgArtprice Global Index – Base 100 in January 2000Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1985067/Artprice_Global_Infographic.jpg""In financial terms  investing in art masterpieces has never been so costly  with auction prices nowadays often reaching eight or nine figures in US dollars. But  at the same time  thanks to joint ownership solutions  it has never been so easy""  says thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice.The Artprice100© index is therefore an essential market benchmark: a purely theoretical exercise simulating investment in the art market's 100 most successful artists without any other aesthetic or preferential consideration. To calculate the index  we construct a portfolio of the world's 100 top-selling artists based on their auction revenue over the previous five years (in this case  1 January 2017 to 31 December 2021). We also apply a liquidity criterion: for each artist  at least ten works (excluding prints and multiples) must have been auctioned annually for them to be included in the calculations (see list of included artists below).The economic context and art market trendsIn global terms  the year 2022 was marked by a range of issues including the fallout and persistent economic impact of the global covid pandemic (inflation  China…) and the new economic challenges posed by the war in Ukraine  notably in terms of energy. Over the 12 months of 2022  the S&P 500 lost 19% of its value while crypto-currencies entered a bear market that substantially slowed NFT transactions.However  despite these drags on the global economy  the global art auction market had a prosperous year and  indeed  one of the best in its history. Artprice attributes this good performance primarily to the successes achieved by American auction houses  posting record sales with truly sensational results in the painting medium  but also in photography and tapestry. And  as you will see in our comprehensive 2022 Global Art Market Report (to be published at the beginning of March 2023 on www.artprice.com)  strong results in France  Germany  and Hong Kong also stabilized the global art auction market.Among the art market's principal trends in 2022  Artprice noted the more intense than ever competition for masterpieces from the most prestigious collections  which included the Hubert de Givenchy  Thomas Ammann  Yusaku Maezawa  and of course the Paul G. Allen collections. The year's results also showed a continuing voracious appetite for works by very young artists (Ultra-Contemporary Art)  to which Artprice devoted its last Annual Report.www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/the-contemporary-art-market-report-2022Our Global Artprice Index was down 18% in 2022  but our Artprice100© gained 3%Excepting the ultra-high-end of the art market  the global economic context nevertheless prompted art buyers to adopt a generally more cautious stance. With 1 million lots presented worldwide (as recorded by Artprice by Artmarket.com in 2022)  the offer has once again expanded to an unprecedented level  with more than half of the transactions (56% of lots sold) concluded below the threshold of $1 000 (including fees).So  while our Blue-chip 100 Artists Index shows slight growth over the past twelve months (+3%)  overall art market prices posted a contraction of 18%: almost the same contraction as the S&P 500 index. The causes are many and varied  starting with the suspension of art auctions in China and the weakening of the euro against the dollar.It should be noted that many artworks that reached sensational results in auction rooms during 2022 cannot be included in the calculation of our Artprice Global Index. Extremely rare works such as Georges Seurat's Les Poseuses (1888) or fresh canvases such as Avery Singer's Happening (2014) are not included in the calculation of the Global Indices either because there is no repeat sales history  or because there is not enough data to use a hedonic valuation method. For example  there may not be enough similar works in circulation or there is still too little hindsight to assess the value of these works on a regular basis (annually or quarterly).www.artprice.com/artist/26469/georges-seurat/painting/28444347/les-poseuses-ensemble-petite-versionwww.artprice.com/artist/611277/avery-singer/painting/26880003/happeningLastly  the progression of the Arptrice100© index may  in itself  seem weak considering the spectacular results recorded in 2022 for blue-chip artists. However  this index takes into consideration all the works sold by the 100 top-selling and most liquid signatures  and some of these works were much less successful than the most legendary pieces.For example  the third-best result of the year 2022 was hammered for Paul Cézanne's La Montagne Sainte-Victoire (1888-1890). Acquired in 2001 for $38.5 million  this painting was resold for $137.8 million (incl. fees) this year as part of the Paul G. Allen Collection. However  a few days later (17 November)  another painting by Cézanne  Maisons au Chou  à Pontoise (circa 1881)  acquired in 2007 for $6.8 million  was resold for just $3.7 million at Christie's in New York.So  if we compare the Artprice100© and the Global Artprice indices  we see that blue-chip artists managed to get through an economically challenging year with a slight increase in market value and that the rarest masterpieces by these blue-chip signatures clearly posted the best returns.The Artprice100© index: Artist + portfolio weighting in 20221.

In France  the number of rentals has increased by 14% compared to last year.Genuine solutions for urban mobility which complement public transport networks and walking  self-service bikes (SSB) and medium and long-term rentals contribute to the mitigation of climate change and the improvement of the quality of life in cities thanks to emission-free transport. More than 755 million journeys were completed using the self-service bikes operated by JCDecaux since their roll-out in Vienna (Austria) in 2003  and with a number of French cities returning to levels equivalent or higher than the pre-Covid period (notably in Toulouse with +2% in rentals in 2022 vs 2019 and +14% compared with 2021)  other SSB systems reported exceptional performances in 2022.Numerous records broken in Lyon in 2022Annual rental record  record number of long-term subscribers and record monthly rentals… in 2022  Vélo’v was consistently popular among Lyon’s residents and visitors to the city:After a previous record set in 2021  Vélo’v reported more than 10.5 million rentals during 2022  up 16%.

A genuine success  which has seen the number of rentals multiplied by 7.3 since launch  the system saw its numbers surge in 2022: the 900 Vel’OH! bikes reported close to 1.2 million rentals  i.e. +47% compared with 2021 and +70% compared with 2019With 84 stations and 840 bikes rented on average 5.3 times per day  the city of Ljubljana in Slovenia has one of the most successful self-service bike systems in the world. Since their introduction by JCDecaux in 2011  the Bicikelj bikes have been extremely popular and have given a new lease of life to biking in Ljubljana  which has become one of the 20 cities since 2015 that is most bike-friendly according to the Copenhagenize index. In 2022  the number of rentals was up 35% compared with the pre-Covid periodIn Spain  the country’s two biggest SSB systems enjoyed a recovery in2022: the 2 750 Valenbisi (Valencia) reported a strong growth  with rental numbers up +23% compared with 2021  while the 2 500 Sevici (Seville) reported +17% growth in rentals compared with 2021This success is based on several factors which together show the strength of JCDecaux’s “green mobility” model: proven equipment that is constantly improved  robust and reliable information systems  expert and dedicated operating teams as well as a cutting-edge digital experience. JCDecaux is the only integrated company which designs and operates the equipment  contributing to the continuous improvement of our service worldwide.Since the early 2000s  JCDecaux has worked to bring self-service bikes to as many people as possible. Today  the Group operates more than 25 000 bikes in 10 countries and 73 cities  witha particularly well-developed network in France. As a trusted partner to local authorities in championing intermodal travel  JCDecaux leverages its expertise and powers of innovation to help cities and citizens meet the challenges of mobility. SSBs as well as their related infrastructure are along with bus shelters  among the activities that are eligible for the “Green Taxomony”. This framework which was implemented by the European Commission aims to prioritise the financing of activities that already contribute significantly to the low-carbon transition objectives and also to encourage and accelerate the emergence and expansion of transition activities. In 2021  Taxonomy-eligible revenues amounted to 39% of the Group’s revenue.Jean-Charles Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer of JCDecaux  said: “As 2023 marks the anniversary of our SSB activity  we are proud to have led the way for shared eco-friendly urban mobility in 2003 and to have contributed to promoting changes in behaviour throughout the world. In line with the Group’s business model  we are delighted to finance our bike networks with advertising street furniture so that we can keep subscription and user fees as low as possible without impacting taxpayers. The strong rental levels which we have enjoyed in recent months confirm that bikes have been adopted as a sustainable means of transport for daily journeys across the world.

It accuses Frontline of “unilateral action” that “has no basis” under the terms of the combination agreement signed in July.Frontline maintains that it was within its rights to terminate the agreement.The combination would have created the world’s largest publicly-listed oil tanker owner and operator with a market capitalization of more than $6 billion and 146 vessels  consisting of 68 VLCC  56 Suezmaxes  20 LR2/Aframax and 2 FSO vessels.“Euronav reiterates its determination that Frontline’s unilateral action in pursuing the termination of the combination agreement has no basis under the terms of the combination agreement and that Frontline failed to provide a satisfactory reason for its decision to pursue termination ” Euronav said in a statement on Wednesday. “After careful consideration  the Supervisory Board  entirely composed of independent directors  has considered that this decision is in the corporate benefit of Euronav.”Frontline issued a statement that it “once again confirms that its decision to terminate the combination agreement was entirely lawful.”The latest action comes after Norwegian billionaire John Fredriksen  who controls Frontline  increased his stake in Euronav to 20.31% through Famatown Finance Limited  which is indirectly controlled by trusts settled by Fredriksen for the benefit of his family.Euronav said the emergency arbitration request is being taken as “a precautionary measure” amid Fredriksen’s increased stake in the company that could qualify him  through various entities within his orbit  as a related party.On Tuesday  Euronav’s largest shareholder  the Saverys family-controlled Compagnie Maritime Belge (CMB)  which controls more than 25% of the Euronav and has sought to quash the combination  requested to convene a general shareholders meeting during which CMB will seek to replace Euronav’s existing Supervisory Board with members of its own choosing. According to Belgian law  the meeting must take place within three weeks.The definitive combination agreement agreed to in July 2021 envisioned a stock-for-stock transaction with an exchange ratio of 1.45 Frontline shares for every 1 Euronav share  where Frontline would be the parent and Euronav a majority-controlled subsidiary.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.18,0.82,True,English,"['Frontline Takeover Saga', 'Emergency Arbitration', 'Euronav', 'Saverys family-controlled Compagnie Maritime Belge', 'Norwegian billionaire John Fredriksen', 'oil tanker owner', 'Famatown Finance Limited', 'existing Supervisory Board', 'Belgian tanker company', 'definitive combination agreement', 'emergency arbitration request', 'general shareholders meeting', 'Belgian law', 'application request', 'unilateral action', 'market capitalization', 'satisfactory reason', 'careful consideration', 'independent directors', 'latest action', 'precautionary measure', 'various entities', 'related party', 'largest shareholder', 'three weeks', 'stock transaction', 'exchange ratio', 'majority-controlled subsidiary', '2 FSO vessels', 'corporate benefit', '1.45 Frontline shares', '1 Euronav share', '146 vessels', 'EURN', 'Euronext', 'relation', 'NYSE', 'OSE', 'termination', 'effort', 'deal', 'basis', 'terms', 'July', 'rights', 'world', 'operator', '68 VLCC', '56 Suezmaxes', '20 LR2/Aframax', 'decision', 'statement', 'Wednesday', 'stake', 'trusts', 'orbit', 'Tuesday', 'CMB', 'members', 'choosing', 'place', 'parent']",2023-01-18,2023-01-19,gcaptain.com

A group of the state’s lawmakers proposed legislation that would end the sale of new EVs in Wyoming by 2035.“Wyoming's vast stretches of highway  coupled with a lack of electric vehicle charging infrastructure  make the widespread use of electric vehicles impracticable for the state ” the bill reads.“The expansion of electric vehicle charging stations in Wyoming and throughout the country necessary to support more electric vehicles will require massive amounts of new power generation in order to sustain the misadventure of electric vehicles.”Moreover  the proposed legislation points out that the oil and gas industry has “created countless jobs” in Wyoming and phasing out new EV sales will “ensure the stability” of the industry.To be sure  despite the increasing focus on ESG investing  traditional energy is far from dead. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) — which provides exposure to oil and gas companies — is actually up 39% in the last 12 months  in stark contrast to the S&P 500’s double-digit decline in the same period.Moreover  Wall Street sees further upside in quite a few companies engaged in hydrocarbon exploration. Here’s a look at three of them.ShellHeadquartered in London  Shell (NYSE:SHEL) is a multinational energy giant with operations in more than 70 countries. It produces around 3.2 barrels of oil equivalent per day  has an interest in 10 refineries  and sold 64.2 million tons of liquefied natural gas in 2021.Story continuesIt’s a staple for global investors  too. Shell is listed on the London Stock Exchange  Euronext Amsterdam  and the New York Stock Exchange.The company’s NYSE-listed shares are up 17% over the past year.Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd sees an opportunity in the oil and gas supermajor. The analyst has an ‘overweight’ rating on Shell and a price target of $70.Considering that Shell trades at around $59.50 per share today  Todd’s new price target implies a potential upside of 18%.READ MORE: 4 simple ways to protect your money against white-hot inflation (without being a stock market genius)ChevronChevron (NYSE:CVX) is another oil and gas supermajor that’s benefiting from the commodity boom.For Q3  the company reported earnings of $11.2 billion  which represented an 84% increase from the same period last year. Sales and other operating revenues totaled $64 billion for the quarter  up 49% year over year.Last January  Chevron’s board approved a 6% increase to the quarterly dividend rate to $1.42 per share. That gives the company an annual dividend yield of 3.1%.The stock has enjoyed a nice rally too  climbing 40% in the last 12 months.Earlier this month  Barclays analyst Jeanine Wai reiterated an ‘overweight’ rating on Chevron while raising the price target from $196 to $212. That implies a potential upside of 17% from the current levels.Exxon MobilCommanding a market cap of over $460 billion  Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is bigger than Shell and Chevron.The company also boasts the strongest stock price performance among the three — Exxon shares are up 55% over the past year.It’s not hard to see why investors like the stock: the oil-producing giant gushes profits and cash flow in this commodity price environment. In the first nine months of 2022  Exxon earned $43.0 billion in profits  a huge increase from the $14.2 billion in the year-ago period. Free cash flow totaled $49.8 billion for the first nine months  compared to $22.9 billion in the same period last year.Solid financials allow the company to return cash to investors. Exxon pays quarterly dividends of 91 cents per share  translating to an annual yield of 3.2%.Jefferies analyst Lloyd Byrne has a ‘buy’ rating on Exxon and a price target of $133 — around 17% above where the stock sits today.What to read nextHere's the golden secret to making your retirement fund as secure as Fort KnoxYou could be the landlord of Walmart  Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Americans are paying nearly 40% more on home insurance compared to 12 years ago — here's how to spend less on peace of mindThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

At constant exchange rates  revenue growth was +15.9%. All areas except Latin America  penalized by the downturn in Chile  saw very good double-digit growth over the period. It should be noted that the quarter has a very favorable base effect compared to the same period in 2021  as well as inventory effects linked on the one hand to anticipated price increases  which may have an impact on the first quarter 2023  and on the other hand to the launch of the new ranges  particularly in the USA. Europe (+13.4% at constant rates)  Asia Pacific (+19.9% at constant rates)  and the United States (+38.6% at constant rates) were the biggest contributors in the quarter. Performance in these regions is driven in particular by five countries (the United States  Australia  the United Kingdom  France and India) which generate 75% of quarterly growth. Finally  Latin America (+1.8% at constant exchange rates) was strongly impacted by Chile  which saw a sharp slowdown in sales in the quarter due to the decline in sales on antibiotic and parasiticide products for salmon  following the suspension by the Chilean maritime authority of the marketing authorization of a parasiticide product for its distribution.Story continuesIn terms of species  the companion animals segment was the main driver of growth (+17.7% at constant rates)  particularly in sales of petfood  specialties  the dental range and vaccines  thanks to the reduction in out-of-stock levels and late deliveries in December. The food-producing animals segment is also growing (+9.1% at constant rates)  driven by sales of parasiticide and nutritional products for cattle.Annual consolidated revenueOur annual revenue amounted to €1 216.1 million  compared with €1 064 million  representing an overall increase of +14.3% compared with the same period in 2021. Adjusted for the favorable impact of exchange rates  revenue shows growth of +9.6%. This growth benefited  in part  from a favorable baseline effect representing 0.4 point of growth in revenue  attributable to new products acquired starting in the second quarter of 2021.The successful execution of our strategic plan  supported by the constant commitment of our teams  has enabled us to consolidate our annual organic growth in all areas  despite the slowdown in the market. In Asia Pacific  growth at real exchange rates came to +18.5% (+13.9% at constant exchange rates)  India and Australia continue to drive growth from the area  thanks to products for cattle  representing approximately 80% of the area’s growth. In Europe  revenue is growing at +6.2% at real rates (+5.8% at constant rates). The main contributors to this performance are the United Kingdom  France  Turkey  Italy  and Spain. The area is supported by the strong dynamism of the companion animals ranges (in particular petfood  specialties  and vaccines)  which compensated for the decline in the antibiotic ranges for food-producing animals. In the United States  business grew by +30.2% (+15.7% at constant exchange rates). It benefits from sustained sales on new products launched in 2021 (Clomicalm and Itrafungol) and those launched in early 2022 (petfood  and Tulissin for the food-producing animals segment)  as well as good performances in the dental  specialties (Movoflex  Stelfonta)  and dermatology ranges. Finally  in Latin America  business grew by +17.1% at real rates (+5.6% at constant exchange rates)  thanks in particular to the contribution of Mexico and Brazil  which offset the downturn in Chile.In terms of species  revenue in the companion animals segment grew overall by +15.9% at real rates (+11.9% at constant rates)  mainly driven by very good double-digit growth in the petfood  specialties and dental ranges  as well as a significant contribution from vaccines. The food-producing animals segment also posted growth of +12.3% at real rates (+6.9% at constant exchange rates)  driven by the ruminant sector (+12.5% at constant rates)  which compensates for the decline in the swine-poultry (-2.7% at constant rates) and aquaculture (-16.0% at constant rates) segments compared to the same period of 2021. This was mainly due to lower sales of vaccines and the suspension of the marketing of the parasiticide product mentioned above.OutlookThe exceptional performance of the last quarter  which was unexpected in a market experiencing a sharp downturn  allows us to slightly exceed the top of our revenue range in 2022. We now anticipate a ratio of “current operating income before depreciation of assets from acquisitions” to ""revenues"" that should be around 15% at constant exchange rates  and our debt relief should be around €35 million excluding dividends  at constant scope and exchange rates.For 2023  we can confirm the content of our press release of last December  namely a ratio of “current operating income before depreciation of assets from acquisitions” to “revenues” that should be between 13% and 14% at constant exchange rates  with growth in revenue at constant rates and scope expected to be between 4% and 6%. This deterioration in our adjusted EBIT ratio is primarily the result of our voluntary acceleration of R&D investments to revenue since early 2022  representing in 2023 ~+2 percentage points compared to 2021 and +~1 percentage point compared to 2022  and the expected effects of inflation in 2023. In addition  our cash position is expected to remain constant at the end of 2023 compared to the end of 2022  taking into account the capital expenditure planned over the period  estimated at around 100 million euros  the acceleration of R&D  and excluding any acquisitions.CONSOLIDATED FIGURESNon-audited figuresin millions of euros 2022 2021 Growth Growthat constant exchange rates 1 Growthat constant exchange rates and scope 1 First-quarter revenue 318.1 266.5 +19.3% +16.2% +16.2% Second-quarter revenue 298.3 262.9 +13.5% +7.8% +7.8% Third-quarter revenue 304.8 288.2 +5.8% -0.2% -0.2% Fourth-quarter revenue 294.9 246.4 +19.7% +15.9% +15.9% Annual revenue 1 216.1 1 064.0 +14.3% +9.6% +9.6%A lifelong commitment to the health of animalsAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

16713,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4570498-veolia-stock-another-european-outperformer-remains-buy,Veolia Stock: Another European Outperformer That Remains A Buy,Investing in Europe has not been a bad idea for the past 6-8 months  even if the initial results were somewhat disheartening. Here's a solid Buy idea in Veolia.,"HJBC/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesDear readers/followers Veolia (OTCPK:VEOEY) is the sort of company I believe you want to own long-term as a conservative investor. I'm certain that I do - and that's why I've owned a small position in the company for some time  which I added to back in august and October  bringing it to a current size of around 0.4% of my portfolio.Its three service/business segments are necessary to everyday human life  which is one of the favorite qualities of investments that I make - and that's also why the company  despite being off its lows and despite being a positive investment from the view of my RoR since investing  is one I continue to put capital into at a slow pace.Seeking Alpha Veolia Article (Seeking Alpha Veolia Article)Updating on VeoliaVeolia is 170 years old and has during its history been part of conglomerates and other businesses. Its area of focus is typical government responsibilities  and the company is one of the only businesses I know of that works with hazardous waste on a global scale - and by global  I mean that it does exist on every single continent.Veolia IR (Veolia IR)This is also a market that's likely to grow  going forward  and one that's unlikely to see any sort of massive volatility in terms of its fundamentals. The company is ""too good"" for that to be the case. Despite being a company with a €20B+ market cap  it's still only a small portion of the global market for these services  because the market for them is so incredibly fragmented. In most areas  this is government and public responsibility.This also means that the scaling potential for this business is nothing short of amazing  and Veolia isn't the only player that has seen this opportunity. Plenty of Chinese players are trying to enter the market  especially in Europe  in order to consolidate operations. Examples of such companies are EEW and Urbaser. Veolia is competing back  by actively M&A'ing and growing wherever possible in order to maintain its scaling advantages and growth.On a high level  the company is Waste  Water  and Energy - all of these areas putting the company very much in the position of being a globally ""necessary"" company. Geographically speaking  the company is a legacy central European operator moving into emerging markets in the search for growth. The mature markets serve as a solid foundation for its expansion and growth.In the mature areas  over 50% of its operations  the company wants to expand its asset-light service base to ensure its margins stay good  while in emerging markets the company seeks to expand its assets  to establish margins and operations.The combination makes for an attractive proposal  at least if this in any way materializes. It provides the company with a good potential for growth. France is 30% of its operations  Europe is another 30%  with Asia and other geographies coming in at around 40% in the remainder - so it's still heavily France-centric  despite having managed to leave its home shores.While Veolia does have GDP-specific cyclicality to its earnings  there are still baseline demands for the company's water  recycling and energy operations which really don't disappear. Furthermore  the utility-like segments have far more stability than those tied to GDP  such as hazardous waste.Waste treatment income and pricing cycles are dependent on energy prices  which makes the company sensitive to energy pricing cycles  at least in the waste segment. This is not the case for Water  where pricing and sourcing conditions are more stable  and margins are more stable as well.In most markets  it is the municipality that sets the price of water after deliberation by the elected members of the municipal council  taking into account the variations in various factors such as inflation  wages and any other external element.The results have been good. The latest set of results we have to look at are the 3Q22  and the company saw very impressive trends with revenues and profits both on the rise.Revenue is up 13.7% YoY  and EBITDA is up almost 10% as well  with current pre-tax profit up almost 17% due to positive FX.Veolia IR (Veolia IR)Mergers ahead of schedule  good growth  resilience  and execution advantages - it's all good stuff coming in here. The company is also pushing pricing for its regulating bodies for its typical government services  and has managed higher indexations and record price increases for its services  with municipal water  waste  district heating  building energy services  and double-digit increases for Hazardous waste.All in all  the companies and customers are seeing problematic pricing  but Veolia is enjoying its position and being able to offset most cost/inflation increases by pushing pricing here.Also  we've more or less seen that Veolia is able to adapt its business model to meet the needs of a changing market. The ongoing energy crisis has reinforced the company's leadership in alternative  locally-sourced energy. The 2 company's main lines of business in energy are municipal and energy services and the company has already secured fuel not just for 2022  but for winter 2023 as well  as well for the beginning of 2024. Company activities in this segment are also  naturally  boosted by the high energy prices we are currently seeing.Veolia is also seeking new opportunities in this segment.Veolia IR (Veolia IR)Additionally  the company is able to showcase some very excellent trends in waste collection  with new contracts and new business opportunities. For instance  hazardous waste management in Abu Dhabi is on the list here...Veolia IR (Veolia IR)...and also  the company is increasing its water growth platform.Veolia IR (Veolia IR)The company has been able to deliver good cost discipline  and because it has been able to grow earnings  grow revenues  and deliver cost discipline and growth projects  this puts the company in a very good position to:Continue showcasing a very resilient sort of business  with a high efficiencyContinue to deliver on accreditive and attractive mergers  like the Suez one  with €500M in cumulated synergies that are already ahead of schedule.Continue to work with a class-leading balance sheet and a sub-3x leverage post its divestment activities.Continue to grow in the next 2 years  fuelled by synergy  efficiency  and positives  regardless of how the macro goes.Continue to pay out an attractive 3-4% dividend  with the current dividend now confirmed for the coming year.Because of this  I continue to call Veolia attractive as an investment here  and I go into the valuation section with this in mind.The valuation for Veolia is convincing - it's time to move in deeperThe company has delivered a Full-year guidance for this fiscal.Veolia IR (Veolia IR)And while the company does remain correlated to GDP  infrastructure expansion  and population growth  the company's fundamentals and strategies are so solid that I don't view these company risks as all that relevant to the long-term overall thesis here.The company's one problem as I will say here  which also influences valuation  is its management. French companies are sometimes out of line with international ambitions - and this board has been slow on the uptake  instead for a long time being happy to let the company percolate in the single digits in a slow-moving national market. While this seems to be changing now  it's worth mentioning that German and French boards need watching to ensure they don't grow lax - and Veolia has been lax for some time. We need to keep an eye on this company's trends to make sure that things don't go out of bounds  and that the company continues to grow in line with expectations.Veolia has an interesting valuation because even after a double-digit market outperformance  I would say that Veolia is still significantly undervalued here.My own DCF work here  even with only a 2-3% EBITDA growth range and assuming as high a WACC as 8%  give us a ~€35 PT  which is down a bit from my last article  but I'm being conservative here to make sure that we're not straying too far from impacting the company's management and its somewhat weak historicals.Remember  there aren't many relevant peers to the company. We could argue for American Water Works (AWK) and United Utilities (OTCPK:UUGRY). We also have Hera and FCC in Europe  as well as LYDEC  though this company doesn't have close to a comparable market cap.Because of that  NAV  DCF  and historicals are the more interesting here  as I see it  and the more indicative of where the company could go in the long term. We of course also look at analysts overall  and where they compare in terms of PTs.VIE trades on Euronext  and for the native ticker  we have a low of €21 per share and a high of €44 per share. 14 analysts follow the business  and 11 of them see an upside that's in the double digits here  coming to an average of €31/share.I continue to believe that below €30/share  this company has utility-like safety and a massive  potential upside for conservative investors. There really isn't much to ""dislike"" about Veolia here  especially at this price.My PT in my last article was €35/share  and while I impair this slightly to account for the higher costs of capital  costs of debt and overall costs of equity/expectations for returns  more than a €1 impairment down to €34/share is not something I'm willing to do.Remember  the market is a violent and volatile place  in terms of ups and downs. It's my ""job"" as an analyst and a conservative investor to look past the noise - go past all of the ""yelling""  and try to find the sort of underlying truth here. As I see it  this is best done using math - historicals  forecasts  and facts.We're no longer as cheap  but at $29 for the ADR  I believe we're still cheaper enough to interest you  given that the company is expected to grow at no less than 13-15% CAGR over the next 3 years.Even conservatively at a range of 15-18x P/E  this implies an upside of no less than 14-15% annually  and as much as 20-30% in the case of full normalization  which would allow for triple-digit returns.Veolia Upside (F.A.S.T graphs)Veolia remains conservatively BBB rated  and the dividend remains well-covered. All in all  I see a double-digit upside here for Veolia  and this leads me to my updated thesis for 2023.Thesis for the common shareVeolia is an attractive  undervalued utility-like company with recession-resistant sector exposure. While the company does have risks and potential downturns due to its correlations  the upside here is significant.The company has a solid set of 3Q22 results and is expecting results to still improve in the next couple of quarters. The company is still undervalued here - more than a double-digit upside isn't unlikely here.I view Veolia as a ""BUY"" here  and I give the company a PT of €34 - a downward adjustment of €1.Remember  I'm all about:Buying undervalued - even if that undervaluation is slight and not mind-numbingly massive - companies at a discount  allowing them to normalize over time and harvesting capital gains and dividends in the meantime.If the company goes well beyond normalization and goes into overvaluation  I harvest gains and rotate my position into other undervalued stocks  repeating #1.If the company doesn't go into overvaluation but hovers within a fair value  or goes back down to undervaluation  I buy more as time allows.I reinvest proceeds from dividends  savings from work  or other cash inflows as specified in #1.Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (italicized).This company is overall qualitative.This company is fundamentally safe/conservative & well-run.This company pays a well-covered dividend.This company is currently cheap.This company has a realistic upside that is high enough  based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion.This company fulfills every single one of my fundamental requirements - and is a ""BUY"" here.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The Company is focused on bringing early-stagefirst-in-class or disruptive compounds from translational research to clinical proof-of-concept  a value-creating inflection point appealing to potential partners.platON™ is Onxeo's proprietary chemistry platform of oligonucleotides acting as decoy agonists  which generates new innovative compounds and broaden the Company's product pipeline.AsiDNA  the first compound from platON  is a highly differentiated  clinical-stagefirst-in-class candidate in the field of DNA damage response (DDR) applied to oncology. Its decoy and agonist mechanism acting upstream of multiple DDR pathways results in distinctive antitumor properties  including the ability to prevent or abrogate tumor resistance to targeted therapies such as PARP inhibitors and strong synergy with tumor DNA-damaging agents such as radio- chemotherapy. AsiDNA is currently being studied in Europe and the US in combination with other treatment modalities in difficult-to-treat solid tumors.OX425  the second compound from platON  is a novel DDR Decoy Agonist with high antitumor activity. It also mediates multiple immunostimulatory effects by activating the STING pathway. OX425 is currently undergoing IND-enabling preclinical development.For further information  please visit www.onxeo.com.Forward looking statementsThis communication expressly or implicitly contains certain forward-looking statements concerning Onxeo and its business.

Shipments in Q4 were near record levels  with both transshipment vessels achieving high availability following the recent dry dock of the Bronagh J.Despite some macroeconomic headwinds  we continue to see a robust market for our products  with strong pricing achieved in Q4 2022. As China further relaxes COVID-19 restrictions  we expect higher domestic demand to support our sales in the region.Kenmare has moved to a net cash position of $27.5 million at the end of 2022  which represents a $110.3 million improvement from the previous year  whilst also having paid record dividends. We continue to target a total dividend payment of 25% of profit after tax in respect of 2022.”OverviewLost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.09 per 200 000 hours worked to 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: 0.03)2022 revised production guidance achieved for ilmenite and rutile while original production guidance achieved for primary zircon and concentratesHeavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production increased 2% in 2022 to 1 586 200 tonnes (2021: 1 555 900 tonnes)  benefitting from higher tonnes mined and improved gradesIlmenite production decreased 3% in 2022 to 1 088 300 tonnes (2021: 1 119 400 tonnes)Shipments of finished products of 1 075 600 tonnes in 2022  a 16% decrease compared to record tonnes shipped in 2021  reflecting planned maintenance on the transshipment fleet51% increase in the interim 2022 dividend to USc10.98 per share (H1 2021: USc7.29)  paid in OctoberNet cash of $27.5 million at year-end 2022 (2021: $82.8 million net debt)  with cash and cash equivalents of $108.3 million (year-end 2021: $69.1 million)Higher average prices achieved for all products in 20222023 ilmenite production guidance range of 1 050 000 to 1 150 000 tonnesStory continuesOperations updateOperational results for the Moma Mine in Q4 2022 and 2022 were as follows:Q4 2022 vs Q4 2021 vs Q3 2022 2022 vs 2021 tonnes % change % change tonnes % change Excavated ore1 10 145 000 9% -3% 40 029 000 2% Grade1 4.75% 10% -4% 4.61% 0% Production HMC produced 404 000 17% -9% 1 586 200 2% HMC processed 397 900 13% -10% 1 578 900 -1% Ilmenite 283 900 15% -7% 1 088 300 -3% Primary zircon 14 600 18% -16% 58 400 4% Rutile 2 200 5% -15% 8 900 0% Concentrates2 11 700 4% -10% 45 200 3% Shipments 365 700 -1% 28% 1 075 600 -16%Excavated ore and grade prior to any floor losses. Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.Unfortunately  three lost time injuries were recorded in the 12 months to 31 December 2022  following a period of over 18 months of being LTI free  resulting in a rolling 12-month LTIFR of 0.09 per 200 000 hours worked (31 December 2021: 0.03). The Company is redoubling efforts to ensure consistent observance of good safety practices is foremost in our employees’ minds.HMC production in 2022 was 1 586 200 tonnes  a 2% increase compared to 2021 (1 555 900 tonnes). Whilst an improvement on 2021  excavated ore and recoveries were impacted by power outages  mining conditions and slimes  as well as the previously reported bad weather in Q1.HMC production in Q4 2022 was 404 000 tonnes  a 17% increase compared to Q4 2021 (343 900 tonnes)  due to higher tonnes of excavated ore and higher grades. However  as previously noted by the Company in its Guidance Update on 25 November 2022  HMC production was also curtailed by unplanned power disruptions caused by issues with the Electricidade de Moçambique (“EdM”) transmission grid. Kenmare worked closely with EdM to resolve these specific issues and by mid-December 2022  power stability improved  and utilisations increased.For 2022  ilmenite production of 1 088 300 tonnes was within revised guidance of 1 080 000 to 1 110 000 tonnes  with rutile production also within revised guidance. Production of primary zircon and concentrates was within original guidance  despite the impacts of unplanned power outages towards the end of the year.Ilmenite production was impacted by the reduced HMC feedstock available due to the challenges highlighted above and the impact of slimes on HMC quality  partially offset by a 1% improvement in ilmenite recovery.Record primary zircon production of 58 400 tonnes was delivered in 2022  increasing by 4% compared to 2021 (56 300 tonnes). Production benefitted from improved recoveries  resulting from the implementation of a flocculation process to provide cleaner process water  as well as the successful implementation of the rotary uninterruptable power supply (“RUPS”)  which provided steadier operating conditions.Rutile production in 2022 was in line with 2021  although higher slimes impacted recoveries at the mine  partially offset by recovery improvements in the Mineral Separation Plant.Record concentrates production of 45 200 tonnes was delivered in 2022  increasing by 3% compared to 2021 (43 900 tonnes). Secondary zircon tonnes fell 4% due to lower zircon contained in the feed  as more was recovered into primary products. This was more than offset by record mineral sands concentrate production  increasing 19% compared to 2021  benefitting from the processing of stockpiles.Production of all finished products increased in Q4 2022 compared to Q4 2021  because of higher HMC processed.Kenmare produced 283 900 tonnes of ilmenite in Q4 2022  a 15% increase compared to Q4 2021  and a 7% decrease compared to Q3 2022. This was the result of weaker HMC production due to unplanned power outages in the period limiting HMC feed availability  partially offset by drawdown of magnetic feed stock. Similarly  Q4 2022 production of primary zircon  rutile and concentrates decreased from Q3 2022 due to lower HMC processed  although recoveries increased relative to Q4 2021.Shipment volumes in 2022 were 1 075 600 tonnes  a 16% decrease compared to 2021 (1 285 300 tonnes). This was primarily due to a 4-month period of planned maintenance  which occurs every five years  on the Company’s largest transshipment vessel  the Bronagh J. Shipments during the year were comprised of 953 395 tonnes of ilmenite  60 520 tonnes of primary zircon  12 933 tonnes of rutile and 48 782 tonnes of concentrates.Q4 2022 was the strongest quarter of the year for shipments and close to a record  with 365 700 tonnes shipped. Volumes were down 1% compared to Q4 2021 (368 600 tonnes). Shipments in Q4 2022 were comprised of 324 200 tonnes of ilmenite  21 700 tonnes of primary zircon  2 800 tonnes of rutile and 17 000 tonnes of concentrates.Closing stock of HMC at the end of 2022 was 18 800 tonnes  compared with 11 600 tonnes at the start of the year. Closing stock of finished products at the end of 2022 was 213 500 tonnes  compared with 88 700 tonnes at the end of 2021.Capital projects updateWork continues on the Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”) for the Nataka ore zone  where WCP A is scheduled to commence mining around 2025. The Company plans to provide a full update of the studies at a Capital Markets Day on 26 April 2023. It is estimated that the capital cost of the WCP A relocation to Nataka is unlikely to be less than $225 million. In addition  the Environmental Impact Assessment for the project continues to make good progress.Finance updateOn 21 October 2022  Kenmare paid its interim 2022 dividend of USc10.98 per share (H1 2021: USc7.29)  for a total distribution of $10.4 million. The Company continues to target a total dividend payment of 25% of profit after tax in respect of 2022.At 31 December 2022  Kenmare had net cash of $27.5 million (2021: $82.8 million net debt). Cash and cash equivalents were $108.3 million (2021: $69.1 million) and gross bank loans  including accrued interest  were $80.8 million (2021: $151.9 million).Market update2022 was a strong year for Kenmare’s product markets  resulting in record average prices received for all products. Prices received for ilmenite  the Company’s primary product  increased 29% on an FOB basis compared with 2021 due to tight market conditions  most notably in the first half when pigment producers were constrained due to shortages of titanium feedstocks.Pigment demand decreased through the year as the global economic outlook weakened and the Chinese zero COVID-19 policy muted industrial activity. The conflict in Ukraine contributed to energy price inflation  particularly in Europe  pressuring pigment producer margins due to their energy-intensive operations. From a supply perspective  there have been increases in the supply of low-quality ilmenite products entering China  particularly from Mozambique.Despite these factors impacting the market  Kenmare continued to see robust demand for its high-quality ilmenite products  achieving a ninth consecutive ilmenite price increase in Q4 2022 as customers continue to value supply security.Spot prices for ilmenite decreased towards the end of the year  as the pigment market weakened  and this has continued into early 2023. However  it is widely expected that the pigment market destocking further downstream will normalise in early 2023.Kenmare achieved record average prices for zircon products in 2022  up 38% on an FOB basis compared with 2021. Global zircon supply decreased in 2022  due to the depletion of industry stockpiles in the first half of the year. Major suppliers maintained stable pricing during the second half  which has continued into early 2023. Despite this  spot prices in China decreased in H2 2022  due to lower domestic demand  but have stabilised in recent weeks as demand has improved.2023 guidance2023 guidance for production and operating costs is as follows:Unit 2023 Guidance 2022 Actual Production Ilmenite tonnes 1 050 000 – 1 150 000 1 088 300 Primary zircon tonnes 51 000 – 57 000 58 400 Rutile tonnes 8 000 – 9 000 8 900 Concentrates1 tonnes 37 000 – 41 000 45 200 Costs Total cash operating costs $m 208 - 228 N/R2 Cash costs per tonne of finished product $/t 170 - 188 N/R2Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate. To be reported in full year financial statements.Ilmenite production in 2023 is expected to be between 1.05 million to 1.15 million tonnes.Closing product inventories at the end of 2022 were above normal levels  which provides flexibility regarding shipment volumes in 2023. 2023 shipments will depend on market conditions and the cadence of production through the year.Total cash operating costs are anticipated to increase in 2023 due to cost increases in labour  power and fuel as a result of forecast inflation  as well as one-off operational costs associated with traversing the Namalope West area at WCP A and increased insurance costs. As previously noted by the Company in its Guidance Update on 25 November 2022  total cash operating costs for 2022 are anticipated to be very slightly above the top end of guidance ($190-210 million)  due primarily to higher fuel prices. Full details of 2022 costs will be provided when the 2022 Preliminary Results are reported.Expenditure on development projects and studies is expected to be approximately $14 million in 2023. These costs primarily relate to ongoing feasibility works for the Nataka ore zone where WCP A is scheduled to commence mining around 2025  and for optimising mining capacity.Improvement projects are expected to cost $8.5 million and relate to numerous smaller projects in water  energy and security management. There are also projects relating to improvements at WCP A  WCP B and the Mineral Separation Plant.Sustaining capital costs in 2023 are expected to be approximately $33.5 million.Kenmare plans to release its 2022 Preliminary Results on Wednesday  22 March 2023. In addition  the Company also plans to host a Capital Markets Day for analysts and investors on Wednesday  26 April 2023.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Michael StarkeInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

In essence  our index reveals the hypothetical financial result you would obtain if you were to invest in the world's top-selling artists to benefit financially from their success.Artprice100© vs. S&P 500 – Base 100 in January 2000Artprice100© vs. S&P 500 – Base 100 in January 2000Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1985066/Artprice100_Infographic.jpgArtprice Global Index – Base 100 in January 2000Artprice Global Index – Base 100 in January 2000Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1985067/Artprice_Global_Infographic.jpg""In financial terms  investing in art masterpieces has never been so costly  with auction prices nowadays often reaching eight or nine figures in US dollars. But  at the same time  thanks to joint ownership solutions  it has never been so easy""  says thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice.The Artprice100© index is therefore an essential market benchmark: a purely theoretical exercise simulating investment in the art market's 100 most successful artists without any other aesthetic or preferential consideration. To calculate the index  we construct a portfolio of the world's 100 top-selling artists based on their auction revenue over the previous five years (in this case  1 January 2017 to 31 December 2021). We also apply a liquidity criterion: for each artist  at least ten works (excluding prints and multiples) must have been auctioned annually for them to be included in the calculations (see list of included artists below).The economic context and art market trendsIn global terms  the year 2022 was marked by a range of issues including the fallout and persistent economic impact of the global covid pandemic (inflation  China…) and the new economic challenges posed by the war in Ukraine  notably in terms of energy. Over the 12 months of 2022  the S&P 500 lost 19% of its value while crypto-currencies entered a bear market that substantially slowed NFT transactions.Story continuesHowever  despite these drags on the global economy  the global art auction market had a prosperous year and  indeed  one of the best in its history. Artprice attributes this good performance primarily to the successes achieved by American auction houses  posting record sales with truly sensational results in the painting medium  but also in photography and tapestry. And  as you will see in our comprehensive 2022 Global Art Market Report (to be published at the beginning of March 2023 on www.artprice.com)  strong results in France  Germany  and Hong Kong also stabilized the global art auction market.Among the art market's principal trends in 2022  Artprice noted the more intense than ever competition for masterpieces from the most prestigious collections  which included the Hubert de Givenchy  Thomas Ammann  Yusaku Maezawa  and of course the Paul G. Allen collections. The year's results also showed a continuing voracious appetite for works by very young artists (Ultra-Contemporary Art)  to which Artprice devoted its last Annual Report.www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/the-contemporary-art-market-report-2022Our Global Artprice Index was down 18% in 2022  but our Artprice100© gained 3%Excepting the ultra-high-end of the art market  the global economic context nevertheless prompted art buyers to adopt a generally more cautious stance. With 1 million lots presented worldwide (as recorded by Artprice by Artmarket.com in 2022)  the offer has once again expanded to an unprecedented level  with more than half of the transactions (56% of lots sold) concluded below the threshold of $1 000 (including fees).So  while our Blue-chip 100 Artists Index shows slight growth over the past twelve months (+3%)  overall art market prices posted a contraction of 18%: almost the same contraction as the S&P 500 index. The causes are many and varied  starting with the suspension of art auctions in China and the weakening of the euro against the dollar.It should be noted that many artworks that reached sensational results in auction rooms during 2022 cannot be included in the calculation of our Artprice Global Index. Extremely rare works such as Georges Seurat's Les Poseuses (1888) or fresh canvases such as Avery Singer's Happening (2014) are not included in the calculation of the Global Indices either because there is no repeat sales history  or because there is not enough data to use a hedonic valuation method. For example  there may not be enough similar works in circulation or there is still too little hindsight to assess the value of these works on a regular basis (annually or quarterly).www.artprice.com/artist/26469/georges-seurat/painting/28444347/les-poseuses-ensemble-petite-versionwww.artprice.com/artist/611277/avery-singer/painting/26880003/happeningLastly  the progression of the Arptrice100© index may  in itself  seem weak considering the spectacular results recorded in 2022 for blue-chip artists. However  this index takes into consideration all the works sold by the 100 top-selling and most liquid signatures  and some of these works were much less successful than the most legendary pieces.For example  the third-best result of the year 2022 was hammered for Paul Cézanne's La Montagne Sainte-Victoire (1888-1890). Acquired in 2001 for $38.5 million  this painting was resold for $137.8 million (incl. fees) this year as part of the Paul G. Allen Collection. However  a few days later (17 November)  another painting by Cézanne  Maisons au Chou  à Pontoise (circa 1881)  acquired in 2007 for $6.8 million  was resold for just $3.7 million at Christie's in New York.So  if we compare the Artprice100© and the Global Artprice indices  we see that blue-chip artists managed to get through an economically challenging year with a slight increase in market value and that the rarest masterpieces by these blue-chip signatures clearly posted the best returns.The Artprice100© index: Artist + portfolio weighting in 20221.

Euronav is requesting to suspend such termination pending a determination on the merits pursuing primarily the specific performance of the combination agreement. Another request regarding such merits of Frontline having unilaterally terminated the Combination Agreement will be filed soon.Following the acquisition of additional shares by Famatown Finance Limited (as disclosed in the Company's press release dated 16 January 2023) Frontline plc  Famatown Finance Limited  Hemen Holding Limited and Geveran Trading Co. Limited. could be qualified as a related party in the meaning of IAS24. As a precautionary measure the Supervisory Board has therefore taken the decision in relation to the initiation of proceedings against Frontline plc  Famatown Finance Limited  Hemen Holding Limited and Geveran Trading Co. Limited in accordance with the procedure provided for in article 7:116 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations.Euronav reiterates its determination that Frontline's unilateral action in pursuing the termination of the combination agreement has no basis under the terms of the combination agreement and that Frontline failed to provide a satisfactory reason for its decision to pursue termination.

16753,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/95449/euromnext-to-shift-derivatives-clearing-to-italy,Euromnext to shift derivatives clearing to Italy,Euronext  the leading pan-European market infrastructure  today announces that the European expansion of Euronext Clearing to Euronext derivatives markets is planned for Q3 2024.,Source: EuronextEuronext  the leading pan-European market infrastructure  today announces that the European expansion of Euronext Clearing to Euronext derivatives markets is planned for Q3 2024.Since April 2021  Euronext has been the owner of a multi-asset clearing house  Euronext Clearing (formerly CC&G)  and is thus in a position to directly manage its clearing activities to complete its value chain. In November 2021  Euronext announced its ambition to internalise the clearing activity of its cash and derivatives flows  today operated by third-party providers. As a result Euronext Clearing will become Euronext’s clearing house (“CCP”) of choice for cash equity1  listed derivatives and commodities markets.Combined with the successful migration of its Core Data Centre in June 2022 from Basildon (United Kingdom) to Bergamo (Italy) and the planned migration of the Borsa Italiana capital markets to Optiq®  Euronext’s proprietary trading platform  the expansion of Euronext Clearing will allow Euronext to manage the entire trading value chain of its markets by the end of 2024. Euronext will directly operate clearing activities for its cash  listed derivatives and commodities markets  and create value through a harmonised clearing framework across Euronext venues. It will provide one single platform for clients to access information on collateral  risk  and clearing. Euronext Clearing will bring margin efficiencies to clients with the implementation of a new Value-at-Risk methodology  offering the financial ecosystem with increasingly efficient and resilient solutions for risk capture and allocation within the system. This move will also bring efficiencies across all asset classes  with transparency on data  particularly on settlement  leveraging Euronext Securities to access the Target-2-Securities (T2S) settlement platform. Euronext Clearing will allow Euronext to significantly increase its footprint in the post-trade space and align strategic priorities between trading and clearing. Euronext will be in an ideal position to innovate and improve time-to-market  notably on derivatives products  to serve the evolving needs of its clients.Positioning of Euronext Clearing as the CCP of choice across its cash equity markets[1]As announced on 3 November 2022  Euronext confirms the first phase of the expansion of Euronext Clearing with the expected positioning of Euronext Clearing as the Euronext CCP of choice for its cash equity markets1 by the end of Q4 2023. Euronext will continue to offer an open access CCP model for cash equity clearing.Migration[2] of Euronext listed derivatives and commodities markets to Euronext Clearing expected in Q3 2024Euronext confirms it expects to migrate the listed financial derivatives and commodities markets of Euronext Amsterdam  Euronext Brussels  Euronext Lisbon  Oslo Børs and Euronext Paris from LCH SA to Euronext Clearing by Q3 2024. As a reminder  Euronext Clearing already clears Euronext Milan listed derivatives.The migration of Euronext listed derivatives and commodities markets is the final step of the European expansion of Euronext Clearing set up as part of Euronext ‘Growth for Impact 2024’ strategic plan. It will unlock innovation capabilities  notably on derivatives products. Furthermore  the migration will maximise value extraction through a harmonised clearing framework across Euronext venues and deliver on the announced targeted run-rate annual synergies for 2024.Euronext and LCH SA are committed to working together to ensure an orderly migration of clearing flows from LCH SA to Euronext Clearing.Notification of early termination of the derivatives clearing agreement (the “Agreement”) with LCH SAAs Euronext Clearing undertakes derivatives clearing services in Europe  Euronext has decided to terminate the existing Agreement with LCH SA  under the terms of the Agreement. Therefore  on 16 January 2023  Euronext served LCH SA notice of termination for the purposes of the Agreement.As set up in the Agreement  Euronext will pay a termination fee of approximately €36.0[3] million to LCH SA  to be provisioned in its income statement as non-underlying expenses in Q1 2023  and payable in 2024. It is reminded that this amount is included in the €150 million of implementation costs related to the ‘Growth for Impact 2024’ strategic plan and already announced in November 2021.Following the notification of the early termination of the Agreement  LCH Group has the option to buy back Euronext's 11.1% stake in LCH SA. Further communications on the stake owned by Euronext in LCH SA will be made when appropriate.The termination of the Agreement does not impact the existing clearing agreement signed between MTS S.p.A and LCH SA nor the existing agreement related to the interoperability link on Italian Government Bonds between Euronext Clearing and LCH SA[4].Stéphane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:“We are pleased to announce that the migration of Euronext derivatives clearing activities to Euronext Clearing is planned for Q3 2024  a few months after the migration of Euronext cash clearing activities. Combined with the successful migration of the Core Data Centre to Bergamo in June 2022 and the planned migration of the Borsa Italiana capital markets to Optiq® in 2023  the expansion of our clearing activities is a major step towards the delivery our “Growth for Impact 2024” strategic plan. This will significantly contribute to achieve the €100 million 2024 targeted run-rate annual synergies related to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition.Euronext has profoundly transformed itself over the past five years and is uniquely positioned to become the leading European market infrastructure. Euronext is now the leading listing venue and the largest liquidity pool in Europe  thanks to its single trading platform. The expansion of Euronext Clearing to Euronext markets is another significant transformational milestone  allowing Euronext to manage the entire trading value chain  and become a major player in the post-trade space.We look forward to completing these strategic milestones in the coming months. I would like to thank all the Euronext teams that have already been working on these key projects for more than a year and that will be critical to the delivery of these projects. I would like to thank LCH SA for the great collaboration during the past years.”,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,positive,0.91,0.09,0.0,True,English,"['Euromnext', 'derivatives', 'Italy', 'MTS S.p.A', 'leading pan-European market infrastructure', 'Borsa Italiana capital markets', 'open access CCP model', 'entire trading value chain', 'one single platform', 'Oslo Børs', 'run-rate annual synergies', 'Italian Government Bonds', 'Stéphane Boujnah', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'proprietary trading platform', 'Impact 2024’ strategic plan', 'cash equity markets1', 'harmonised clearing framework', 'Core Data Centre', 'T2S) settlement platform', 'multi-asset clearing house', 'cash equity clearing', 'LCH SA notice', 'derivatives clearing services', 'existing clearing agreement', 'Euronext derivatives markets', 'derivatives clearing agreement', 'strategic priorities', 'commodities markets', 'new Value', 'value extraction', 'clearing activity', 'clearing flows', 'LCH Group', 'CC&G', 'derivatives flows', 'third-party providers', 'listed derivatives', 'United Kingdom', 'margin efficiencies', 'financial ecosystem', 'resilient solutions', 'asset classes', 'post-trade space', 'derivatives products', 'evolving needs', 'first phase', 'financial derivatives', 'final step', 'innovation capabilities', 'income statement', 'underlying expenses', 'Further communications', 'interoperability link', 'Managing Board', 'existing Agreement', 'clearing activities', 'Euronext Clearing', 'Risk methodology', 'risk capture', 'early termination', 'termination fee', 'Euronext venues', 'Euronext Securities', 'Euronext CCP', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Euronext Brussels', 'Euronext Lisbon', 'Euronext Paris', 'Euronext Milan', 'European expansion', 'ideal position', 'expected positioning', 'implementation costs', 'successful migration', 'orderly migration', 'Euronext ‘Growth', 'Source', 'Q3', 'April', 'owner', 'November', 'ambition', 'result', 'choice', 'June', 'Basildon', 'Bergamo', 'Italy', 'planned', 'Optiq®', 'end', 'clients', 'information', 'collateral', 'efficient', 'allocation', 'move', 'transparency', 'Target-2-Securities', 'footprint', 'time', 'Q4', 'reminder', 'targeted', 'Notification', 'terms', '16 January', 'purposes', 'Q1', 'amount', 'option', '11.1% stake', 'Chairman']",2023-01-18,2023-01-19,finextra.com

""The hotels we will feature in Handwritten Collection are those sought out by travelers who appreciate heartwarming travel experiences and a twist on traditional hospitality  as well as by hoteliers who cherish the unique personality of their properties while desiring the benefits that come with a leading global partner.""With the creation of Handwritten Collection  Accor is broadening its unrivalled brand portfolio and midscale hotel offerings and will look to replicate the success it has achieved with the Group's other collection brands across other segments. This includes the MGallery Hotel Collection  a storied portfolio in the upper upscale brand segment that now counts more than 100 boutique hotels worldwide and Emblems Collection  Accor's first luxury collection brand  a carefully curated selection of distinctive hotels that are emblematic of their destination  designer or place in history.

Like a handwritten note  each host's individual touches will be subtly encountered at select moments throughout the guest journey. From a warm welcome that cascades into conversation  to freshly baked treats that have guests sneaking seconds into their pockets  no two hotels or stays will be the same.A Host with PassionHandwritten Collection offers a variety of hotels that are so distinct  it's as if each local hotelier were inviting guests into their charming and stylish homes. The guest experience at Handwritten Collection brings to life the spirit of the host: their tastes  their passions and the little quirks of their personality. Each local hotelier provides a charming presence that weaves their character and personality into the fabric of their hotel  engaging guests with local wisdom and delightful conversation  bringing a personalized energy to the guest experience.""The manner in which each host interacts with their guests is thoughtfully considered and brings to life their own personal passions "" added Caroline Bénard  Global SVP Economy & Midscale Brands  Accor.

This rapport between host and guest contributes to a more meaningful and memorable stay experience.'Designed for Independent HoteliersThe Handwritten Collection is also designed with the needs of independent hotel owners in mind. With a current conversion rate of 80%  the bulk of properties joining Handwritten Collection will be conversion projects rather than new builds  requiring a simpler transition and ramp up process and a more sustainable growth and development model. The brand's standards are designed to be flexible  light  and easy to attain. Moreover  Handwritten Collection provides direct ROI and the opportunity for owners to maximize revenue with immediate access to the power and reach of Accor's sales  distribution and loyalty platforms  while also benefiting from the Group's environmental  social  and governance (ESG) capabilities.""In 2022  Accor signed on average globally more than one hotel per day and opened nearly one hotel per day. We aim to continue this growth by anticipating the needs of our guests and aligning with the investment criteria of our partners and owners. Independent hotels are increasingly seeking the strength of Accor's powerful sales  distribution and loyalty platform to increase their revenue and assist them in optimizing their costs  whilst retaining their own distinctive personality and offering a highly qualitative product  service and experience. Handwritten Collection offers them an ideal solution  providing the option for a franchise contract and a flexible and cost-effective level of investment. We look forward to working collaboratively with owners and partners and welcoming additional hotels from around the world into this outstanding collection.

Parallel to this  the retail store network in France is also strongly impacted by significantly higher energy prices and must bear the cost of rent linked to forced administrative closures in its stores (Covid-19 period) following a recent decision by the French Court of Cassation. This situation will affect Bogart's 2022 results. Nonetheless  the Group confirms its outlook of an increase in 2022 turnover without  however  reaching its EBITDA target and without jeopardising the Group's fundamentals.In this respect  April France  a Bogart subsidiary  wanted to quickly adopt measures to improve the economic and financial situation of its network in France and has conducted a strategic review of the Group's store network to address this new context. An initial meeting was held on 18 January 2023 with employee representatives to submit to them the documents relating to the planned reorganisation. This provides for the potential closure of 17 stores in France (of a total of 67 points of sale) which could lead to 50 positions being lost as part of an employment protection plan ( “Plan de Sauvegarde de l'Emploi”).This project will be the subject of a consultation procedure with the Economic and Social Committee (ESC).

Repurposing a decommissioned production unit greatly reduces both time and cost  with a 70% reduction in emissions compared to the construction of a new unit.The scope of supply by Vallourec includes 170 000 feet of X70 heavy-wall pipe required for the in-field flowline and riser systems  as well as 365 000 feet of X65 pipes required for the oil export and gas export flowline and riser systems. The pipes will be produced at Vallourec’s state-of-the-art Jeceaba PQF mill  with riser pipes subject to fatigue loading undergoing pipe-end laser measurement and machining at Vallourec’s end-truing facility in Barreiro. Both facilities are located in Minas Gerais  Brazil.Philippe Guillemot  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vallourec  commented: “These important orders mark the strengthening of Vallourec's position in the strategic Gulf of Mexico market and demonstrate the competitiveness of our Brazilian base.

Organic growth in the first half was 50%  at constant perimeter and exchange rates.€89.9m is equal to 69% of the total revenues achieved in the previous financial year (€130.8m in the full financial year 2021/22)  positioning the company well ahead of its original annual plan.Half-yearly increases of more than 50% in traditional activitiesIn Mass Transit & Smart Cities (36% of revenue in H1 2022/23)  sales grew +68% in the first half as commuters progressively returned to urban transport systems. The benefit of this positive movement was accelerated by the growth in market share achieved by Paragon ID during the pandemic  particularly in the US market.Within this division  the Group continues to invest in its Strategic Initiative of digitization of ticketing on mobile phones and deployments of Mobility as as Service (MaaS) platforms  thereby developing new streams of recurring revenues.Track and Trace (34% of sales in the first half of 2022/23) posted growth of +51% in H1. Security Label  Europe's leading supplier of baggage tags and other material for the aviation sector  posted record sales in this period  contributing strongly to the growth in this activity. Security Label now reports revenues considerably in excess of its pre-Covid record years.The deployment of hardware and software in Real Time Locating Systems – an activity in which Paragon ID has just announced the acquisition of Uwinloc (see press release of 4th January 2023) – contributed to growth in the Track & Trace activity  as did the sale of RFID tags destined for IoT projects in the Retail sector.In Payment (18% of sales in the first half of financial year 2022/23)  the company posted growth of +22%  showing strong acceleration from the growth achieved in the 1st quarter which was +13%. The 2nd quarter is  traditionally  one in which sales of gift cards and loyalty cards are at their highest. The +29% growth in this activity in Q2 confirms gains in market share by Paragon ID's subsidiary Thames Card Technology.Growth in this activity is also driven by sales of RFID inlays and modules for contactless payment and by the royalties attaching to the licensing of Amatech's unique technologies permitting double-sided contactless payment with metal payment cards. Commercialisation of Paragon ID's own-manufactured metal payment cards commenced in H1 and will contribute more substantially to the company's growth in H2In e-ID (12% of sales in the first half of financial year 2022/23)  growth was particularly strong at a startling +173% in H1. All of this growth was organic and reflected strong sales of the company's polycarbonate line of products  in addition to the normalisation of orders for the traditional product lines.Activity in e-ID will continue to be strong in H2 following the receipt of new orders for polycarbonate products (see below).Record orders in eID received for new polycarbonate product lineParagon ID has recently had confirmation of some individually significant orders for the eID polycarbonate product line. These orders will boost e-ID revenues in 2022/23 and could generate tens of millions of euros in annual revenues in the future.The e-ID division of Paragon ID commercialises a range of RFID inlays which allow national printing houses to develop electronic and biometric passports  identity cards and other secure documents.A new range of e-ID products has been derived from Paragon ID's proprietary expertise in polycarbonate material  allowing the company to offer the slimmest inlay for passport e-datapages which currently exists in the market. In these products  RFID inlays integrate a structure of multiple layers of polycarbonate material  while including binding and security features  in a manner which is unique to Paragon ID  exceeding all technical norms in the marketplace for slimness  durability and security.Every year  Paragon ID delivers millions of e-ID inlays to the countries in the world with the highest possible standards for the production of their secure documents – passports  identity cards and electronic drivers' licences. The company's three secure and certified  industrial sites in France  US and Romania ensure continuity of service  close to its key customers.Negotiation of new State-Guaranteed-Loans in the amount of €10m under the French' Government's “Resilience” measures.New loans of €10m have been negotiated between Paragon ID and the banking partners of the Paragon Group. These loans  guaranteed by the French state under its “Resilience” measures  are designed to support French companies which have been heavily impacted by the consequences of the current geopolitical situation  notably from the disruption of supply chains caused by the war in Ukraine  with consequential requirements to invest heavily in inventories of scarce elements like electronic components.These one-year loans could  potentially  be repaid over the course of five years and have attractive interest rates in the current environment. There are no particular covenants attaching to the loans.They therefore provide Paragon ID with additional financial means to support the investments in working capital  notably in stocks of chips and other components  which are vital to continue the company's growth.New upgrade in targeted revenues for financial year 2022/23: €170m  representing full-year growth in excess of 30%Given the strong growth in the business in the first half of the year  the orders received to date and those in the pipeline  the company is revising its full-year outlook for the second time this financial year.Paragon ID is now targeting full-year growth in excess of 30% (as compared to double-digit growth originally communicated and >20% communicated at the end of October). This level of growth would bring total sales in 2022/23 to around €170m (vs €130.8m in 2021/22).Clem Garvey  CEO Paragon ID  said:""The growth across all of our activities during the first half is well ahead of plan.This growth reflects a progressive return to normality in our traditional activities in which we have also increased our market share since the pandemic. In addition  the success of our Strategic Initiatives and the performance of the companies we have acquired in recent years are  rightfully  a source of pride and satisfaction to everyone in Paragon ID.We have every reason to believe that the current momentum can be maintained for the foreseeable future and we continue  therefore  to aspire to doubling the size of this company every three years.""Financial agenda2022/23 Half year results Wednesday 29 March 2023 2022/23 Q3 turnover Wednesday 26 April 2023 2022/23 Q4 turnover Wednesday 26 July 2023 2022/23 Yearly results Wednesday 25 October 2023 2023/24 Q1 turnoverThese dates are given for information only.

The resulting capabilities (e.g.  real-time collaboration and communication  multidisciplinary imaging for 15+ service lines  anytime-anywhere access  AI-enabled rules-based workflow automation  modular deployment) differentiate AGFA's solution. One customer said  ""I took a trip a few times to RSNA and HIMSS  and AGFA was the only vendor at the time that seemed to understand the concept of enterprise imaging.""
