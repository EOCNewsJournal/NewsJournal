Accor already has over 110 Handwritten leads globally totaling more than 11 500 rooms  including 12 secured signings  with five properties expected to debut throughout the first trimester of 2023.Handwritten Collection properties opening over the next several months include Hotel Shanghai Sheshan Oriental  Handwritten Collection in Shanghai  China; Le Saint Gervais Hotel & Spa  Handwritten Collection in Saint Gervais  France; Wonil Hotel Perth  Handwritten Collection in Perth  Australia; Hotel Morris  Handwritten Collection in Sydney  Australia; and Le Splendid Hotel Lac d'Annecy  Handwritten Collection in Annecy  France.

The Handwritten Collection portfolio is expected to reach more than 250 hotels by 2030.Handwritten Collection (CNW Group/Accor)""Handwritten Collection enriches Accor's offering in the 'collection brands' segment with a curated selection of hotels that exhibit charming and one-of-a-kind concepts. Our aim  beyond delivering a truly authentic guest experience  is to support the growing number of independent and boutique hotel owners looking to boost their global profile  connect with more audiences and grow their revenue without losing their identity "" said Alex Schellenberger  Chief Marketing Officer  Premium  Midscale  Economy Brands  Accor. ""The hotels we will feature in Handwritten Collection are those sought out by travelers who appreciate heartwarming travel experiences and a twist on traditional hospitality  as well as by hoteliers who cherish the unique personality of their properties while desiring the benefits that come with a leading global partner.""With the creation of Handwritten Collection  Accor is broadening its unrivalled brand portfolio and midscale hotel offerings and will look to replicate the success it has achieved with the Group's other collection brands across other segments. This includes the MGallery Hotel Collection  a storied portfolio in the upper upscale brand segment that now counts more than 100 boutique hotels worldwide and Emblems Collection  Accor's first luxury collection brand  a carefully curated selection of distinctive hotels that are emblematic of their destination  designer or place in history. With a similar bespoke approach  Handwritten Collection will bring together hotels with individual personalities  intimately reflecting the character and warmth of the people who love and look after them. Like a handwritten note  each host's individual touches will be subtly encountered at select moments throughout the guest journey. From a warm welcome that cascades into conversation  to freshly baked treats that have guests sneaking seconds into their pockets  no two hotels or stays will be the same.A Host with PassionHandwritten Collection offers a variety of hotels that are so distinct  it's as if each local hotelier were inviting guests into their charming and stylish homes. The guest experience at Handwritten Collection brings to life the spirit of the host: their tastes  their passions and the little quirks of their personality. Each local hotelier provides a charming presence that weaves their character and personality into the fabric of their hotel  engaging guests with local wisdom and delightful conversation  bringing a personalized energy to the guest experience.""The manner in which each host interacts with their guests is thoughtfully considered and brings to life their own personal passions "" added Caroline B√©nard  Global SVP Economy & Midscale Brands  Accor. ""Whether in a social setting or the privacy of a guest's room  there will be moments of storytelling and engagement that create a genuine connection. This rapport between host and guest contributes to a more meaningful and memorable stay experience.'Designed for Independent HoteliersThe Handwritten Collection is also designed with the needs of independent hotel owners in mind. With a current conversion rate of 80%  the bulk of properties joining Handwritten Collection will be conversion projects rather than new builds  requiring a simpler transition and ramp up process and a more sustainable growth and development model. The brand's standards are designed to be flexible  light  and easy to attain. Moreover  Handwritten Collection provides direct ROI and the opportunity for owners to maximize revenue with immediate access to the power and reach of Accor's sales  distribution and loyalty platforms  while also benefiting from the Group's environmental  social  and governance (ESG) capabilities.""In 2022  Accor signed on average globally more than one hotel per day and opened nearly one hotel per day. We aim to continue this growth by anticipating the needs of our guests and aligning with the investment criteria of our partners and owners. Independent hotels are increasingly seeking the strength of Accor's powerful sales  distribution and loyalty platform to increase their revenue and assist them in optimizing their costs  whilst retaining their own distinctive personality and offering a highly qualitative product  service and experience. Handwritten Collection offers them an ideal solution  providing the option for a franchise contract and a flexible and cost-effective level of investment. We look forward to working collaboratively with owners and partners and welcoming additional hotels from around the world into this outstanding collection. With over 110 properties and 11 500 rooms in negotiation to become part of Handwritten Collection  including 12 hotels committed already  we aim to have over 250 properties by 2030 "" said Camil Yazbeck  Global Chief Development Officer  Premium  Midscale  Economy  Accor.NOTABLE HANDWRITTEN COLLECTION PROPERTIESHotel Shanghai Sheshan Oriental  Handwritten Collection  Shanghai  China Opening 19 January 2023Close to Sheshan National Park  Hotel Shanghai Sheshan Oriental has over 124 000 square meters of landscaped gardens  including an outdoor beach pool for an unforgettable urban resort experience.

It is intended to ensure that Pharnext has the financial capacity to cover its cash requirements in the event that Pharnext is unable to use the OCEANE-BSA financing agreement granted by Global Tech Opportunities 13 (""GTO 13"")  as was the case in December 2022. In this context  N√©ovacs has committed to increase its financial support up to an additional ‚Ç¨2 million per month by the end of 2023[1].Under the terms of the agreement  N√©ovacs ensures the provision to Pharnext  until December 31  2023 (inclusive)  of a maximum principal amount of ‚Ç¨24 million. N√©ovacs is thus covering Pharnext's potential financing needs until the expected publication of the first results of the pivotal Phase III clinical trial of PXT3003 in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A).Pharnext may thus  at any time  in one or more steps  call from N√©ovacs the amount required in tranches of a nominal amount of ‚Ç¨100 000 each.

This situation will affect Bogart's 2022 results. Nonetheless  the Group confirms its outlook of an increase in 2022 turnover without  however  reaching its EBITDA target and without jeopardising the Group's fundamentals.In this respect  April France  a Bogart subsidiary  wanted to quickly adopt measures to improve the economic and financial situation of its network in France and has conducted a strategic review of the Group's store network to address this new context. An initial meeting was held on 18 January 2023 with employee representatives to submit to them the documents relating to the planned reorganisation. This provides for the potential closure of 17 stores in France (of a total of 67 points of sale) which could lead to 50 positions being lost as part of an employment protection plan ( ‚ÄúPlan de Sauvegarde de l'Emploi‚Äù).This project will be the subject of a consultation procedure with the Economic and Social Committee (ESC). Based on legal provisions and considering that Management aims to promote dialogue with the social partners  no information on the prerogatives of the company's ESC can be disclosed.Bogart will continue to keep the market informed of the latest developments.Next publication: full-year turnover  2 February 2023Group website www.groupe-bogart.comCONTACTSBOGARTcontact@jbogart.comTel.: +33 (0)1 53 77 55 55ACTUS FINANCE & COMMUNICATIONInvestor RelationsAnne-Pauline Petureauxapetureaux@actus.frTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 72Media RelationsManon Clairetmclairet@actus.frTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 73This publication embed ""üîí Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key: nXBqlJRpapecnZ6elp1sbpZjl5xkm2iXlpScxmdsY8ycm5phx5hkbcaXZnBplmVo- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com.Regulated information:Inside Information:- other releases Full and original press release in PDF: https://www.actusnews.com/news/78102-pr_bogart_update_france_business_def_en.pdfReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com  it's free¬© 2023 ActusNews",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.12,0.88,True,English,"['Jacques Bogart', 'retail business', 'Update', 'state', 'France', 'higher energy prices', 'employment protection plan', 'original press release', 'next press releases', 'retail store network', 'new Nocib√© stores', 'general economic backdrop', 'SECURITY MASTER Key', 'Actusnews SECURITY MASTER', 'current backdrop', 'new context', 'Plan de', 'other releases', 'retail stores', 'Compartment B', 'luxury fragrances', 'one hand', 'purchasing power', 'recent integration', 'consolidation scope', 'administrative closures', 'Covid-19 period', 'recent decision', 'French Court', 'EBITDA target', 'strategic review', 'initial meeting', 'employee representatives', 'potential closure', 'consultation procedure', 'Social Committee', 'legal provisions', 'social partners', 'latest developments', 'Next publication', 'Investor Relations', 'Anne-Pauline Petureaux', 'Media Relations', 'Manon Clairet', 'Euronext Paris', 'business activity', 'full year', 'financial situation', 'full-year turnover', 'ACTUS FINANCE', 'Regulated information', 'April France', 'Group website', 'Bogart subsidiary', '17 stores', '2022 turnover', '19 January', 'JBOG', 'creation', 'manufacture', 'sale', 'cosmetics', 'update', 'light', 'decline', 'profitability', 'inflation', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'cost', 'Cassation', '2022 results', 'increase', 'fundamentals', 'respect', 'measures', '18 January', 'documents', 'reorganisation', 'total', '67 points', '50 positions', 'Sauvegarde', 'Emploi', 'project', 'subject', 'ESC', 'Management', 'dialogue', 'prerogatives', 'company', 'market', 'CONTACTS', 'Tel.', 'COMMUNICATION', 'mclairet', 'PDF', 'email', '33', '1 53']",2023-01-19,2023-01-20,marketscreener.com

The companies Urban Things and Tracktio have been consolidated since 1st July 2022. The activity related to the acquisition of the assets of Uwinloc is accounted for as of 1st January 2023.Record revenues of ‚Ç¨89.9m in H1 2022/23  growing by +59%Revenues in the 2nd quarter of the year totalled ‚Ç¨47.7m  growing 54%  year-on -year. Organic growth in the 2nd quarter was +50%.Second quarter revenues were higher than those achieved in the first quarter by +13% (+‚Ç¨5.5m)  despite revenues in Q1 having been particularly strong  exceeding ‚Ç¨40m in a quarter for the first time in the company's history.Total revenues in the first half of the 2022/23 financial year  were ‚Ç¨89.9m  growing some 59% vs prior year. Organic growth in the first half was 50%  at constant perimeter and exchange rates.‚Ç¨89.9m is equal to 69% of the total revenues achieved in the previous financial year (‚Ç¨130.8m in the full financial year 2021/22)  positioning the company well ahead of its original annual plan.Half-yearly increases of more than 50% in traditional activitiesIn Mass Transit & Smart Cities (36% of revenue in H1 2022/23)  sales grew +68% in the first half as commuters progressively returned to urban transport systems. The benefit of this positive movement was accelerated by the growth in market share achieved by Paragon ID during the pandemic  particularly in the US market.Within this division  the Group continues to invest in its Strategic Initiative of digitization of ticketing on mobile phones and deployments of Mobility as as Service (MaaS) platforms  thereby developing new streams of recurring revenues.Track and Trace (34% of sales in the first half of 2022/23) posted growth of +51% in H1. Security Label  Europe's leading supplier of baggage tags and other material for the aviation sector  posted record sales in this period  contributing strongly to the growth in this activity. Security Label now reports revenues considerably in excess of its pre-Covid record years.The deployment of hardware and software in Real Time Locating Systems ‚Äì an activity in which Paragon ID has just announced the acquisition of Uwinloc (see press release of 4th January 2023) ‚Äì contributed to growth in the Track & Trace activity  as did the sale of RFID tags destined for IoT projects in the Retail sector.In Payment (18% of sales in the first half of financial year 2022/23)  the company posted growth of +22%  showing strong acceleration from the growth achieved in the 1st quarter which was +13%. The 2nd quarter is  traditionally  one in which sales of gift cards and loyalty cards are at their highest. The +29% growth in this activity in Q2 confirms gains in market share by Paragon ID's subsidiary Thames Card Technology.Growth in this activity is also driven by sales of RFID inlays and modules for contactless payment and by the royalties attaching to the licensing of Amatech's unique technologies permitting double-sided contactless payment with metal payment cards. Commercialisation of Paragon ID's own-manufactured metal payment cards commenced in H1 and will contribute more substantially to the company's growth in H2In e-ID (12% of sales in the first half of financial year 2022/23)  growth was particularly strong at a startling +173% in H1. All of this growth was organic and reflected strong sales of the company's polycarbonate line of products  in addition to the normalisation of orders for the traditional product lines.Activity in e-ID will continue to be strong in H2 following the receipt of new orders for polycarbonate products (see below).Record orders in eID received for new polycarbonate product lineParagon ID has recently had confirmation of some individually significant orders for the eID polycarbonate product line. These orders will boost e-ID revenues in 2022/23 and could generate tens of millions of euros in annual revenues in the future.The e-ID division of Paragon ID commercialises a range of RFID inlays which allow national printing houses to develop electronic and biometric passports  identity cards and other secure documents.A new range of e-ID products has been derived from Paragon ID's proprietary expertise in polycarbonate material  allowing the company to offer the slimmest inlay for passport e-datapages which currently exists in the market. In these products  RFID inlays integrate a structure of multiple layers of polycarbonate material  while including binding and security features  in a manner which is unique to Paragon ID  exceeding all technical norms in the marketplace for slimness  durability and security.Every year  Paragon ID delivers millions of e-ID inlays to the countries in the world with the highest possible standards for the production of their secure documents ‚Äì passports  identity cards and electronic drivers' licences. The company's three secure and certified  industrial sites in France  US and Romania ensure continuity of service  close to its key customers.Negotiation of new State-Guaranteed-Loans in the amount of ‚Ç¨10m under the French' Government's ‚ÄúResilience‚Äù measures.New loans of ‚Ç¨10m have been negotiated between Paragon ID and the banking partners of the Paragon Group. These loans  guaranteed by the French state under its ‚ÄúResilience‚Äù measures  are designed to support French companies which have been heavily impacted by the consequences of the current geopolitical situation  notably from the disruption of supply chains caused by the war in Ukraine  with consequential requirements to invest heavily in inventories of scarce elements like electronic components.These one-year loans could  potentially  be repaid over the course of five years and have attractive interest rates in the current environment. There are no particular covenants attaching to the loans.They therefore provide Paragon ID with additional financial means to support the investments in working capital  notably in stocks of chips and other components  which are vital to continue the company's growth.New upgrade in targeted revenues for financial year 2022/23: ‚Ç¨170m  representing full-year growth in excess of 30%Given the strong growth in the business in the first half of the year  the orders received to date and those in the pipeline  the company is revising its full-year outlook for the second time this financial year.Paragon ID is now targeting full-year growth in excess of 30% (as compared to double-digit growth originally communicated and >20% communicated at the end of October). This level of growth would bring total sales in 2022/23 to around ‚Ç¨170m (vs ‚Ç¨130.8m in 2021/22).Clem Garvey  CEO Paragon ID  said:""The growth across all of our activities during the first half is well ahead of plan.This growth reflects a progressive return to normality in our traditional activities in which we have also increased our market share since the pandemic. In addition  the success of our Strategic Initiatives and the performance of the companies we have acquired in recent years are  rightfully  a source of pride and satisfaction to everyone in Paragon ID.We have every reason to believe that the current momentum can be maintained for the foreseeable future and we continue  therefore  to aspire to doubling the size of this company every three years.""Financial agenda2022/23 Half year results Wednesday 29 March 2023 2022/23 Q3 turnover Wednesday 26 April 2023 2022/23 Q4 turnover Wednesday 26 July 2023 2022/23 Yearly results Wednesday 25 October 2023 2023/24 Q1 turnoverThese dates are given for information only.

It is offering a new programme of sweeteners for banks to switch from LCH in London.But LCH in London still accounted for 50.9 trillion euros or 93.8% of global gross notional market share in euro swaps in 2022  with Eurex at 6.2% and its gains in recent years did not continue in 2022  research and data provider Clarus (NASDAQ: ) Financial Technology said.ICE is due to terminate clearing of euro CDS in London in October as it relocates the activity to Chicago  though some of the business will likely shift to rival LCH's Paris arm.ICE said that by the third quarter of last year  ICE in Chicago cleared 88% of euro CDS instruments  with 8% at ICE in London  and 4% at LCH.LCH said CDS products clearing in Paris rose to 3.24 trillion euros ($3.51 trillion) last year  up from 2.25 trillion in 2021. It is offering customers to switch from a rival to LCH free of clearing fees.($1 = 0.9219 euros)",neutral,0.01,0.95,0.05,negative,0.07,0.06,0.87,True,English,"['Analysis-Frankfurt', 'STIRs', 'euro', 'battle', 'London', 'Reuters', 'critical liquidity financial centres need', 'global gross notional market share', 'short-term interest rate futures trading', 'senior European clearing industry official', 'euro short-term interest rates contracts', 'three-month estr futures contract', 'euro credit default swaps', 'euro interest rate swaps', 'U.S. derivatives exchange', 'new three-month futures contract', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'estr interest rate', 'German stock exchange', 'new estr contract', 'former futures trader', 'European Union ambitions', 'European Central Bank', 'Exchange Invest newsletter', 'euro yield curve', 'huge euribor contract', 'competing asset classes', 'euro CDS instruments', 'euro derivatives contracts', 'euro STIRs volume', 'EU-based clearing house', 'File Photo DB1Gn', 'heavy EU reliance', 'EU securities watchdog', 'EU policy efforts', 'one clearing house', 'CDS products clearing', 'derivatives contracts banks', 'Eurex derivatives arm', 'euro swaps', 'euribor futures', 'Financial Technology', 'industry officials', 'new programme', 'euro-denominated derivatives', 'market moves', 'euro IRS', 'one side', 'Shifting clearing', 'enough clearing', 'clearing fees', 'bear symbols', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Kai Pfaffenbach', 'Huw Jones', 'early test', 'biggest exchanges', 'long haul', 'UK capital', 'draft law', 'minimum amount', 'longer end', 'maximum margin', 'capital efficiencies', '365 million lots', 'prior year', 'longstanding dominance', 'tall order', 'Margin offsets', 'key problem', 'broader pool', 'United States', 'unreasonable proportions', 'data provider', 'Paris arm', 'third quarter', 'last year', 'Watchlist LSEG', 'Watchlist CLAR', 'STIR segment', 'STIR offering', 'TAKE YEARS', 'recent years', ""banks' hostility"", 'three types', 'Patrick Young', '50.9 trillion euros', '3.24 trillion euros', 'mono-currency Eurex', 'EU banks', 'Wrestling business', 'Watchlist ICE', '0.9219 euros', 'Reuters', 'Bull', 'front', 'Frankfurt', 'Germany', 'February', 'Monday', 'trillions', 'practice', 'Britain', 'Brexit', 'Brussels', 'skirmish', 'world', 'bulk', 'deal', 'investors', 'bloc', 'account', 'companies', 'NYSE', 'extent', 'ESMA', 'monopolist', 'ETR', 'Jan.', 'commitment', 'home', 'CME', 'challenge', 'opportunities', 'adjustments', 'options', 'founder', 'everything', 'Chicago', 'LCH', 'customers', 'matching', 'June', 'extension', 'time', 'scratch', 'sweeteners', 'gains', 'research', 'Clarus', 'October', 'activity', 'rival', '¬©']",2023-01-20,2023-01-20,investing.com

The first day of trading of the New Shares and the delivery of the New Shares to investors is expected to take place on or around 27 January 2023.

In a late-breaking abstracts session presentation (LBA661) at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium  the data demonstrating investigational novel NALIRIFOX regimen (liposomal irinotecan 50 mg/m2 + 5-FU 2400 mg/m2 + leucovorin 400 mg/m2 + oxaliplatin 60 mg/m2) improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine.1 At the median follow-up of 16.1 months  the investigational Onivyde regimen met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in OS of 11.1 months compared to 9.2 months for patients treated with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.70‚Äì0.99]; p=0.04).1‚Ä†‚Äú For the first time  a clinical study in the first-line setting for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma demonstrated superior overall survival and progression-free survival for an investigational regimen when compared to standard of care treatment with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine ‚Äù said Zev Wainberg  M.D. Professor of Medicine at UCLA and co-director of the UCLA GI Oncology Program. ‚Äú These findings are especially meaningful to people living with this aggressive and difficult-to-treat cancer  representing the potential to prolong life with a safety profile consistent with the safety profile of the treatment components.""‚Äú Very few clinical studies in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma have demonstrated efficacy in the past few decades. Progress has been slow with limited treatment options  hence the NAPOLI 3 results are a meaningful advance for people with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ‚Äù said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. ‚Äú In totality  the data demonstrate that the investigational Onivyde treatment regimen (NALIRIFOX) provides a survival benefit over nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine. We look forward to submitting the data to the FDA.‚ÄùNAPOLI 3 secondary outcome measures included PFS  objective response rate (ORR)  incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events  serious adverse events  and laboratory abnormalities.Trial met its secondary endpoint showing patients treated with NALIRIFOX had a statistically significant improvement in median PFS of 7.4 months versus 5.6 months for nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.58‚Äì0.83]; p=0.0001). 1‚Ä†ORR was 41.8 percent (36.8%-46.9%; 95% CI) for patients treated with the NALIRIFOX regimen versus 36.2 percent (31.4%-41.2%; 95% CI) for patients treated with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. 1The safety profile of NALIRIFOX was manageable and consistent with the profiles of the treatment components. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with more than 10 percent frequency in patients receiving NALIRIFOX versus nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine included diarrhea (20.3% vs 4.5%)  nausea (11.9% vs 2.6%)  hypokalemia (15.1% vs 4.0%)  anemia (10.5% vs 17.4%) and neutropenia (14.1% vs 24.5%).1About the NAPOLI 3 trial1NAPOLI 3 is a randomized  open-label Phase III trial of Onivyde treatment regimen (NALIRIFOX) in patients who have not previously received chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. NAPOLI 3 enrolled 770 patients across 205 trial site locations in 18 countries. Patients were randomized to receive Onivyde plus 5 fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin (NALIRIFOX regimen; n=383) twice in a month (days 1 and 15 of 28-day cycle) compared to an injection of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (n=387) administered three times a month (days 1  8  15 of a 28-day cycle).About Onivyde¬Æ (irinotecan liposome injection)Onivyde is a cancer medicine that blocks an enzyme called topoisomerase I  which is involved in copying cell DNA needed to make new cells. By blocking the enzyme  cancer cells are prevented from multiplying and eventually die. In Onivyde  irinotecan is enclosed in tiny fat particles called ‚Äòliposomes ‚Äô which accumulate in the tumor and release slowly over time.Ipsen is planning to file a supplemental New Drug Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Onivyde in combination with oxaliplatin plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin for the treatment of patients with previously untreated mPDAC following the Fast Track Designation granted in 2020. Onivyde is currently approved in most major markets including the U.S.  Europe and Asia in combination with fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy. Onivyde is not indicated as a single agent for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.Ipsen has exclusive commercialization rights for the current and potential future indications for Onivyde in the U.S. Servier  an independent international pharmaceutical company with an international presence in 150 countries  is responsible for the commercialization of Onivyde outside of the U.S. and Taiwan. PharmaEngine is a commercial stage oncology company headquartered in Taipei and is responsible for the commercialization of Onivyde in Taiwan.About Pancreatic Ductal AdenocarcinomaPDAC is the most common type of cancer that forms in the pancreas with approximately 60 000 people diagnosed in the U.S. each year and nearly 500 000 people globally.2 3 Since there are no specific symptoms in the early stages  PDAC is often detected late and after the disease has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic or stage IV).4 Even in later stages  weight loss  abdominal pain and jaundice are the most common symptoms making PDAC difficult to detect.5 Despite significant advances in cancer treatments since the 1970s  no treatment options for PDAC significantly extend life.4 Currently  fewer than 20 percent of people diagnosed with PDAC survive longer than one year and overall  pancreatic cancer has the lowest five-year survival rate of all cancer types globally and in the U.S.2 3U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNINGS: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA and SEVERE DIARRHEAFatal neutropenic sepsis occurred in 0.8% of patients receiving Onivyde. Severe or life-threatening neutropenic fever or sepsis occurred in 3% and severe or life-threatening neutropenia occurred in 20% of patients receiving Onivyde in combination with 5-FU and LV. Withhold Onivyde for absolute neutrophil count below 1500/mm3 or neutropenic fever. Monitor blood cell counts periodically during treatment.Severe diarrhea occurred in 13% of patients receiving Onivyde in combination with 5-FU/LV. Do not administer Onivyde to patients with bowel obstruction. Withhold Onivyde for diarrhea of Grade 2‚Äì4 severity. Administer loperamide for late diarrhea of any severity. Administer atropine  if not contraindicated  for early diarrhea of any severity.CONTRAINDICATIONOnivyde is contraindicated in patients who have experienced a severe hypersensitivity reaction to Onivyde or irinotecan hydrochloride.Warnings and precautionsSevere neutropenia: see boxed WARNING. In patients receiving Onivyde/5-FU/LV  the incidence of Grade 3/4 neutropenia was higher among Asian (18/33 [55%]) vs White patients (13/73 [18%]). Neutropenic fever/neutropenic sepsis was reported in 6% of Asian vs 1% of White patientsSevere diarrhea: see boxed WARNING. Severe and life-threatening late-onset (onset >24 hours after chemotherapy [9%]) and early-onset diarrhea (onset ‚â§24 hours after chemotherapy [3%]  sometimes with other symptoms of cholinergic reaction) were observedInterstitial lung disease (ILD): Irinotecan HCl can cause severe and fatal ILD. Withhold Onivyde patients with new or progressive dyspnea  cough  and fever  pending diagnostic evaluation.

For more information  visit ipsen.comIpsen‚Äôs Forward-Looking StatementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen‚Äôs management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen‚Äôs future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‚Äòbelieves‚Äô  ‚Äòanticipates‚Äô and ‚Äòexpects‚Äô and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen‚Äôs expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen‚Äôs patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen‚Äôs activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen‚Äôs partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen‚Äôs business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen‚Äôs business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorit√© des March√©s Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen‚Äôs 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com‚Ä† Survival results (OS  PFS) reflect data included in the ASCO GI presentation.

The condition can result in different health challenges  including muscle and bone weakness  respiratory or heart failure  seizures or coma.Deficiency of this vital mineral is always linked to an underlying condition  such as diabetes  anorexia  use of diuretics or alcohol abuse. A more extensive list can be found at the end of this press release under ‚ÄúAbout Hypophosphatemia‚Äù.It is estimated hypophosphatemia affects around 5% of hospitalized patients 1 and a subpopulation needs direct treatment during and/or after their hospital stay.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a source of pride for us to ensure that drugs administered to patients are accompanied by clear instructions and have demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety. A registered product entails the treatment has been validated by regulators  which ensures fast and equal access and offers peace of mind to physicians and patients.‚Äù‚ÄúThe expected costs for Hyloris stay well below our required average investment of less than EUR 7 million per product candidate. This interesting new opportunity brings us one step closer to a total pipeline of 30 assets  a goal we aim to achieve before 2025.‚ÄùTreatment protocols for patients deficient in phosphate are well-established and have proven useful in other situations of bone mineral imbalance. Oral administration is the preferred way of treating hypophosphatemia  although in most countries no approved drugs exist. Currently  physicians mostly rely on compounded drugs which have  by definition  not been submitted for regulatory scrutiny regarding safety  efficacy  and quality.Hyloris will seek advice and approval from regulators by making use of the rich body of clinical data that has emerged from established clinical practice. With a primary on safety of the product  Hyloris intends to conduct a streamlined development program to achieve market access in Europe  targeting regulatory approval in European countries as from 2026.Global rights of the ongoing development have been licensed-in from Dutch company  QliniQ  who maintains the rights to commercialize the product candidate in its home country  and a selected number of Middle Eastern and developing countries.The external development cost including the licensing fee is expected to remain below EUR 2 million. Besides agreed upon product development costs that will be incurred  no further payments will be owed to QliniQ.Albert de Bruin  Managing Director of QliniQ  added: ‚ÄúThanks to Hyloris and its demonstrated expertise in bringing new drugs to international markets  our product candidate could help many more patients. We have tremendous confidence in Hyloris‚Äô ability to navigate the regulatory path towards improved patient outcomes.‚ÄùSeparately  Hyloris has divested HY-038 to QliniQ for a price of EUR 1 million. This generic product was considered a non-core asset by Hyloris. This transaction highlights once again an increased focus on value-added repurposed or reformulated product candidates.About HypophosphatemiaHypophosphatemia is a condition where the blood level of phosphorus is low (<2.5mg/dl). This condition can occur due to decrease in oral or intestinal resorption  increased renal excretion or internal redistribution of phosphate.There is a wide range of underlying conditions leading to hypophosphatemia which could be hereditary (such as X-linked hypophosphatemia  hypophosphatemic rickets  osteomalacia  Cushing syndrome) or acquired (anorexia nervosa  recovery phase of diabetes-related ketoacidosis  alcohol withdrawal  respiratory alkalosis  long term use of diuretic and phosphate binders)2.Chronic hypophosphatemia can become life threatening  making direct treatment of the hypophosphatemia desirable in cases where treating the underlying condition does not solve the mineral deficiency.Many patients are asymptomatic. Symptoms of moderate to severe hypophosphatemia include bone pain  muscle dysfunction  rhabdomyolysis  hemolysis  Leucocyte dysfunction  metabolic encephalopathy  respiratory failure  impaired myocardial performance3. Depending on the clinical condition  the standard of treatment is dietary supplement (in mild cases)  oral intake (moderate to severe)  and intravenous phosphate (Severe)2.About QliniQQliniQ is a Dutch company which develops and in-licenses drugs and medical supplies in various therapeutic domains and commercializes these in the Netherlands. QliniQ nurtures cooperation and long lasting business relationships with international companies as part of its successful market approach.About Hyloris Pharmaceuticals SAHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.

Nexans  a leader in the design and manufacturing of cable systems  and Authentic Vision  a leading provider of mobile authentication solutions  have agreed to enter into a strategic alliance partnership based upon the organizations‚Äô shared philosophy focusing on consumer safety and improving the consumer experience. Authentic Vision‚Äôs patented Holographic Fingerprint labels have already been applied to Nexans products packaging in Peru and Lebanon and are under deployment in other countries. The labels make it easy for customers or distributors to scan and verify the authenticity of a product with any smartphone  an approach that is fully in line with Nexans‚Äô strategy of providing value-added services to its customers.Nexans demonstrates its determination to protect its customers from potentially harmful  substandard products. The most important risk associated with counterfeit cable is cheating on the quantity of copper  which can have dramatic consequences. By reducing the diameter of the copper conductor  counterfeit cables can become abnormally hot when current is passed through them and cause a short-circuit and a fire outbreak. ‚ÄúThrough our partnership with Authentic Vision  digital innovation plays a key role in our customers‚Äô safety. It helps Nexans guarantee its products‚Äô conformity in terms of manufacturing and safety standards‚Äù  says J√©r√¥me Fournier  Vice-President Innovation at Nexans. The Group is now planning to roll out and deploy Authentic Vision‚Äôs solution in products around the world to protect the brand and create consumer engagement.Secure  easy to use and widely beneficialAuthentic Vision‚Äôs solution is highly secure  easy to use and instantly provides clear positive/negative verification results. No additional training or specialized equipment is required. ‚ÄúOur security labels are unique and absolutely copy-proof due to the physical randomness used in the production process. Even we are not able to duplicate or copy the labels ourselves‚Äù  Thomas Weiss  CEO of Authentic Vision states and points out that his company's technology is also global and actionable: ‚ÄúOur solution provides customers with proof of authenticity  and in the event a fake attempt occurs  precise geo-location provides brands with actionable data.‚Äù In other words  the Meta-Anchor‚Ñ¢ technology provides every product with a physically and digitally unique identifier (UID) and tracks counterfeiting attempts  thus providing valuable data for the prosecution of counterfeiters and fraudsters. Only three weeks after the Nexans launch  the first suspicious activities were recorded by the Group.Environmental  partner and customer benefitsNexans is engaged and deeply committed to reduce any adverse impact on the environment. Counterfeiters do not apply rules and regulations as Nexans does  to limit the environmental impact. With the Authentic Vision unique holographic label  anyone can differentiate a genuine product that respects standards in force and one that is manufactured in the frame of the Group Sustainability action plan. ‚ÄúBy fighting against counterfeit products  we create value for our customers‚Äù  says Elyette Roux  Chief Sales & Marketing  Communications Officer at Nexans. ‚ÄúBeyond ensuring the authenticity of the product  making these products unique and connectable also represents an added value for our customers in terms of information exchange with Nexans  such as installation guide videos or product features brochures‚Äù. Indeed  Nexans and Authentic Vision are joining efforts to develop customer engagement features that will be implemented by regional marketing teams  through the Nexans mobile app  which is used to authenticate the Nexans products.About NexansFor over a century  Nexans has played a crucial role in the electrification of the planet and is committed to electrifying the future.

The company‚Äôs oncology-focused pipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma‚Äôs approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-line data from the NOX-A12 three dose-escalation cohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy has received orphan drug designation for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-line data with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12 combination trial with Keytruda¬Æ in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck‚Äôs Keytruda¬Æ and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial is in discussion with regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe. The company‚Äôs second clinical-stage drug candidate  NOX-E36  is designed to target the innate immune system. TME Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

GLORIA further evaluates safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 three additional arms combining NOX-A12 with: A. radiotherapy in patients with complete tumor resection; B. radiotherapy and bevacizumab; and C. radiotherapy and pembrolizumab.About the OPTIMUS StudyOPTIMUS (NCT04901741) is TME Pharma‚Äôs planned open-label two-arm Phase 2 study of NOX-A12 combined with pembrolizumab and nanoliposomal irinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in microsatellite-stable metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.DisclaimerTranslations of any press release into languages other than English are intended solely as a convenience to the non-English-reading audience.
