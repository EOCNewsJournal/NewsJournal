REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File PhotoDB1Gn -1.08% Add to/Remove from Watchlist LSEG -0.11% Add to/Remove from Watchlist ICE +1.46% Add to/Remove from Watchlist CLAR +5.25% Add to/Remove from WatchlistBy Huw JonesLONDON (Reuters) - Frankfurt expands derivatives clearing on Monday in an early test of how well European Union ambitions to lure trillions of euros of business from London could work in practice.With Britain now outside the EU due to Brexit  Brussels wants to reduce heavy EU reliance on London for clearing euro-denominated derivatives worth trillions of euros  triggering a skirmish between the world's biggest exchanges.Wrestling business from London will be a long haul  though  given the bulk of clearing in heavily used contracts is based in the UK capital  banks have refused to shift business voluntarily  and the EU has yet to say exactly much volume it wants to see moving  industry officials say.Clearing  which ensures a trade is completed even if one side of the deal goes bust  is key to amassing the critical liquidity financial centres need to attract investors.Last month Brussels proposed a draft law that would force banks in the bloc to have an account with an EU-based clearing house to clear a yet-to-be-determined minimum amount of three types of euro derivatives contracts which are widely used by companies.One of these - euro short-term interest rates contracts or STIR - are mainly cleared outside the EU  dominated by ICE (NYSE: ) in London to such an extent that EU securities watchdog ESMA described it as monopolist.Deutsche Boerse (ETR: )'s Eurex derivatives arm in Frankfurt  already strong in contracts covering the longer end of the euro yield curve  will offer trading and clearing in a new three-month futures contract from Jan. 23 referencing the estr interest rate compiled by the European Central Bank.""Expanding the STIR segment underlines our commitment to be the home of the euro yield curve and delivering maximum margin and capital efficiencies to the market "" Eurex said.U.S. derivatives exchange CME already launched its own three-month estr futures contract last October  which banks in the EU can also trade  adding to the challenge faced by Eurex.ICE's euro STIRs volume is  however  in its huge euribor contract  which traded 365 million lots in 2022  a 66% rise on the prior year as the European Central Bank hiked interest rates sending companies rushing to hedge themselves.""We are continuously evaluating opportunities to make further adjustments in our STIR offering including our listed euribor futures and options "" Eurex said.Patrick Young  a former futures trader in London and founder of Exchange Invest newsletter  said Eurex is obliged to try everything to end London's longstanding dominance in short-term interest rate futures trading given the EU policy efforts.It is a tall order  though.""Margin offsets remain the key problem as ICE has a broader pool of competing asset classes to offset than mono-currency Eurex "" Young said.'TAKE YEARS'ESMA will calibrate how much of each of the three specified derivatives contracts banks must clear in the bloc.The other two are euro credit default swaps (CDS)  also cleared by ICE in London and Chicago  and euro interest rate swaps (IRS)  dominated by London Stock Exchange Group (LON: )'s LCH in London.Shifting clearing can be risky for customers as it involves closing contracts at one clearing house and opening matching ones in another  exposing them to disruptive market moves.Brussels is allowing EU banks to continue clearing in London until June 2025  though industry officials say an extension is inevitable given the time it could take for enough clearing to shift given banks' hostility.""All of this will take years  and more clearing will go to the United States if ESMA comes up with unreasonable proportions "" a senior European clearing industry official said.Eurex is effectively the only EU clearer for euro IRS  and unlike with its new estr contract it is not starting from scratch. It is offering a new programme of sweeteners for banks to switch from LCH in London.But LCH in London still accounted for 50.9 trillion euros or 93.8% of global gross notional market share in euro swaps in 2022  with Eurex at 6.2% and its gains in recent years did not continue in 2022  research and data provider Clarus (NASDAQ: ) Financial Technology said.ICE is due to terminate clearing of euro CDS in London in October as it relocates the activity to Chicago  though some of the business will likely shift to rival LCH's Paris arm.ICE said that by the third quarter of last year  ICE in Chicago cleared 88% of euro CDS instruments  with 8% at ICE in London  and 4% at LCH.LCH said CDS products clearing in Paris rose to 3.24 trillion euros ($3.51 trillion) last year  up from 2.25 trillion in 2021. It is offering customers to switch from a rival to LCH free of clearing fees.($1 = 0.9219 euros)",neutral,0.01,0.95,0.05,negative,0.07,0.06,0.87,True,English,"['Analysis-Frankfurt', 'STIRs', 'euro', 'battle', 'London', 'Reuters', 'critical liquidity financial centres need', 'global gross notional market share', 'short-term interest rate futures trading', 'senior European clearing industry official', 'euro short-term interest rates contracts', 'three-month estr futures contract', 'euro credit default swaps', 'euro interest rate swaps', 'U.S. derivatives exchange', 'new three-month futures contract', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'estr interest rate', 'German stock exchange', 'new estr contract', 'former futures trader', 'European Union ambitions', 'European Central Bank', 'Exchange Invest newsletter', 'euro yield curve', 'huge euribor contract', 'competing asset classes', 'euro CDS instruments', 'euro derivatives contracts', 'euro STIRs volume', 'EU-based clearing house', 'File Photo DB1Gn', 'heavy EU reliance', 'EU securities watchdog', 'EU policy efforts', 'one clearing house', 'CDS products clearing', 'derivatives contracts banks', 'Eurex derivatives arm', 'euro swaps', 'euribor futures', 'Financial Technology', 'industry officials', 'new programme', 'euro-denominated derivatives', 'market moves', 'euro IRS', 'one side', 'Shifting clearing', 'enough clearing', 'clearing fees', 'bear symbols', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Kai Pfaffenbach', 'Huw Jones', 'early test', 'biggest exchanges', 'long haul', 'UK capital', 'draft law', 'minimum amount', 'longer end', 'maximum margin', 'capital efficiencies', '365 million lots', 'prior year', 'longstanding dominance', 'tall order', 'Margin offsets', 'key problem', 'broader pool', 'United States', 'unreasonable proportions', 'data provider', 'Paris arm', 'third quarter', 'last year', 'Watchlist LSEG', 'Watchlist CLAR', 'STIR segment', 'STIR offering', 'TAKE YEARS', 'recent years', ""banks' hostility"", 'three types', 'Patrick Young', '50.9 trillion euros', '3.24 trillion euros', 'mono-currency Eurex', 'EU banks', 'Wrestling business', 'Watchlist ICE', '0.9219 euros', 'Reuters', 'Bull', 'front', 'Frankfurt', 'Germany', 'February', 'Monday', 'trillions', 'practice', 'Britain', 'Brexit', 'Brussels', 'skirmish', 'world', 'bulk', 'deal', 'investors', 'bloc', 'account', 'companies', 'NYSE', 'extent', 'ESMA', 'monopolist', 'ETR', 'Jan.', 'commitment', 'home', 'CME', 'challenge', 'opportunities', 'adjustments', 'options', 'founder', 'everything', 'Chicago', 'LCH', 'customers', 'matching', 'June', 'extension', 'time', 'scratch', 'sweeteners', 'gains', 'research', 'Clarus', 'October', 'activity', 'rival', '¬©']",2023-01-20,2023-01-21,investing.com

In a late-breaking abstracts session presentation (LBA661) at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium  the data demonstrating investigational novel NALIRIFOX regimen (liposomal irinotecan 50 mg/m2 + 5-FU 2400 mg/m2 + leucovorin 400 mg/m2 + oxaliplatin 60 mg/m2) improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine.1 At the median follow-up of 16.1 months  the investigational Onivyde regimen met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in OS of 11.1 months compared to 9.2 months for patients treated with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.70‚Äì0.99]; p=0.04).1‚Ä†‚Äú For the first time  a clinical study in the first-line setting for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma demonstrated superior overall survival and progression-free survival for an investigational regimen when compared to standard of care treatment with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine ‚Äù said Zev Wainberg  M.D. Professor of Medicine at UCLA and co-director of the UCLA GI Oncology Program. ‚Äú These findings are especially meaningful to people living with this aggressive and difficult-to-treat cancer  representing the potential to prolong life with a safety profile consistent with the safety profile of the treatment components.""‚Äú Very few clinical studies in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma have demonstrated efficacy in the past few decades. Progress has been slow with limited treatment options  hence the NAPOLI 3 results are a meaningful advance for people with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ‚Äù said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. ‚Äú In totality  the data demonstrate that the investigational Onivyde treatment regimen (NALIRIFOX) provides a survival benefit over nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine. We look forward to submitting the data to the FDA.‚ÄùNAPOLI 3 secondary outcome measures included PFS  objective response rate (ORR)  incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events  serious adverse events  and laboratory abnormalities.Trial met its secondary endpoint showing patients treated with NALIRIFOX had a statistically significant improvement in median PFS of 7.4 months versus 5.6 months for nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.58‚Äì0.83]; p=0.0001). 1‚Ä†ORR was 41.8 percent (36.8%-46.9%; 95% CI) for patients treated with the NALIRIFOX regimen versus 36.2 percent (31.4%-41.2%; 95% CI) for patients treated with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. 1The safety profile of NALIRIFOX was manageable and consistent with the profiles of the treatment components. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with more than 10 percent frequency in patients receiving NALIRIFOX versus nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine included diarrhea (20.3% vs 4.5%)  nausea (11.9% vs 2.6%)  hypokalemia (15.1% vs 4.0%)  anemia (10.5% vs 17.4%) and neutropenia (14.1% vs 24.5%).1About the NAPOLI 3 trial1NAPOLI 3 is a randomized  open-label Phase III trial of Onivyde treatment regimen (NALIRIFOX) in patients who have not previously received chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. NAPOLI 3 enrolled 770 patients across 205 trial site locations in 18 countries. Patients were randomized to receive Onivyde plus 5 fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin (NALIRIFOX regimen; n=383) twice in a month (days 1 and 15 of 28-day cycle) compared to an injection of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (n=387) administered three times a month (days 1  8  15 of a 28-day cycle).About Onivyde¬Æ (irinotecan liposome injection)Onivyde is a cancer medicine that blocks an enzyme called topoisomerase I  which is involved in copying cell DNA needed to make new cells. By blocking the enzyme  cancer cells are prevented from multiplying and eventually die. In Onivyde  irinotecan is enclosed in tiny fat particles called ‚Äòliposomes ‚Äô which accumulate in the tumor and release slowly over time.Ipsen is planning to file a supplemental New Drug Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Onivyde in combination with oxaliplatin plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin for the treatment of patients with previously untreated mPDAC following the Fast Track Designation granted in 2020. Onivyde is currently approved in most major markets including the U.S.  Europe and Asia in combination with fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy. Onivyde is not indicated as a single agent for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.Ipsen has exclusive commercialization rights for the current and potential future indications for Onivyde in the U.S. Servier  an independent international pharmaceutical company with an international presence in 150 countries  is responsible for the commercialization of Onivyde outside of the U.S. and Taiwan. PharmaEngine is a commercial stage oncology company headquartered in Taipei and is responsible for the commercialization of Onivyde in Taiwan.About Pancreatic Ductal AdenocarcinomaPDAC is the most common type of cancer that forms in the pancreas with approximately 60 000 people diagnosed in the U.S. each year and nearly 500 000 people globally.2 3 Since there are no specific symptoms in the early stages  PDAC is often detected late and after the disease has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic or stage IV).4 Even in later stages  weight loss  abdominal pain and jaundice are the most common symptoms making PDAC difficult to detect.5 Despite significant advances in cancer treatments since the 1970s  no treatment options for PDAC significantly extend life.4 Currently  fewer than 20 percent of people diagnosed with PDAC survive longer than one year and overall  pancreatic cancer has the lowest five-year survival rate of all cancer types globally and in the U.S.2 3U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNINGS: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA and SEVERE DIARRHEAFatal neutropenic sepsis occurred in 0.8% of patients receiving Onivyde.

For more information  visit ipsen.comIpsen‚Äôs Forward-Looking StatementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen‚Äôs management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen‚Äôs future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‚Äòbelieves‚Äô  ‚Äòanticipates‚Äô and ‚Äòexpects‚Äô and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen‚Äôs expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen‚Äôs patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen‚Äôs activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen‚Äôs partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen‚Äôs business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen‚Äôs business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorit√© des March√©s Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen‚Äôs 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com‚Ä† Survival results (OS  PFS) reflect data included in the ASCO GI presentation.

This serious condition causes patients to have a low level of phosphorous in the blood.While mild hypophosphatemia is common and many patients are asymptomatic  severe hypophosphatemia can be life-threatening and requires medical treatment. The condition can result in different health challenges  including muscle and bone weakness  respiratory or heart failure  seizures or coma.Deficiency of this vital mineral is always linked to an underlying condition  such as diabetes  anorexia  use of diuretics or alcohol abuse. A more extensive list can be found at the end of this press release under ‚ÄúAbout Hypophosphatemia‚Äù.It is estimated hypophosphatemia affects around 5% of hospitalized patients 1 and a subpopulation needs direct treatment during and/or after their hospital stay.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a source of pride for us to ensure that drugs administered to patients are accompanied by clear instructions and have demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety.

With a primary on safety of the product  Hyloris intends to conduct a streamlined development program to achieve market access in Europe  targeting regulatory approval in European countries as from 2026.Global rights of the ongoing development have been licensed-in from Dutch company  QliniQ  who maintains the rights to commercialize the product candidate in its home country  and a selected number of Middle Eastern and developing countries.The external development cost including the licensing fee is expected to remain below EUR 2 million. Besides agreed upon product development costs that will be incurred  no further payments will be owed to QliniQ.Albert de Bruin  Managing Director of QliniQ  added: ‚ÄúThanks to Hyloris and its demonstrated expertise in bringing new drugs to international markets  our product candidate could help many more patients.

This generic product was considered a non-core asset by Hyloris. This transaction highlights once again an increased focus on value-added repurposed or reformulated product candidates.About HypophosphatemiaHypophosphatemia is a condition where the blood level of phosphorus is low (<2.5mg/dl). This condition can occur due to decrease in oral or intestinal resorption  increased renal excretion or internal redistribution of phosphate.There is a wide range of underlying conditions leading to hypophosphatemia which could be hereditary (such as X-linked hypophosphatemia  hypophosphatemic rickets  osteomalacia  Cushing syndrome) or acquired (anorexia nervosa  recovery phase of diabetes-related ketoacidosis  alcohol withdrawal  respiratory alkalosis  long term use of diuretic and phosphate binders)2.Chronic hypophosphatemia can become life threatening  making direct treatment of the hypophosphatemia desirable in cases where treating the underlying condition does not solve the mineral deficiency.Many patients are asymptomatic. Symptoms of moderate to severe hypophosphatemia include bone pain  muscle dysfunction  rhabdomyolysis  hemolysis  Leucocyte dysfunction  metabolic encephalopathy  respiratory failure  impaired myocardial performance3. Depending on the clinical condition  the standard of treatment is dietary supplement (in mild cases)  oral intake (moderate to severe)  and intravenous phosphate (Severe)2.About QliniQQliniQ is a Dutch company which develops and in-licenses drugs and medical supplies in various therapeutic domains and commercializes these in the Netherlands.

16888,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4571339-week-ahead-earnings-season-a-highlight,Week Ahead - Earnings Season A Highlight,It will be a busy week filled with the first look at Q4 GDP  corporate earnings  and US debt ceiling gridlock.,Darren415USIt will be a busy week filled with the first look at Q4 GDP  corporate earnings  and US debt ceiling gridlock. There is a lot of risk on the table and a key focal point for many will be the modest growth we will see alongside a plethora of data points that are signalling recession warnings. Traders will want to see if the contraction manufacturing and service PMI readings we saw in December show any improvement this month.Wall Street is also fixating on what will happen with debt ceiling talks. Special measures are being used and that should stave off default until June 5th  but flare-ups will most likely happen along the way.Earnings season shifts away from the banks and now focuses on broader parts of the economy. Key earnings include results from Tesla (TSLA)  Chevron (CVX)  the airlines  Lockheed Martin (LMT)  Visa (V)  American Express (AXP)  3M (MMM)  Abbott Labs (ABT)  J&J (JNJ)  GE (GE)  IBM (IBM)  and Colgate-Palmolive (CL).EUThe flash PMIs early in the week will be of keen interest as investors continue to assess how much trouble the economy is in. A relatively mild winter to date has boosted the bloc‚Äôs economic prospects as gas prices have fallen considerably.This isn‚Äôt expected to be reflected in the PMIs though  with the prospect of much higher interest rates and a tougher global economic environment continuing to weigh. It will be interesting to see if there is any improvement as a result of this and China‚Äôs growth prospects.Regardless  markets expect the ECB to hike by another 150 basis points over the coming meetings and officials have been keen to ensure investors don‚Äôt become complacent on that. I expect more commentary along those lines next week.UKWhile the PMIs would typically be the standout release next week  investors may have more of an eye on the PPI inflation data for signs of inflationary pressures subsiding. The CPI data in December declined for a second month but remains far too high  above 10%. We‚Äôll need to see much greater signs of those pressures abating before the Bank of England can become more comfortable.RussiaThe only economic release of note is the PPI data. That aside  the focus will remain on the war in Ukraine.South AfricaThe SARB is expected to raise interest rates by another 50 basis points on Thursday  taking the repo rate to 7.5%  although they could opt for only 25. Inflation has been heading in the right direction since peaking in the summer and could be back within the 3-6% target range before long. Investors will be looking for signs on whether the tightening cycle is now at or near an end.TurkeyThe CBRT left the repo rate unchanged at 9% in January after opting to pause the easing cycle late last year. The quarterly inflation report may offer insight into whether rates will fall again and when but that aside  I‚Äôm not sure it will contain much of note given the logic adopted to justify cutting interest rates over the last couple of years.SwitzerlandTrade data is the only notable release next week.ChinaThis Saturday is Chinese New Year‚Äôs Eve  followed by the Spring Festival. The New Year atmosphere which generally extends until at least the end of January may further stimulate domestic consumption and investment in China.The billions of trips made during the Chinese New Year could bring the second wave of Covid-19 to largely unaffected rural areas and smaller cities. Given that the general population will have a higher level of immunity  the economic impact of a second outbreak should be less in areas that have already withstood the main wave of evacuations.IndiaNo major data or central bank appearances are expected.Australia & New ZealandChina‚Äôs full reopening since the beginning of January this year and its renewed focus on ‚Äòeconomic development‚Äô will benefit economic growth in Australia and New Zealand. The largest potential upside from reopening itself sits within the services sector given China is the largest consumer of Australian tourism and education exports.Australia recently released its CPI for November at an annual rate of 7.3%  in line with expectations but higher than the previous value of 6.9%  indicating that Australia‚Äôs inflation level may still not have peaked.The RBA‚Äôs CPI for December will be released on Thursday  as well as its revised CPI average quarterly rate for the fourth quarter. New Zealand‚Äôs CPI for the fourth quarter will offer clues on whether sustainable disinflation is underway.JapanThe Bank of Japan monetary policy decision saw them defer any major decisions until at least Governor Kuroda‚Äôs last meeting in March  barring any surprises in the interim.Following that  the summary of opinions on Wednesday could be of interest  as will the December minutes  released Monday. Despite being outdated now  it will provide perspective on the decision to unexpectedly tweak its yield curve control band.Next week also focuses on the Japan PMI readings  leading index  and Tokyo‚Äôs CPI.SingaporeThe release of the December inflation will be followed closely. MAS sees core inflation averaging 3.5%‚Äì4.5% this year.Economic CalendarSaturday  Jan. 21Economic EventsUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen visits Senegal  Zambia  and South AfricaSunday  Jan.

16893,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4570717-acomo-robust-resilient-and-trading-at-less-than-10x-fcf,Acomo: Robust  Resilient And Trading At Less Than 10x FCF (OTCMKTS:ACNFF),Acomo is a Netherlands-based company focusing on trading nuts  spices  seeds and tea. Read what could be 'hiding' the strong underlying cash flows.,narong niamfoi/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionAcomo (OTCPK:ACNFF)  previously known as Amsterdam Commodities  is a Dutch company focusing on the sourcing  trading  processing and distribution of food products. With in excess of 600 products (including spices  tea and oil)  Acomo comes pretty close to what the Dutch East India company did in the 17 th and 18 th century.Yahoo FinanceAcomo's main listing is on Euronext Amsterdam where it is trading with ACOMO as its ticker symbol. As the average daily volume in Amsterdam is almost 40 000 shares per day  I would strongly recommend to use the company's Dutch listing to trade in its shares.Acomo is a cash cowBack in 2020  I was surprised at how resilient Acomo was during the COVID pandemic. As you can see below  the revenue in 2020 actually increased while the EBITDA only slightly decreased and that was very comforting to see as Acomo got through the pandemic without too many issues.Acomo Investor RelationsThe sudden bump in revenue and EBITDA in 2021 was caused by the acquisition of Tradin Organics from SunOpta in December 2020. Acomo funded the all-cash transaction with a combination of equity (through a capital raise priced at 19.50 EUR) and debt.Unfortunately the company does not publish quarterly results  and except in unforeseen circumstances  there are no interim trading updates either. While the most recently available financial data stems from H1 2022 and may seem outdated  I'd like to think that considering no profit warning has been issued yet  the H2 results would have been more or less in line with the expectations.During the first half of 2022  Acomo reported a 15% revenue increase  which jumped to almost 712M EUR. And as the company was not immune for margin pressure  the EBITDA increased by just 5% to 56.1M EUR for an EBITDA margin of just under 7.9% compared to 8.6% in the first half of last year.Acomo Investor RelationsThis doesn't mean the results were bad  and the income statement below the EBITDA result were pretty decent  as you can see below. The net income was 31.2M EUR of which 31.1M EUR was attributable to the shareholders of Acomo  resulting in an EPS of 1.05 EUR.Acomo Investor RelationsWhile the bottom line isn't increasing as fast as the revenue is  I'm still encouraged to see a net income increase of 8.7%.The interest expenses increased  not because of higher interest rates (which weren't too noticeable yet in the first semester of 2022) but because the company borrowed more cash to fund its working capital investments. As you can see below  the reported operating cash flow was a negative 5.9M EUR  but this was mainly caused by the 47.8M EUR investment in the working capital position.Acomo Investor RelationsOn an adjusted basis  and after also including the 2.3M EUR lease payment  the underlying operating cash flow was 39.6M EUR. And as the total capex was just 1.9M EUR  the underlying free cash flow was 37.7M EUR or 1.27 EUR per share based on the current share count of 29.6M shares outstanding.Seeing how the free cash flow is higher than the reported earnings is not a surprise as the sustaining capex is substantially lower than the depreciation and amortization expenses. In 2021  for instance  the annual report confirmed the total depreciation and amortization expenses came in at 24.6M EUR while the capex (7.8M EUR) and lease payments (4.1M EUR) on a combined basis were just over half the depreciation and amortization expenses.Acomo Investor RelationsThe adjusted operating cash flow in FY 2021 was 79.9M EUR and after deducting the capex  the underlying free cash flow result was even in excess of 72M EUR or 2.43 EUR per share.I'm not sure Acomo will be able to keep its full-year free cash flow result stable. While I expect the full-year EBITDA to beat last year's 105M EUR in EBITDA  I'm mainly concerned about the impact of higher interest rates on the interest expenses. As of the end of June  Acomo had 362M EUR in gross debt and a 200 basis point interest increase would result in a 7.3M EUR increase in interest expenses and a subsequent decrease of the adjusted free cash flow by 5.5M EUR or 19 cents per share. Fortunately Acomo was able to amend its financing agreements with its lenders  so there is no near-term pressure on the group.Investment thesisThe increasing interest rates make debt management more important than ever. And while Acomo's underlying free cash flow (excluding working capital changes) are very strong  we can't deny those WC investments are a drag on the financial performance and debt levels. That being said  the company had a positive working capital position (current assets minus current liabilities) of 245M EUR thanks to a high inventory level (439M EUR). While increasing inventory levels could be a reason to be concerned  the financial statements clearly show Acomo's inventory levels are increasing in line with its revenue increase. As of the end of 2021  inventories represented 31% of the revenue while that percentage has remained stable based on the annualized H1 revenue. It's a drag  but not a concern.I currently have no position in Acomo  but I may go long in the next few weeks.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

This serious condition causes patients to have a low level of phosphorous in the blood.While mild hypophosphatemia is common and many patients are asymptomatic  severe hypophosphatemia can be life-threatening and requires medical treatment. The condition can result in different health challenges  including muscle and bone weakness  respiratory or heart failure  seizures or coma.Deficiency of this vital mineral is always linked to an underlying condition  such as diabetes  anorexia  use of diuretics or alcohol abuse. A more extensive list can be found at the end of this press release under ‚ÄúAbout Hypophosphatemia‚Äù.It is estimated hypophosphatemia affects around 5% of hospitalized patients 1 and a subpopulation needs direct treatment during and/or after their hospital stay.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a source of pride for us to ensure that drugs administered to patients are accompanied by clear instructions and have demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety. A registered product entails the treatment has been validated by regulators  which ensures fast and equal access and offers peace of mind to physicians and patients.‚Äù‚ÄúThe expected costs for Hyloris stay well below our required average investment of less than EUR 7 million per product candidate. This interesting new opportunity brings us one step closer to a total pipeline of 30 assets  a goal we aim to achieve before 2025.‚ÄùTreatment protocols for patients deficient in phosphate are well-established and have proven useful in other situations of bone mineral imbalance. Oral administration is the preferred way of treating hypophosphatemia  although in most countries no approved drugs exist. Currently  physicians mostly rely on compounded drugs which have  by definition  not been submitted for regulatory scrutiny regarding safety  efficacy  and quality.Hyloris will seek advice and approval from regulators by making use of the rich body of clinical data that has emerged from established clinical practice. With a primary on safety of the product  Hyloris intends to conduct a streamlined development program to achieve market access in Europe  targeting regulatory approval in European countries as from 2026.Global rights of the ongoing development have been licensed-in from Dutch company  QliniQ  who maintains the rights to commercialize the product candidate in its home country  and a selected number of Middle Eastern and developing countries.The external development cost including the licensing fee is expected to remain below EUR 2 million. Besides agreed upon product development costs that will be incurred  no further payments will be owed to QliniQ.Albert de Bruin  Managing Director of QliniQ  added: ‚ÄúThanks to Hyloris and its demonstrated expertise in bringing new drugs to international markets  our product candidate could help many more patients. We have tremendous confidence in Hyloris‚Äô ability to navigate the regulatory path towards improved patient outcomes.‚ÄùSeparately  Hyloris has divested HY-038 to QliniQ for a price of EUR 1 million. This generic product was considered a non-core asset by Hyloris. This transaction highlights once again an increased focus on value-added repurposed or reformulated product candidates.About HypophosphatemiaHypophosphatemia is a condition where the blood level of phosphorus is low (<2.5mg/dl). This condition can occur due to decrease in oral or intestinal resorption  increased renal excretion or internal redistribution of phosphate.There is a wide range of underlying conditions leading to hypophosphatemia which could be hereditary (such as X-linked hypophosphatemia  hypophosphatemic rickets  osteomalacia  Cushing syndrome) or acquired (anorexia nervosa  recovery phase of diabetes-related ketoacidosis  alcohol withdrawal  respiratory alkalosis  long term use of diuretic and phosphate binders)2.Chronic hypophosphatemia can become life threatening  making direct treatment of the hypophosphatemia desirable in cases where treating the underlying condition does not solve the mineral deficiency.Many patients are asymptomatic. Symptoms of moderate to severe hypophosphatemia include bone pain  muscle dysfunction  rhabdomyolysis  hemolysis  Leucocyte dysfunction  metabolic encephalopathy  respiratory failure  impaired myocardial performance3. Depending on the clinical condition  the standard of treatment is dietary supplement (in mild cases)  oral intake (moderate to severe)  and intravenous phosphate (Severe)2.About QliniQQliniQ is a Dutch company which develops and in-licenses drugs and medical supplies in various therapeutic domains and commercializes these in the Netherlands. QliniQ nurtures cooperation and long lasting business relationships with international companies as part of its successful market approach.About Hyloris Pharmaceuticals SAHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.

16899,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/DGB-GROUP-N-V-6434/news/DGB-N-Why-is-the-Guardian-so-negative-about-conserving-rainforests-42780063/?utm_medium=RSS&utm_content=20230120,DGB N : Why is the Guardian so negative about conserving rainforests?,(marketscreener.com)   The Guardian published an article this week that raised concerns about the effectiveness of rainforest carbon-offset projects  known as REDD+ projects  in reducing deforestation and carbon emissions. REDD+ projects are part of the Vol‚Ä¶,"The Guardian published an article this week that raised concerns about the effectiveness of rainforest carbon-offset projects  known as REDD+ projects  in reducing deforestation and carbon emissions. REDD+ projects are part of the Voluntary Carbon Standard and aim to protect and restore forests in order to reduce carbon emissions. However  the Guardian article suggests that the methodologies used in these projects are fundamentally flawed and lead to inaccurate conclusions.This is a serious concern  not only for companies that depend on carbon offsetting as part of their net zero and biodiversity strategies  but for the planet as a whole. Deforestation and biodiversity loss are major global issues  and it is crucial that any efforts to address them are based on sound science and accurate data.As the CEO of DGB Group  a carbon project developer with a long history of working to protect and restore nature  I feel compelled to address the concerns raised by the Guardian. Furthermore  I want to provide some context to carbon offsetting and the voluntary carbon markets.While DGB's focus is on different categories of carbon dioxide emission reduction and removal projects  the Guardian's reporting brings disrepute to the voluntary carbon market - to the detriment of genuine initiatives and nature conservation projects. Why are these journalists so negative about efforts to protect and conserve forests?The article in question claims that over 90% of rainforest carbon-offset credits approved by leading provider Verra are ""phantom credits"" and may even contribute to global heating. The journalists question the effectiveness of credits purchased by several companies  naming Disney  Shell  and Gucci.These claims are based on a new analysis of scientific studies of Verra's rainforest schemes. The Guardian journalists claim that only a handful of Verra's rainforest projects showed evidence of deforestation reductions  suggesting that 94% of the credits had no benefit to the climate. The consequence of this reporting will increase public scepticism and diminish the confidence of companies depending on offsets as part of their net zero strategies.The investigation raises questions about the effectiveness of carbon-offset credits and the potential for them to be used as a form of 'greenwashing'. The problem with carbon offsetting is that it can be difficult to determine the true impact of a project and whether it truly results in genuine carbon reductions. Even though this is particularly relevant in the case of rainforest-offset projects  which can be complex and difficult to monitor  a single minded attack like this does not benefit anyone. Least of all the local communities living in these areas and the genuine efforts to help nature flourish and prosper.Verra disputes the findings of the Guardian article  stating that the studies relied on are based on incorrect conclusions and flawed methodologies. Verra argues that the synthetic control approach used by the underlying studies does not accurately represent the pre-project conditions in the project area. Verra's methodologies are designed to take into account site-specific drivers of deforestation and compare projects to real areas  not synthetic controls.Verra emphasises that their methodologies are based on the best available science and technology and continually improve through rigorous consultations with experts. They rightfully argue that their work has enabled billions of dollars to be channelled to the vital cause of preserving forests. Verified carbon credits are the world's major funder of nature  funding the protection of endangered habitats and rainforests. What other mechanism enables billions to be spent on the protection of rainforests?It is important to note that the studies mentioned in the Guardian article are but a fraction of sources available on carbon offsetting and the effectiveness of Verra's methodologies. Other studies and experts in the field have shown that  when done correctly  carbon offsetting is a valuable tool in the fight against deforestation  biodiversity loss  and ecosystem restoration. The Guardian's journalists seem to pick and choose their sources.Project developer EverlandProject developer Everland has also disputed the Guardian's article  noting it was based on three scientific papers that used a 'pixel-matching' approach  which they argue is fundamentally flawed and resulted in inaccurate conclusions. Everland point out that the studies do not compare 'like' with 'like' and that slight differences in the chosen matching criteria can produce substantial differences in the results of pixel-matching analyses.The carbon experts at Everland demonstrated five clear reasons why the analysis on which the article led to inaccurate and misleading conclusions:The studies do not compare 'like' with 'like'; The results vary wildly; The underlying data is highly uncertain and simplistic; The study was not peer reviewed; A misrepresentation is made of key references.Everland emphasises that carbon projects are one of the most effective mechanisms for providing economic value for conservation and that they must be scaled up urgently to end deforestation by 2030. We could not agree more.Carbon rating agency SylveraSylvera has invested heavily in researching and validating carbon-credit claims. They use a combination of field research  data synthesis  and machine learning to ensure the accuracy of emissions reductions. Their frameworks are peer-reviewed by experts in the field.The team at Sylvera states in their response to the article that the Guardian's claim is hugely overstated and not in line with their own deep analysis and research  or representative of some of the cited papers.'This article risks damaging one of the best mechanisms we currently have for funding the wide-scale conservation of natural carbon sinks.'- SylveraTrading platform EmsurgeThe carbon trading experts at Emsurge state that the journalists should focus on the transformation that is taking place today. They point to the fact that the same technology the Guardian has used to critique projects is also being adopted by companies to understand which projects they should invest in  creating a market for higher-quality credits. Criticising carbon projects too aggressively makes it easy for executives to do nothing instead of improving. We need to better protect our rainforests and value nature.'It's a shame the Guardian didn't put more emphasis on the quality projects they found and how we can better protect our rainforests. Verra REDD+ may have its flaws but the bigger issue here is we are failing to value nature and carbon markets are at least trying to solve that.'- Emsurge CEO  Melissa LindsayThe carbon market provides a mechanism for verifiable carbon-reduction efforts and scaling nature-based solutions. A degree of scrutiny helps to promote transparency  accountability  and the effectiveness of carbon offsetting projects  and can improve the growth of the industry. The Guardian raises important questions  specifically about the effectiveness of rainforest-offset credits provided by Verra. However  it is important to remember that carbon offsetting is not a simple solution and that like the methodologies and standards used to measure the impact of these projects  any analysis of same must be robust and based on the best-available science.Carbon offsetting is a vital tool to protect the natural environment. By purchasing carbon credits  companies and individuals are funding projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. These projects not only have a direct impact on reducing emissions  but also provide important co-benefits such as increasing biodiversity levels  improving the livelihoods of local communities and protecting natural habitats.The voluntary carbon market is still in its infancy  and it will take time to iron out the kinks. While the current market is just 2 billion dollars  exponential growth is predicted by almost all industry experts. In the meantime  it is essential that companies and organisations look closely at the carbon offset projects they are supporting and ensure that they are truly effective in reducing emissions and benefiting the planet.Carbon offsetting is not the sole solution  but any rational person should understand that any efforts to protect habitats and help nature are better than none and do make a difference. The key is to ensure that carbon-offset projects are high-quality  transparent  and independently verified and act as a complement to other carbon reduction and adaptation strategies.For a buyer  it is important to carefully evaluate carbon-credit projects and only purchase credits from reputable providers - ideally  directly from the source  i.e. the project developer. Carbon offsetting is essential in addressing ecosystem restoration  nature conservation  and deforestation. It is thus vital that we continue to support and improve these markets.At DGB  we believe that carbon removals through reforestation and soil carbon sequestration are essential nature-based solutions. These projects not only remove carbon from the atmosphere but provide tangible co-benefits  improving biodiversity conservation  soil health  employment for local communities  and water management.We are dedicated to making a positive impact on the environment through the development and operation of large-scale  sustainable carbon projects. Our focus is on tree planting  restoring natural habitats  and helping the planet achieve net zero emissions through carbon removal via nature-based solutions.As a for-profit organisation listed on the Amsterdam Euronext stock exchange  we are subject to strict rules and fierce compliance. Our goal is to make a real  visible impact on the environment and work towards a healthier  more sustainable planet for us and future generations. We take a boots-on-the-ground approach to ensure high-quality  large-scale carbon and biodiversity projects that make a positive difference for the planet.'As a project developer of high-quality  large-scale carbon and biodiversity projects accredited by leading verification standards  we focus on nature conservation and helping biodiversity flourish by assisting governments and corporations in achieving net zero via verified emission reduction credits. Carbon offsetting is the best way to finance large-scale ecosystem restoration.' - DGB Group CEO  Selwyn DuijvestijnCarbon projects are currently the best way to invest in conservation  reforestation  and other initiatives that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Carbon projects are crucial in the fight against deforestation and biodiversity loss.The discussions that flare up from time to time about the accuracy of carbon offset projects highlight the importance of ensuring that projects are held to high standards of scientific and journalistic integrity. It is important to have transparency and accurate measuring and reporting of their progress.carbon-offset projects accurately measure and report their progress. However  this debate must not detract from the overall importance of these projects and the vital role that carbon offsetting plays in addressing ecosystem restoration  nature conservation  and the fight against deforestation  desertification  and biodiversity loss.At DGB  we are dedicated to making a positive impact on the environment through carbon removals and the development and operation of carbon projects. Carbon offsetting is one of the best tools we have to preserve nature and biodiversity. We are committed to bringing excellence to carbon projects and nature conservation. Our projects in Kenya  Uganda  and Cameroon have a significant positive impact on the environment  wildlife  and communities at large.We are on the ground to ensure our projects are executed to the highest standard and that they make a real difference. Our goal is to positively impact the environment and work towards a healthier  more sustainable planet for us and future generations.Further reading and references:",negative,0.0,0.0,1.0,mixed,0.19,0.1,0.71,True,English,"['DGB N', 'Guardian', 'rainforests', 'carbon dioxide emission reduction', 'single minded attack', 'five clear reasons', 'Voluntary Carbon Standard', 'voluntary carbon markets', 'best available science', 'three scientific papers', 'major global issues', 'synthetic control approach', 'carbon project developer', 'net zero strategies', 'Verified carbon credits', 'genuine carbon reductions', 'leading provider Verra', 'Project developer Everland', 'rainforest carbon-offset projects', 'rainforest carbon-offset credits', 'nature conservation projects', 'The Guardian journalists', 'carbon emissions', 'carbon offsetting', 'biodiversity strategies', 'sound science', 'global heating', 'rainforest schemes', 'rainforest projects', 'synthetic controls', 'major funder', ""pixel-matching' approach"", 'carbon projects', 'project area', 'genuine initiatives', 'REDD+ projects', 'serious concern', 'biodiversity loss', 'accurate data', 'long history', 'different categories', 'removal projects', 'phantom credits', 'public scepticism', 'true impact', 'rainforest-offset projects', 'local communities', 'incorrect conclusions', 'pre-project conditions', 'site-specific drivers', 'rigorous consultations', 'vital cause', 'endangered habitats', 'other mechanism', 'valuable tool', 'ecosystem restoration', 'slight differences', 'matching criteria', 'substantial differences', 'pixel-matching analyses', 'misleading conclusions', 'underlying data', 'key references', 'scientific studies', 'carbon experts', 'deforestation reductions', 'inaccurate conclusions', 'genuine efforts', 'DGB Group', 'new analysis', 'real areas', 'underlying studies', 'Other studies', 'several companies', 'Guardian article', 'flawed methodologies', 'concerns', 'effectiveness', 'part', 'forests', 'order', 'planet', 'CEO', 'context', 'focus', 'reporting', 'disrepute', 'detriment', 'conserve', 'question', 'Disney', 'Shell', 'Gucci', 'claims', 'handful', 'evidence', 'benefit', 'climate', 'consequence', 'confidence', 'offsets', 'investigation', 'potential', 'form', 'greenwashing', 'problem', 'case', 'findings', 'account', 'technology', 'work', 'billions', 'dollars', 'world', 'protection', 'fraction', 'sources', 'field', 'fight', 'results', 'study', 'misrepresentation']",2023-01-20,2023-01-21,marketscreener.com
