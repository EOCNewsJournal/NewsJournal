16888,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4571339-week-ahead-earnings-season-a-highlight,Week Ahead - Earnings Season A Highlight,It will be a busy week filled with the first look at Q4 GDP  corporate earnings  and US debt ceiling gridlock.,Darren415USIt will be a busy week filled with the first look at Q4 GDP  corporate earnings  and US debt ceiling gridlock. There is a lot of risk on the table and a key focal point for many will be the modest growth we will see alongside a plethora of data points that are signalling recession warnings. Traders will want to see if the contraction manufacturing and service PMI readings we saw in December show any improvement this month.Wall Street is also fixating on what will happen with debt ceiling talks. Special measures are being used and that should stave off default until June 5th  but flare-ups will most likely happen along the way.Earnings season shifts away from the banks and now focuses on broader parts of the economy. Key earnings include results from Tesla (TSLA)  Chevron (CVX)  the airlines  Lockheed Martin (LMT)  Visa (V)  American Express (AXP)  3M (MMM)  Abbott Labs (ABT)  J&J (JNJ)  GE (GE)  IBM (IBM)  and Colgate-Palmolive (CL).EUThe flash PMIs early in the week will be of keen interest as investors continue to assess how much trouble the economy is in. A relatively mild winter to date has boosted the bloc‚Äôs economic prospects as gas prices have fallen considerably.This isn‚Äôt expected to be reflected in the PMIs though  with the prospect of much higher interest rates and a tougher global economic environment continuing to weigh. It will be interesting to see if there is any improvement as a result of this and China‚Äôs growth prospects.Regardless  markets expect the ECB to hike by another 150 basis points over the coming meetings and officials have been keen to ensure investors don‚Äôt become complacent on that. I expect more commentary along those lines next week.UKWhile the PMIs would typically be the standout release next week  investors may have more of an eye on the PPI inflation data for signs of inflationary pressures subsiding. The CPI data in December declined for a second month but remains far too high  above 10%. We‚Äôll need to see much greater signs of those pressures abating before the Bank of England can become more comfortable.RussiaThe only economic release of note is the PPI data. That aside  the focus will remain on the war in Ukraine.South AfricaThe SARB is expected to raise interest rates by another 50 basis points on Thursday  taking the repo rate to 7.5%  although they could opt for only 25. Inflation has been heading in the right direction since peaking in the summer and could be back within the 3-6% target range before long. Investors will be looking for signs on whether the tightening cycle is now at or near an end.TurkeyThe CBRT left the repo rate unchanged at 9% in January after opting to pause the easing cycle late last year. The quarterly inflation report may offer insight into whether rates will fall again and when but that aside  I‚Äôm not sure it will contain much of note given the logic adopted to justify cutting interest rates over the last couple of years.SwitzerlandTrade data is the only notable release next week.ChinaThis Saturday is Chinese New Year‚Äôs Eve  followed by the Spring Festival. The New Year atmosphere which generally extends until at least the end of January may further stimulate domestic consumption and investment in China.The billions of trips made during the Chinese New Year could bring the second wave of Covid-19 to largely unaffected rural areas and smaller cities. Given that the general population will have a higher level of immunity  the economic impact of a second outbreak should be less in areas that have already withstood the main wave of evacuations.IndiaNo major data or central bank appearances are expected.Australia & New ZealandChina‚Äôs full reopening since the beginning of January this year and its renewed focus on ‚Äòeconomic development‚Äô will benefit economic growth in Australia and New Zealand. The largest potential upside from reopening itself sits within the services sector given China is the largest consumer of Australian tourism and education exports.Australia recently released its CPI for November at an annual rate of 7.3%  in line with expectations but higher than the previous value of 6.9%  indicating that Australia‚Äôs inflation level may still not have peaked.The RBA‚Äôs CPI for December will be released on Thursday  as well as its revised CPI average quarterly rate for the fourth quarter. New Zealand‚Äôs CPI for the fourth quarter will offer clues on whether sustainable disinflation is underway.JapanThe Bank of Japan monetary policy decision saw them defer any major decisions until at least Governor Kuroda‚Äôs last meeting in March  barring any surprises in the interim.Following that  the summary of opinions on Wednesday could be of interest  as will the December minutes  released Monday. Despite being outdated now  it will provide perspective on the decision to unexpectedly tweak its yield curve control band.Next week also focuses on the Japan PMI readings  leading index  and Tokyo‚Äôs CPI.SingaporeThe release of the December inflation will be followed closely. MAS sees core inflation averaging 3.5%‚Äì4.5% this year.Economic CalendarSaturday  Jan. 21Economic EventsUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen visits Senegal  Zambia  and South AfricaSunday  Jan.

16893,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4570717-acomo-robust-resilient-and-trading-at-less-than-10x-fcf,Acomo: Robust  Resilient And Trading At Less Than 10x FCF (OTCMKTS:ACNFF),Acomo is a Netherlands-based company focusing on trading nuts  spices  seeds and tea. Read what could be 'hiding' the strong underlying cash flows.,narong niamfoi/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionAcomo (OTCPK:ACNFF)  previously known as Amsterdam Commodities  is a Dutch company focusing on the sourcing  trading  processing and distribution of food products. With in excess of 600 products (including spices  tea and oil)  Acomo comes pretty close to what the Dutch East India company did in the 17 th and 18 th century.Yahoo FinanceAcomo's main listing is on Euronext Amsterdam where it is trading with ACOMO as its ticker symbol. As the average daily volume in Amsterdam is almost 40 000 shares per day  I would strongly recommend to use the company's Dutch listing to trade in its shares.Acomo is a cash cowBack in 2020  I was surprised at how resilient Acomo was during the COVID pandemic. As you can see below  the revenue in 2020 actually increased while the EBITDA only slightly decreased and that was very comforting to see as Acomo got through the pandemic without too many issues.Acomo Investor RelationsThe sudden bump in revenue and EBITDA in 2021 was caused by the acquisition of Tradin Organics from SunOpta in December 2020. Acomo funded the all-cash transaction with a combination of equity (through a capital raise priced at 19.50 EUR) and debt.Unfortunately the company does not publish quarterly results  and except in unforeseen circumstances  there are no interim trading updates either. While the most recently available financial data stems from H1 2022 and may seem outdated  I'd like to think that considering no profit warning has been issued yet  the H2 results would have been more or less in line with the expectations.During the first half of 2022  Acomo reported a 15% revenue increase  which jumped to almost 712M EUR. And as the company was not immune for margin pressure  the EBITDA increased by just 5% to 56.1M EUR for an EBITDA margin of just under 7.9% compared to 8.6% in the first half of last year.Acomo Investor RelationsThis doesn't mean the results were bad  and the income statement below the EBITDA result were pretty decent  as you can see below. The net income was 31.2M EUR of which 31.1M EUR was attributable to the shareholders of Acomo  resulting in an EPS of 1.05 EUR.Acomo Investor RelationsWhile the bottom line isn't increasing as fast as the revenue is  I'm still encouraged to see a net income increase of 8.7%.The interest expenses increased  not because of higher interest rates (which weren't too noticeable yet in the first semester of 2022) but because the company borrowed more cash to fund its working capital investments. As you can see below  the reported operating cash flow was a negative 5.9M EUR  but this was mainly caused by the 47.8M EUR investment in the working capital position.Acomo Investor RelationsOn an adjusted basis  and after also including the 2.3M EUR lease payment  the underlying operating cash flow was 39.6M EUR. And as the total capex was just 1.9M EUR  the underlying free cash flow was 37.7M EUR or 1.27 EUR per share based on the current share count of 29.6M shares outstanding.Seeing how the free cash flow is higher than the reported earnings is not a surprise as the sustaining capex is substantially lower than the depreciation and amortization expenses. In 2021  for instance  the annual report confirmed the total depreciation and amortization expenses came in at 24.6M EUR while the capex (7.8M EUR) and lease payments (4.1M EUR) on a combined basis were just over half the depreciation and amortization expenses.Acomo Investor RelationsThe adjusted operating cash flow in FY 2021 was 79.9M EUR and after deducting the capex  the underlying free cash flow result was even in excess of 72M EUR or 2.43 EUR per share.I'm not sure Acomo will be able to keep its full-year free cash flow result stable. While I expect the full-year EBITDA to beat last year's 105M EUR in EBITDA  I'm mainly concerned about the impact of higher interest rates on the interest expenses. As of the end of June  Acomo had 362M EUR in gross debt and a 200 basis point interest increase would result in a 7.3M EUR increase in interest expenses and a subsequent decrease of the adjusted free cash flow by 5.5M EUR or 19 cents per share. Fortunately Acomo was able to amend its financing agreements with its lenders  so there is no near-term pressure on the group.Investment thesisThe increasing interest rates make debt management more important than ever. And while Acomo's underlying free cash flow (excluding working capital changes) are very strong  we can't deny those WC investments are a drag on the financial performance and debt levels. That being said  the company had a positive working capital position (current assets minus current liabilities) of 245M EUR thanks to a high inventory level (439M EUR). While increasing inventory levels could be a reason to be concerned  the financial statements clearly show Acomo's inventory levels are increasing in line with its revenue increase. As of the end of 2021  inventories represented 31% of the revenue while that percentage has remained stable based on the annualized H1 revenue. It's a drag  but not a concern.I currently have no position in Acomo  but I may go long in the next few weeks.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

BlackRock recently warned investors that old playbooks and approaches can't be relied on  and to prepare portfolios for a paradigm shift.Analysts have pointed to four big reasons why the S&P 500 will likely underperform this year.Morgan Stanley's chief stock strategist Mike Wilson Bloomberg1. An earnings recession will ravage stocksS&P 500 companies are set to report weak earnings this year  with the market is still reeling from the impact of Fed rate hikes in 2022 and cooling inflation set to take a bite out of revenues. Central bankers hiked interest rates a whopping 425-basis-points last year and signaled they will start to ease up on their tightening efforts in 2023. But stocks have already taken a hit  and the full effects of those rate hikes has yet to be felt in the market.Morgan Stanley's top stock strategist Mike Wilson estimated that corporate earnings expectations for 2023 were about 20% too high among investors  which means the worst earnings recession since 2008 could hit the market this year. He predicted the S&P 500 would fall 24% in the early half of the year  in line with estimates from Bank of America and Deutsche Bank.The Fed is rapidly reducing the size of its balance sheet through quantitative tightening. Reuters2. Liquidity is being flushed out of the marketIn addition to rate hikes  the Fed is rapidly reducing the size of its balance sheet by around $95 billion a month  a form of monetary tightening that can help reduce asset inflation by taking liquidity out of the market. But that's a headwind ahead for many asset classes  including stocks  particularly growth and tech stocks that have been boosted by ultra liquid condition and traders desperately seeking higher returns amid the low rate environment.The central bank has already shaved off $381 billion from its balance sheet since last April  and stocks have plunged as erased most of the gains made during the pandemic period of interest rates near zero and ample cash sloshing around the market.The liquidity runoff is the ""elephant in the room "" Morgan Stanley said  predicting that continued tightening could cause the S&P 500 to drop another 15% by March. Bank of America has predicted a milder decline of 7%.The S&P 500 is overcrowded  according to Bank of America's chief stock strategist. REUTERS/Dario Cantatore/NYSE Euronext3. The S&P 500 is a crowded tradeToo many investors are huddled in the S&P 500 ‚Äì and that's going to make any bouts of volatility even worse as traders move to sell en masse when trouble hits  according to Bank of America's top stock strategist Savita Subramanian.""The problem is everyone is using muscle memory to go back into what they think of as the safest equity market  which is the S&P 500. Trouble is  if everybody is in the S&P 500  and they're all selling at the same time  the S&P isn't really that safe "" Subramanian said in a recent interview with Bloomberg.She urged investors to exit crowded areas of the market  like tech  and to bet on energy and small cap stocks.John Hussman  the market veteran who called the dot-com bust. YouTube / John Mauldin4. Stocks are still overvaluedStocks in the S&P 500 are still overvalued despite the steep sell-off of last year  according to market veteran John Hussman  who warned that the index could see negative returns over the next decade.Hussman  who called the burst the dot-com bubble in 2000  noted that his favorite valuation measure in the S&P 500 was at a similar level to where it was at the peak of the dot-com era. That indicator has the best track record out of any measure to predicting long-run returns for the stock index  Hussman warned  who thinks the S&P 500 still has more room to fall.""Notice how little impact the 2022 market decline to-date has had on valuations "" he said. ""Though recent market losses have removed the most extreme speculative froth  our most reliable valuation measures remain near their 1929 and 2000 extremes.""He warned that the S&P 500 could fall another 60% on a ""very long  interesting trip to nowhere "" which would bring the index close to 1 500. He estimated the S&P 500 would see an average return of -6% over the next 10-12 years.",negative,0.01,0.08,0.92,mixed,0.11,0.08,0.81,True,English,"['2nd straight year', 'sky-high valuations', 'S&P 500', 'earnings', '4 reasons', 'experts', 'losses', 'Some Wall Street observers', 'aggressive interest rate increases', 'market veteran John Hussman', 'app Email address', 'other partner offers', 'Wall Street analysts', 'ultra liquid condition', 'Dario Cantatore/NYSE Euronext', 'best track record', 'chief stock strategist', 'top stock strategist', 'low rate environment', 'four lingering headwinds', 'four big reasons', 'corporate earnings expectations', 'aggressive Fed policy', 'many asset classes', 'safest equity market', 'S&P 500 companies', 'benchmark stock index', 'favorite valuation measure', 'The S&P 500', 'Fed rate hikes', 'small cap stocks', 'Mike Wilson Bloomberg', 'worst earnings recession', 'recent market losses', 'The Fed', 'worst losses', 'interest rates', 'John Mauldin', 'favorite topics', 'Privacy Policy', 'weak earnings', 'recent interview', 'asset inflation', 'market headwinds', 'big hit', 'inside scoop', 'personalized feed', 'marketing emails', 'safe bet', 'Federal Reserve', 'new era', 'anemic returns', 'old playbooks', 'paradigm shift', 'Morgan Stanley', 'tightening efforts', 'full effects', 'early half', 'balance sheet', 'quantitative tightening', 'monetary tightening', 'higher returns', 'last April', 'pandemic period', 'continued tightening', 'milder decline', 'crowded trade', 'muscle memory', 'same time', 'crowded areas', 'steep sell-off', 'negative returns', 'next decade', 'com bubble', 'similar level', 'com era', 'long-run returns', 'extreme speculativ', 'rising inflation', '2022 market decline', 'dismal year', 'many investors', 'last year', 'heightened volatility', 'Central bankers', 'Savita Subramanian', 'little impact', 'Deutsche Bank', 'liquidity runoff', '2008 recession', 'showing', 'newsletter', 'traders', 'inbox', 'Something', 'go', 'Insider', 'Terms', 'Service', 'myriad', 'macro', 'fears', 'BlackRock', 'approaches', 'portfolios', 'bite', 'revenues', '425-basis-points', 'estimates', 'America', 'size', 'Reuters', 'addition', 'form', 'growth', 'gains', 'cash', 'elephant', 'room', 'March', 'bouts', 'masse', 'trouble', 'problem', 'everyone', 'everybody', 'energy', 'YouTube', 'burst', 'dot', 'peak', 'indicator', 'date', '2023']",2023-01-22,2023-01-22,markets.businessinsider.com
