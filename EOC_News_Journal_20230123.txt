BlackRock recently warned investors that old playbooks and approaches can't be relied on  and to prepare portfolios for a paradigm shift.Analysts have pointed to four big reasons why the S&P 500 will likely underperform this year.Morgan Stanley's chief stock strategist Mike Wilson Bloomberg1. An earnings recession will ravage stocksS&P 500 companies are set to report weak earnings this year  with the market is still reeling from the impact of Fed rate hikes in 2022 and cooling inflation set to take a bite out of revenues. Central bankers hiked interest rates a whopping 425-basis-points last year and signaled they will start to ease up on their tightening efforts in 2023. But stocks have already taken a hit  and the full effects of those rate hikes has yet to be felt in the market.Morgan Stanley's top stock strategist Mike Wilson estimated that corporate earnings expectations for 2023 were about 20% too high among investors  which means the worst earnings recession since 2008 could hit the market this year. He predicted the S&P 500 would fall 24% in the early half of the year  in line with estimates from Bank of America and Deutsche Bank.The Fed is rapidly reducing the size of its balance sheet through quantitative tightening. Reuters2. Liquidity is being flushed out of the marketIn addition to rate hikes  the Fed is rapidly reducing the size of its balance sheet by around $95 billion a month  a form of monetary tightening that can help reduce asset inflation by taking liquidity out of the market. But that's a headwind ahead for many asset classes  including stocks  particularly growth and tech stocks that have been boosted by ultra liquid condition and traders desperately seeking higher returns amid the low rate environment.The central bank has already shaved off $381 billion from its balance sheet since last April  and stocks have plunged as erased most of the gains made during the pandemic period of interest rates near zero and ample cash sloshing around the market.The liquidity runoff is the ""elephant in the room "" Morgan Stanley said  predicting that continued tightening could cause the S&P 500 to drop another 15% by March. Bank of America has predicted a milder decline of 7%.The S&P 500 is overcrowded  according to Bank of America's chief stock strategist. REUTERS/Dario Cantatore/NYSE Euronext3. The S&P 500 is a crowded tradeToo many investors are huddled in the S&P 500 ‚Äì and that's going to make any bouts of volatility even worse as traders move to sell en masse when trouble hits  according to Bank of America's top stock strategist Savita Subramanian.""The problem is everyone is using muscle memory to go back into what they think of as the safest equity market  which is the S&P 500. Trouble is  if everybody is in the S&P 500  and they're all selling at the same time  the S&P isn't really that safe "" Subramanian said in a recent interview with Bloomberg.She urged investors to exit crowded areas of the market  like tech  and to bet on energy and small cap stocks.John Hussman  the market veteran who called the dot-com bust. YouTube / John Mauldin4. Stocks are still overvaluedStocks in the S&P 500 are still overvalued despite the steep sell-off of last year  according to market veteran John Hussman  who warned that the index could see negative returns over the next decade.Hussman  who called the burst the dot-com bubble in 2000  noted that his favorite valuation measure in the S&P 500 was at a similar level to where it was at the peak of the dot-com era. That indicator has the best track record out of any measure to predicting long-run returns for the stock index  Hussman warned  who thinks the S&P 500 still has more room to fall.""Notice how little impact the 2022 market decline to-date has had on valuations "" he said. ""Though recent market losses have removed the most extreme speculative froth  our most reliable valuation measures remain near their 1929 and 2000 extremes.""He warned that the S&P 500 could fall another 60% on a ""very long  interesting trip to nowhere "" which would bring the index close to 1 500. He estimated the S&P 500 would see an average return of -6% over the next 10-12 years.",negative,0.01,0.08,0.92,mixed,0.11,0.08,0.81,True,English,"['2nd straight year', 'sky-high valuations', 'S&P 500', 'earnings', '4 reasons', 'experts', 'losses', 'Some Wall Street observers', 'aggressive interest rate increases', 'market veteran John Hussman', 'app Email address', 'other partner offers', 'Wall Street analysts', 'ultra liquid condition', 'Dario Cantatore/NYSE Euronext', 'best track record', 'chief stock strategist', 'top stock strategist', 'low rate environment', 'four lingering headwinds', 'four big reasons', 'corporate earnings expectations', 'aggressive Fed policy', 'many asset classes', 'safest equity market', 'S&P 500 companies', 'benchmark stock index', 'favorite valuation measure', 'The S&P 500', 'Fed rate hikes', 'small cap stocks', 'Mike Wilson Bloomberg', 'worst earnings recession', 'recent market losses', 'The Fed', 'worst losses', 'interest rates', 'John Mauldin', 'favorite topics', 'Privacy Policy', 'weak earnings', 'recent interview', 'asset inflation', 'market headwinds', 'big hit', 'inside scoop', 'personalized feed', 'marketing emails', 'safe bet', 'Federal Reserve', 'new era', 'anemic returns', 'old playbooks', 'paradigm shift', 'Morgan Stanley', 'tightening efforts', 'full effects', 'early half', 'balance sheet', 'quantitative tightening', 'monetary tightening', 'higher returns', 'last April', 'pandemic period', 'continued tightening', 'milder decline', 'crowded trade', 'muscle memory', 'same time', 'crowded areas', 'steep sell-off', 'negative returns', 'next decade', 'com bubble', 'similar level', 'com era', 'long-run returns', 'extreme speculativ', 'rising inflation', '2022 market decline', 'dismal year', 'many investors', 'last year', 'heightened volatility', 'Central bankers', 'Savita Subramanian', 'little impact', 'Deutsche Bank', 'liquidity runoff', '2008 recession', 'showing', 'newsletter', 'traders', 'inbox', 'Something', 'go', 'Insider', 'Terms', 'Service', 'myriad', 'macro', 'fears', 'BlackRock', 'approaches', 'portfolios', 'bite', 'revenues', '425-basis-points', 'estimates', 'America', 'size', 'Reuters', 'addition', 'form', 'growth', 'gains', 'cash', 'elephant', 'room', 'March', 'bouts', 'masse', 'trouble', 'problem', 'everyone', 'everybody', 'energy', 'YouTube', 'burst', 'dot', 'peak', 'indicator', 'date', '2023']",2023-01-22,2023-01-23,markets.businessinsider.com

Gazprom PJSC and Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works PJSC have substituted some of their eurobonds for ruble debt.Worth $85.6 billion before the invasion of Ukraine  Russia‚Äôs international corporate bond market has shrunk by about $12.7 billion since President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine prompted the US  UK and European Union to block Russia‚Äôs access to foreign capital  Bloomberg calculations based on central bank data show. And it‚Äôs set to contract further this year after Gazprom makes more planned swaps.Even in cases where the borrower doesn‚Äôt fall under sanctions  companies and their investors have found that the restrictions target so many of the processes needed for the bonds to keep functioning  that it‚Äôs become necessary to take them out of the market.‚ÄúIn a couple of months everything is going to be bought out‚Äù by local investors  said Dmitry Dorofeev  a portfolio manager at Armbrok investment company in Yerevan  Armenia  which has traded some Russian eurobonds in recent months. ‚ÄúRussian companies will replace bonds and return to Russia.‚ÄùStory continuesWhile coupon and principal payments do go through  the process has become complicated and there are significant delays. Companies need to get paperwork sorted in Russia to repay foreign bondholders  and the financial plumbing used to get payments through hasn‚Äôt run smoothly since sanctions were imposed. And Euroclear Bank SA and Clearstream Banking SA  Europe‚Äôs two major central depositories  only process transactions that have been vetted and processed by paying agents  according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named discussing private information.Some firms have opted for other alternatives  including swaps  buybacks and direct payments to bondholders  although that last option is only for accounts in Russia. The hurdle  however  is that Euroclear and Clearstream have been unwilling to process corporate actions  such as buybacks  since sanctions were introduced  the people said. Spokespeople for the two depositories declined to comment on the matter.Read More: JPMorgan  BofA Among Banks to Resume Trading Russian BondsAnd so companies have been finding ways to exclude Euroclear and Clearstream  a process that could leave them exposed to ownership disputes  according to Alexander Geda  counsel at Moscow-based law firm Rybalkin  Gortsunyan  Dyakin and Partners  who advised Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works on its consent solicitation.Lukoil  for instance  announced its buyback offer in a press release without publicly disclosing the terms. Investors who expressed interest were contacted by brokers based in Cyprus  who would then buy their debt in over-the-counter transactions  according to several people with knowledge of the matter. Lukoil didn‚Äôt respond to phone calls and emailed questions.Spokespeople for the European Commission  the US Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control and the UK‚Äôs Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation declined to comment on whether buybacks of Russian corporate bonds in general ‚Äî and in Lukoil‚Äôs case in particular ‚Äî are in breach of their sanctions. The Russian oil giant is not subject to sanctions imposed by the US  the EU or the UK following Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. Still  central depositories haven‚Äôt been processing corporate actions by Russian companies.Read More: Aurelius  Silver Point Win Sweetener in Lukoil Bond Buyback DealGazprom PlansGazprom plans to convert all domestic holdings of its eurobonds into equivalent domestic replacement bonds settled in rubles  Chief Financial Officer Famil Sadygov said by phone. Holdings of 10 of the bonds have already been replaced and another 12 will be swapped by the end of March  he said. Four of those are due to be swapped this week.Replacement bonds are ‚Äúthe most reliable way‚Äù to service debt given the restrictions on financial infrastructure  Sadygov said. Eurobonds received in the exchange are canceled and the overall number in circulation is reduced accordingly  he said  adding that once the exchange is done  Gazprom pays coupons on both the substitute Russian bonds and the remaining international bonds.Meanwhile some companies are pivoting east  with United Co. Rusal International PJSC and others borrowing 52.7 billion yuan ($7.7 billion) of debt denominated in the Chinese offshore currency in recent months. But that debt still only makes up an ‚Äúinsignificant‚Äù 2.9% of the total Russian corporate debt market  according to a review of financial market risks published by the Bank of Russia on Jan. 19.The ruble‚Äôs 11% rally over the past 12 months on the back of capital restrictions and high energy prices has helped create attractive conditions for buybacks  according to Alexey Kuprianov  director at Russian investment bank Aspring Capital  who advised Moscow‚Äôs Domodedovo airport on its consent solicitation and social network VK on its restructuring. Those trends may change  he said.‚ÄúWe may see a deterioration of the currency and the Russian economy  so it‚Äôs likely companies have less capability to buy back bonds ‚Äù Kuprianov said.--With assistance from Tasos Vossos.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek¬©2023 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.01,0.88,0.12,negative,0.0,0.12,0.88,True,English,"['Biggest Firms', 'Wall Street', 'Russia', 'Debt', 'Sanctions', 'United Co.

Sales for the quarter were boosted by games released in the first half of the year (Vampire The Masquerade¬Æ - Swansong  Pro Cycling Manager 2022 and Tour De France 2022  SteelrisingTM and Session Skate SimTM) and by the release of WRC Generations on 3 November  which outperformed its predecessor  WCR10  in the first two months following release.The Back catalogue (games released during previous financial years) once again achieved an excellent performance.

Mobile accessories were up 8.5% at 75.2 M‚Ç¨  boosted by the success of the Force¬Æ premium ranges. The Audio-Video business recorded an 11.1% increase to 24.0 M‚Ç¨ partly due to the inclusion of Metronic in the consolidation scope.Expected trends for the 4th quarter and 2022/23 targetsNACON GAMINGNew publishing releases for the 4th quarter will be sustained  with the launch of four games:- Chef Life and the highly anticipated Blood Bowl¬Æ3 will be released on 23 February 2023.- Clash and Transport Fever 2 Console Edition are scheduled for release on 9 March 2023.As for Accessories  the end of console shortages should lead to an improvement in sales over the next few months.BIGBEN AUDIOVIDEO/TELCOTo support the positive momentum of the chargers and cables market  the Telco business launched at the end of December 2022 the first universal high-performance Force¬Æ Power charger manufactured in France and equipped with GaN and Power Delivery technologies. This industrial relocation completes the efforts already undertaken in the carbon reduction plan.The Telco business is continuing to premiumise its offering with the launch last September of the Force¬Æ Play range ; its wireless headphones have just been awarded the ""Product of the Year 2023"" label by consumers.Finally  Metronic's listing of Audio products in DIY stores in the third quarter of 2022-2023 opens up new commercial prospects.On the strength of sustained new releases in publishing / newsflow at the end of the financial year for NACON and a sustained dynamic in the Mobile Accessories activity thanks to the extension of the Force¬Æ ranges  the BIGBEN Group is confident in its ability to generate  for the whole FY 2022-2023  sales and current operating income that are up on the previous financial year.Strong growth ambition for FY 2023-2024In FY 2023-2024  NACON will have a wide range of new releases with about twenty games to be launched during the year  including:- The Lord of the Rings GollumTM  which will be released in the first half of FY 2023-24 - RoboCop: Rogue City - Gangs of Sherwood - TestDrive Unlimited Solar Crown.At the same time  the games released in FY 2022-23 will feed the back catalogue and will mechanically accelerate growth.The Gaming Accessories market should rebound thanks to a growing installed base of new generation consoles and a more favourable base effect.Bigben Audio-Video/Telco's business will benefit from favourable market trends for its development with the new ranges of smartphones sold without chargers and pedestrian kits.

On a constant scope basis  growth is +5%.COVID activity now represents only 39% of consolidated revenue (compared to 56% in 2021)  in a market driven by a sharp drop in sales prices and test volumes.The share of proprietary products in the core business increased to 18% of sales  compared to 14% the previous year.in ‚Ç¨m 2022 2021 change Core (excl. COVID) 93.4 81.5 +15% COVID 59.1 102.6 -42% Total 152.5 184.1 -17% unauditedA business portfolio with higher added valueThe strong growth of the core business  at +15%  reflects both the dynamism of historical activities  the development of new activities and the reallocation of the distribution portfolio.New activities are driven on the one hand by the strengthening of R&D and partnerships  but above all by the acquisitions made in 2022. In this respect  BMD  acquired in June 2022  makes it possible to extend the distribution of diagnostic products to the Benelux zone. GenDx  acquired on October 1  2022  brings a range of 100% proprietary products among the most efficient in the field of HLA2 diagnostics  as well as next-generation genomic sequencing technologies bringing numerous synergies.Excluding the contribution of BMD and GenDx  the core business grew by 5% including the strategic reallocation of the distribution portfolio which resulted in the termination of certain low-margin distribution contracts  which represented several million euros of turnover in 2021.This strategic reallocation of the distribution portfolio is for the benefit of new partnerships aimed at making innovative products with a strong impact available in France for healthcare professionals and patients. The Group has thus taken over the exclusive distribution in France of the HIV self-test from the US company Orasure  signed partnerships with Alcor  Technoclone and SD Biosensor laboratories for distribution in the field of ""Point of Care"" proximity tests  and in the field of connected biology based on artificial intelligence.COVID sales supported by an extension of the product portfolioAs expected  the COVID activity proved resilient in a market whose decline accelerated in the second half of the year. Corresponding revenue shows an annual decline of 42% driven by a sharp reduction in prices and volumes. At ‚Ç¨59.1 million  the COVID activity represents 39% of revenue in 2022.Thanks to a highly responsive innovation strategy and go-to-market capabilities  sales of new proprietary COVID tests continued. Eurobio Scientific has introduced more than 10 proprietary tests since 2021 as the different variants of the virus have spread. The expertise of the R&D teams  the mastery of regulatory affairs demonstrated by the company's ISO 13485 recertification under the new IVDR3 framework  and a high-capacity production tool  all enable the Group to support laboratories in almost real time.Eurobio Scientific has remained one of the main French players in the diagnosis of COVID  and benefits  thanks to its privileged relations with its partners  from a vast park of installed instruments  capable of processing a multitude of tests. At the start of the year  a part of this business segment relies on the proprietary EBX 042 FluCoSyn‚Ñ¢ test (COVID/influenza/RSV triplex)  which Eurobio Scientific introduced in September 2020. The COVID segment is therefore becoming a core business routine activity.Group internationalizationInternational now represents more than 25% of the turnover generated by the core business  while it still only partially includes the sales of BMD and GenDx  acquired in 2022.Net debt of less than ‚Ç¨30m after acquisition of GenDxAt the end of 2022  Eurobio Scientific's cash position was over ‚Ç¨85 million  for a net financial debt of less than ‚Ç¨30 million.After completing the structuring acquisition of GenDx  Eurobio Scientific retains a financial structure allowing continued investments and the ability to seize possible acquisition opportunities.Next financial meetings2022 results: April 5  2023  before market opensAnnual shareholders‚Äô meeting : June 12  2023 at 9amHalf-year 2023 sales : July 24  2023  after market closesHalf-year results : October 11  2023  after market closesAbout Eurobio ScientificEurobio Scientific is a key player in the field of specialty in vitro diagnostics.

16937,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4571619-vinci-stock-good-execution-growing-dividends,Vinci Stock: Good Execution And Growing Dividends (OTCMKTS:VCISF),Vinci SA possesses a major concessions business including highways and airports. Read more to see my recommendation on Vinci stock.,mtcurado/iStock Unreleased via Getty ImagesVinci's (DG:PA  OTCPK:VCISF  OTCPK:VCISY  ) highway concessions made a relatively quick recovery from Covid  as soon as 2021. The recovery in air traffic has been slower  but it is now almost complete  adding another engine to the company's growth. Meanwhile  the engineering division boasts a record order book.The company  therefore  is in great shape  and this has been recognized by the market with the Euronext-listed stock reaching the ‚Ç¨100 mark again. This obviously makes Vinci less attractive for investors looking for quick capital appreciation. A 10% or so pullback would be needed for a better entry point - this is always a possibility  depending on macro developments in Europe.In any case  Vinci is a sleep-well-at-night stock with predictable returns  which offers growing dividends. Its prospects are solid  and I have no doubt that by continuing its savvy investments in new concessions  it will be able to offset the expiry - a legitimate but overblown concern in my opinion.Vinci Airports' Recovery Well UnderwayAll of Vinci's divisions performed well in 2022. The engineering division continued to deliver  and the acquisition of Spanish conglomerate ACS' energy business seems to have gone smoothly. Meanwhile  highway concessions (toll roads) are back to pre-Covid traffic figures. What about airport concessions  the hardest hit segment during the Covid crisis?Things are looking up for Vinci airports  with the recently-released passenger traffic statistics for FY 2022 confirming the gradual recovery.Vinci's press releaseSome airports are seen to have fully regained their 2019 (pre-Covid) traffic as of December 2022  while others are still lagging. Such is the case of some Asian assets like Japan and Cambodia  but this too should improve in the near future: Japan's traffic has picked up gradually since the country's late reopening to visitors in Q4 2022  while Cambodia can expect a return of Chinese tourists in the coming months.One can also notice the presence of the newest holding in Vinci's portfolio  Mexico's Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte (OMAB)  following the acquisition of a significant 30% stake  that I discussed in an earlier article. The Mexican operator continues to display strong momentum  which Vinci commented as follows in their press release:Traffic at the OMA airports in Mexico remained far above pre-crisis levels  growing rapidly during the festive season. Traffic to and from the US was particularly dynamic  powered by the capacity of airlines such as American Airlines  Spirit and Frontier.Vinci's Valuation And DividendsWith Vinci the company in rude health  the question for investors is whether Vinci the stock still has room for upside. In my opinion  investors should have reasonable expectations going forward  with the recovery largely priced in. The 2022 earnings will be released in early February  but analysts project earnings in the region of ‚Ç¨7.30 per share. At the current share price of ‚Ç¨103 for the Paris-listed stock  this equates to a P/E ratio of 14.Boursorama.comThere will be growth in coming years  and the 2023 consensus estimate above seems conservative. In a recent note  UBS' analysts suggested at least 10% EPS growth for this year  and raised their target price to ‚Ç¨122. However  this is not what I would call a big upside potential for the stock. I consider Vinci fairly valued  which doesn't mean that it will not keep rewarding investors. I just think that the annual returns will be more or less in line with Vinci's cost of capital  in a 8% to 10% range.What about the dividends? As shown in the yield row of the table above  dividends in the region of 4% can be expected  in tandem with EPS growth. This is consistent with the policy that has been in place in recent years:VINCI‚Äôs Board of Directors determines dividend policy based on the Group‚Äôs performance  financial position and any other factor deemed relevant. The dividend payout ratio has averaged 50% of the Group‚Äôs consolidated net income for the past 10 years. Source: company's websiteHow Serious Is Vinci's Concession Risk?Even with mature  well-managed blue-chip companies like Vinci  there are always some risks to consider. One risk which I've seen mentioned here and there relates to the remaining life of some of Vinci's key concessions. This is a fear that is overblown in my opinion. This risk concerns more specifically the French component of the highway division. Vinci currently manages about 35% of the network in France  and it has undoubtedly been a huge cash cow for the company. All good things must come to an end  and most of these concessions will expire between 2032 and 2036:Vinci's H1 2022 results presentationThe highly profitable nature of the concessions is confirmed by their huge cash flow generation: about ‚Ç¨2.6 billion of FCF in 2021  and  in fact  closer to ‚Ç¨3.3 billion when one excludes the growth CapEx:Vinci's 2021 Annual ReportThere are two ways to look at it:For sure  the expiry of these concessions in the 2030s will deprive Vinci of a tremendous asset.However  between now and the expiry  the company will pile up the cash at a rate of more than ‚Ç¨3 billion per year (and growing)  possibly more than ‚Ç¨50 billion in total.This cash should be enough to keep paying comfortable dividends while also preparing the future with new concessions. The company has been doing exactly that with new highway deals (see below) and  of course  the airport division.Vinci's H1 2022 results presentationIn a worst-case scenario  I have to mention one specific risk  which would be the forced renegotiation of the concession terms awarded by the French state to Vinci  Bouygues (OTCPK:BOUYF  OTCPK:BOUYY) and Eiffage (OTCPK:EFGSF  OTCPK:EFGSY) in the mid-2000s. The terms have turned out to be very favorable for the private companies (as shown by the FCF we discussed). Toll roads are rarely popular  and  with every election  there are calls by some candidates to renegotiate or even cancel the concessions altogether.However  this would constitute a blatant breach of contractual terms  which would have far-reaching implications for France as a stable jurisdiction. The current Macron government has always resisted such a move  so any reckless decision would not happen before the next presidential election in 2026 at the earliest - and again  this is highly unlikely.TakeawayVinci's strong performance and solid prospects look baked in the stock price  and investors looking for significant capital appreciation may want to look at other infrastructure plays such as Corporaci√≥n Am√©rica Airports (CAAP)  which also boasts a promising airport portfolio.However  even at the current share price  Vinci should provide decent returns  and a growing dividend that makes it a blue chip worth keeping in one's income portfolio.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

In 2022 the Group signed 15 new projects under six hotel brands adding more than 2100 rooms to its existing portfolio of 24 hotels in these regions. Accor will open nine properties in this area in 2023  five of which were signed in 2022.New Accor hotels will open in the well-known capitals ‚Äì Baku  Azerbaijan; Tashkent  Uzbekistan; and Tbilisi  Georgia. The Group‚Äôs brands will also debut in picturesque resorts such as Kobuleti in Georgia  Charvak Lake in Uzbekistan  Tsaghkadzor in Armenia. The growth in the region is dominated by Accor‚Äôs globally renowned ‚Äòglocal‚Äô midscale brand Mercure  with six signings across the region in 2022. Mercure combines the strength of an international network of nearly 1000 hotels  with genuine and local hospitality experiences. A third of signings in 2022 was for the Group‚Äôs leading premium brands M√∂venpick and Swiss√¥tel  bringing a further five properties to the region in the coming years.

Sales for the quarter were boosted by games released in the first half of the year (Vampire The Masquerade¬Æ - Swansong  Pro Cycling Manager 2022 and Tour De France 2022  SteelrisingTM and Session Skate SimTM) and by the release of WRC Generations on 3 November  which outperformed its predecessor  WCR10  in the first two months following release.The Back catalogue (games released during previous financial years) once again achieved an excellent performance. Its sales were up 59.5% over the quarter to 8.8 M‚Ç¨.ACCESSORIES : Sales of accessories came to 20.4 M‚Ç¨  down 41.5% over the quarter. Since the beginning of the year  the shortage of new generation consoles has caused a sharp decline in the global accessories market  leading retailers to be very cautious in their sourcing policy.BIGBEN ‚Äì Audiovideo/Telco posted 38.4 M‚Ç¨ sales in Q3 2022-23 down 4.1%.MOBILE ACCESSOR I ES : This business showed good resistance. Q3 sales amounted to 28.3 M‚Ç¨  compared with 29.0 M‚Ç¨ in Q3 2021-2022.AUDIO - VIDEO: This business was resilient over the period thanks in particular to the good performance of the Bigben Kids and Bigben Party sound and lighting ranges.

Mobile accessories were up 8.5% at 75.2 M‚Ç¨  boosted by the success of the Force¬Æ premium ranges. The Audio-Video business recorded an 11.1% increase to 24.0 M‚Ç¨ partly due to the inclusion of Metronic in the consolidation scope.Expected trends for the 4th quarter and 2022/23 targetsNACON GAMINGNew publishing releases for the 4th quarter will be sustained  with the launch of four games:- Chef Life and the highly anticipated Blood Bowl¬Æ3 will be released on 23 February 2023.- Clash and Transport Fever 2 Console Edition are scheduled for release on 9 March 2023.As for Accessories  the end of console shortages should lead to an improvement in sales over the next few months.BIGBEN AUDIOVIDEO/TELCOTo support the positive momentum of the chargers and cables market  the Telco business launched at the end of December 2022 the first universal high-performance Force¬Æ Power charger manufactured in France and equipped with GaN and Power Delivery technologies. This industrial relocation completes the efforts already undertaken in the carbon reduction plan.The Telco business is continuing to premiumise its offering with the launch last September of the Force¬Æ Play range ; its wireless headphones have just been awarded the ""Product of the Year 2023"" label by consumers.Finally  Metronic's listing of Audio products in DIY stores in the third quarter of 2022-2023 opens up new commercial prospects.On the strength of sustained new releases in publishing / newsflow at the end of the financial year for NACON and a sustained dynamic in the Mobile Accessories activity thanks to the extension of the Force¬Æ ranges  the BIGBEN Group is confident in its ability to generate  for the whole FY 2022-2023  sales and current operating income that are up on the previous financial year.Strong growth ambition for FY 2023-2024In FY 2023-2024  NACON will have a wide range of new releases with about twenty games to be launched during the year  including:- The Lord of the Rings GollumTM  which will be released in the first half of FY 2023-24 - RoboCop: Rogue City - Gangs of Sherwood - TestDrive Unlimited Solar Crown.At the same time  the games released in FY 2022-23 will feed the back catalogue and will mechanically accelerate growth.The Gaming Accessories market should rebound thanks to a growing installed base of new generation consoles and a more favourable base effect.Bigben Audio-Video/Telco's business will benefit from favourable market trends for its development with the new ranges of smartphones sold without chargers and pedestrian kits. At the same time  a diversification of sales channels will be actively pursued in order to penetrate the refurbished smartphone marketGiven the sustained growth expected for NACON Gaming and a BIGBEN Audio-Video/Telco business that should remain buoyant in FY 2023-2024  the Group anticipates strong growth as of next year and reaffirms its confidence in its medium-term prospects.Next event:Q4 2022-2023 sales  24 April 2023 Press release after close of the Euronext Paris stock exchangeSALES 2021-22275.7 M‚Ç¨HEADCOUNTOver 1200 employeesINTERNATIONAL31 subsidiaries and a distribution networkin more than 100 countrieswww.bigben-group.comBigben Interactive is a European player in video game development and publishing  in design and distribution of smartphone and gaming accessories as well as in audio products.

On a constant scope basis  growth is +5%.COVID activity now represents only 39% of consolidated revenue (compared to 56% in 2021)  in a market driven by a sharp drop in sales prices and test volumes.The share of proprietary products in the core business increased to 18% of sales  compared to 14% the previous year.in ‚Ç¨m 2022 2021 change Core (excl. COVID) 93.4 81.5 +15% COVID 59.1 102.6 -42% Total 152.5 184.1 -17% unauditedA business portfolio with higher added valueThe strong growth of the core business  at +15%  reflects both the dynamism of historical activities  the development of new activities and the reallocation of the distribution portfolio.New activities are driven on the one hand by the strengthening of R&D and partnerships  but above all by the acquisitions made in 2022. In this respect  BMD  acquired in June 2022  makes it possible to extend the distribution of diagnostic products to the Benelux zone. GenDx  acquired on October 1  2022  brings a range of 100% proprietary products among the most efficient in the field of HLA2 diagnostics  as well as next-generation genomic sequencing technologies bringing numerous synergies.Excluding the contribution of BMD and GenDx  the core business grew by 5% including the strategic reallocation of the distribution portfolio which resulted in the termination of certain low-margin distribution contracts  which represented several million euros of turnover in 2021.This strategic reallocation of the distribution portfolio is for the benefit of new partnerships aimed at making innovative products with a strong impact available in France for healthcare professionals and patients. The Group has thus taken over the exclusive distribution in France of the HIV self-test from the US company Orasure  signed partnerships with Alcor  Technoclone and SD Biosensor laboratories for distribution in the field of ""Point of Care"" proximity tests  and in the field of connected biology based on artificial intelligence.COVID sales supported by an extension of the product portfolioAs expected  the COVID activity proved resilient in a market whose decline accelerated in the second half of the year. Corresponding revenue shows an annual decline of 42% driven by a sharp reduction in prices and volumes. At ‚Ç¨59.1 million  the COVID activity represents 39% of revenue in 2022.Thanks to a highly responsive innovation strategy and go-to-market capabilities  sales of new proprietary COVID tests continued. Eurobio Scientific has introduced more than 10 proprietary tests since 2021 as the different variants of the virus have spread. The expertise of the R&D teams  the mastery of regulatory affairs demonstrated by the company's ISO 13485 recertification under the new IVDR3 framework  and a high-capacity production tool  all enable the Group to support laboratories in almost real time.Eurobio Scientific has remained one of the main French players in the diagnosis of COVID  and benefits  thanks to its privileged relations with its partners  from a vast park of installed instruments  capable of processing a multitude of tests. At the start of the year  a part of this business segment relies on the proprietary EBX 042 FluCoSyn‚Ñ¢ test (COVID/influenza/RSV triplex)  which Eurobio Scientific introduced in September 2020. The COVID segment is therefore becoming a core business routine activity.Group internationalizationInternational now represents more than 25% of the turnover generated by the core business  while it still only partially includes the sales of BMD and GenDx  acquired in 2022.Net debt of less than ‚Ç¨30m after acquisition of GenDxAt the end of 2022  Eurobio Scientific's cash position was over ‚Ç¨85 million  for a net financial debt of less than ‚Ç¨30 million.After completing the structuring acquisition of GenDx  Eurobio Scientific retains a financial structure allowing continued investments and the ability to seize possible acquisition opportunities.Next financial meetings2022 results: April 5  2023  before market opensAnnual shareholders‚Äô meeting : June 12  2023 at 9amHalf-year 2023 sales : July 24  2023  after market closesHalf-year results : October 11  2023  after market closesAbout Eurobio ScientificEurobio Scientific is a key player in the field of specialty in vitro diagnostics.

Sales for the quarter were boosted by games released in the first half of the year (Vampire The Masquerade¬Æ - Swansong  Pro Cycling Manager 2022 and Tour De France 2022  SteelrisingTM and Session Skate SimTM) and by the release of WRC Generations on 3 November  which outperformed its predecessor  WCR10  in the first two months following release.The Back catalogue (games released during previous financial years) once again achieved an excellent performance. Its sales were up 59.5% over the quarter to 8.8 M‚Ç¨.ACCESSORIES : Sales of accessories came to 20.4 M‚Ç¨  down 41.5% over the quarter.

Q3 sales amounted to 28.3 M‚Ç¨  compared with 29.0 M‚Ç¨ in Q3 2021-2022.AUDIO - VIDEO: This business was resilient over the period thanks in particular to the good performance of the Bigben Kids and Bigben Party sound and lighting ranges.

Mobile accessories were up 8.5% at 75.2 M‚Ç¨  boosted by the success of the Force¬Æ premium ranges. The Audio-Video business recorded an 11.1% increase to 24.0 M‚Ç¨ partly due to the inclusion of Metronic in the consolidation scope.Expected trends for the 4th quarter and 2022/23 targetsNACON GAMINGNew publishing releases for the 4th quarter will be sustained  with the launch of four games:- Chef Life and the highly anticipated Blood Bowl¬Æ3 will be released on 23 February 2023.- Clash and Transport Fever 2 Console Edition are scheduled for release on 9 March 2023.As for Accessories  the end of console shortages should lead to an improvement in sales over the next few months.BIGBEN AUDIOVIDEO/TELCOTo support the positive momentum of the chargers and cables market  the Telco business launched at the end of December 2022 the first universal high-performance Force¬Æ Power charger manufactured in France and equipped with GaN and Power Delivery technologies. This industrial relocation completes the efforts already undertaken in the carbon reduction plan.The Telco business is continuing to premiumise its offering with the launch last September of the Force¬Æ Play range ; its wireless headphones have just been awarded the ""Product of the Year 2023"" label by consumers.Finally  Metronic's listing of Audio products in DIY stores in the third quarter of 2022-2023 opens up new commercial prospects.On the strength of sustained new releases in publishing / newsflow at the end of the financial year for NACON and a sustained dynamic in the Mobile Accessories activity thanks to the extension of the Force¬Æ ranges  the BIGBEN Group is confident in its ability to generate  for the whole FY 2022-2023  sales and current operating income that are up on the previous financial year.Strong growth ambition for FY 2023-2024In FY 2023-2024  NACON will have a wide range of new releases with about twenty games to be launched during the year  including:- The Lord of the Rings GollumTM  which will be released in the first half of FY 2023-24 - RoboCop: Rogue City - Gangs of Sherwood - TestDrive Unlimited Solar Crown.At the same time  the games released in FY 2022-23 will feed the back catalogue and will mechanically accelerate growth.The Gaming Accessories market should rebound thanks to a growing installed base of new generation consoles and a more favourable base effect.Bigben Audio-Video/Telco's business will benefit from favourable market trends for its development with the new ranges of smartphones sold without chargers and pedestrian kits. At the same time  a diversification of sales channels will be actively pursued in order to penetrate the refurbished smartphone marketGiven the sustained growth expected for NACON Gaming and a BIGBEN Audio-Video/Telco business that should remain buoyant in FY 2023-2024  the Group anticipates strong growth as of next year and reaffirms its confidence in its medium-term prospects.Next event:Q4 2022-2023 sales  24 April 2023 Press release after close of the Euronext Paris stock exchangeSALES 2021-22275.7 M‚Ç¨HEADCOUNTOver 1200 employeesINTERNATIONAL31 subsidiaries and a distribution networkin more than 100 countrieswww.bigben-group.comBigben Interactive is a European player in video game development and publishing  in design and distribution of smartphone and gaming accessories as well as in audio products.

On a constant scope basis  growth is +5%.COVID activity now represents only 39% of consolidated revenue (compared to 56% in 2021)  in a market driven by a sharp drop in sales prices and test volumes.The share of proprietary products in the core business increased to 18% of sales  compared to 14% the previous year.in ‚Ç¨m 2022 2021 change Core (excl. COVID) 93.4 81.5 +15% COVID 59.1 102.6 -42% Total 152.5 184.1 -17% unauditedA business portfolio with higher added valueThe strong growth of the core business  at +15%  reflects both the dynamism of historical activities  the development of new activities and the reallocation of the distribution portfolio.New activities are driven on the one hand by the strengthening of R&D and partnerships  but above all by the acquisitions made in 2022. In this respect  BMD  acquired in June 2022  makes it possible to extend the distribution of diagnostic products to the Benelux zone. GenDx  acquired on October 1  2022  brings a range of 100% proprietary products among the most efficient in the field of HLA2 diagnostics  as well as next-generation genomic sequencing technologies bringing numerous synergies.Excluding the contribution of BMD and GenDx  the core business grew by 5% including the strategic reallocation of the distribution portfolio which resulted in the termination of certain low-margin distribution contracts  which represented several million euros of turnover in 2021.This strategic reallocation of the distribution portfolio is for the benefit of new partnerships aimed at making innovative products with a strong impact available in France for healthcare professionals and patients. The Group has thus taken over the exclusive distribution in France of the HIV self-test from the US company Orasure  signed partnerships with Alcor  Technoclone and SD Biosensor laboratories for distribution in the field of ""Point of Care"" proximity tests  and in the field of connected biology based on artificial intelligence.Story continuesCOVID sales supported by an extension of the product portfolioAs expected  the COVID activity proved resilient in a market whose decline accelerated in the second half of the year. Corresponding revenue shows an annual decline of 42% driven by a sharp reduction in prices and volumes. At ‚Ç¨59.1 million  the COVID activity represents 39% of revenue in 2022.Thanks to a highly responsive innovation strategy and go-to-market capabilities  sales of new proprietary COVID tests continued. Eurobio Scientific has introduced more than 10 proprietary tests since 2021 as the different variants of the virus have spread. The expertise of the R&D teams  the mastery of regulatory affairs demonstrated by the company's ISO 13485 recertification under the new IVDR3 framework  and a high-capacity production tool  all enable the Group to support laboratories in almost real time.Eurobio Scientific has remained one of the main French players in the diagnosis of COVID  and benefits  thanks to its privileged relations with its partners  from a vast park of installed instruments  capable of processing a multitude of tests. At the start of the year  a part of this business segment relies on the proprietary EBX 042 FluCoSyn‚Ñ¢ test (COVID/influenza/RSV triplex)  which Eurobio Scientific introduced in September 2020. The COVID segment is therefore becoming a core business routine activity.Group internationalizationInternational now represents more than 25% of the turnover generated by the core business  while it still only partially includes the sales of BMD and GenDx  acquired in 2022.Net debt of less than ‚Ç¨30m after acquisition of GenDxAt the end of 2022  Eurobio Scientific's cash position was over ‚Ç¨85 million  for a net financial debt of less than ‚Ç¨30 million.After completing the structuring acquisition of GenDx  Eurobio Scientific retains a financial structure allowing continued investments and the ability to seize possible acquisition opportunities.Next financial meetings2022 results: April 5  2023  before market opensAnnual shareholders‚Äô meeting : June 12  2023 at 9amHalf-year 2023 sales : July 24  2023  after market closesHalf-year results : October 11  2023  after market closesAbout Eurobio ScientificEurobio Scientific is a key player in the field of specialty in vitro diagnostics.
