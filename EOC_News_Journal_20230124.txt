Mobile accessories were up 8.5% at 75.2 M‚Ç¨  boosted by the success of the Force¬Æ premium ranges. The Audio-Video business recorded an 11.1% increase to 24.0 M‚Ç¨ partly due to the inclusion of Metronic in the consolidation scope.Expected trends for the 4th quarter and 2022/23 targetsNACON GAMINGNew publishing releases for the 4th quarter will be sustained  with the launch of four games:- Chef Life and the highly anticipated Blood Bowl¬Æ3 will be released on 23 February 2023.- Clash and Transport Fever 2 Console Edition are scheduled for release on 9 March 2023.As for Accessories  the end of console shortages should lead to an improvement in sales over the next few months.BIGBEN AUDIOVIDEO/TELCOTo support the positive momentum of the chargers and cables market  the Telco business launched at the end of December 2022 the first universal high-performance Force¬Æ Power charger manufactured in France and equipped with GaN and Power Delivery technologies. This industrial relocation completes the efforts already undertaken in the carbon reduction plan.The Telco business is continuing to premiumise its offering with the launch last September of the Force¬Æ Play range ; its wireless headphones have just been awarded the ""Product of the Year 2023"" label by consumers.Finally  Metronic's listing of Audio products in DIY stores in the third quarter of 2022-2023 opens up new commercial prospects.On the strength of sustained new releases in publishing / newsflow at the end of the financial year for NACON and a sustained dynamic in the Mobile Accessories activity thanks to the extension of the Force¬Æ ranges  the BIGBEN Group is confident in its ability to generate  for the whole FY 2022-2023  sales and current operating income that are up on the previous financial year.Strong growth ambition for FY 2023-2024In FY 2023-2024  NACON will have a wide range of new releases with about twenty games to be launched during the year  including:- The Lord of the Rings GollumTM  which will be released in the first half of FY 2023-24 - RoboCop: Rogue City - Gangs of Sherwood - TestDrive Unlimited Solar Crown.At the same time  the games released in FY 2022-23 will feed the back catalogue and will mechanically accelerate growth.The Gaming Accessories market should rebound thanks to a growing installed base of new generation consoles and a more favourable base effect.Bigben Audio-Video/Telco's business will benefit from favourable market trends for its development with the new ranges of smartphones sold without chargers and pedestrian kits.

On a constant scope basis  growth is +5%.COVID activity now represents only 39% of consolidated revenue (compared to 56% in 2021)  in a market driven by a sharp drop in sales prices and test volumes.The share of proprietary products in the core business increased to 18% of sales  compared to 14% the previous year.in ‚Ç¨m 2022 2021 change Core (excl. COVID) 93.4 81.5 +15% COVID 59.1 102.6 -42% Total 152.5 184.1 -17% unauditedA business portfolio with higher added valueThe strong growth of the core business  at +15%  reflects both the dynamism of historical activities  the development of new activities and the reallocation of the distribution portfolio.New activities are driven on the one hand by the strengthening of R&D and partnerships  but above all by the acquisitions made in 2022. In this respect  BMD  acquired in June 2022  makes it possible to extend the distribution of diagnostic products to the Benelux zone. GenDx  acquired on October 1  2022  brings a range of 100% proprietary products among the most efficient in the field of HLA2 diagnostics  as well as next-generation genomic sequencing technologies bringing numerous synergies.Excluding the contribution of BMD and GenDx  the core business grew by 5% including the strategic reallocation of the distribution portfolio which resulted in the termination of certain low-margin distribution contracts  which represented several million euros of turnover in 2021.This strategic reallocation of the distribution portfolio is for the benefit of new partnerships aimed at making innovative products with a strong impact available in France for healthcare professionals and patients. The Group has thus taken over the exclusive distribution in France of the HIV self-test from the US company Orasure  signed partnerships with Alcor  Technoclone and SD Biosensor laboratories for distribution in the field of ""Point of Care"" proximity tests  and in the field of connected biology based on artificial intelligence.COVID sales supported by an extension of the product portfolioAs expected  the COVID activity proved resilient in a market whose decline accelerated in the second half of the year. Corresponding revenue shows an annual decline of 42% driven by a sharp reduction in prices and volumes. At ‚Ç¨59.1 million  the COVID activity represents 39% of revenue in 2022.Thanks to a highly responsive innovation strategy and go-to-market capabilities  sales of new proprietary COVID tests continued. Eurobio Scientific has introduced more than 10 proprietary tests since 2021 as the different variants of the virus have spread. The expertise of the R&D teams  the mastery of regulatory affairs demonstrated by the company's ISO 13485 recertification under the new IVDR3 framework  and a high-capacity production tool  all enable the Group to support laboratories in almost real time.Eurobio Scientific has remained one of the main French players in the diagnosis of COVID  and benefits  thanks to its privileged relations with its partners  from a vast park of installed instruments  capable of processing a multitude of tests. At the start of the year  a part of this business segment relies on the proprietary EBX 042 FluCoSyn‚Ñ¢ test (COVID/influenza/RSV triplex)  which Eurobio Scientific introduced in September 2020. The COVID segment is therefore becoming a core business routine activity.Group internationalizationInternational now represents more than 25% of the turnover generated by the core business  while it still only partially includes the sales of BMD and GenDx  acquired in 2022.Net debt of less than ‚Ç¨30m after acquisition of GenDxAt the end of 2022  Eurobio Scientific's cash position was over ‚Ç¨85 million  for a net financial debt of less than ‚Ç¨30 million.After completing the structuring acquisition of GenDx  Eurobio Scientific retains a financial structure allowing continued investments and the ability to seize possible acquisition opportunities.Next financial meetings2022 results: April 5  2023  before market opensAnnual shareholders‚Äô meeting : June 12  2023 at 9amHalf-year 2023 sales : July 24  2023  after market closesHalf-year results : October 11  2023  after market closesAbout Eurobio ScientificEurobio Scientific is a key player in the field of specialty in vitro diagnostics.

16937,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4571619-vinci-stock-good-execution-growing-dividends,Vinci Stock: Good Execution And Growing Dividends (OTCMKTS:VCISF),Vinci SA possesses a major concessions business including highways and airports. Read more to see my recommendation on Vinci stock.,mtcurado/iStock Unreleased via Getty ImagesVinci's (DG:PA  OTCPK:VCISF  OTCPK:VCISY  ) highway concessions made a relatively quick recovery from Covid  as soon as 2021. The recovery in air traffic has been slower  but it is now almost complete  adding another engine to the company's growth. Meanwhile  the engineering division boasts a record order book.The company  therefore  is in great shape  and this has been recognized by the market with the Euronext-listed stock reaching the ‚Ç¨100 mark again. This obviously makes Vinci less attractive for investors looking for quick capital appreciation. A 10% or so pullback would be needed for a better entry point - this is always a possibility  depending on macro developments in Europe.In any case  Vinci is a sleep-well-at-night stock with predictable returns  which offers growing dividends. Its prospects are solid  and I have no doubt that by continuing its savvy investments in new concessions  it will be able to offset the expiry - a legitimate but overblown concern in my opinion.Vinci Airports' Recovery Well UnderwayAll of Vinci's divisions performed well in 2022. The engineering division continued to deliver  and the acquisition of Spanish conglomerate ACS' energy business seems to have gone smoothly. Meanwhile  highway concessions (toll roads) are back to pre-Covid traffic figures. What about airport concessions  the hardest hit segment during the Covid crisis?Things are looking up for Vinci airports  with the recently-released passenger traffic statistics for FY 2022 confirming the gradual recovery.Vinci's press releaseSome airports are seen to have fully regained their 2019 (pre-Covid) traffic as of December 2022  while others are still lagging. Such is the case of some Asian assets like Japan and Cambodia  but this too should improve in the near future: Japan's traffic has picked up gradually since the country's late reopening to visitors in Q4 2022  while Cambodia can expect a return of Chinese tourists in the coming months.One can also notice the presence of the newest holding in Vinci's portfolio  Mexico's Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte (OMAB)  following the acquisition of a significant 30% stake  that I discussed in an earlier article. The Mexican operator continues to display strong momentum  which Vinci commented as follows in their press release:Traffic at the OMA airports in Mexico remained far above pre-crisis levels  growing rapidly during the festive season. Traffic to and from the US was particularly dynamic  powered by the capacity of airlines such as American Airlines  Spirit and Frontier.Vinci's Valuation And DividendsWith Vinci the company in rude health  the question for investors is whether Vinci the stock still has room for upside. In my opinion  investors should have reasonable expectations going forward  with the recovery largely priced in. The 2022 earnings will be released in early February  but analysts project earnings in the region of ‚Ç¨7.30 per share. At the current share price of ‚Ç¨103 for the Paris-listed stock  this equates to a P/E ratio of 14.Boursorama.comThere will be growth in coming years  and the 2023 consensus estimate above seems conservative. In a recent note  UBS' analysts suggested at least 10% EPS growth for this year  and raised their target price to ‚Ç¨122. However  this is not what I would call a big upside potential for the stock. I consider Vinci fairly valued  which doesn't mean that it will not keep rewarding investors. I just think that the annual returns will be more or less in line with Vinci's cost of capital  in a 8% to 10% range.What about the dividends? As shown in the yield row of the table above  dividends in the region of 4% can be expected  in tandem with EPS growth. This is consistent with the policy that has been in place in recent years:VINCI‚Äôs Board of Directors determines dividend policy based on the Group‚Äôs performance  financial position and any other factor deemed relevant. The dividend payout ratio has averaged 50% of the Group‚Äôs consolidated net income for the past 10 years. Source: company's websiteHow Serious Is Vinci's Concession Risk?Even with mature  well-managed blue-chip companies like Vinci  there are always some risks to consider. One risk which I've seen mentioned here and there relates to the remaining life of some of Vinci's key concessions. This is a fear that is overblown in my opinion. This risk concerns more specifically the French component of the highway division. Vinci currently manages about 35% of the network in France  and it has undoubtedly been a huge cash cow for the company. All good things must come to an end  and most of these concessions will expire between 2032 and 2036:Vinci's H1 2022 results presentationThe highly profitable nature of the concessions is confirmed by their huge cash flow generation: about ‚Ç¨2.6 billion of FCF in 2021  and  in fact  closer to ‚Ç¨3.3 billion when one excludes the growth CapEx:Vinci's 2021 Annual ReportThere are two ways to look at it:For sure  the expiry of these concessions in the 2030s will deprive Vinci of a tremendous asset.However  between now and the expiry  the company will pile up the cash at a rate of more than ‚Ç¨3 billion per year (and growing)  possibly more than ‚Ç¨50 billion in total.This cash should be enough to keep paying comfortable dividends while also preparing the future with new concessions. The company has been doing exactly that with new highway deals (see below) and  of course  the airport division.Vinci's H1 2022 results presentationIn a worst-case scenario  I have to mention one specific risk  which would be the forced renegotiation of the concession terms awarded by the French state to Vinci  Bouygues (OTCPK:BOUYF  OTCPK:BOUYY) and Eiffage (OTCPK:EFGSF  OTCPK:EFGSY) in the mid-2000s. The terms have turned out to be very favorable for the private companies (as shown by the FCF we discussed). Toll roads are rarely popular  and  with every election  there are calls by some candidates to renegotiate or even cancel the concessions altogether.However  this would constitute a blatant breach of contractual terms  which would have far-reaching implications for France as a stable jurisdiction. The current Macron government has always resisted such a move  so any reckless decision would not happen before the next presidential election in 2026 at the earliest - and again  this is highly unlikely.TakeawayVinci's strong performance and solid prospects look baked in the stock price  and investors looking for significant capital appreciation may want to look at other infrastructure plays such as Corporaci√≥n Am√©rica Airports (CAAP)  which also boasts a promising airport portfolio.However  even at the current share price  Vinci should provide decent returns  and a growing dividend that makes it a blue chip worth keeping in one's income portfolio.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

In 2022 the Group signed 15 new projects under six hotel brands adding more than 2100 rooms to its existing portfolio of 24 hotels in these regions. Accor will open nine properties in this area in 2023  five of which were signed in 2022.New Accor hotels will open in the well-known capitals ‚Äì Baku  Azerbaijan; Tashkent  Uzbekistan; and Tbilisi  Georgia. The Group‚Äôs brands will also debut in picturesque resorts such as Kobuleti in Georgia  Charvak Lake in Uzbekistan  Tsaghkadzor in Armenia. The growth in the region is dominated by Accor‚Äôs globally renowned ‚Äòglocal‚Äô midscale brand Mercure  with six signings across the region in 2022. Mercure combines the strength of an international network of nearly 1000 hotels  with genuine and local hospitality experiences. A third of signings in 2022 was for the Group‚Äôs leading premium brands M√∂venpick and Swiss√¥tel  bringing a further five properties to the region in the coming years.

On a constant scope basis  growth is +5%.COVID activity now represents only 39% of consolidated revenue (compared to 56% in 2021)  in a market driven by a sharp drop in sales prices and test volumes.The share of proprietary products in the core business increased to 18% of sales  compared to 14% the previous year.in ‚Ç¨m 2022 2021 change Core (excl. COVID) 93.4 81.5 +15% COVID 59.1 102.6 -42% Total 152.5 184.1 -17% unauditedA business portfolio with higher added valueThe strong growth of the core business  at +15%  reflects both the dynamism of historical activities  the development of new activities and the reallocation of the distribution portfolio.New activities are driven on the one hand by the strengthening of R&D and partnerships  but above all by the acquisitions made in 2022. In this respect  BMD  acquired in June 2022  makes it possible to extend the distribution of diagnostic products to the Benelux zone. GenDx  acquired on October 1  2022  brings a range of 100% proprietary products among the most efficient in the field of HLA2 diagnostics  as well as next-generation genomic sequencing technologies bringing numerous synergies.Excluding the contribution of BMD and GenDx  the core business grew by 5% including the strategic reallocation of the distribution portfolio which resulted in the termination of certain low-margin distribution contracts  which represented several million euros of turnover in 2021.This strategic reallocation of the distribution portfolio is for the benefit of new partnerships aimed at making innovative products with a strong impact available in France for healthcare professionals and patients. The Group has thus taken over the exclusive distribution in France of the HIV self-test from the US company Orasure  signed partnerships with Alcor  Technoclone and SD Biosensor laboratories for distribution in the field of ""Point of Care"" proximity tests  and in the field of connected biology based on artificial intelligence.COVID sales supported by an extension of the product portfolioAs expected  the COVID activity proved resilient in a market whose decline accelerated in the second half of the year. Corresponding revenue shows an annual decline of 42% driven by a sharp reduction in prices and volumes. At ‚Ç¨59.1 million  the COVID activity represents 39% of revenue in 2022.Thanks to a highly responsive innovation strategy and go-to-market capabilities  sales of new proprietary COVID tests continued. Eurobio Scientific has introduced more than 10 proprietary tests since 2021 as the different variants of the virus have spread. The expertise of the R&D teams  the mastery of regulatory affairs demonstrated by the company's ISO 13485 recertification under the new IVDR3 framework  and a high-capacity production tool  all enable the Group to support laboratories in almost real time.Eurobio Scientific has remained one of the main French players in the diagnosis of COVID  and benefits  thanks to its privileged relations with its partners  from a vast park of installed instruments  capable of processing a multitude of tests. At the start of the year  a part of this business segment relies on the proprietary EBX 042 FluCoSyn‚Ñ¢ test (COVID/influenza/RSV triplex)  which Eurobio Scientific introduced in September 2020. The COVID segment is therefore becoming a core business routine activity.Group internationalizationInternational now represents more than 25% of the turnover generated by the core business  while it still only partially includes the sales of BMD and GenDx  acquired in 2022.Net debt of less than ‚Ç¨30m after acquisition of GenDxAt the end of 2022  Eurobio Scientific's cash position was over ‚Ç¨85 million  for a net financial debt of less than ‚Ç¨30 million.After completing the structuring acquisition of GenDx  Eurobio Scientific retains a financial structure allowing continued investments and the ability to seize possible acquisition opportunities.Next financial meetings2022 results: April 5  2023  before market opensAnnual shareholders‚Äô meeting : June 12  2023 at 9amHalf-year 2023 sales : July 24  2023  after market closesHalf-year results : October 11  2023  after market closesAbout Eurobio ScientificEurobio Scientific is a key player in the field of specialty in vitro diagnostics.

16995,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://www.cityam.com/how-blockchains-are-being-used-by-asset-managers/,How blockchains are being used by asset managers,Jonny Fry delves into the world of asset management and how blockchains can create multiple opportunities for investors.The post How blockchains are being used by asset managers appeared first on CityAM.,How blockchains are being used by asset managersThe extreme volatility of cryptocurrencies has long been a major concern. Investors‚Äô nervousness has risen in recent times as the future of digital currencies remains uncertain all the while the crypto crash lingers on.However  the technology behind cryptocurrencies  blockchain and (more importantly) other digital assets is gathering greater adoption by regulated financial institutions around the world. Digital ledger technology (DLT) ‚Äì the umbrella term under which blockchain also functions ‚Äì has gained visibility and is now being developed for several applications. The financial system  having switched to electronic trading a few decades ago  is set to witness another significant transformation through the use of DLT.The fund industry has undoubtedly seen massive growth in terms of the number of funds and total assets under management in the last decade. Despite this  fund houses still rely on long complex chains of distribution which make building investor relationships and controlling distribution costs difficult.However  the industry has seen the light  acknowledging the transformative potential of blockchain technology in the sector since it enables digitisation and tokenisation of funds whereby helping to reduce inefficiencies in fund distribution.Asset managers using blockchainsSource: YouTubeThe YouTube link above is an example of how Vanguard  the second biggest asset manager in the world (with $8trillion undermanagement)  is using blockchain technology. Warren Pennington  from Vanguard  explains how blockchain technology is being used to help manage its vast array of index funds: ‚Äú‚Ä¶blockchain at its core is a supercomputer that we can all use at the same time allowing many parties to all be connected in real time.‚ÄùBlockchains can certainly create opportunities for both asset management firms and investors. Whilst asset managers can go to investors and expand their distribution networks  investors can now also subscribe to a native digital or tokenised asset via an online distributed ledger. The fund tokens can then be held in digital wallets that are owned and operated by the investor  thus moving the industry closer to a self-service style model.Oliver Portenseigne  CEO of FundsDLT (established in 2016 and owned by Clearstream  Credit Suisse Asset Management  the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and Natixis Investment Managers)  believes: ‚ÄúThe immediate result of greater blockchain adoption in wealth and asset management is simply cheaper  easier and faster services. Financial inclusion is therefore improved as this will attract larger numbers of potential clients to wealth managers  who before may have been perceived as out of reach‚Äù.Furthermore  blockchains offer the potential to reduce transaction costs  provide automation and real-time visibility  and enhance reporting. They will also streamline AML/ KYC processes because tokens‚Äô ownership can be linked to the digital identity of the investor  therefore building proof of beneficial ownership with AML/KYC controls incorporated into the smart contract.Taking a look at how DLT and tokenisation will transform the fund distribution value chain  Paul Daly (Head of Distribution Products and Solutions) and Carole Michel (Fund Distribution Senior Global Product Manager) at BNP Paribas Securities Services  have concurred: ‚ÄúThis technology will give birth to new types of services such as consolidation in case of interoperability between blockchain platforms  storage of private keys  signature of orders to validate the value on the chain  and structuration of data in the security token.‚ÄùConfirming this approach also in an interview with CoinDesk  Tyrone Lobban (head of Onyx Digital Assets at JPMorgan) has explained the bank‚Äôs institutional-grade DeFi plans  pointing out how much value in tokenised assets is ready to be used at the appropriate time.‚ÄúOver time  we think tokenising U.S. Treasurys or money market fund shares  for example  means these could all potentially be used as collateral in DeFi pools ‚Äù and adding  ‚ÄúThe overall goal is to bring these trillions of dollars of assets into DeFi  so that we can use these new mechanisms for trading  borrowing [and] lending  but with the scale of institutional assets.‚ÄùHoping that DeFi developers would leverage the yield-generating potential of non-crypto assets  JPMorgan incorporates the tokenisation of traditional assets to a greater scale. Through two complementary components  one of which is JPMorgan‚Äôs blockchain-based collateral settlement system  Onyx Digital Assets hopes to bring bank-grade DeFi to realisation. Project Guardian  which tests institutional-friendly DeFi using permissioned liquidity pools that comprise tokenised bonds and deposits  is the second part.Furthermore  tokenisation offers a real opportunity to improve the asset management industry since it allows for the digital representation of funds and the underlying assets on a blockchain or DLT. According to a study by BNY Mellon ‚Äúalmost all institutional investors (91%) are interested in investing in tokenized products‚Äù.Speaking to Connect Forum  Edward Glyn  head of global market at Calastone  reported: ‚ÄúThis tokenised product would provide the same exposure but be issued and operated throughout a technical ecosystem where every player also has access  input  and oversight.‚ÄùFrom the investors‚Äô perspective  this means more personalised low-cost investing  real-time investing  clear and fair pricing  transparency  access to a bigger pool of assets and a user experience equal to the challenger banks and lifestyle apps.On the other hand  investment managers see this as a radical enhancing of the supply chain  improved transparency and analytics  simpler fund issuance  and the possibility of greater alpha generation by removing tens of basis points off management costs.As a step towards tokenisation  AllianceBernstein joins hands with specialists in blockchain technology  Allfunds Blockchain ‚Äì the collaboration between the two aimed at integrating blockchain technology into the financial service ecosystem. The Allfunds Group  a leading B2B WealthTech platform for the funds industry with ‚Ç¨1.4 trillion in assets under management  offers fully integrated solutions for both asset management firms and distributors. Within this is a standalone company  Allfunds Blockchain  which generates a unique environment of security  privacy and data governance amongst financial institutions and enables new capabilities for programming and automating processes via smart contracts.AllianceBernstein (with $779billion in assets under management) offers research and diversified investment services to institutional investors  individuals and private wealth clients worldwide. The integrative collaboration creating mutual benefits between these two is  without doubt  an important example of how blockchain is influencing the asset management industry. Another is the recent acquisition of a stake in digital securities exchange  Archax  by Abrdn.Following through on the ¬£508billion asset manager‚Äôs ambitions to enter the digital assets market  the Edinburgh-based fund group has become the largest external shareholder in Archax although  prior to this  BlackRock (the world‚Äôs largest asset manager)  had partnered with Coinbase Global to offer digital assets to institutional investors.So  whilst it is quite impossible to mention all since the list is inexhaustible  the above demonstrates how tokenisation is still impacting the asset management industry.Looking ahead  tokenisation would enable the industry to develop a secondary market where the value encapsulated in a token can be transferred almost instantly in a traceable process that can handle small amounts of capital and settle in real time. This would not only simplify operations  reduce costs and provide real-time data  but would also be of value to clients with illiquid funds.Furthermore  the use of blockchains and/or DLTs offers compliance staff and regulators much needed greater transparency while potentially reducing counterparty risk.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.49,0.13,0.38,True,English,"['asset managers', 'blockchains', 'Fund Distribution Senior Global Product Manager', 'money market fund shares', 'second biggest asset manager', 'BNP Paribas Securities Services', 'blockchain-based collateral settlement system', 'Credit Suisse Asset Management', 'fund distribution value chain', 'long complex chains', 'online distributed ledger', 'self-service style model', 'Luxembourg Stock Exchange', 'AML/ KYC processes', 'U.S. Treasurys', 'two complementary components', 'permissioned liquidity pools', 'asset management firms', 'Natixis Investment Managers', 'institutional-grade DeFi plans', 'other digital assets', 'Onyx Digital Assets', 'Digital ledger technology', 'asset management industry', 'greater blockchain adoption', 'fund houses', 'fund tokens', 'financial system', 'second part', 'fund industry', 'asset managers', 'greater adoption', 'distribution costs', 'distribution networks', 'Distribution Products', 'tokenised asset', 'DeFi pools', 'digital currencies', 'native digital', 'digital wallets', 'digital identity', 'digital representation', 'faster services', 'total assets', 'institutional assets', 'crypto assets', 'traditional assets', 'underlying assets', 'extreme volatility', 'major concern', 'recent times', 'crypto crash', 'financial institutions', 'umbrella term', 'several applications', 'significant transformation', 'massive growth', 'last decade', '$8trillion undermanagement', 'Warren Pennington', 'vast array', 'many parties', 'Oliver Portenseigne', 'immediate result', 'cheaper, easier', 'Financial inclusion', 'larger numbers', 'transaction costs', 'tokens‚Äô ownership', 'beneficial ownership', 'AML/KYC controls', 'smart contract', 'Paul Daly', 'Carole Michel', 'new types', 'private keys', 'security token', 'Tyrone Lobban', 'overall goal', 'new mechanisms', 'DeFi developers', 'bank-grade DeFi', 'Project Guardian', 'institutional-friendly DeFi', 'tokenised bonds', 'real opportunity', 'BNY Mellon', 'greater scale', 'transformative potential', 'same time', 'real time', 'potential clients', 'appropriate time', 'yield-generating potential', 'wealth managers', 'blockchain platforms', 'electronic trading', 'blockchain technology', 'YouTube link', 'real-time visibility', 'Investors‚Äô nervousness', 'institutional investors', 'investor relationships', 'blockchains Source', 'index funds', 'cryptocurrencies', 'future', 'world', 'DLT', 'terms', 'light', 'sector', 'digitisation', 'tokenisation', 'inefficiencies', 'example', 'Vanguard', 'core', 'supercomputer', 'opportunities', 'CEO', 'Clearstream', 'reach', 'automation', 'reporting', 'proof', 'look', 'Head', 'Solutions', 'birth', 'consolidation', 'case', 'interoperability', 'storage', 'signature', 'orders', 'data', 'approach', 'interview', 'CoinDesk', 'JPMorgan', 'trillions', 'dollars', 'lending', 'realisation', 'deposits', 'study']",2023-01-24,2023-01-24,cityam.com

Athena takes the concept of customer service chatbots to the next level using Open AI programs ChatGPT-3 and DALL.E allowing enterprise clients the ability to have full  interactive conversations with the avatar within the ENGAGE metaverse. Click HERE and HERE to experience Athena.‚ÄúThe launch of Athena is going to open up endless possibilities for enterprise clients and change the future of the metaverse ‚Äù said David Whelen  CEO and co-founder of ENGAGE. ‚ÄúWith just a prompt or two  users can have full conversations with Athena inside the ENGAGE platform and ask her just about anything from completing simple tasks and answering basic questions to creating complex and unique installations within the metaverse.‚ÄùTraditionally  customer service chatbots are software or computer program interfaces that simulate human-like conversations via text or voice interactions. Up until now  chatbots have been programmed using keywords and preset scripts  which can limit their functionality and usefulness. Athena‚Äôs AI intelligence takes the customer service chat functionality further for ENGAGE Link users. Athena can provide advice  answer questions  source media for playback  create AI imagery  find 3D objects  create sticky notes  and interact with key functions of the platform. This is all done via an animated avatar body giving people who interact with Athena the sense they are speaking with a real person. The AI functionality also enables Athena the ability to learn and enhance her intelligence the more she interacts with people  improving her performance and responding more naturally to conversational prompts.Story continues‚ÄúWe named ENGAGE‚Äôs companion  Athena  after the Greek goddess of wisdom  handicraft and practical reason ‚Äù said Whelan. ‚ÄúAs our clients continue to interact with Athena  she will expand her intelligence with each prompt and conversation. The introduction of Athena is only the beginning of an extensive roadmap we have planned for AI metaverse applications.‚ÄùOver the coming weeks  engineers at ENGAGE will be adding more functionality and connectivity to Athena  utilizing different AI programs. She will be given access to hundreds of technical documents training her to become an expert on the ENGAGE platform and helping to enhance her responses to become more humanlike.ENGAGE XR plans to provide custom AI employees for its enterprise clients at a premium in the future. Each custom avatar will be tailored with a unique personality and will be provided all the technical knowledge they will need to support each individual company‚Äôs goals and tasks. The avatars will be able to take on a host of client-facing tasks which include tech support  training  education and moderation.To learn more about ENGAGE XR and Athena  please visit the company‚Äôs blog and website https://engageplc.com and follow us on social on LinkedIn   Twitter   YouTube and Facebook .About ENGAGE XRENGAGE XR Holdings plc (AIM: EXR; Euronext Growth: EXR) is a metaverse technology company focused on becoming a leading global provider of virtual communications solutions through its new fully featured corporate metaverse  ENGAGE Link.

The year 2022 also marks an important milestone for the global microbiome industry with the regulatory approvals of the first microbiome-based drugs by the FDA in the U.S. and by the TGA in Australia ‚Äù stated Herv√© Affagard  CEO and co-founder of MaaT Pharma. ‚ÄúDespite difficult market conditions  we continue to advance our pioneering science and technology and we remain focused on delivering new therapeutic solutions to the benefit of patients with severe conditions as well as building value for our shareholders. 2023 will be a year with important inflection points and will require us to act decisively to reach our objectives. We thank our investors for their support throughout this year  and their confidence in our ability to achieve the next level of corporate development.‚ÄùClinical developmentHemato-oncologyMaaT013  a full-ecosystem  standardized  pooled-donor native Microbiome Ecosystem Therapy for acute  hospital use (enema administration)MaaT013 for the treatment of acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (aGvHD): MaaT013 has received an Orphan Drug Designation by both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medical Agency (EMA).MaaT013 is currently being evaluated in Europe in an ongoing international multicenter open-label  single arm  pivotal Phase 3 trial (ARES) in 75 patients with steroid-resistant gastrointestinal aGvHD. The Company has received full regulatory approvals in the following countries  which is more than initially envisioned: Austria  Belgium  France  Germany  Italy  and Spain. A safety and efficacy data review will be conducted by an independent data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) after enrollment of half of the patients in the study. The review is expected in the first half of 2023 and the Company will communicate the DSMB‚Äôs recommendations following the review.The initiation of clinical trials following the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for MaaT013 in the United States (U.S.) will depend on the outcome of ongoing exchanges with the FDA in response to the August 2022 continued clinical hold letter. The most recent communication received by the Company from the FDA stated that the complete response provided by the Company in response to the letter received in August 2022  was still under review. Feedback could be expected in the early part of 2023 and the Company will update investors accordingly. The Company understands that the FDA‚Äôs Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) that currently hosts all microbiome-based drug candidates  continues to prioritize their work to advance the nation‚Äôs response to the COVID-19 public health emergency  which is creating additional delays. Despite this  the Company remains focused on achieving regulatory approval for MaaT013 in the U.S. and providing a therapeutic solution for patients in the country.MaaT013 has already been successfully evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with steroid-resistant grade III-IV gastro-intestinal (GI) aGvHD (HERACLES) as well as in an ongoing compassionate use program (EAP) in France in patients with Grade II-IV GI-aGvHD having failed previous therapies  with promising results presented at the 2022 American Society of Hematology (ASH) conference in an oral presentation and in a poster at the 2022 edition of the International Human Microbiome Consortium (IHMC). The compelling data demonstrates that the pooled microbiota product is well tolerated and shows a good safety profile in a fragile patient population. Efficacy of MaaT013 correlates with engraftment of the product‚Äôs microbial species in the gut and clinical response to MaaT013 translates to increased overall survival in patients with aGvHD.MaaT033  a donor-derived  standardized  high-richness  high-diversity Microbiome Ecosystem Therapy for oral administration  currently being developed as an adjunctive and maintenance therapy to improve overall survival in patients receiving HSCT1.MaaT033 for the improved survival of patients with hematological malignancies receiving allo-HSCTBased on promising results following the Phase 1b trial presented at the 2022 edition of the ASH annual meeting  and learnings from this study  along with an in-depth review of the Protocol Assistance with the EMA  and discussions with potential partners showing an interest in the license and commercialization of MaaT033 in this therapeutic area  the Company has optimized and adjusted the protocol for the Phase 2b trial of MaaT033 (PHOEBUS). In this context and given the strategic importance of the trial  the Company has decided to take over the sponsorship of the clinical trial in Europe. At the time of the IPO  it was anticipated that AP-HP2 would sponsor the trial in France as an Investigator-sponsored trial. The study is expected to start in Q2 2023 and would now be conducted in Europe in accordance with EMA recommendations. The number of patients enrolled in the study would expand from 341 to 387 and the number of sites would be increased from 20 to 56  enabling the recruitment period to be reduced from 36 to 24 months.While the primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of MaaT033 in improving overall survival at 12 months  secondary endpoints would include the evaluation of safety and tolerability before and after allo-HSCT  and the evaluation of the engraftment of beneficial microbial species from MaaT033 and the activity in preventing allo-HSCT complications (infections  GvHD).Additional readouts have been included throughout the 24-month recruitment period  such as interim safety analysis with stopping rules 3 when the trial has enrolled and randomized  respectively  60 and 120 patients.when the trial has enrolled and randomized  respectively  60 and 120 patients. The expected timelines including the overall survival endpoint (data to be expected in H1 2026) announced by MaaT Pharma during the IPO should be confirmed based on the adjustments mentioned above.In parallel to starting the trial in Europe  the Company plans to discuss this program with the FDA upon conclusion of ongoing dialogues with the Agency regarding its pooling technology.Immuno-oncology ‚Äì Clinical and nonclinical programsMaaT013 for the improvement of patients‚Äô response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI) ‚Äìproof of concept Phase 2a clinical trial sponsored by AP-HPThe proof-of-concept double blind randomized Phase 2a clinical trial  PICASSO (n=60)  initiated in April 2022  evaluating MaaT013‚Äôs impact on the efficacy of ICI treatments (ipilimumab + nivolumab) in patients with metastatic melanoma  remains on track as planned.This trial is an Investigator-sponsored trial by AP-HP  where MaaT Pharma supplies drug candidates and performs the microbiome profiling of patients using its proprietary gutPrint¬Æ platform.Key study endpoints after 23 weeks of treatment include MaaT013‚Äôs safety profile and best-overall response rate vs placebo as an add-on treatment to ipilimumab + nivolumab.placebo as an add-on treatment to ipilimumab + nivolumab. The Company is expected to receive biological biomarker data in H1 2023 after half of the patients have been enrolled and achieved their evaluation 9 weeks after randomization.Results are expected in H2 2024  as planned.MaaT03x  a new generation high richness  co-cultured  designed Microbiome Ecosystem TherapyTM in oral formulation for the increase in the response rate to ICI in patients with solid tumors - currently in preclinical testing.As MaaT03x is expected to be used in large markets  MaaT Pharma has been focused on increasing the level of readiness and decided to enter a Phase 1b trial in Europe and the U.S. in the first half of 2024  as opposed to the second half of 2023 as initially announced. This is a result of changes and adjustments following announcements of first regulatory approvals for microbiome-based products and the Company‚Äôs work for the development of its native products (MaaT013 & MaaT033) in Europe. MaaT Pharma is consolidating in vivo/in vitro data  continuing product development characterization and conducting regulatory readiness of MaaT03x. Preclinical data are expected to be shared at scientific conferences in 2023.MaaT Pharma has initiated early interactions with the EMA in 2022 including a meeting with the EMA's Innovation Task Force (ITF). Further interactions in Europe are expected to take place in 2023. The Company is also planning early interactions with the FDA in H1 2023 to present its MaaT03x platform and has already filed a meeting request.The Company will be able to strengthen its intellectual property (IP) portfolio in France and internationally thanks to the co-cultured new generation products. Currently  the Company holds the IP for 14 patent families.Therapeutic pipeline extensionRecent studies have highlighted the importance of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and the impact of the gut microbiome in brain diseases. Interestingly  patients with neurodegenerative disorders display both central nervous system (CNS) and gastrointestinal symptoms4. In parallel  scientific research has started to shed light on the role of the gut microbiome  linking abnormalities to diseases such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS5). The link between gut microbiota and ALS first emerged from preclinical evidence and then from clinical observations indicating a disease-modifying role for the gut microbiome. To date  there is no effective treatment for ALS  a disease that leads to death within an average of 3-5 years after diagnosis6. ALS affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord causing loss of muscle control. Since its inception  MaaT Pharma has been committed to restoring a microbial symbiosis in life-threatening diseases with high unmet clinical needs. Growing evidence suggests that ALS patients show increased inflammation in the gut with changes in the composition of gut microbes and low levels of beneficial bacteria.MaaT Pharma has decided to extend its scientific research to the management of ALS  which could pave the way for the treatment of several neurodegenerative diseases. The Company is leveraging the strong safety profile of its native MET products (MaaT033/MaaT013) and their inherent product characteristics of promoting immune modulation/anti-inflammatory properties and acting as a homeostasis hub. The number of ALS cases is expected to increase substantially in the developing world over the next 25 years and could reach a total of 60 000 patients in U.S. and Europe by 20407. Every year  5 000 new patients are diagnosed in the U.S. and in Europe and the incidence of ALS ranges from 3 to 4 per 100 000 person-years7.Leveraging 12 months of feasibility assessment in MaaT Pharma‚Äôs Discovery team  the Company expects to initiate in H1 2023 a Phase 1b pilot study in ALS evaluating MaaT033 to slow down disease progression. The study  developed with experts from the ALS network (FILSLAN and ACT4ALS-MND) and strongly supported by the French patient association (Tous en Selles contre la SLA)  will enroll up to 15 patients presenting initial motor deficit i.e.  at least 6 months up to 24 months at the time of the screening. This pipeline expansion to a new indication demonstrates the strong potential of MaaT033 to be used in an acute or chronic setting as a standalone  adjunctive and maintenance therapy. Data readout from the pilot study is expected for the first half of 2024.If this initial trial is successful  the Company could extend further to other chronic diseases/ immuno-inflammatory diseases as MaaT Pharma collects data and strengthens in-depth understanding of the mechanism of action. Funding for the trial is already secured and the program has been designed to minimize the risk and not impact the Company‚Äôs lead programs in oncology. The key study endpoints are assessment of safety and tolerability of multiple doses of MaaT033  the assessment of gut microbiota composition evolution and the identification of biomarkers sensitive to treatment before considering a larger randomized controlled efficacy study.cGMP manufacturing facilitiesMaaT Pharma is currently building its future manufacturing facilities  in partnership with Skyepharma. The 1600m2 facility will be able to support the needs of clinical and commercial production of its native MET (MaaT013 & MaaT033)  R&D and clinical batches of cultured products  MaaT03x  up to 2034.Funding is secured and the completion of the facility is expected in mid-2023. Under the terms of the partnership agreement  MaaT Pharma will retain the know-how of its bio-manufacturing processes and agility (full command end-to-end manufacturing processes)  while leveraging Skyepharma‚Äôs experience in running a cGMP facility. Having this facility is a strong competitive advantage for a late-stage company preparing for commercial phase  which MaaT Pharma believes will facilitate potential commercial partnerships. The site will be the first in France  and the largest specialized manufacturing facility for full ecosystem microbiome therapies in Europe to date. The facility will also increase potential synergies within the microbiome industry and contribute to structuring the production of microbiome-based drugs. It will provide a fully integrated manufacturing and development platform that will allow quick and efficient product development  scale-up and GMP processes.Financing plans & update on cash runwayFollowing an in-depth review of its ongoing programs  in particular the deferral of the clinical study of MaaT03x from 2023 to 2024 and savings on discretionary spending  the Company has optimized and prioritized its operations  extending its cash runway to end of Q4 2023  as compared to end of Q3 2023 as previously announced. The Company is also evaluating options that will finance operations and bring its late-stage products close to commercial launch. The focus is on both dilutive and non-dilutive financing  including business deals. The Company is confident in the continuing and longstanding support of its historical investors.The Company has updated its corporate presentation  which can be download here: https://www.maatpharma.com/investors/About MaaT PharmaMaaT Pharma  a clinical stage biotechnology company  has established a complete approach to restoring patient-microbiome symbiosis in oncology.

By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world‚Äôs first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world‚Äôs first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ (ALDEI ‚Äì code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010. The Company has 45 employees and relies on a network of world-class academic  technological  industrial and institutional partners.CONTACTSInvestorsMario AlcarazChief Financial and Administrative Officer+33 (0)4 48 19 01 00ir@deinove.comMediaATCG Partners+33 (0)9 81 87 46 72communication@deinove.comAttachment,neutral,0.0,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.14,0.13,0.73,True,English,"['judicial liquidation proceedings', 'receivership proceedings', 'Conversion', 'proc√©dure de liquidation judiciaire', 'Ma√Ætre Christine Dauverchain', 'Phase II clinical trial', 'severe Clostridioides difficile infection', 'first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms', 'world-class academic, technological, industrial', 'microbial dark matter', 'several development programs', 'low concentrated compounds', 'JUDICIAL LIQUIDATION PROCEEDINGS', 'first antibiotic candidate', 'complex chemical structures', 'French biotech company', 'French biotechnology company', 'urgent, global challenge', 'Montpellier Commercial Court', 'new bacterial micro-factories', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'liquidateur judiciaire', 'liquidation surplus', 'first emergencies', 'industrial production', 'judicial liquidator', 'English French', 'RECEIVERSHIP PROCEEDINGS', 'antibiotic resistance', 'Euronext Paris', 'global health', 'economic challenge', 'chemical synthesis', 'bacterial biodiversity', 'new domain', 'new therapies', 'bacterial extracts', 'EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ', 'The Company', 'press release', 'delisting procedure', 'metabolic potential', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'life-threatening infections', 'high speed', 'breakthrough approach', 'unique collection', 'other issue', 'Euromedecine park', 'institutional partners', 'Mario Alcaraz', 'Chief Financial', 'Administrative Officer', 'ATCG Partners', 'rare bacteria', '10,000 rare strains', 'Deinove shares', 'CONVERSION', 'ALDEI', 'pioneer', 'exploration', 'exploitation', 'January', 'judgment', 'November', 'offer', 'deadline', 'noon', 'result', 'publication', 'notice', 'end', 'place', 'consultation', 'distribution', 'shareholders', 'superbugs', 'microbes', 'antimicrobials', 'rise', 'thousands', 'race', 'heart', 'code', 'ISIN', '45 employees', 'network', 'CONTACTS', 'Investors', 'Media', 'communication', 'Attachment', '9']",2023-01-24,2023-01-24,globenewswire.com

ESA is working closely with the European Commission to ensure that space benefits EU citizens and to foster a strong and resilient European space economy.‚ÄùESA and the EU have been partners in European space for decades. ESA designed and developed the EU‚Äôs Galileo system ‚Äì with its 28-satellite constellation and its global ground stations ‚Äì that together provide a highly accurate  guaranteed global positioning service under civilian control  as well as more than 30 EU Copernicus Earth observation satellites that deliver data to improve the management of the environment  understand and mitigate the effects of climate change  and ensure civil security. ESA has also created the EU‚Äôs European satellite navigation system for aircraft.Cyberattacks and geopolitics threaten today‚Äôs increasingly digital world  leading to the disruption of essential supplies such as power and water. In response  ESA has started work on supporting the EU‚Äôs new flagship space programme ‚Äì a highly secure  satellite-enabled connectivity system called Iris2 that will promote digital autonomy and provide a strategic asset for the EU.Javier Benedicto  ESA Director of Navigation and Acting Director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications  will tell the conference how ESA will work with space companies in the EU to deliver the Iris2 constellation. The satellites and their ground stations are expected to be operational by the end of 2027  based on contracts to be signed in 2024.He will also outline how ESA is developing the new generation of the EU‚Äôs Galileo navigation satellites that will support European autonomy and resilience.Simonetta Cheli  ESA Director of Earth Observation  will highlight how ESA can support the evolution and modernisation of the EU‚Äôs Copernicus Earth observation satellites. Advanced use of Copernicus data and information services will support better policy definition  improved planning  increased transparency and accountability  enabling Europe to achieve the ambitious goal of becoming the first net-zero continent by 2050.Geraldine Naja  ESA Director of Commercialisation  Industry and Procurement  will speak about how ESA is supporting the development of European space innovation  technology and skills.Today the European space stock index ‚Äì an index of European space-based companies that are currently listed on the stock market ‚Äì will be launched. The index enables investors and people working in finance to monitor the financial performance of European space companies.

Registration applications will be filed in the remaining countries (Serbia  North Macedonia  Montenegro  Bosnia).Last November Maxigesic¬Æ IV was launched France and Italy  together with Ever Pharma GmbH.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: ‚ÄúWe are pleased with Maxigesic¬Æ IV‚Äôs further roll-out. This novel non-opioid pain treatment can soon offer relief to patients in even more countries across Europe  and underlines the attractiveness of our business model of reformulating and repurposing existing medicinal products  including its ability to provide significant benefits to patients and health care providers.‚ÄùAbout Maxigesic¬Æ IVMaxigesic¬Æ IV is a novel  dual mode-of-action  non-opioid pain treatment for use post-operatively in hospitals or when patients cannot take medicine orally. It is a unique combination of 1000mg paracetamol with 300mg ibuprofen solution for infusion  thereby reducing both pain and inflammation.Story continuesResults from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial demonstrated that Maxigesic¬Æ IV was well-tolerated and had a faster onset of action  offered higher pain relief  and provided the potential to reduce the use of opioids compared to ibuprofen IV or paracetamol IV alone in the same doses. Further exposure studies have demonstrated the drug‚Äôs efficacy and safety in an expanded population group over a longer treatment period. Maxigesic¬Æ IV is protected by several granted and pending patent applications.About Hyloris Pharmaceuticals SAHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimising existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.

By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world‚Äôs first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world‚Äôs first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ (ALDEI ‚Äì code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010.

Name : EKINOPS ISIN Code : FR0011466069 Mnemonic code : EKI Number of shares: 25 431 086  Attachments   Original Link   Original Document‚Ä¶,"Ekinops (Euronext Paris - FR0011466069 - EKI)  a leading supplier of optical transport systems and access network solutions  today announces the availability of its new PM_400FR05-C2A pluggable module for the Ekinops360 WDM optical transport system. This new line card is the first coherent module from Ekinops based on 400G pluggable line interfaces  offering lower cost  lower power coherent solutions than what is offered by high-performance embedded optics.Since their debut in 2021  pluggable 400G transceivers have been quickly adapted for use in communications networks. Though initially designed for short reach data center connectivity  newer versions with higher optical launch powers are now being deployed in broader applications including metro and regional service provider transport networks. According to market research firm Cignal AI  these transceivers will represent more than 20% of all 100G+ telecom bandwidth deployed in 2022  growing to 30% by 2024. ""400G pluggable optics are revolutionizing the optical communications market by creating more flexible high-performance networks at lower cost for both data center and traditional telco operators "" said Scott Wilkinson  Lead Analyst for Optical Components at Cignal AI. ""This performance and cost savings provide a compelling case for all network operators to consider pluggable coherent optics-based network designs  and deployments based on these modules will lead coherent bandwidth growth in optical networking for the next several years.""The PM_400FR05-C2A provides multiple client options capable of supporting either 100GbE or OTU4 as well as 400GbE connectivity. The line interface is programmable from 100G to 400G. As a standards-based solution  the PM_400FR05-C2A is fully interoperable with other third-party compliant interfaces making it easy and inexpensive for service providers to interconnect switch/router ports. While most pluggable 400G optics are limited to point-to-point connectivity  the PM_400FR05-C2A is also deployable on meshed optical networks with multi-point connectivity  a key differentiator that significantly expands the scope of potential applications.""As a line card-based solution  the PM_400 FR05-C2A provides a strict demarcation point between not only service provider and customer networks but also the packet and optical networks so that it fits seamlessly into the service providers' operational model "" said Guillaume Crenn  Product Line and Marketing Director at Ekinops. ""Because most switches and routers out there today cannot support a 400G transceiver directly  Ekinops' approach saves customers from having to upgrade their packet infrastructure."" Compatible with all existing Ekinops chassis  Ekinops customers can not only avoid the cost of upgrading routers but also avoid adding new transport infrastructure while still taking advantage of the small size  low power and low cost of pluggable solutions without sacrificing performance.Another differentiator is the availability of an optional Ekinops proprietary enhanced performance mode that extends the reach of the line output more than 20% compared to standardized modes of performance. Advanced transmission technology developed by Ekinops provides a cleaner transmission signal that can eliminate the need for additional amplifiers and regeneration points to further lower overall network cost.The PM_400FR05-C2A is already attracting customer interest. It is currently in lab trials with general availability beginning in the first quarter of 2023.For more information about the Ekinops portfolio  please visit https://www.ekinops.com/products-services/productsEkinops is a leading provider of open  trusted and innovative network connectivity solutions to service providers around the world.

Registration applications will be filed in the remaining countries (Serbia  North Macedonia  Montenegro  Bosnia).Last November Maxigesic¬Æ IV was launched France and Italy  together with Ever Pharma GmbH.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: ‚ÄúWe are pleased with Maxigesic¬Æ IV‚Äôs further roll-out. This novel non-opioid pain treatment can soon offer relief to patients in even more countries across Europe  and underlines the attractiveness of our business model of reformulating and repurposing existing medicinal products  including its ability to provide significant benefits to patients and health care providers.‚ÄùAbout Maxigesic¬Æ IVMaxigesic¬Æ IV is a novel  dual mode-of-action  non-opioid pain treatment for use post-operatively in hospitals or when patients cannot take medicine orally. It is a unique combination of 1000mg paracetamol with 300mg ibuprofen solution for infusion  thereby reducing both pain and inflammation.Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial demonstrated that Maxigesic¬Æ IV was well-tolerated and had a faster onset of action  offered higher pain relief  and provided the potential to reduce the use of opioids compared to ibuprofen IV or paracetamol IV alone in the same doses. Further exposure studies have demonstrated the drug‚Äôs efficacy and safety in an expanded population group over a longer treatment period. Maxigesic¬Æ IV is protected by several granted and pending patent applications.About Hyloris Pharmaceuticals SAHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimising existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors. Hyloris has built a broad  patented portfolio of 16 reformulated and repurposed value-added medicines that have the potential to offer significant advantages over available alternatives. Outside of its core strategic focus  the Company also has 3 high barrier generic products in development and registration phase. Two products are currently in initial phases of commercialisation with partners: Sotalol IV for the treatment of atrial fibrillation  and Maxigesic¬Æ IV  a non-opioid post-operative pain treatment. The Company‚Äôs development strategy primarily focuses on the FDA‚Äôs 505(b)2 regulatory pathway  which is specifically designed for pharmaceuticals for which safety and efficacy of the molecule have already been established. This pathway can reduce the clinical burden required to bring a product to market  and significantly shorten the development timelines and reduce costs and risks. Hyloris is based in Li√®ge  Belgium.

These are the first indications of upcoming deployments in low-carbon hydrogen as the market is getting more structured. The first grants under the Hydrogen PIIEC will foster the development of production capacities and will shortly be followed by a second wave of funding  which will fuel demand and the transition to larger-scale projects. Therefore  the launch of our Gigafactory project on the Belfort site in the second half of the year is a major strategic step forward. Indeed  it will allow us to lower the cost of our electrolyzers and increase their capacity in order to provide competitive low-carbon hydrogen very quickly. We are thus approaching 2023 with confidence in our ability to generate sustained growth and enthusiastic about the idea of building a first-rate industrial tool  which is an essential condition to remain at the forefront of the low-carbon hydrogen revolution‚Äù.Return to sustained growth in sales in 2022Revenue for the 2022 financial year is up 22% compared to 2021  to ‚Ç¨16.0 million. Restated for the takeover of two old generation stations sold during previous financial years (the amount of which was deducted from the revenue for the first half of the year)  revenue would amount to ‚Ç¨18.2 million compared with ‚Ç¨13.1 million in 2021  representing a growth of +39%. This return to growth primarily results from the materialization of the first orders under the major contracts signed over the past years. The revenue breakdown between the supply of electrolyzers of large capacity McLyzer and of Piel range (68%) and the supply of stations (32%).Commercial momentum strengthened by the signing of a landmark industrial contractIn the course of the first semester  McPhy signed a contract with a subsidiary of Eiffage to equip a site in Belfort with a 1 MW electrolyzer and a recharging station capable of distributing up to 800 kg/day to fuel a fleet of hydrogen buses. The Group also received two first orders in the framework of its strategic partnership with Hype to supply: (i) two alkaline electrolyzers with a capacity of 2 MW for the first and upgraded to 4 MW for the second  as well as (ii) two Dual Pressure stations with a capacity of 800 kg per day each to be installed in the Paris region. During the second half of the year  McPhy also finalized an 8-year maintenance contract with Siemens Energy. McPhy teams will manage the maintenance of the hydrogen production equipment on the CEOG project site.At the end of the year  the Group recorded a landmark order in the industrial sector with a joint venture controlled by one of the world's leading steel groups. The agreement includes the equipment of an innovative low-carbon steel production project at a plant in Germany  close to McPhy's design and engineering site in Wildau. The agreement  favoured by the geographical proximity  illustrates the relevance of the Group's European operating set-up. The agreement covers the supply of two McLyzer electrolyzers with a capacity of 1 MW each  as well as a Dual Pressure 350/700 bar station dedicated to the supply of forklift trucks and trailer trucks. It has also been agreed of a 5-year long-term services contract. The first deliveries of low-carbon steel should take place in the first half of 2024.Strong increase in order intake and backlogAll of these elements allow McPhy to record a +53% growth in firm order intake  which amounts to ‚Ç¨29.4 million  bringing the order backlog to ‚Ç¨31.3 million at December 31  2022  up +56% compared to December 31  2021.As of 31 December 2022  McPhy had a portfolio of projects signed  commissioned and/or under execution representing a total of 45 MW and 40 stations. The Group had furthermore been identified as a preferred partner and/or selected supplier for 148 MW and 56 stations  bringing its references to 193 MW and 96 stations.Acceleration of industrial scale-up with the launch of the Gigafactory projectThe eligibility of McPhy's electrolyzer Gigafactory project to the IPCEI scheme was approved by the European Commission in July  allowing the signing of a public aid contract with the French State represented by Bpifrance  for a maximum amount of ‚Ç¨114 million. On that basis  McPhy has officially made a final investment decision and received a first payment of ‚Ç¨28.5 million from Bpifrance. Work has already begun on the commissioning of the future plant on the Belfort site  with a launch scheduled for the first half of 2024  followed by a gradual ramp-up to reach an annual production capacity of 1 GW.Concurrently  McPhy continued its efforts to scale up the electrolyzer part of the business by increasing its production capacity to 300 MW on its San Miniato site  in order to meet market demand while awaiting for the commissioning of the Gigafactory.For the Stations part  McPhy has finalized the regrouping of all the activities of this business line on its new site in the heart of Grenoble in an existing industrial building of more than 4 000 sqm. This new site will have a production capacity of 150 units per year.Continuation of an active recruitment policyMcPhy has recruited 85 new employees (of which 66 on permanent contracts) in fiscal year 2022  demonstrating its ability to attract talent in a competitive market and in an industry where skills are crucial. The Group now accounts 205 employees and will keep up its active recruitment policy though at a slower pace.OutlookGiven the acceleration of development investments and the rise in the number of employees in the second half of the year  the Group estimates that its EBITDA will amount to ‚Ç¨-34 to ‚Ç¨-37 million for the fiscal year 2022. The Group's net cash position should therefore be around ‚Ç¨135 million  including the initial payment of ‚Ç¨28.5 million from Bpifrance as part of the launch of the Gigafactory.The level of its backlog and the continued ramp-up of the hydrogen market  allow McPhy to anticipate another year of sustained growth in 2023.Next financial communication:Publication of 2022 Results: March 7 2023  after market closeABOUT MCPHYSpecialized in hydrogen production and distribution equipment  McPhy is contributing to the global deployment of low-carbon hydrogen as a solution for energy transition.

Factoring in our 2022 bookings for new ARR and related services  in just one year  we have successfully become the equivalent of a SaaS player that is already expected to generate revenue of ‚Ç¨10 million+ in 2023. This success is mainly the result of an inflationary environment fostering the deployment of Order-to-Cash solutions worldwide  and our technological edge in Artificial Intelligence  combined with the fast and impressive ramp-up in our North American activities. We can now confirm that our offensive US expansion strategy  kick-started 18 months ago  is producing results. North America has already proven that it is a robust growth driver for Sidetrade  and this is just the beginning. Our commercial successes with global businesses in preference over our direct North American competitors confirms the positioning of Sidetrade  which in a matter of months  has grown into a leader of the Order-to-Cash market in the United States. Together  we are proud of what we have achieved. As such  I wish to commend our teams across the board for their commitment  talent and resilience. Against a highly volatile and uncertain background of increased redundancy and cost reduction plans within SaaS companies  Sidetrade‚Äôs original model to continue an offensive investment policy and support its growth while maintaining profitability will provide a key competitive advantage in the months ahead.‚ÄùAll-time record bookings in 2022 with more than ‚Ç¨10 million in Annual Contract Value  and ‚Ç¨6.44 million in ARR  up 36%Excellent Q4  in line with performance for 2022After setting a record for SaaS bookings in Q1 2022  Sidetrade delivered the best Q4 performance in its history with a profit of ‚Ç¨2.03 million in New Annual Recurring Revenue (‚Äúnew ARR‚Äù)  compared with ‚Ç¨1.67 million in Q4 2021; a +22% increase. The total value of these new subscription contracts over their initial contract periods (excluding renewals and services) represents ‚Ç¨6.88 million of Total Contract Value (‚ÄúTCV‚Äù) in Q4 2022 versus ‚Ç¨4.15 million in Q4 2021; a +66% increase.In Q4 2022  international orders represented 54% of all bookings  largely driven by North America (46% of total bookings).To these SaaS bookings should be added ‚Ç¨1.18 million of additional related services in Q4 2022 (implementation  configuration and training excluding recurring services) ‚Äì compared with ‚Ç¨0.81 million in Q4 2021  a +45% increase. As a reminder  almost all of these services will be invoiced within twelve months of their signing.In total  the Annual Contract Value (‚ÄúACV‚Äù) of these bookings in Q4 2022 was ‚Ç¨3.21 million compared with ‚Ç¨2.48 million in Q4 2021 (excluding recurring services); a +29% increase.Record bookings in 2022  with more than ‚Ç¨10 million in Annual Contract ValueIn 2022  Sidetrade generated ‚Ç¨6.44 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (‚ÄúARR‚Äù) compared to ‚Ç¨4.75 million in 2021; a +36% increase.Bookings linked to services (implementation  configuration and training  excluding recurring services) also achieved robust growth  up from ‚Ç¨2.81 million in 2021 to ‚Ç¨3.84 million in 2022; a +37% increase. In total  and considering that almost all of these services will be invoiced over the next twelve months(excluding recurring services which can be invoiced over several years)  the 2022 fiscal year enables Sidetrade to add the equivalent of ‚Ç¨10.28 million in Annual Contract Value (‚ÄúACV‚Äù) compared to ‚Ç¨7.56 million for fiscal 2021; a +36% increase.In addition to both record quarterly performances in 2022 (Q1 2022 is the all-time high for a quarter while Q4 2022 is the best Q4 in Sidetrade‚Äôs history)  the increase in bookings is based on a continuous solid upward trend on a half-yearly basis  as illustrated by the double-digit half-year sequential growth (+12.4%) on average.Sidetrade H1 2021(‚Ç¨m) H2 2021(‚Ç¨m) H1 2022(‚Ç¨m) H2 2022(‚Ç¨m) Averagehalf-yearsequentialchange New SaaS Subscriptions(ARR) 2.14 2.62 3.04 3.41 12.4%2022 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.North America has already exceeded expectations  becoming a robust growth driver with 51% of total bookings in 2022In 2022  international orders represented 66% of all bookings  driven largely by the multiple commercial successes in the United States.The first eighteen months of US business have seen Sidetrade‚Äôs North American bookings continue on a strong growth trajectory  already representing more than half the Group total (51%) on a full-year basis in 2022  which is significantly above the target set by Management of 33% by Q4 2022. Sidetrade‚Äôs commercial wins in preference over local competitors with major North American players such as DXC Technologies in Q1 2022 (see the press release issued on 02/21/2022)  Insights Enterprise in Q2 2022 (see the press release issued on 09/06/2022) and HPE  signed in Q4 2022  have already positioned the Group as one of the US‚Äôs go-to Order-to-Cash partners.On the one hand  this excellent commercial momentum demonstrates Sidetrade‚Äôs technological edge in Artificial Intelligence with recognition by Gartner¬Æ as one of three Leaders for Integrated Invoice-to-Cash Applications in its 2022 Magic Quadrant publication (see the press release issued on 04/11/2022). On the other  it recognizes Sidetrade‚Äôs boldness to invest substantially and methodically in an experienced Order-to-Cash salesforce which will continue its ramp-up in the quarters ahead.Sidetrade now has a workforce of close to 300 employees  with over 60% of its teams based outside of France  including 53 North American colleagues. Only eighteen months after its US operations were officially launched  Sidetrade has a salesforce that includes three experienced VP Sales Executives and 11 Enterprise Account Sales Managers all over the country  supported by three presales and a Chief Marketing Officer now located in the US. To ensure this salesforce is fully equipped to quickly penetrate the North American market in 2023  Sidetrade made additions by hiring a team of 11 sales lead generation experts on October 1  2022  who work from the Group‚Äôs North American Business Hub opened in Calgary  Canada (see the press release issued on 10/04/2022).Sidetrade(ARR) 2021(‚Ç¨m) 2022(‚Ç¨m) Average New SaaS Subscriptions 4.75 6.44 36% of which North America 1.04 3.27 214%2022 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.The total value of these new subscription contracts over their initial contract periods (excluding renewals and services) reached a peak of ‚Ç¨20.7 million of Total Contract Value (‚ÄúTCV‚Äù) for the first time in 2022 versus ‚Ç¨12.9 million in 2021  a dramatic increase of +60%. In particular  this surge is attributed to an extension of the initial contract period for new customers (excluding renewals)  up from 36.2 to 44.9 months  thereby increasing the economic model‚Äôs high predictability.Overall  in FY 2022  bookings by new customers (‚ÄúNew Business‚Äù) and Cross-selling represented 80% of the total versus 72% in FY 2021  with the remaining 20% of bookings accounting for Upselling of additional modules to existing customers compared to 28% in FY 2021.Lastly  attrition remains under control for enterprise accounts with a churn rate of 3.83% as of December 31  2022  which represents an excellent result for the SaaS industry  whose average was 14% according to the ‚Äú 2022 Private SaaS Company Survey Results ‚Äù by KeyBank Capital Markets.It should be noted that as with all existing contracts  the new contracts include an annual automatic price re-indexation clause based on changes in price indices for the relevant country.In an inflationary market environment  now more than ever  businesses must deploy efficient solutions to manage their Order-to-Cash process as they face a twofold challenge: to consolidate cash reserves with multiple hikes in interest rates  while generating productivity gains to address salary increases and recruitment difficulties.This trend is expected to continue over the next 12 to 18 months with an additional increased risk of future recession in certain countries. In this disrupted context  the management of operating working capital  and particularly accounts receivable  is a major challenge for all finance departments.Strong increase in Order-to-Cash SaaS revenue: +22%Revenue driven by international orders  up +13%Sidetrade Q42022(‚Ç¨m) Q42021(‚Ç¨m) Change 2022(‚Ç¨m) 2021(‚Ç¨m) Change ‚ÄòOrder-to-Cash‚Äô Activities 9.5 7.9 +21% 35.9 30.3 +18% of which SaaS Subscriptions 8.1 6.4 +25% 30.1 24.7 +22% ‚ÄòSales & Marketing‚Äô Activities 0.2 0.4 -44% 0.9 2.3 -61% Revenue 9.7 8.3 +17% 36.8 32.6 +13%2022 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.Sidetrade capped off 2022 with outstanding growth and a record fourth-quarter performance  reflecting a year full of successes as well as an important step taken in its development.Q4 2022 ‚ÄòOrder-to-Cash‚Äô Activities totaled ‚Ç¨9.5 million  up 21% on the same period in 2021 and driven by sharp growth in SaaS subscriptions (+25%) compared with Q4 2021.On a full-year basis  ‚ÄòOrder-to-Cash‚Äô Activities for 2022 increased by 18%  thanks to strong growth in SaaS subscriptions (+22%). The increase in this recurring revenue is the result of record bookings in the 2021 fiscal year and early fiscal 2022  which continued to impact revenue growth throughout the 2022 fiscal year.‚ÄòOrder-to-Cash‚Äô Activities  a core business within the Company‚Äôs strategy since 2019  represented 98% of total revenue in 2022.The ‚ÄòSales & Marketing‚Äô Activities  which are no longer part of the Company‚Äôs strategy  now account for only 2% of total revenue in 2022  and will continue to decline  with estimated revenue of ‚Ç¨0.5 million at end-2023. While the decline in revenue for these Activities impacted growth by 4% in 2022  it will automatically have considerably less impact in 2023.Total revenue grew further by +13% in FY 2022  to ‚Ç¨36.8 million. This performance is underpinned by vigorous growth in international markets which  for the first time in the Group‚Äôs history  represent 54% of total revenue  including 24% for North America.Sidetrade‚Äôs economic model provides its business with significant resilience  as 90% of its revenue is recurring  representing a significant advantage in the current and future international environment.All multi-year contracts are indexed to inflation (the Syntec for Southern Europe  the UK CPI for Northern Europe and the US CPI for the United States)  which alters the total price of SaaS subscriptions each year by reference to changes in these price indices.Sidetrade therefore has robust pricing power that protects the Company‚Äôs future revenue against uncertainties and inflationary pressures. At present  Sidetrade perfectly combines its sound fundamentals with a highly favorable growth outlook.In respect of fiscal 2022  the impact of exchange rates on the Company was not material.Next financial announcement2022 Annual Results: April 4  2023  after the stock market closes.Investor relationsChristelle Dhrif +33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comMedia relationsBecca Parlby +44 7824 505 584 bparlby@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.

However  the importance of tokenisation for Europe  i.e. the transfer of real assets (digital or otherwise) to the blockchain  is generally underestimated.In the context of this report  a token represents an asset in a digital form combined with information and assignable digital rights. The token is a reference (i.e. identifier) that maps back to sensitive data through a tokenisation system and can represent either tangible physical assets or intangible assets that themselves only exist in digital form.How can tokenisation change our lives?Thanks to the breakthrough of distributed ledger (e.g. blockchain) technology  tokenisation has spread in many areas and can cover lots of use cases like paying with a digital car wallet  stable coins or future digital Euro  creating digital twin and Digital ID  securing M2M communication.Simple regulatory framework and more digital know-how can boost innovationWorldline and peer field experts are collaborating to create an interoperable trusted layer to enable all the truly digitised and automated services we have been expecting  allowing Europe to master its services and ideally lead the industry forward.Thanks to its long technological experience and expertise in transaction and payment management  including complex  security and regulatory constraints  Worldline is ideally placed to support industry players  banks  public institutions  transport operators and others  unleashing for them the token economy  thereby improving the transparency  safety and efficiency of all their transactions.Europe must succeed in fully exploiting the potential of tokenisation in the coming years. Introducing a token economy to financial markets would lead to greater efficiency  increased security and trust  while significantly reducing cost and complexity.,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,positive,0.9,0.09,0.0,True,English,"['Tokenise Europe 2025 report', 'Worldline', 'peer field experts', 'interoperable trusted layer', 'long technological experience', 'The European Commission', 'Simple regulatory framework', 'assignable digital rights', 'digital car wallet', 'future digital Euro', 'tangible physical assets', 'digital business models', 'successful token economy', 'European competitiveness', 'regulatory constraints', 'digital form', 'digital twin', 'Digital ID', 'digital know-how', 'real assets', 'intangible assets', 'global leader', 'management consultancy', 'Roland Berger', '20 member organisations', 'Key findings', 'Worldine perspective', 'many industries', 'sensitive data', 'distributed ledger', 'many areas', 'use cases', 'stable coins', 'M2M communication', 'payment management', 'public institutions', 'transport operators', 'coming years', 'financial markets', 'payment services', 'new services', 'automated services', 'German Banks', 'complex, security', 'industry players', 'greater efficiency', 'tokenisation system', 'Source', 'Worldline', 'Euronext', 'WLN', 'compilation', 'report', 'Initiative', 'Association', 'importance', 'support', 'participation', 'France', 'Germany', 'Portugal', 'Italy', 'Liechtenstein', 'Sweden', 'Spain', 'potential', 'transfer', 'blockchain', 'context', 'information', 'reference', 'lives', 'breakthrough', 'technology', 'lots', 'innovation', 'digitised', 'expertise', 'transaction', 'others', 'transparency', 'safety', 'cost', 'complexity']",2023-01-24,2023-01-24,finextra.com

First one  the health restrictions linked to the Covid-19 epidemic  and mainly the vaccination pass  until mid-March 2022  penalized the Group. The second  the total lifting of these allowed the Group to regain a very satisfactory dynamism.The +81.8% increase in Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) compared to the 2021 financial year is the direct consequence of the closure of the Group's establishments in France and abroad for just over half of 2021. And this  despite the departure from the scope of consolidation of the Ostend casino at the end of July 2021 (and correlatively of its very dynamic online gaming and related sports betting activities) and the sale of shares in the Crans-Montana casino on 31st January  2022.Thus  the GGR increased over the financial year to reach ‚Ç¨ 636.7 M  compared to ‚Ç¨ 350.2 M in 2021. It benefited from the growth in the GGR of slot machines (+122.6%) and the GGR of traditional games (+8.9%)  the latter increasing in particular by +158.9% in France.The Net Gaming Revenue (NGR) is generally on the rise reaching ‚Ç¨ 305.5 M.At the same time  the turnover excluding NGR rose by ‚Ç¨ 44.9 M to ‚Ç¨ 86.1 M.The consolidated 2022 turnover increased by +52.0% reaching ‚Ç¨ 388.8 M.Return to a good financial performanceThe very good operational performance allows to generate an EBITDA (IFRS 16) of ‚Ç¨ 75.6 M over the period (compared to ‚Ç¨ 13.0 M in 2021). The EBITDA margin on revenue was 19.4%  an improvement of 14.3 points compared to 2021.Story continuesThe current operating income (COI) became positive again reaching ‚Ç¨ 23.1 M  thanks to the reopening of all the sites over the whole financial year  and mainly the casinos division.Purchases & External expenses are down by ‚Ç¨ 9.1 M  impacted mainly by:the downward trend in subcontracting expenses (-‚Ç¨ 48.7 M)  mainly linked to the absence of expenses related to the operation of online licenses in Belgium in 2022 (-‚Ç¨ 53.8 M of expenses)  following the cessation of activity in July 2021 (online casino and sports betting);in the opposite direction  there is an increase in subcontracting costs (security  cleaning) in the other establishments  given the reopening of the establishments (+‚Ç¨ 3.9 M);purchases of materials  advertising/marketing costs  upkeep and maintenance costs up respectively +‚Ç¨ 17.2 M (+82.9%)  +‚Ç¨ 11.8 M (+128.4 %) and +‚Ç¨ 2.5 M (+33.3%) directly linked to the reopening of establishments and the increase in turnover from ancillary activities;the increase in fees  advertising costs and subcontracting costs relating to the deployment of online games in Switzerland (+‚Ç¨ 0.7 M  +‚Ç¨ 2.5 M and +‚Ç¨ 0.4 M respectively).Taxes & duties increased from ‚Ç¨ 10.9 M in 2021 to ‚Ç¨ 17.3 M in 2022  i.e. + 58.7 % due to the resumption of the activity.Employees expenses reached ‚Ç¨ 168.0 M  up by ‚Ç¨ 63.8 M (+61.2 %)  i.e. a more normative level after two years of the business support measures put in place by the government in order to face the health crisis  in particular the use of the partial activity scheme from which the Group benefited. In addition  profit sharing paid to employees increased by +‚Ç¨ 4.1 M.The change in amortization and depreciation of fixed assets  down -8.3% to ‚Ç¨ 51.5 M  reflects scope effects and the slowdown in the investment policy usually sustained in recent years  but hampered by the health crisis.The item ‚ÄúOther current operating income and expenses‚Äù represents a net expense of ‚Ç¨ 6.9 M  compared to a net income of ‚Ç¨ 0.2 M over the previous financial year  additional ""closure"" aid amounting to ‚Ç¨ 4.9 M obtained from the government over the financial year in order to fight the consequences of the health crisis  being less than the ""fixed cost aid"" obtained in 2021 in the amount of ‚Ç¨ 10.0 M. In addition  expenses related to casino specifications are up (+‚Ç¨ 4.1 M in expenses)  correlatively to the GGR. Conversely  we note a favorable trend in changes in provisions.The non-current operating income is an income of + ‚Ç¨ 17.6 M compared to + ‚Ç¨ 0.9 M in 2021 which is explained by:the settlement of disputes with the ONSS (disputes with the Belgian social security regarding increases in social security contributions wrongly imposed on casinos during previous years) generating a non-recurring profit of ‚Ç¨ 3.4 M compared to ‚Ç¨ 11.8 M in N-1 on the one hand  and the compensation of ‚Ç¨ 9.5 M for the cessation of activity obtained from our former online partner in Belgium in N-1 on the other hand;a result on the sale of consolidated investments of ‚Ç¨ 14.1 M following the disposal of the entire 57% stake held by Groupe Partouche in the Crans-Montana casino;the absence of impairment of goodwill for the 2022 financial year  compared to an amount of ‚Ç¨ 18.5 M in 2021  reflecting the evolution of the health crisis.Consequently  the operating income reached ‚Ç¨ 40.7 M over the year compared to a loss of ‚Ç¨ 45.5 M in 2021.Finally  Groupe Partouche makes a profit of ‚Ç¨ 37.1 M (of which ‚Ç¨ 34.2 M Group‚Äôs share)  compared to - ‚Ç¨ 55.9 M in 2021 after taking into consideration the following elements:a financial income of -‚Ç¨ 2.3 M (compared to -‚Ç¨ 3.8 M in 2021). Due to the reopening of casinos on both sides of the Franco-Swiss border and the rise in the Swiss Franc over the 2022 financial year  foreign exchange gains recorded an increase of ‚Ç¨ 1.5 M compared to the previous year. In addition  the cost of financial debt is stable despite the sharp drop in the Group's gross debt due to the rise in the average annual interest rate;a significant decrease in tax expenses (CVAE included) (- ‚Ç¨ 1.2 M compared to - ‚Ç¨ 6.6 M in 2021).A solid financial structureBalance sheet assets amounted to ‚Ç¨ 798.3 M  up ‚Ç¨ 2.0 M. The main variations are as follows:increase in the ‚Äútangible fixed assets‚Äù item for ‚Ç¨ 56.6 M resulting in particular from IFRS 16 restatements of new real estate lease contracts linked to renewals of public service delegations (DSP);conversely  the drop in the ""Trade & other receivables"" item due  on the one hand  to the settlement of residual receivables relating to the Belgian online activity and its shutdown in July 2021 and  on the other hand  the presence at 31 st October 2021 of a receivable of ‚Ç¨ 5.5 M related to the compensation to be received from the City Hall of Saint-Amand-les-Eaux following the return of the casino property to the municipality within the framework of the renewal of the DSP (debt collected in 2022);the decrease in the cash flow (- ‚Ç¨ 11.9 M) correlated with the repayment of the second State Guaranteed Loan in the amount of ‚Ç¨ 59.5 M  mitigated by the income from the sale by Groupe Partouche of Crans-Montana casino and the good dynamism of the activity following the lifting of all health restrictions.On the liabilities side  the Group's equity  including minority interests  rose by ‚Ç¨ 38.6 M to ‚Ç¨ 354.0 M.At 31st October 2022  the financial debt decreased by ‚Ç¨ 9.7 M  totalling ‚Ç¨ 277.7 M under the combined effects of the following elements:The reimbursement of the second State Guaranteed Loan up to ‚Ç¨ 59.5 M as well as other banks loans for ‚Ç¨13.6M;The settlement of four quarterly installments of the syndicated loan for ‚Ç¨ 10.8 M;the setting up of new loans for ‚Ç¨ 21.6 M;the net impact of the restatement of rental contracts according to IFRS 16 for ‚Ç¨ 51.9 M (increasing in particular  in the subscriptions of new real estate contracts found as an increase in non-current assets  and a reduction in the payment of lease instalments practice).Net financial debt amounted to ‚Ç¨ 46.3 M (down by ‚Ç¨ 40.7 M). The Group's financial structure is improving and becoming extremely sound again  with leverage ratios (Net debt / EBITDA) and gearing ratios (Net debt / Equity) respectively at 0.7x (compared to 2.3x in N-21) and 0.1x (against 0.3x a year earlier for the latter).Confidence in the prospectsContinuation of the investment programme on the existing establishmentsAfter two years of the pandemic and the pause in investments  the Group is continuing to relaunch its program started in the previous financial year in order to enrich its offer and renovate its casinos network aiming at improving its performance  thus:extensive work is underway at the Annemasse casino and will in particular allow the opening of the left wing  the construction of an extension at the front of the building and the creation of two outdoor rooms;Le Lyon Vert casino in La Tour-de-Salvagny is undertaking a major restructuring of the existing spaces and the creation of a major extension on two levels (ground floor and 1 st floor);the Pasino at Saint-Amand-les-Eaux is undertaking major works to become one of the largest establishments in France  eventually offering a ""food-court"" restaurant open to all and a completely redesigned performance hall. Outside the concession and in the immediate vicinity of the casino  the hotel overlooking the new forecourt will have increased logging capacity. In addition  the creation of a room for immersive digital experiences will allow the organization of multiple permanent or ephemeral events and exhibitions;other sites redevelopments will be initiated in the 2023 financial year in the casinos of Vichy  Divonne  Contrex√©ville  Middelkerke as well as in the 3.14 hotel in Cannes.Bolstered by the results obtained since the lifting of health restrictions and thanks to the relevance of its innovative products offering strategy  Groupe Partouche is confident about its prospects. The Group is continuing the investment program aimed at strengthening the activity of its establishments while maintaining a healthy and solid financial situation.Upcoming events:- Turnover 1st quarter (Nov. 2022-Jan. 2023): Tuesday 14th March 2023 (after stock market closure)- General Meeting: Wednesday 22nd March 2023Groupe Partouche was established in 1973 and has grown to become one of the market leaders in Europe in its business sector.

All the operating expenses increased by +‚Ç¨ 76.2 M and notably include an increase in employees expenses (+‚Ç¨ 54.5 M  i.e. +64.3%) due to the end of the partial activity of most of the Group's employees which had prevailed during the closures of operations in the 2021 financial year. Conversely  amortization and depreciation of fixed assets fell by ‚Ç¨ 5.4 M  reflecting the slowdown of the renovation program for the casino network in the previous years  due to the health crisis.The hotel sector's COI  which became positive again  benefited on the one hand from the recovery of activity linked to the end of the restrictions introduced to deal with the Covid health crisis and on the other hand from a favourable effect linked to the restructuring of certain divisions  and thus increased by +‚Ç¨ 2.5 M to reach ‚Ç¨0.3M.Finally  the COI of the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù sector is deteriorating; it totals -‚Ç¨ 6.9 M over the financial year  compared to -5.6M for the previous year.

This new line card is the first coherent module from Ekinops based on 400G pluggable line interfaces  offering lower cost  lower power coherent solutions than what is offered by high-performance embedded optics.Pluggable 400G Comes to Ekinops (PRNewsfoto/Ekinops)Since their debut in 2021  pluggable 400G transceivers have been quickly adapted for use in communications networks. Though initially designed for short reach data center connectivity  newer versions with higher optical launch powers are now being deployed in broader applications including metro and regional service provider transport networks. According to market research firm Cignal AI  these transceivers will represent more than 20% of all 100G+ telecom bandwidth deployed in 2022  growing to 30% by 2024. ""400G pluggable optics are revolutionizing the optical communications market by creating more flexible high-performance networks at lower cost for both data center and traditional telco operators "" said Scott Wilkinson  Lead Analyst for Optical Components at Cignal AI. ""This performance and cost savings provide a compelling case for all network operators to consider pluggable coherent optics-based network designs  and deployments based on these modules will lead coherent bandwidth growth in optical networking for the next several years.""The PM_400FR05-C2A provides multiple client options capable of supporting either 100GbE or OTU4 as well as 400GbE connectivity. The line interface is programmable from 100G to 400G. As a standards-based solution  the PM_400FR05-C2A is fully interoperable with other third-party compliant interfaces making it easy and inexpensive for service providers to interconnect switch/router ports. While most pluggable 400G optics are limited to point-to-point connectivity  the PM_400FR05-C2A is also deployable on meshed optical networks with multi-point connectivity  a key differentiator that significantly expands the scope of potential applications.Story continues""As a line card-based solution  the PM_400 FR05-C2A provides a strict demarcation point between not only service provider and customer networks but also the packet and optical networks so that it fits seamlessly into the service providers' operational model "" said Guillaume Crenn  Product Line and Marketing Director at Ekinops. ""Because most switches and routers out there today cannot support a 400G transceiver directly  Ekinops' approach saves customers from having to upgrade their packet infrastructure."" Compatible with all existing Ekinops chassis  Ekinops customers can not only avoid the cost of upgrading routers but also avoid adding new transport infrastructure while still taking advantage of the small size  low power and low cost of pluggable solutions without sacrificing performance.Another differentiator is the availability of an optional Ekinops proprietary enhanced performance mode that extends the reach of the line output more than 20% compared to standardized modes of performance. Advanced transmission technology developed by Ekinops provides a cleaner transmission signal that can eliminate the need for additional amplifiers and regeneration points to further lower overall network cost.The PM_400FR05-C2A is already attracting customer interest. It is currently in lab trials with general availability beginning in the first quarter of 2023.For more information about the Ekinops portfolio  please visit https://www.ekinops.com/products-services/productsAll press releases are published after the close of trading on Euronext Paris.EKINOPS ContactDidier Br√©dyChairman and CEOcontact@ekinops.comInvestorsMathieu OmnesInvestor relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 92momnes@actus.frPressAmaury DugastPress relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 74adugast@actus.frPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1989077/Ekinops_Pluggable_400G.jpgLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/814911/Ekinops_Logo.jpgEkinops Logo (PRNewsfoto/Ekinops)CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ekinops-announces-availability-of-new-cfp2-based-400g-transport-solution-301729579.htmlSOURCE Ekinops",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.54,0.34,0.13,True,English,"['New CFP2-based 400G Transport Solution', 'Ekinops', 'Availability', 'optional Ekinops proprietary enhanced performance mode', 'Ekinops360 WDM optical transport system', 'pluggable coherent optics-based network designs', 'regional service provider transport networks', 'short reach data center connectivity', 'other third-party compliant interfaces', 'higher optical launch powers', 'small size, low power', ""service providers' operational model"", 'lower power coherent solutions', 'lower overall network cost', '400G pluggable line interfaces', 'new PM_400FR05-C2A pluggable module', 'optical transport systems', 'new transport infrastructure', 'first coherent module', 'coherent bandwidth growth', 'access network solutions', 'new line card', 'high-performance embedded optics', 'market research firm', '100G+ telecom bandwidth', 'next several years', 'multiple client options', 'Advanced transmission technology', 'cleaner transmission signal', 'Didier Br√©dy', 'flexible high-performance networks', 'meshed optical networks', '400G pluggable optics', 'pluggable 400G optics', 'optical communications market', 'traditional telco operators', 'strict demarcation point', 'line card-based solution', 'existing Ekinops chassis', 'pluggable 400G transceivers', 'pluggable solutions', 'network operators', 'lower cost', 'communications networks', 'point connectivity', 'low cost', 'Optical Components', 'optical networking', 'customer networks', '400GbE connectivity', 'Product Line', 'line output', 'standards-based solution', 'first quarter', 'cost savings', 'leading supplier', 'newer versions', 'broader applications', 'Cignal AI', 'Scott Wilkinson', 'Lead Analyst', 'compelling case', 'The PM_400FR05-C2A', 'router ports', 'potential applications', 'PM_400 FR05-C2A', 'Guillaume Crenn', 'Marketing Director', 'most switches', 'packet infrastructure', 'standardized modes', 'additional amplifiers', 'regeneration points', 'customer interest', 'lab trials', 'Mathieu Omnes', 'Investor relation', 'Amaury Dugast', 'original content', ""Ekinops' approach"", 'Ekinops portfolio', 'EKINOPS Contact', 'SOURCE Ekinops', 'Euronext Paris', 'press releases', 'Press relation', 'key differentiator', 'Ekinops customers', 'Ekinops Logo', 'general availability', 'Jan.', 'PRNewswire', 'PRNewsfoto', 'debut', 'use', 'metro', 'deployments', 'modules', '100GbE', 'OTU4', 'scope', 'Story', 'routers', 'advantage', 'need', 'information', 'products', 'close', 'trading', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'Investors', 'Tel.', 'momnes', 'actus', 'Photo', 'Ekinops_Pluggable_400G', 'Ekinops_Logo', 'Cision', 'multimedia', 'news-releases', 'new-cfp2-based-400g-transport-solution', '2024', '33', '1 53']",2023-01-24,2023-01-24,au.news.yahoo.com

The year 2022 also marks an important milestone for the global microbiome industry with the regulatory approvals of the first microbiome-based drugs by the FDA in the U.S. and by the TGA in Australia "" stated Herv√© Affagard  CEO and co-founder of MaaT Pharma. ""Despite difficult market conditions  we continue to advance our pioneering science and technology and we remain focused on delivering new therapeutic solutions to the benefit of patients with severe conditions as well as building value for our shareholders. 2023 will be a year with important inflection points and will require us to act decisively to reach our objectives. We thank our investors for their support throughout this year  and their confidence in our ability to achieve the next level of corporate development.""Clinical developmentHemato-oncologyMaaT013  a full-ecosystem  standardized  pooled-donor native Microbiome Ecosystem Therapy for acute  hospital use (enema administration)MaaT013 for the treatment of acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (aGvHD): MaaT013 has received an Orphan Drug Designation by both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medical Agency (EMA).MaaT013 is currently being evaluated in Europe in an ongoing international multicenter open-label  single arm  pivotal Phase 3 trial (ARES) in 75 patients with steroid-resistant gastrointestinal aGvHD. The Company has received full regulatory approvals in the following countries  which is more than initially envisioned: Austria  Belgium  France  Germany  Italy  and Spain. A safety and efficacy data review will be conducted by an independent data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) after enrollment of half of the patients in the study. The review is expected in the first half of 2023 and the Company will communicate the DSMB's recommendations following the review.The initiation of clinical trials following the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for MaaT013 in the United States (U.S.) will depend on the outcome of ongoing exchanges with the FDA in response to the August 2022 continued clinical hold letter. The most recent communication received by the Company from the FDA stated that the complete response provided by the Company in response to the letter received in August 2022  was still under review. Feedback could be expected in the early part of 2023 and the Company will update investors accordingly. The Company understands that the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) that currently hosts all microbiome-based drug candidates  continues to prioritize their work to advance the nation's response to the COVID-19 public health emergency  which is creating additional delays. Despite this  the Company remains focused on achieving regulatory approval for MaaT013 in the U.S. and providing a therapeutic solution for patients in the country.MaaT013 has already been successfully evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with steroid-resistant grade III-IV gastro-intestinal (GI) aGvHD (HERACLES) as well as in an ongoing compassionate use program (EAP) in France in patients with Grade II-IV GI-aGvHD having failed previous therapies  with promising results presented at the 2022 American Society of Hematology (ASH) conference in an oral presentation and in a poster at the 2022 edition of the International Human Microbiome Consortium (IHMC). The compelling data demonstrates that the pooled microbiota product is well tolerated and shows a good safety profile in a fragile patient population. Efficacy of MaaT013 correlates with engraftment of the product's microbial species in the gut and clinical response to MaaT013 translates to increased overall survival in patients with aGvHD.MaaT033  a donor-derived  standardized  high-richness  high-diversity Microbiome Ecosystem Therapy for oral administration  currently being developed as an adjunctive and maintenance therapy to improve overall survival in patients receiving HSCT1.MaaT033 for the improved survival of patients with hematological malignancies receiving allo-HSCTBased on promising results following the Phase 1b trial presented at the 2022 edition of the ASH annual meeting  and learnings from this study  along with an in-depth review of the Protocol Assistance with the EMA  and discussions with potential partners showing an interest in the license and commercialization of MaaT033 in this therapeutic area  the Company has optimized and adjusted the protocol for the Phase 2b trial of MaaT033 (PHOEBUS). In this context and given the strategic importance of the trial  the Company has decided to take over the sponsorship of the clinical trial in Europe. At the time of the IPO  it was anticipated that AP-HP2 would sponsor the trial in France as an Investigator-sponsored trial. The study is expected to start in Q2 2023 and would now be conducted in Europe in accordance with EMA recommendations. The number of patients enrolled in the study would expand from 341 to 387 and the number of sites would be increased from 20 to 56  enabling the recruitment period to be reduced from 36 to 24 months.While the primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of MaaT033 in improving overall survival at 12 months  secondary endpoints would include the evaluation of safety and tolerability before and after allo-HSCT  and the evaluation of the engraftment of beneficial microbial species from MaaT033 and the activity in preventing allo-HSCT complications (infections  GvHD).Additional readouts have been included throughout the 24-month recruitment period  such as interim safety analysis with stopping rules 3 when the trial has enrolled and randomized  respectively  60 and 120 patients.when the trial has enrolled and randomized  respectively  60 and 120 patients. The expected timelines including the overall survival endpoint (data to be expected in H1 2026) announced by MaaT Pharma during the IPO should be confirmed based on the adjustments mentioned above.In parallel to starting the trial in Europe  the Company plans to discuss this program with the FDA upon conclusion of ongoing dialogues with the Agency regarding its pooling technology.Immuno-oncology ? Clinical and nonclinical programsMaaT013 for the improvement of patients' response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI) ?proof of concept Phase 2a clinical trial sponsored by AP-HPThe proof-of-concept double blind randomized Phase 2a clinical trial  PICASSO (n=60)  initiated in April 2022  evaluating MaaT013's impact on the efficacy of ICI treatments (ipilimumab + nivolumab) in patients with metastatic melanoma  remains on track as planned.This trial is an Investigator-sponsored trial by AP-HP  where MaaT Pharma supplies drug candidates and performs the microbiome profiling of patients using its proprietary gutPrint¬Æ platform.Key study endpoints after 23 weeks of treatment include MaaT013's safety profile and best-overall response rate vs placebo as an add-on treatment to ipilimumab + nivolumab.placebo as an add-on treatment to ipilimumab + nivolumab. The Company is expected to receive biological biomarker data in H1 2023 after half of the patients have been enrolled and achieved their evaluation 9 weeks after randomization.Results are expected in H2 2024  as planned.MaaT03x  a new generation high richness  co-cultured  designed Microbiome Ecosystem TherapyTM in oral formulation for the increase in the response rate to ICI in patients with solid tumors - currently in preclinical testing.As MaaT03x is expected to be used in large markets  MaaT Pharma has been focused on increasing the level of readiness and decided to enter a Phase 1b trial in Europe and the U.S. in the first half of 2024  as opposed to the second half of 2023 as initially announced. This is a result of changes and adjustments following announcements of first regulatory approvals for microbiome-based products and the Company's work for the development of its native products (MaaT013 & MaaT033) in Europe. MaaT Pharma is consolidating in vivo/in vitro data  continuing product development characterization and conducting regulatory readiness of MaaT03x. Preclinical data are expected to be shared at scientific conferences in 2023.MaaT Pharma has initiated early interactions with the EMA in 2022 including a meeting with the EMA's Innovation Task Force (ITF). Further interactions in Europe are expected to take place in 2023. The Company is also planning early interactions with the FDA in H1 2023 to present its MaaT03x platform and has already filed a meeting request.The Company will be able to strengthen its intellectual property (IP) portfolio in France and internationally thanks to the co-cultured new generation products. Currently  the Company holds the IP for 14 patent families.Therapeutic pipeline extensionRecent studies have highlighted the importance of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and the impact of the gut microbiome in brain diseases. Interestingly  patients with neurodegenerative disorders display both central nervous system (CNS) and gastrointestinal symptoms4. In parallel  scientific research has started to shed light on the role of the gut microbiome  linking abnormalities to diseases such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS5). The link between gut microbiota and ALS first emerged from preclinical evidence and then from clinical observations indicating a disease-modifying role for the gut microbiome. To date  there is no effective treatment for ALS  a disease that leads to death within an average of 3-5 years after diagnosis6. ALS affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord causing loss of muscle control. Since its inception  MaaT Pharma has been committed to restoring a microbial symbiosis in life-threatening diseases with high unmet clinical needs. Growing evidence suggests that ALS patients show increased inflammation in the gut with changes in the composition of gut microbes and low levels of beneficial bacteria.MaaT Pharma has decided to extend its scientific research to the management of ALS  which could pave the way for the treatment of several neurodegenerative diseases. The Company is leveraging the strong safety profile of its native MET products (MaaT033/MaaT013) and their inherent product characteristics of promoting immune modulation/anti-inflammatory properties and acting as a homeostasis hub. The number of ALS cases is expected to increase substantially in the developing world over the next 25 years and could reach a total of 60 000 patients in U.S. and Europe by 20407. Every year  5 000 new patients are diagnosed in the U.S. and in Europe and the incidence of ALS ranges from 3 to 4 per 100 000 person-years7.Leveraging 12 months of feasibility assessment in MaaT Pharma's Discovery team  the Company expects to initiate in H1 2023 a Phase 1b pilot study in ALS evaluating MaaT033 to slow down disease progression. The study  developed with experts from the ALS network (FILSLAN and ACT4ALS-MND) and strongly supported by the French patient association (Tous en Selles contre la SLA)  will enroll up to 15 patients presenting initial motor deficit i.e.  at least 6 months up to 24 months at the time of the screening. This pipeline expansion to a new indication demonstrates the strong potential of MaaT033 to be used in an acute or chronic setting as a standalone  adjunctive and maintenance therapy. Data readout from the pilot study is expected for the first half of 2024.If this initial trial is successful  the Company could extend further to other chronic diseases/ immuno-inflammatory diseases as MaaT Pharma collects data and strengthens in-depth understanding of the mechanism of action. Funding for the trial is already secured and the program has been designed to minimize the risk and not impact the Company's lead programs in oncology. The key study endpoints are assessment of safety and tolerability of multiple doses of MaaT033  the assessment of gut microbiota composition evolution and the identification of biomarkers sensitive to treatment before considering a larger randomized controlled efficacy study.cGMP manufacturing facilitiesMaaT Pharma is currently building its future manufacturing facilities  in partnership with Skyepharma. The 1600m2 facility will be able to support the needs of clinical and commercial production of its native MET (MaaT013 & MaaT033)  R&D and clinical batches of cultured products  MaaT03x  up to 2034.Funding is secured and the completion of the facility is expected in mid-2023. Under the terms of the partnership agreement  MaaT Pharma will retain the know-how of its bio-manufacturing processes and agility (full command end-to-end manufacturing processes)  while leveraging Skyepharma's experience in running a cGMP facility. Having this facility is a strong competitive advantage for a late-stage company preparing for commercial phase  which MaaT Pharma believes will facilitate potential commercial partnerships. The site will be the first in France  and the largest specialized manufacturing facility for full ecosystem microbiome therapies in Europe to date. The facility will also increase potential synergies within the microbiome industry and contribute to structuring the production of microbiome-based drugs. It will provide a fully integrated manufacturing and development platform that will allow quick and efficient product development  scale-up and GMP processes.Financing plans & update on cash runwayFollowing an in-depth review of its ongoing programs  in particular the deferral of the clinical study of MaaT03x from 2023 to 2024 and savings on discretionary spending  the Company has optimized and prioritized its operations  extending its cash runway to end of Q4 2023  as compared to end of Q3 2023 as previously announced. The Company is also evaluating options that will finance operations and bring its late-stage products close to commercial launch. The focus is on both dilutive and non-dilutive financing  including business deals. The Company is confident in the continuing and longstanding support of its historical investors.The Company has updated its corporate presentation  which can be download here: https://www.maatpharma.com/investors/About MaaT PharmaMaaT Pharma  a clinical stage biotechnology company  has established a complete approach to restoring patient-microbiome symbiosis in oncology.

By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world‚Äôs first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world‚Äôs first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Story continuesLocated at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ (ALDEI ‚Äì code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010.
