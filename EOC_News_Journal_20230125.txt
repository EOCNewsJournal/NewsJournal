16995,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://www.cityam.com/how-blockchains-are-being-used-by-asset-managers/,How blockchains are being used by asset managers,Jonny Fry delves into the world of asset management and how blockchains can create multiple opportunities for investors.The post How blockchains are being used by asset managers appeared first on CityAM.,How blockchains are being used by asset managersThe extreme volatility of cryptocurrencies has long been a major concern. Investors‚Äô nervousness has risen in recent times as the future of digital currencies remains uncertain all the while the crypto crash lingers on.However  the technology behind cryptocurrencies  blockchain and (more importantly) other digital assets is gathering greater adoption by regulated financial institutions around the world. Digital ledger technology (DLT) ‚Äì the umbrella term under which blockchain also functions ‚Äì has gained visibility and is now being developed for several applications. The financial system  having switched to electronic trading a few decades ago  is set to witness another significant transformation through the use of DLT.The fund industry has undoubtedly seen massive growth in terms of the number of funds and total assets under management in the last decade. Despite this  fund houses still rely on long complex chains of distribution which make building investor relationships and controlling distribution costs difficult.However  the industry has seen the light  acknowledging the transformative potential of blockchain technology in the sector since it enables digitisation and tokenisation of funds whereby helping to reduce inefficiencies in fund distribution.Asset managers using blockchainsSource: YouTubeThe YouTube link above is an example of how Vanguard  the second biggest asset manager in the world (with $8trillion undermanagement)  is using blockchain technology. Warren Pennington  from Vanguard  explains how blockchain technology is being used to help manage its vast array of index funds: ‚Äú‚Ä¶blockchain at its core is a supercomputer that we can all use at the same time allowing many parties to all be connected in real time.‚ÄùBlockchains can certainly create opportunities for both asset management firms and investors. Whilst asset managers can go to investors and expand their distribution networks  investors can now also subscribe to a native digital or tokenised asset via an online distributed ledger. The fund tokens can then be held in digital wallets that are owned and operated by the investor  thus moving the industry closer to a self-service style model.Oliver Portenseigne  CEO of FundsDLT (established in 2016 and owned by Clearstream  Credit Suisse Asset Management  the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and Natixis Investment Managers)  believes: ‚ÄúThe immediate result of greater blockchain adoption in wealth and asset management is simply cheaper  easier and faster services. Financial inclusion is therefore improved as this will attract larger numbers of potential clients to wealth managers  who before may have been perceived as out of reach‚Äù.Furthermore  blockchains offer the potential to reduce transaction costs  provide automation and real-time visibility  and enhance reporting. They will also streamline AML/ KYC processes because tokens‚Äô ownership can be linked to the digital identity of the investor  therefore building proof of beneficial ownership with AML/KYC controls incorporated into the smart contract.Taking a look at how DLT and tokenisation will transform the fund distribution value chain  Paul Daly (Head of Distribution Products and Solutions) and Carole Michel (Fund Distribution Senior Global Product Manager) at BNP Paribas Securities Services  have concurred: ‚ÄúThis technology will give birth to new types of services such as consolidation in case of interoperability between blockchain platforms  storage of private keys  signature of orders to validate the value on the chain  and structuration of data in the security token.‚ÄùConfirming this approach also in an interview with CoinDesk  Tyrone Lobban (head of Onyx Digital Assets at JPMorgan) has explained the bank‚Äôs institutional-grade DeFi plans  pointing out how much value in tokenised assets is ready to be used at the appropriate time.‚ÄúOver time  we think tokenising U.S. Treasurys or money market fund shares  for example  means these could all potentially be used as collateral in DeFi pools ‚Äù and adding  ‚ÄúThe overall goal is to bring these trillions of dollars of assets into DeFi  so that we can use these new mechanisms for trading  borrowing [and] lending  but with the scale of institutional assets.‚ÄùHoping that DeFi developers would leverage the yield-generating potential of non-crypto assets  JPMorgan incorporates the tokenisation of traditional assets to a greater scale. Through two complementary components  one of which is JPMorgan‚Äôs blockchain-based collateral settlement system  Onyx Digital Assets hopes to bring bank-grade DeFi to realisation. Project Guardian  which tests institutional-friendly DeFi using permissioned liquidity pools that comprise tokenised bonds and deposits  is the second part.Furthermore  tokenisation offers a real opportunity to improve the asset management industry since it allows for the digital representation of funds and the underlying assets on a blockchain or DLT. According to a study by BNY Mellon ‚Äúalmost all institutional investors (91%) are interested in investing in tokenized products‚Äù.Speaking to Connect Forum  Edward Glyn  head of global market at Calastone  reported: ‚ÄúThis tokenised product would provide the same exposure but be issued and operated throughout a technical ecosystem where every player also has access  input  and oversight.‚ÄùFrom the investors‚Äô perspective  this means more personalised low-cost investing  real-time investing  clear and fair pricing  transparency  access to a bigger pool of assets and a user experience equal to the challenger banks and lifestyle apps.On the other hand  investment managers see this as a radical enhancing of the supply chain  improved transparency and analytics  simpler fund issuance  and the possibility of greater alpha generation by removing tens of basis points off management costs.As a step towards tokenisation  AllianceBernstein joins hands with specialists in blockchain technology  Allfunds Blockchain ‚Äì the collaboration between the two aimed at integrating blockchain technology into the financial service ecosystem. The Allfunds Group  a leading B2B WealthTech platform for the funds industry with ‚Ç¨1.4 trillion in assets under management  offers fully integrated solutions for both asset management firms and distributors. Within this is a standalone company  Allfunds Blockchain  which generates a unique environment of security  privacy and data governance amongst financial institutions and enables new capabilities for programming and automating processes via smart contracts.AllianceBernstein (with $779billion in assets under management) offers research and diversified investment services to institutional investors  individuals and private wealth clients worldwide. The integrative collaboration creating mutual benefits between these two is  without doubt  an important example of how blockchain is influencing the asset management industry. Another is the recent acquisition of a stake in digital securities exchange  Archax  by Abrdn.Following through on the ¬£508billion asset manager‚Äôs ambitions to enter the digital assets market  the Edinburgh-based fund group has become the largest external shareholder in Archax although  prior to this  BlackRock (the world‚Äôs largest asset manager)  had partnered with Coinbase Global to offer digital assets to institutional investors.So  whilst it is quite impossible to mention all since the list is inexhaustible  the above demonstrates how tokenisation is still impacting the asset management industry.Looking ahead  tokenisation would enable the industry to develop a secondary market where the value encapsulated in a token can be transferred almost instantly in a traceable process that can handle small amounts of capital and settle in real time. This would not only simplify operations  reduce costs and provide real-time data  but would also be of value to clients with illiquid funds.Furthermore  the use of blockchains and/or DLTs offers compliance staff and regulators much needed greater transparency while potentially reducing counterparty risk.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.49,0.13,0.38,True,English,"['asset managers', 'blockchains', 'Fund Distribution Senior Global Product Manager', 'money market fund shares', 'second biggest asset manager', 'BNP Paribas Securities Services', 'blockchain-based collateral settlement system', 'Credit Suisse Asset Management', 'fund distribution value chain', 'long complex chains', 'online distributed ledger', 'self-service style model', 'Luxembourg Stock Exchange', 'AML/ KYC processes', 'U.S. Treasurys', 'two complementary components', 'permissioned liquidity pools', 'asset management firms', 'Natixis Investment Managers', 'institutional-grade DeFi plans', 'other digital assets', 'Onyx Digital Assets', 'Digital ledger technology', 'asset management industry', 'greater blockchain adoption', 'fund houses', 'fund tokens', 'financial system', 'second part', 'fund industry', 'asset managers', 'greater adoption', 'distribution costs', 'distribution networks', 'Distribution Products', 'tokenised asset', 'DeFi pools', 'digital currencies', 'native digital', 'digital wallets', 'digital identity', 'digital representation', 'faster services', 'total assets', 'institutional assets', 'crypto assets', 'traditional assets', 'underlying assets', 'extreme volatility', 'major concern', 'recent times', 'crypto crash', 'financial institutions', 'umbrella term', 'several applications', 'significant transformation', 'massive growth', 'last decade', '$8trillion undermanagement', 'Warren Pennington', 'vast array', 'many parties', 'Oliver Portenseigne', 'immediate result', 'cheaper, easier', 'Financial inclusion', 'larger numbers', 'transaction costs', 'tokens‚Äô ownership', 'beneficial ownership', 'AML/KYC controls', 'smart contract', 'Paul Daly', 'Carole Michel', 'new types', 'private keys', 'security token', 'Tyrone Lobban', 'overall goal', 'new mechanisms', 'DeFi developers', 'bank-grade DeFi', 'Project Guardian', 'institutional-friendly DeFi', 'tokenised bonds', 'real opportunity', 'BNY Mellon', 'greater scale', 'transformative potential', 'same time', 'real time', 'potential clients', 'appropriate time', 'yield-generating potential', 'wealth managers', 'blockchain platforms', 'electronic trading', 'blockchain technology', 'YouTube link', 'real-time visibility', 'Investors‚Äô nervousness', 'institutional investors', 'investor relationships', 'blockchains Source', 'index funds', 'cryptocurrencies', 'future', 'world', 'DLT', 'terms', 'light', 'sector', 'digitisation', 'tokenisation', 'inefficiencies', 'example', 'Vanguard', 'core', 'supercomputer', 'opportunities', 'CEO', 'Clearstream', 'reach', 'automation', 'reporting', 'proof', 'look', 'Head', 'Solutions', 'birth', 'consolidation', 'case', 'interoperability', 'storage', 'signature', 'orders', 'data', 'approach', 'interview', 'CoinDesk', 'JPMorgan', 'trillions', 'dollars', 'lending', 'realisation', 'deposits', 'study']",2023-01-24,2023-01-25,cityam.com

Of particular note is the commitment by the Group‚Äôs subsidiaries to apply the Code of Conduct for Out-of-Home display and to support one or more of the UN‚Äôs SDGs.These 17 goals  defined in 2015 and adopted by all of the UN member states  represent a global call to action to eradicate poverty  ensure the prosperity of everyone while at the same time protecting the planet. Universal  inclusive and interconnected  it calls for action to achieve the goals ahead of 2030 based on five major principles (the 5 Ps): People  the Planet  Prosperity  Peace and Partnerships. Since 2015  and backed by the United Nations  many governments have already adopted measures to support these SDGs  leading to the decline of the proportion of the world‚Äôs population living in extreme poverty as well as mortality rates linked to non-contagious diseases. The next eight years will be key in making all of the SDGs a reality and in building a better future for everyone. Reaching these goals will require global cooperation  promoted by the United Nations. JCDecaux  via its partnership with the Joint SDG Fund  is committed to making outdoor advertising a key driver in promoting SDGs.Story continuesHaving signed the United Nations‚Äô Global Compact in November 2015  JCDecaux is extending its commitment with this new agreement  to support Human rights and commits to a concrete policy of supporting Major Causes throughout the world.Lisa Kurbiel  Head of the United Nations Joint SDG Fund Secretariat  declared: ‚ÄúWe are honored to bring the strengths of the UN Joint SDG Fund together with JCDecaux to mobilise a global movement that embeds sustainability at the heart of advertising. The media is a key stakeholder in accelerating the Sustainable Development Goals  playing a major role in advancing societal goals to combat climate change  promote gender equality and reduce inequalities.

The year 2022 also marks an important milestone for the global microbiome industry with the regulatory approvals of the first microbiome-based drugs by the FDA in the U.S. and by the TGA in Australia ‚Äù stated Herv√© Affagard  CEO and co-founder of MaaT Pharma. ‚ÄúDespite difficult market conditions  we continue to advance our pioneering science and technology and we remain focused on delivering new therapeutic solutions to the benefit of patients with severe conditions as well as building value for our shareholders. 2023 will be a year with important inflection points and will require us to act decisively to reach our objectives. We thank our investors for their support throughout this year  and their confidence in our ability to achieve the next level of corporate development.‚ÄùClinical developmentHemato-oncologyMaaT013  a full-ecosystem  standardized  pooled-donor native Microbiome Ecosystem Therapy for acute  hospital use (enema administration)MaaT013 for the treatment of acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (aGvHD): MaaT013 has received an Orphan Drug Designation by both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medical Agency (EMA).MaaT013 is currently being evaluated in Europe in an ongoing international multicenter open-label  single arm  pivotal Phase 3 trial (ARES) in 75 patients with steroid-resistant gastrointestinal aGvHD. The Company has received full regulatory approvals in the following countries  which is more than initially envisioned: Austria  Belgium  France  Germany  Italy  and Spain. A safety and efficacy data review will be conducted by an independent data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) after enrollment of half of the patients in the study. The review is expected in the first half of 2023 and the Company will communicate the DSMB‚Äôs recommendations following the review.The initiation of clinical trials following the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for MaaT013 in the United States (U.S.) will depend on the outcome of ongoing exchanges with the FDA in response to the August 2022 continued clinical hold letter. The most recent communication received by the Company from the FDA stated that the complete response provided by the Company in response to the letter received in August 2022  was still under review. Feedback could be expected in the early part of 2023 and the Company will update investors accordingly. The Company understands that the FDA‚Äôs Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) that currently hosts all microbiome-based drug candidates  continues to prioritize their work to advance the nation‚Äôs response to the COVID-19 public health emergency  which is creating additional delays. Despite this  the Company remains focused on achieving regulatory approval for MaaT013 in the U.S. and providing a therapeutic solution for patients in the country.MaaT013 has already been successfully evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with steroid-resistant grade III-IV gastro-intestinal (GI) aGvHD (HERACLES) as well as in an ongoing compassionate use program (EAP) in France in patients with Grade II-IV GI-aGvHD having failed previous therapies  with promising results presented at the 2022 American Society of Hematology (ASH) conference in an oral presentation and in a poster at the 2022 edition of the International Human Microbiome Consortium (IHMC). The compelling data demonstrates that the pooled microbiota product is well tolerated and shows a good safety profile in a fragile patient population. Efficacy of MaaT013 correlates with engraftment of the product‚Äôs microbial species in the gut and clinical response to MaaT013 translates to increased overall survival in patients with aGvHD.MaaT033  a donor-derived  standardized  high-richness  high-diversity Microbiome Ecosystem Therapy for oral administration  currently being developed as an adjunctive and maintenance therapy to improve overall survival in patients receiving HSCT1.MaaT033 for the improved survival of patients with hematological malignancies receiving allo-HSCTBased on promising results following the Phase 1b trial presented at the 2022 edition of the ASH annual meeting  and learnings from this study  along with an in-depth review of the Protocol Assistance with the EMA  and discussions with potential partners showing an interest in the license and commercialization of MaaT033 in this therapeutic area  the Company has optimized and adjusted the protocol for the Phase 2b trial of MaaT033 (PHOEBUS). In this context and given the strategic importance of the trial  the Company has decided to take over the sponsorship of the clinical trial in Europe. At the time of the IPO  it was anticipated that AP-HP2 would sponsor the trial in France as an Investigator-sponsored trial. The study is expected to start in Q2 2023 and would now be conducted in Europe in accordance with EMA recommendations. The number of patients enrolled in the study would expand from 341 to 387 and the number of sites would be increased from 20 to 56  enabling the recruitment period to be reduced from 36 to 24 months.While the primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of MaaT033 in improving overall survival at 12 months  secondary endpoints would include the evaluation of safety and tolerability before and after allo-HSCT  and the evaluation of the engraftment of beneficial microbial species from MaaT033 and the activity in preventing allo-HSCT complications (infections  GvHD).Additional readouts have been included throughout the 24-month recruitment period  such as interim safety analysis with stopping rules 3 when the trial has enrolled and randomized  respectively  60 and 120 patients.when the trial has enrolled and randomized  respectively  60 and 120 patients. The expected timelines including the overall survival endpoint (data to be expected in H1 2026) announced by MaaT Pharma during the IPO should be confirmed based on the adjustments mentioned above.In parallel to starting the trial in Europe  the Company plans to discuss this program with the FDA upon conclusion of ongoing dialogues with the Agency regarding its pooling technology.Immuno-oncology ‚Äì Clinical and nonclinical programsMaaT013 for the improvement of patients‚Äô response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI) ‚Äìproof of concept Phase 2a clinical trial sponsored by AP-HPThe proof-of-concept double blind randomized Phase 2a clinical trial  PICASSO (n=60)  initiated in April 2022  evaluating MaaT013‚Äôs impact on the efficacy of ICI treatments (ipilimumab + nivolumab) in patients with metastatic melanoma  remains on track as planned.This trial is an Investigator-sponsored trial by AP-HP  where MaaT Pharma supplies drug candidates and performs the microbiome profiling of patients using its proprietary gutPrint¬Æ platform.Key study endpoints after 23 weeks of treatment include MaaT013‚Äôs safety profile and best-overall response rate vs placebo as an add-on treatment to ipilimumab + nivolumab.placebo as an add-on treatment to ipilimumab + nivolumab. The Company is expected to receive biological biomarker data in H1 2023 after half of the patients have been enrolled and achieved their evaluation 9 weeks after randomization.Results are expected in H2 2024  as planned.MaaT03x  a new generation high richness  co-cultured  designed Microbiome Ecosystem TherapyTM in oral formulation for the increase in the response rate to ICI in patients with solid tumors - currently in preclinical testing.As MaaT03x is expected to be used in large markets  MaaT Pharma has been focused on increasing the level of readiness and decided to enter a Phase 1b trial in Europe and the U.S. in the first half of 2024  as opposed to the second half of 2023 as initially announced. This is a result of changes and adjustments following announcements of first regulatory approvals for microbiome-based products and the Company‚Äôs work for the development of its native products (MaaT013 & MaaT033) in Europe. MaaT Pharma is consolidating in vivo/in vitro data  continuing product development characterization and conducting regulatory readiness of MaaT03x. Preclinical data are expected to be shared at scientific conferences in 2023.MaaT Pharma has initiated early interactions with the EMA in 2022 including a meeting with the EMA's Innovation Task Force (ITF). Further interactions in Europe are expected to take place in 2023. The Company is also planning early interactions with the FDA in H1 2023 to present its MaaT03x platform and has already filed a meeting request.The Company will be able to strengthen its intellectual property (IP) portfolio in France and internationally thanks to the co-cultured new generation products. Currently  the Company holds the IP for 14 patent families.Therapeutic pipeline extensionRecent studies have highlighted the importance of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and the impact of the gut microbiome in brain diseases. Interestingly  patients with neurodegenerative disorders display both central nervous system (CNS) and gastrointestinal symptoms4. In parallel  scientific research has started to shed light on the role of the gut microbiome  linking abnormalities to diseases such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS5). The link between gut microbiota and ALS first emerged from preclinical evidence and then from clinical observations indicating a disease-modifying role for the gut microbiome. To date  there is no effective treatment for ALS  a disease that leads to death within an average of 3-5 years after diagnosis6. ALS affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord causing loss of muscle control. Since its inception  MaaT Pharma has been committed to restoring a microbial symbiosis in life-threatening diseases with high unmet clinical needs. Growing evidence suggests that ALS patients show increased inflammation in the gut with changes in the composition of gut microbes and low levels of beneficial bacteria.MaaT Pharma has decided to extend its scientific research to the management of ALS  which could pave the way for the treatment of several neurodegenerative diseases. The Company is leveraging the strong safety profile of its native MET products (MaaT033/MaaT013) and their inherent product characteristics of promoting immune modulation/anti-inflammatory properties and acting as a homeostasis hub. The number of ALS cases is expected to increase substantially in the developing world over the next 25 years and could reach a total of 60 000 patients in U.S. and Europe by 20407. Every year  5 000 new patients are diagnosed in the U.S. and in Europe and the incidence of ALS ranges from 3 to 4 per 100 000 person-years7.Leveraging 12 months of feasibility assessment in MaaT Pharma‚Äôs Discovery team  the Company expects to initiate in H1 2023 a Phase 1b pilot study in ALS evaluating MaaT033 to slow down disease progression. The study  developed with experts from the ALS network (FILSLAN and ACT4ALS-MND) and strongly supported by the French patient association (Tous en Selles contre la SLA)  will enroll up to 15 patients presenting initial motor deficit i.e.  at least 6 months up to 24 months at the time of the screening. This pipeline expansion to a new indication demonstrates the strong potential of MaaT033 to be used in an acute or chronic setting as a standalone  adjunctive and maintenance therapy. Data readout from the pilot study is expected for the first half of 2024.If this initial trial is successful  the Company could extend further to other chronic diseases/ immuno-inflammatory diseases as MaaT Pharma collects data and strengthens in-depth understanding of the mechanism of action. Funding for the trial is already secured and the program has been designed to minimize the risk and not impact the Company‚Äôs lead programs in oncology. The key study endpoints are assessment of safety and tolerability of multiple doses of MaaT033  the assessment of gut microbiota composition evolution and the identification of biomarkers sensitive to treatment before considering a larger randomized controlled efficacy study.cGMP manufacturing facilitiesMaaT Pharma is currently building its future manufacturing facilities  in partnership with Skyepharma. The 1600m2 facility will be able to support the needs of clinical and commercial production of its native MET (MaaT013 & MaaT033)  R&D and clinical batches of cultured products  MaaT03x  up to 2034.Funding is secured and the completion of the facility is expected in mid-2023. Under the terms of the partnership agreement  MaaT Pharma will retain the know-how of its bio-manufacturing processes and agility (full command end-to-end manufacturing processes)  while leveraging Skyepharma‚Äôs experience in running a cGMP facility. Having this facility is a strong competitive advantage for a late-stage company preparing for commercial phase  which MaaT Pharma believes will facilitate potential commercial partnerships. The site will be the first in France  and the largest specialized manufacturing facility for full ecosystem microbiome therapies in Europe to date. The facility will also increase potential synergies within the microbiome industry and contribute to structuring the production of microbiome-based drugs. It will provide a fully integrated manufacturing and development platform that will allow quick and efficient product development  scale-up and GMP processes.Financing plans & update on cash runwayFollowing an in-depth review of its ongoing programs  in particular the deferral of the clinical study of MaaT03x from 2023 to 2024 and savings on discretionary spending  the Company has optimized and prioritized its operations  extending its cash runway to end of Q4 2023  as compared to end of Q3 2023 as previously announced. The Company is also evaluating options that will finance operations and bring its late-stage products close to commercial launch. The focus is on both dilutive and non-dilutive financing  including business deals. The Company is confident in the continuing and longstanding support of its historical investors.The Company has updated its corporate presentation  which can be download here: https://www.maatpharma.com/investors/About MaaT PharmaMaaT Pharma  a clinical stage biotechnology company  has established a complete approach to restoring patient-microbiome symbiosis in oncology.

By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world‚Äôs first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world‚Äôs first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ (ALDEI ‚Äì code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010. The Company has 45 employees and relies on a network of world-class academic  technological  industrial and institutional partners.CONTACTSInvestorsMario AlcarazChief Financial and Administrative Officer+33 (0)4 48 19 01 00ir@deinove.comMediaATCG Partners+33 (0)9 81 87 46 72communication@deinove.comAttachment,neutral,0.0,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.14,0.13,0.73,True,English,"['judicial liquidation proceedings', 'receivership proceedings', 'Conversion', 'proc√©dure de liquidation judiciaire', 'Ma√Ætre Christine Dauverchain', 'Phase II clinical trial', 'severe Clostridioides difficile infection', 'first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms', 'world-class academic, technological, industrial', 'microbial dark matter', 'several development programs', 'low concentrated compounds', 'JUDICIAL LIQUIDATION PROCEEDINGS', 'first antibiotic candidate', 'complex chemical structures', 'French biotech company', 'French biotechnology company', 'urgent, global challenge', 'Montpellier Commercial Court', 'new bacterial micro-factories', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'liquidateur judiciaire', 'liquidation surplus', 'first emergencies', 'industrial production', 'judicial liquidator', 'English French', 'RECEIVERSHIP PROCEEDINGS', 'antibiotic resistance', 'Euronext Paris', 'global health', 'economic challenge', 'chemical synthesis', 'bacterial biodiversity', 'new domain', 'new therapies', 'bacterial extracts', 'EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ', 'The Company', 'press release', 'delisting procedure', 'metabolic potential', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'life-threatening infections', 'high speed', 'breakthrough approach', 'unique collection', 'other issue', 'Euromedecine park', 'institutional partners', 'Mario Alcaraz', 'Chief Financial', 'Administrative Officer', 'ATCG Partners', 'rare bacteria', '10,000 rare strains', 'Deinove shares', 'CONVERSION', 'ALDEI', 'pioneer', 'exploration', 'exploitation', 'January', 'judgment', 'November', 'offer', 'deadline', 'noon', 'result', 'publication', 'notice', 'end', 'place', 'consultation', 'distribution', 'shareholders', 'superbugs', 'microbes', 'antimicrobials', 'rise', 'thousands', 'race', 'heart', 'code', 'ISIN', '45 employees', 'network', 'CONTACTS', 'Investors', 'Media', 'communication', 'Attachment', '9']",2023-01-24,2023-01-25,globenewswire.com

ESA is working closely with the European Commission to ensure that space benefits EU citizens and to foster a strong and resilient European space economy.‚ÄùESA and the EU have been partners in European space for decades. ESA designed and developed the EU‚Äôs Galileo system ‚Äì with its 28-satellite constellation and its global ground stations ‚Äì that together provide a highly accurate  guaranteed global positioning service under civilian control  as well as more than 30 EU Copernicus Earth observation satellites that deliver data to improve the management of the environment  understand and mitigate the effects of climate change  and ensure civil security. ESA has also created the EU‚Äôs European satellite navigation system for aircraft.Cyberattacks and geopolitics threaten today‚Äôs increasingly digital world  leading to the disruption of essential supplies such as power and water. In response  ESA has started work on supporting the EU‚Äôs new flagship space programme ‚Äì a highly secure  satellite-enabled connectivity system called Iris2 that will promote digital autonomy and provide a strategic asset for the EU.Javier Benedicto  ESA Director of Navigation and Acting Director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications  will tell the conference how ESA will work with space companies in the EU to deliver the Iris2 constellation. The satellites and their ground stations are expected to be operational by the end of 2027  based on contracts to be signed in 2024.He will also outline how ESA is developing the new generation of the EU‚Äôs Galileo navigation satellites that will support European autonomy and resilience.Simonetta Cheli  ESA Director of Earth Observation  will highlight how ESA can support the evolution and modernisation of the EU‚Äôs Copernicus Earth observation satellites. Advanced use of Copernicus data and information services will support better policy definition  improved planning  increased transparency and accountability  enabling Europe to achieve the ambitious goal of becoming the first net-zero continent by 2050.Geraldine Naja  ESA Director of Commercialisation  Industry and Procurement  will speak about how ESA is supporting the development of European space innovation  technology and skills.Today the European space stock index ‚Äì an index of European space-based companies that are currently listed on the stock market ‚Äì will be launched. The index enables investors and people working in finance to monitor the financial performance of European space companies.

Registration applications will be filed in the remaining countries (Serbia  North Macedonia  Montenegro  Bosnia).Last November Maxigesic¬Æ IV was launched France and Italy  together with Ever Pharma GmbH.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: ‚ÄúWe are pleased with Maxigesic¬Æ IV‚Äôs further roll-out. This novel non-opioid pain treatment can soon offer relief to patients in even more countries across Europe  and underlines the attractiveness of our business model of reformulating and repurposing existing medicinal products  including its ability to provide significant benefits to patients and health care providers.‚ÄùAbout Maxigesic¬Æ IVMaxigesic¬Æ IV is a novel  dual mode-of-action  non-opioid pain treatment for use post-operatively in hospitals or when patients cannot take medicine orally. It is a unique combination of 1000mg paracetamol with 300mg ibuprofen solution for infusion  thereby reducing both pain and inflammation.Story continuesResults from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial demonstrated that Maxigesic¬Æ IV was well-tolerated and had a faster onset of action  offered higher pain relief  and provided the potential to reduce the use of opioids compared to ibuprofen IV or paracetamol IV alone in the same doses. Further exposure studies have demonstrated the drug‚Äôs efficacy and safety in an expanded population group over a longer treatment period. Maxigesic¬Æ IV is protected by several granted and pending patent applications.About Hyloris Pharmaceuticals SAHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimising existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.

By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world‚Äôs first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world‚Äôs first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ (ALDEI ‚Äì code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010.

Name : EKINOPS ISIN Code : FR0011466069 Mnemonic code : EKI Number of shares: 25 431 086  Attachments   Original Link   Original Document‚Ä¶,"Ekinops (Euronext Paris - FR0011466069 - EKI)  a leading supplier of optical transport systems and access network solutions  today announces the availability of its new PM_400FR05-C2A pluggable module for the Ekinops360 WDM optical transport system. This new line card is the first coherent module from Ekinops based on 400G pluggable line interfaces  offering lower cost  lower power coherent solutions than what is offered by high-performance embedded optics.Since their debut in 2021  pluggable 400G transceivers have been quickly adapted for use in communications networks. Though initially designed for short reach data center connectivity  newer versions with higher optical launch powers are now being deployed in broader applications including metro and regional service provider transport networks. According to market research firm Cignal AI  these transceivers will represent more than 20% of all 100G+ telecom bandwidth deployed in 2022  growing to 30% by 2024. ""400G pluggable optics are revolutionizing the optical communications market by creating more flexible high-performance networks at lower cost for both data center and traditional telco operators "" said Scott Wilkinson  Lead Analyst for Optical Components at Cignal AI. ""This performance and cost savings provide a compelling case for all network operators to consider pluggable coherent optics-based network designs  and deployments based on these modules will lead coherent bandwidth growth in optical networking for the next several years.""The PM_400FR05-C2A provides multiple client options capable of supporting either 100GbE or OTU4 as well as 400GbE connectivity. The line interface is programmable from 100G to 400G. As a standards-based solution  the PM_400FR05-C2A is fully interoperable with other third-party compliant interfaces making it easy and inexpensive for service providers to interconnect switch/router ports. While most pluggable 400G optics are limited to point-to-point connectivity  the PM_400FR05-C2A is also deployable on meshed optical networks with multi-point connectivity  a key differentiator that significantly expands the scope of potential applications.""As a line card-based solution  the PM_400 FR05-C2A provides a strict demarcation point between not only service provider and customer networks but also the packet and optical networks so that it fits seamlessly into the service providers' operational model "" said Guillaume Crenn  Product Line and Marketing Director at Ekinops. ""Because most switches and routers out there today cannot support a 400G transceiver directly  Ekinops' approach saves customers from having to upgrade their packet infrastructure."" Compatible with all existing Ekinops chassis  Ekinops customers can not only avoid the cost of upgrading routers but also avoid adding new transport infrastructure while still taking advantage of the small size  low power and low cost of pluggable solutions without sacrificing performance.Another differentiator is the availability of an optional Ekinops proprietary enhanced performance mode that extends the reach of the line output more than 20% compared to standardized modes of performance. Advanced transmission technology developed by Ekinops provides a cleaner transmission signal that can eliminate the need for additional amplifiers and regeneration points to further lower overall network cost.The PM_400FR05-C2A is already attracting customer interest. It is currently in lab trials with general availability beginning in the first quarter of 2023.For more information about the Ekinops portfolio  please visit https://www.ekinops.com/products-services/productsEkinops is a leading provider of open  trusted and innovative network connectivity solutions to service providers around the world.

Registration applications will be filed in the remaining countries (Serbia  North Macedonia  Montenegro  Bosnia).Last November Maxigesic¬Æ IV was launched France and Italy  together with Ever Pharma GmbH.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: ‚ÄúWe are pleased with Maxigesic¬Æ IV‚Äôs further roll-out. This novel non-opioid pain treatment can soon offer relief to patients in even more countries across Europe  and underlines the attractiveness of our business model of reformulating and repurposing existing medicinal products  including its ability to provide significant benefits to patients and health care providers.‚ÄùAbout Maxigesic¬Æ IVMaxigesic¬Æ IV is a novel  dual mode-of-action  non-opioid pain treatment for use post-operatively in hospitals or when patients cannot take medicine orally. It is a unique combination of 1000mg paracetamol with 300mg ibuprofen solution for infusion  thereby reducing both pain and inflammation.Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial demonstrated that Maxigesic¬Æ IV was well-tolerated and had a faster onset of action  offered higher pain relief  and provided the potential to reduce the use of opioids compared to ibuprofen IV or paracetamol IV alone in the same doses. Further exposure studies have demonstrated the drug‚Äôs efficacy and safety in an expanded population group over a longer treatment period. Maxigesic¬Æ IV is protected by several granted and pending patent applications.About Hyloris Pharmaceuticals SAHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimising existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors. Hyloris has built a broad  patented portfolio of 16 reformulated and repurposed value-added medicines that have the potential to offer significant advantages over available alternatives. Outside of its core strategic focus  the Company also has 3 high barrier generic products in development and registration phase. Two products are currently in initial phases of commercialisation with partners: Sotalol IV for the treatment of atrial fibrillation  and Maxigesic¬Æ IV  a non-opioid post-operative pain treatment. The Company‚Äôs development strategy primarily focuses on the FDA‚Äôs 505(b)2 regulatory pathway  which is specifically designed for pharmaceuticals for which safety and efficacy of the molecule have already been established. This pathway can reduce the clinical burden required to bring a product to market  and significantly shorten the development timelines and reduce costs and risks. Hyloris is based in Li√®ge  Belgium.

These are the first indications of upcoming deployments in low-carbon hydrogen as the market is getting more structured. The first grants under the Hydrogen PIIEC will foster the development of production capacities and will shortly be followed by a second wave of funding  which will fuel demand and the transition to larger-scale projects. Therefore  the launch of our Gigafactory project on the Belfort site in the second half of the year is a major strategic step forward. Indeed  it will allow us to lower the cost of our electrolyzers and increase their capacity in order to provide competitive low-carbon hydrogen very quickly. We are thus approaching 2023 with confidence in our ability to generate sustained growth and enthusiastic about the idea of building a first-rate industrial tool  which is an essential condition to remain at the forefront of the low-carbon hydrogen revolution‚Äù.Return to sustained growth in sales in 2022Revenue for the 2022 financial year is up 22% compared to 2021  to ‚Ç¨16.0 million. Restated for the takeover of two old generation stations sold during previous financial years (the amount of which was deducted from the revenue for the first half of the year)  revenue would amount to ‚Ç¨18.2 million compared with ‚Ç¨13.1 million in 2021  representing a growth of +39%. This return to growth primarily results from the materialization of the first orders under the major contracts signed over the past years. The revenue breakdown between the supply of electrolyzers of large capacity McLyzer and of Piel range (68%) and the supply of stations (32%).Commercial momentum strengthened by the signing of a landmark industrial contractIn the course of the first semester  McPhy signed a contract with a subsidiary of Eiffage to equip a site in Belfort with a 1 MW electrolyzer and a recharging station capable of distributing up to 800 kg/day to fuel a fleet of hydrogen buses. The Group also received two first orders in the framework of its strategic partnership with Hype to supply: (i) two alkaline electrolyzers with a capacity of 2 MW for the first and upgraded to 4 MW for the second  as well as (ii) two Dual Pressure stations with a capacity of 800 kg per day each to be installed in the Paris region. During the second half of the year  McPhy also finalized an 8-year maintenance contract with Siemens Energy. McPhy teams will manage the maintenance of the hydrogen production equipment on the CEOG project site.At the end of the year  the Group recorded a landmark order in the industrial sector with a joint venture controlled by one of the world's leading steel groups. The agreement includes the equipment of an innovative low-carbon steel production project at a plant in Germany  close to McPhy's design and engineering site in Wildau. The agreement  favoured by the geographical proximity  illustrates the relevance of the Group's European operating set-up. The agreement covers the supply of two McLyzer electrolyzers with a capacity of 1 MW each  as well as a Dual Pressure 350/700 bar station dedicated to the supply of forklift trucks and trailer trucks. It has also been agreed of a 5-year long-term services contract. The first deliveries of low-carbon steel should take place in the first half of 2024.Strong increase in order intake and backlogAll of these elements allow McPhy to record a +53% growth in firm order intake  which amounts to ‚Ç¨29.4 million  bringing the order backlog to ‚Ç¨31.3 million at December 31  2022  up +56% compared to December 31  2021.As of 31 December 2022  McPhy had a portfolio of projects signed  commissioned and/or under execution representing a total of 45 MW and 40 stations. The Group had furthermore been identified as a preferred partner and/or selected supplier for 148 MW and 56 stations  bringing its references to 193 MW and 96 stations.Acceleration of industrial scale-up with the launch of the Gigafactory projectThe eligibility of McPhy's electrolyzer Gigafactory project to the IPCEI scheme was approved by the European Commission in July  allowing the signing of a public aid contract with the French State represented by Bpifrance  for a maximum amount of ‚Ç¨114 million. On that basis  McPhy has officially made a final investment decision and received a first payment of ‚Ç¨28.5 million from Bpifrance. Work has already begun on the commissioning of the future plant on the Belfort site  with a launch scheduled for the first half of 2024  followed by a gradual ramp-up to reach an annual production capacity of 1 GW.Concurrently  McPhy continued its efforts to scale up the electrolyzer part of the business by increasing its production capacity to 300 MW on its San Miniato site  in order to meet market demand while awaiting for the commissioning of the Gigafactory.For the Stations part  McPhy has finalized the regrouping of all the activities of this business line on its new site in the heart of Grenoble in an existing industrial building of more than 4 000 sqm. This new site will have a production capacity of 150 units per year.Continuation of an active recruitment policyMcPhy has recruited 85 new employees (of which 66 on permanent contracts) in fiscal year 2022  demonstrating its ability to attract talent in a competitive market and in an industry where skills are crucial. The Group now accounts 205 employees and will keep up its active recruitment policy though at a slower pace.OutlookGiven the acceleration of development investments and the rise in the number of employees in the second half of the year  the Group estimates that its EBITDA will amount to ‚Ç¨-34 to ‚Ç¨-37 million for the fiscal year 2022. The Group's net cash position should therefore be around ‚Ç¨135 million  including the initial payment of ‚Ç¨28.5 million from Bpifrance as part of the launch of the Gigafactory.The level of its backlog and the continued ramp-up of the hydrogen market  allow McPhy to anticipate another year of sustained growth in 2023.Next financial communication:Publication of 2022 Results: March 7 2023  after market closeABOUT MCPHYSpecialized in hydrogen production and distribution equipment  McPhy is contributing to the global deployment of low-carbon hydrogen as a solution for energy transition.

Factoring in our 2022 bookings for new ARR and related services  in just one year  we have successfully become the equivalent of a SaaS player that is already expected to generate revenue of ‚Ç¨10 million+ in 2023. This success is mainly the result of an inflationary environment fostering the deployment of Order-to-Cash solutions worldwide  and our technological edge in Artificial Intelligence  combined with the fast and impressive ramp-up in our North American activities. We can now confirm that our offensive US expansion strategy  kick-started 18 months ago  is producing results. North America has already proven that it is a robust growth driver for Sidetrade  and this is just the beginning. Our commercial successes with global businesses in preference over our direct North American competitors confirms the positioning of Sidetrade  which in a matter of months  has grown into a leader of the Order-to-Cash market in the United States. Together  we are proud of what we have achieved. As such  I wish to commend our teams across the board for their commitment  talent and resilience. Against a highly volatile and uncertain background of increased redundancy and cost reduction plans within SaaS companies  Sidetrade‚Äôs original model to continue an offensive investment policy and support its growth while maintaining profitability will provide a key competitive advantage in the months ahead.‚ÄùAll-time record bookings in 2022 with more than ‚Ç¨10 million in Annual Contract Value  and ‚Ç¨6.44 million in ARR  up 36%Excellent Q4  in line with performance for 2022After setting a record for SaaS bookings in Q1 2022  Sidetrade delivered the best Q4 performance in its history with a profit of ‚Ç¨2.03 million in New Annual Recurring Revenue (‚Äúnew ARR‚Äù)  compared with ‚Ç¨1.67 million in Q4 2021; a +22% increase. The total value of these new subscription contracts over their initial contract periods (excluding renewals and services) represents ‚Ç¨6.88 million of Total Contract Value (‚ÄúTCV‚Äù) in Q4 2022 versus ‚Ç¨4.15 million in Q4 2021; a +66% increase.In Q4 2022  international orders represented 54% of all bookings  largely driven by North America (46% of total bookings).To these SaaS bookings should be added ‚Ç¨1.18 million of additional related services in Q4 2022 (implementation  configuration and training excluding recurring services) ‚Äì compared with ‚Ç¨0.81 million in Q4 2021  a +45% increase. As a reminder  almost all of these services will be invoiced within twelve months of their signing.In total  the Annual Contract Value (‚ÄúACV‚Äù) of these bookings in Q4 2022 was ‚Ç¨3.21 million compared with ‚Ç¨2.48 million in Q4 2021 (excluding recurring services); a +29% increase.Record bookings in 2022  with more than ‚Ç¨10 million in Annual Contract ValueIn 2022  Sidetrade generated ‚Ç¨6.44 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (‚ÄúARR‚Äù) compared to ‚Ç¨4.75 million in 2021; a +36% increase.Bookings linked to services (implementation  configuration and training  excluding recurring services) also achieved robust growth  up from ‚Ç¨2.81 million in 2021 to ‚Ç¨3.84 million in 2022; a +37% increase. In total  and considering that almost all of these services will be invoiced over the next twelve months(excluding recurring services which can be invoiced over several years)  the 2022 fiscal year enables Sidetrade to add the equivalent of ‚Ç¨10.28 million in Annual Contract Value (‚ÄúACV‚Äù) compared to ‚Ç¨7.56 million for fiscal 2021; a +36% increase.In addition to both record quarterly performances in 2022 (Q1 2022 is the all-time high for a quarter while Q4 2022 is the best Q4 in Sidetrade‚Äôs history)  the increase in bookings is based on a continuous solid upward trend on a half-yearly basis  as illustrated by the double-digit half-year sequential growth (+12.4%) on average.Sidetrade H1 2021(‚Ç¨m) H2 2021(‚Ç¨m) H1 2022(‚Ç¨m) H2 2022(‚Ç¨m) Averagehalf-yearsequentialchange New SaaS Subscriptions(ARR) 2.14 2.62 3.04 3.41 12.4%2022 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.North America has already exceeded expectations  becoming a robust growth driver with 51% of total bookings in 2022In 2022  international orders represented 66% of all bookings  driven largely by the multiple commercial successes in the United States.The first eighteen months of US business have seen Sidetrade‚Äôs North American bookings continue on a strong growth trajectory  already representing more than half the Group total (51%) on a full-year basis in 2022  which is significantly above the target set by Management of 33% by Q4 2022. Sidetrade‚Äôs commercial wins in preference over local competitors with major North American players such as DXC Technologies in Q1 2022 (see the press release issued on 02/21/2022)  Insights Enterprise in Q2 2022 (see the press release issued on 09/06/2022) and HPE  signed in Q4 2022  have already positioned the Group as one of the US‚Äôs go-to Order-to-Cash partners.On the one hand  this excellent commercial momentum demonstrates Sidetrade‚Äôs technological edge in Artificial Intelligence with recognition by Gartner¬Æ as one of three Leaders for Integrated Invoice-to-Cash Applications in its 2022 Magic Quadrant publication (see the press release issued on 04/11/2022). On the other  it recognizes Sidetrade‚Äôs boldness to invest substantially and methodically in an experienced Order-to-Cash salesforce which will continue its ramp-up in the quarters ahead.Sidetrade now has a workforce of close to 300 employees  with over 60% of its teams based outside of France  including 53 North American colleagues. Only eighteen months after its US operations were officially launched  Sidetrade has a salesforce that includes three experienced VP Sales Executives and 11 Enterprise Account Sales Managers all over the country  supported by three presales and a Chief Marketing Officer now located in the US. To ensure this salesforce is fully equipped to quickly penetrate the North American market in 2023  Sidetrade made additions by hiring a team of 11 sales lead generation experts on October 1  2022  who work from the Group‚Äôs North American Business Hub opened in Calgary  Canada (see the press release issued on 10/04/2022).Sidetrade(ARR) 2021(‚Ç¨m) 2022(‚Ç¨m) Average New SaaS Subscriptions 4.75 6.44 36% of which North America 1.04 3.27 214%2022 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.The total value of these new subscription contracts over their initial contract periods (excluding renewals and services) reached a peak of ‚Ç¨20.7 million of Total Contract Value (‚ÄúTCV‚Äù) for the first time in 2022 versus ‚Ç¨12.9 million in 2021  a dramatic increase of +60%. In particular  this surge is attributed to an extension of the initial contract period for new customers (excluding renewals)  up from 36.2 to 44.9 months  thereby increasing the economic model‚Äôs high predictability.Overall  in FY 2022  bookings by new customers (‚ÄúNew Business‚Äù) and Cross-selling represented 80% of the total versus 72% in FY 2021  with the remaining 20% of bookings accounting for Upselling of additional modules to existing customers compared to 28% in FY 2021.Lastly  attrition remains under control for enterprise accounts with a churn rate of 3.83% as of December 31  2022  which represents an excellent result for the SaaS industry  whose average was 14% according to the ‚Äú 2022 Private SaaS Company Survey Results ‚Äù by KeyBank Capital Markets.It should be noted that as with all existing contracts  the new contracts include an annual automatic price re-indexation clause based on changes in price indices for the relevant country.In an inflationary market environment  now more than ever  businesses must deploy efficient solutions to manage their Order-to-Cash process as they face a twofold challenge: to consolidate cash reserves with multiple hikes in interest rates  while generating productivity gains to address salary increases and recruitment difficulties.This trend is expected to continue over the next 12 to 18 months with an additional increased risk of future recession in certain countries. In this disrupted context  the management of operating working capital  and particularly accounts receivable  is a major challenge for all finance departments.Strong increase in Order-to-Cash SaaS revenue: +22%Revenue driven by international orders  up +13%Sidetrade Q42022(‚Ç¨m) Q42021(‚Ç¨m) Change 2022(‚Ç¨m) 2021(‚Ç¨m) Change ‚ÄòOrder-to-Cash‚Äô Activities 9.5 7.9 +21% 35.9 30.3 +18% of which SaaS Subscriptions 8.1 6.4 +25% 30.1 24.7 +22% ‚ÄòSales & Marketing‚Äô Activities 0.2 0.4 -44% 0.9 2.3 -61% Revenue 9.7 8.3 +17% 36.8 32.6 +13%2022 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.Sidetrade capped off 2022 with outstanding growth and a record fourth-quarter performance  reflecting a year full of successes as well as an important step taken in its development.Q4 2022 ‚ÄòOrder-to-Cash‚Äô Activities totaled ‚Ç¨9.5 million  up 21% on the same period in 2021 and driven by sharp growth in SaaS subscriptions (+25%) compared with Q4 2021.On a full-year basis  ‚ÄòOrder-to-Cash‚Äô Activities for 2022 increased by 18%  thanks to strong growth in SaaS subscriptions (+22%). The increase in this recurring revenue is the result of record bookings in the 2021 fiscal year and early fiscal 2022  which continued to impact revenue growth throughout the 2022 fiscal year.‚ÄòOrder-to-Cash‚Äô Activities  a core business within the Company‚Äôs strategy since 2019  represented 98% of total revenue in 2022.The ‚ÄòSales & Marketing‚Äô Activities  which are no longer part of the Company‚Äôs strategy  now account for only 2% of total revenue in 2022  and will continue to decline  with estimated revenue of ‚Ç¨0.5 million at end-2023. While the decline in revenue for these Activities impacted growth by 4% in 2022  it will automatically have considerably less impact in 2023.Total revenue grew further by +13% in FY 2022  to ‚Ç¨36.8 million. This performance is underpinned by vigorous growth in international markets which  for the first time in the Group‚Äôs history  represent 54% of total revenue  including 24% for North America.Sidetrade‚Äôs economic model provides its business with significant resilience  as 90% of its revenue is recurring  representing a significant advantage in the current and future international environment.All multi-year contracts are indexed to inflation (the Syntec for Southern Europe  the UK CPI for Northern Europe and the US CPI for the United States)  which alters the total price of SaaS subscriptions each year by reference to changes in these price indices.Sidetrade therefore has robust pricing power that protects the Company‚Äôs future revenue against uncertainties and inflationary pressures. At present  Sidetrade perfectly combines its sound fundamentals with a highly favorable growth outlook.In respect of fiscal 2022  the impact of exchange rates on the Company was not material.Next financial announcement2022 Annual Results: April 4  2023  after the stock market closes.Investor relationsChristelle Dhrif +33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comMedia relationsBecca Parlby +44 7824 505 584 bparlby@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.

However  the importance of tokenisation for Europe  i.e. the transfer of real assets (digital or otherwise) to the blockchain  is generally underestimated.In the context of this report  a token represents an asset in a digital form combined with information and assignable digital rights. The token is a reference (i.e. identifier) that maps back to sensitive data through a tokenisation system and can represent either tangible physical assets or intangible assets that themselves only exist in digital form.How can tokenisation change our lives?Thanks to the breakthrough of distributed ledger (e.g. blockchain) technology  tokenisation has spread in many areas and can cover lots of use cases like paying with a digital car wallet  stable coins or future digital Euro  creating digital twin and Digital ID  securing M2M communication.Simple regulatory framework and more digital know-how can boost innovationWorldline and peer field experts are collaborating to create an interoperable trusted layer to enable all the truly digitised and automated services we have been expecting  allowing Europe to master its services and ideally lead the industry forward.Thanks to its long technological experience and expertise in transaction and payment management  including complex  security and regulatory constraints  Worldline is ideally placed to support industry players  banks  public institutions  transport operators and others  unleashing for them the token economy  thereby improving the transparency  safety and efficiency of all their transactions.Europe must succeed in fully exploiting the potential of tokenisation in the coming years.

First one  the health restrictions linked to the Covid-19 epidemic  and mainly the vaccination pass  until mid-March 2022  penalized the Group. The second  the total lifting of these allowed the Group to regain a very satisfactory dynamism.The +81.8% increase in Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) compared to the 2021 financial year is the direct consequence of the closure of the Group's establishments in France and abroad for just over half of 2021. And this  despite the departure from the scope of consolidation of the Ostend casino at the end of July 2021 (and correlatively of its very dynamic online gaming and related sports betting activities) and the sale of shares in the Crans-Montana casino on 31st January  2022.Thus  the GGR increased over the financial year to reach ‚Ç¨ 636.7 M  compared to ‚Ç¨ 350.2 M in 2021. It benefited from the growth in the GGR of slot machines (+122.6%) and the GGR of traditional games (+8.9%)  the latter increasing in particular by +158.9% in France.The Net Gaming Revenue (NGR) is generally on the rise reaching ‚Ç¨ 305.5 M.At the same time  the turnover excluding NGR rose by ‚Ç¨ 44.9 M to ‚Ç¨ 86.1 M.The consolidated 2022 turnover increased by +52.0% reaching ‚Ç¨ 388.8 M.Return to a good financial performanceThe very good operational performance allows to generate an EBITDA (IFRS 16) of ‚Ç¨ 75.6 M over the period (compared to ‚Ç¨ 13.0 M in 2021). The EBITDA margin on revenue was 19.4%  an improvement of 14.3 points compared to 2021.Story continuesThe current operating income (COI) became positive again reaching ‚Ç¨ 23.1 M  thanks to the reopening of all the sites over the whole financial year  and mainly the casinos division.Purchases & External expenses are down by ‚Ç¨ 9.1 M  impacted mainly by:the downward trend in subcontracting expenses (-‚Ç¨ 48.7 M)  mainly linked to the absence of expenses related to the operation of online licenses in Belgium in 2022 (-‚Ç¨ 53.8 M of expenses)  following the cessation of activity in July 2021 (online casino and sports betting);in the opposite direction  there is an increase in subcontracting costs (security  cleaning) in the other establishments  given the reopening of the establishments (+‚Ç¨ 3.9 M);purchases of materials  advertising/marketing costs  upkeep and maintenance costs up respectively +‚Ç¨ 17.2 M (+82.9%)  +‚Ç¨ 11.8 M (+128.4 %) and +‚Ç¨ 2.5 M (+33.3%) directly linked to the reopening of establishments and the increase in turnover from ancillary activities;the increase in fees  advertising costs and subcontracting costs relating to the deployment of online games in Switzerland (+‚Ç¨ 0.7 M  +‚Ç¨ 2.5 M and +‚Ç¨ 0.4 M respectively).Taxes & duties increased from ‚Ç¨ 10.9 M in 2021 to ‚Ç¨ 17.3 M in 2022  i.e. + 58.7 % due to the resumption of the activity.Employees expenses reached ‚Ç¨ 168.0 M  up by ‚Ç¨ 63.8 M (+61.2 %)  i.e. a more normative level after two years of the business support measures put in place by the government in order to face the health crisis  in particular the use of the partial activity scheme from which the Group benefited. In addition  profit sharing paid to employees increased by +‚Ç¨ 4.1 M.The change in amortization and depreciation of fixed assets  down -8.3% to ‚Ç¨ 51.5 M  reflects scope effects and the slowdown in the investment policy usually sustained in recent years  but hampered by the health crisis.The item ‚ÄúOther current operating income and expenses‚Äù represents a net expense of ‚Ç¨ 6.9 M  compared to a net income of ‚Ç¨ 0.2 M over the previous financial year  additional ""closure"" aid amounting to ‚Ç¨ 4.9 M obtained from the government over the financial year in order to fight the consequences of the health crisis  being less than the ""fixed cost aid"" obtained in 2021 in the amount of ‚Ç¨ 10.0 M. In addition  expenses related to casino specifications are up (+‚Ç¨ 4.1 M in expenses)  correlatively to the GGR. Conversely  we note a favorable trend in changes in provisions.The non-current operating income is an income of + ‚Ç¨ 17.6 M compared to + ‚Ç¨ 0.9 M in 2021 which is explained by:the settlement of disputes with the ONSS (disputes with the Belgian social security regarding increases in social security contributions wrongly imposed on casinos during previous years) generating a non-recurring profit of ‚Ç¨ 3.4 M compared to ‚Ç¨ 11.8 M in N-1 on the one hand  and the compensation of ‚Ç¨ 9.5 M for the cessation of activity obtained from our former online partner in Belgium in N-1 on the other hand;a result on the sale of consolidated investments of ‚Ç¨ 14.1 M following the disposal of the entire 57% stake held by Groupe Partouche in the Crans-Montana casino;the absence of impairment of goodwill for the 2022 financial year  compared to an amount of ‚Ç¨ 18.5 M in 2021  reflecting the evolution of the health crisis.Consequently  the operating income reached ‚Ç¨ 40.7 M over the year compared to a loss of ‚Ç¨ 45.5 M in 2021.Finally  Groupe Partouche makes a profit of ‚Ç¨ 37.1 M (of which ‚Ç¨ 34.2 M Group‚Äôs share)  compared to - ‚Ç¨ 55.9 M in 2021 after taking into consideration the following elements:a financial income of -‚Ç¨ 2.3 M (compared to -‚Ç¨ 3.8 M in 2021). Due to the reopening of casinos on both sides of the Franco-Swiss border and the rise in the Swiss Franc over the 2022 financial year  foreign exchange gains recorded an increase of ‚Ç¨ 1.5 M compared to the previous year. In addition  the cost of financial debt is stable despite the sharp drop in the Group's gross debt due to the rise in the average annual interest rate;a significant decrease in tax expenses (CVAE included) (- ‚Ç¨ 1.2 M compared to - ‚Ç¨ 6.6 M in 2021).A solid financial structureBalance sheet assets amounted to ‚Ç¨ 798.3 M  up ‚Ç¨ 2.0 M. The main variations are as follows:increase in the ‚Äútangible fixed assets‚Äù item for ‚Ç¨ 56.6 M resulting in particular from IFRS 16 restatements of new real estate lease contracts linked to renewals of public service delegations (DSP);conversely  the drop in the ""Trade & other receivables"" item due  on the one hand  to the settlement of residual receivables relating to the Belgian online activity and its shutdown in July 2021 and  on the other hand  the presence at 31 st October 2021 of a receivable of ‚Ç¨ 5.5 M related to the compensation to be received from the City Hall of Saint-Amand-les-Eaux following the return of the casino property to the municipality within the framework of the renewal of the DSP (debt collected in 2022);the decrease in the cash flow (- ‚Ç¨ 11.9 M) correlated with the repayment of the second State Guaranteed Loan in the amount of ‚Ç¨ 59.5 M  mitigated by the income from the sale by Groupe Partouche of Crans-Montana casino and the good dynamism of the activity following the lifting of all health restrictions.On the liabilities side  the Group's equity  including minority interests  rose by ‚Ç¨ 38.6 M to ‚Ç¨ 354.0 M.At 31st October 2022  the financial debt decreased by ‚Ç¨ 9.7 M  totalling ‚Ç¨ 277.7 M under the combined effects of the following elements:The reimbursement of the second State Guaranteed Loan up to ‚Ç¨ 59.5 M as well as other banks loans for ‚Ç¨13.6M;The settlement of four quarterly installments of the syndicated loan for ‚Ç¨ 10.8 M;the setting up of new loans for ‚Ç¨ 21.6 M;the net impact of the restatement of rental contracts according to IFRS 16 for ‚Ç¨ 51.9 M (increasing in particular  in the subscriptions of new real estate contracts found as an increase in non-current assets  and a reduction in the payment of lease instalments practice).Net financial debt amounted to ‚Ç¨ 46.3 M (down by ‚Ç¨ 40.7 M). The Group's financial structure is improving and becoming extremely sound again  with leverage ratios (Net debt / EBITDA) and gearing ratios (Net debt / Equity) respectively at 0.7x (compared to 2.3x in N-21) and 0.1x (against 0.3x a year earlier for the latter).Confidence in the prospectsContinuation of the investment programme on the existing establishmentsAfter two years of the pandemic and the pause in investments  the Group is continuing to relaunch its program started in the previous financial year in order to enrich its offer and renovate its casinos network aiming at improving its performance  thus:extensive work is underway at the Annemasse casino and will in particular allow the opening of the left wing  the construction of an extension at the front of the building and the creation of two outdoor rooms;Le Lyon Vert casino in La Tour-de-Salvagny is undertaking a major restructuring of the existing spaces and the creation of a major extension on two levels (ground floor and 1 st floor);the Pasino at Saint-Amand-les-Eaux is undertaking major works to become one of the largest establishments in France  eventually offering a ""food-court"" restaurant open to all and a completely redesigned performance hall. Outside the concession and in the immediate vicinity of the casino  the hotel overlooking the new forecourt will have increased logging capacity. In addition  the creation of a room for immersive digital experiences will allow the organization of multiple permanent or ephemeral events and exhibitions;other sites redevelopments will be initiated in the 2023 financial year in the casinos of Vichy  Divonne  Contrex√©ville  Middelkerke as well as in the 3.14 hotel in Cannes.Bolstered by the results obtained since the lifting of health restrictions and thanks to the relevance of its innovative products offering strategy  Groupe Partouche is confident about its prospects. The Group is continuing the investment program aimed at strengthening the activity of its establishments while maintaining a healthy and solid financial situation.Upcoming events:- Turnover 1st quarter (Nov. 2022-Jan. 2023): Tuesday 14th March 2023 (after stock market closure)- General Meeting: Wednesday 22nd March 2023Groupe Partouche was established in 1973 and has grown to become one of the market leaders in Europe in its business sector.

All the operating expenses increased by +‚Ç¨ 76.2 M and notably include an increase in employees expenses (+‚Ç¨ 54.5 M  i.e. +64.3%) due to the end of the partial activity of most of the Group's employees which had prevailed during the closures of operations in the 2021 financial year.

Companies and investors now search for alternatives  including swaps  buybacks and direct payments to bondholders.Some companies like fertilizer producer Uralkali  miner Norilsk Nikel and metals giant Metalloinvest have opted to change bond documentation and pay the debt directly to investors in rubles  the outlet said. The country‚Äôs energy major Gazprom and one of the world‚Äôs largest steel producers  Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works PJSC  have swapped some of their eurobonds for ruble debt.Gazprom Deputy Chairman Famil Sadygov told Bloomberg that replacement bonds were ‚Äúthe most reliable way‚Äù to service debt given the restrictions on financial infrastructure. He noted that holdings of ten of the bonds have already been substituted and another 12 will be replaced by the end of March  adding that Gazprom pays coupons on both the swapped Russian bonds and the remaining international bonds.Following EU sanctions  Europe‚Äôs two major central depositories ‚Äì Euroclear and Clearstream ‚Äì have only been processing transactions verified by paying agents. The clearing houses have been reluctant to process corporate actions  forcing companies to find ways to bypass European depositories.Companies have realized that sanctions have disrupted so many processes needed to keep bonds that it‚Äôs become necessary to take them out of the market.A portfolio manager at Armbrok investment company  Dmitry Dorofeev  told Bloomberg that ‚Äúin a couple of months everything is going to be bought out‚Äù by local investors  adding that ‚ÄúRussian companies will replace bonds and return to Russia.‚ÄùRussia‚Äôs international corporate bond market declined by about $12.7 billion from $85.6 billion since the imposition of Ukraine-related sanctions on Moscow  according to the outlet.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,negative,0.0,0.06,0.94,True,English,"['Russian companies', 'new ways', 'debt', 'Bloomberg', 'Gazprom Deputy Chairman Famil Sadygov', 'two major central depositories', 'international corporate bond market', 'energy major Gazprom', 'metals giant Metalloinvest', 'largest steel producers', 'Steel Works PJSC', 'Armbrok investment company', 'critical financial operations', 'remaining international bonds', 'bond documentation', 'corporate actions', 'European depositories', 'financial processes', 'financial infrastructure', 'unsanctioned ones', 'Wall Street', 'large number', 'direct payments', 'fertilizer producer', 'Norilsk Nikel', 'Magnitogorsk Iron', 'reliable way', 'paying agents', 'clearing houses', 'many processes', 'portfolio manager', 'Dmitry Dorofeev', 'business section', 'servicing bonds', 'replacement bonds', 'Russian bonds', 'Western sanctions', 'EU sanctions', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'outstanding debt', 'ruble debt', 'biggest companies', 'local investors', 'Russian companies', 'firms', 'eurobonds', 'denomination', 'outlet', 'Bloomberg', 'Monday', 'Restrictions', 'borrower', 'alternatives', 'swaps', 'buybacks', 'bondholders', 'Uralkali', 'miner', 'rubles', 'country', 'world', 'holdings', 'end', 'March', 'coupons', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'transactions', 'ways', 'couple', 'months', 'everything', 'Moscow', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-01-25,2023-01-25,rt.com

If you are in any doubt about your position  you should consult your professional adviser in the relevant territory.PART IV ‚Äì RISK FACTORSPrior to deciding whether or not to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should carefully consider this Tender Document in its entirety  as well as the section ""Risk Factors"" in the DCAC IPO Prospectus and the risk factors discussed in the section ""Risk Factors"" in the Shareholders Circular dated 20 December 2022 (the ""Circular"").The risks described below have emerged or changed in light of the Tender Offer. The occurrence of any of the risks below could have a material adverse effect on the Tender Offer and on the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares.All of these risk factors and events are contingencies that may or may not occur. A number of these risks described below may occur simultaneously. The order in which these risks are presented is not necessarily an indication of the likelihood of the risks actually materialising  of the potential significance of the risks or of the scope of any potential negative impact to the Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should carefully consider all of the risk factors set out in this Part IV.Although the Company believes that the risks described below are the material risks concerning the Tender Offer  they are not the only risks relating to the Tender Offer. Other risks  events  facts or circumstances not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial could  individually or cumulatively  prove to be important and may have a significant negative impact on the Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders can only tender up to 95% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will consequently retain 5% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares.Under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders can only tender up to 95% of their shareholding in the Company. As a result  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will in any case retain 5% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares and remain DCAC Ordinary Shareholder in the Company for the remainder of their shareholding. Other than through the Stub Tender Offer  which is  at the date of this Tender Document still subject to approval by an extraordinary general meeting of the Company and which is only available for DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tendered their full entitlement of DCAC Ordinary Shares under this Tender Offer  there is no certainty that DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will be able to sell or otherwise dispose of their Remaining Holding  should they so wish.As the Sponsor may not tender its DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer and/or other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may decide not to tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may experience immediate and substantial dilution of their shareholding in the Company.The Sponsor may (or may not) tender its DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer. In addition  other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may decide not to tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares. As a result  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may experience an immediate and substantial dilution of their shareholding in the Company  causing the Sponsor and/or such other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders to obtain increased voting power  thereby increasing their respective influence over all matters requiring DCAC Ordinary Shareholder approval and decreasing your influence over matters presented to the DCAC Ordinary Shareholders for approval  including  subject to the Amended Articles  approval of a future business combination.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tender their DCAC Ordinary Shares may suffer from reduced value or proceeds in future.Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares will experience an immediate and substantial dilution of their shareholding in the Company  so that the Sponsor and other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will obtain an increased proportion of the economic value of the Company. Whilst there is no guarantee of future success  such tendering DCAC Ordinary Shareholder may accordingly suffer reduced overall value compared to those DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender their DCAC Ordinary Shares.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders cannot withdraw their tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares without the written consent of the Company or once their tender has become unconditional.Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares will be deemed to have agreed that  in consideration of the Company to process his tender  such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder will not revoke its tender or its DCAC Ordinary Shares without the prior consent of the Company. Once tendered  a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder can therefore not withdraw its tender under the Tender Offer  unless the Company consents to such withdrawal.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares will be locked.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares will be locked. During this period  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will not be able to (re)sell  pledge  encumber or otherwise transfer such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares or any rights related thereto.The Tender Offer is subject to certain conditions and the Board may decide to postpone or terminate the Tender Offer at any time prior to the purchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer as a result of which DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share at a later point in time or not at all.The Tender Offer is subject to the conditions that (a) there has been no Material Adverse Change nor Force Majeure Event  (b) the Board being satisfied that the Company has in its control or to its order the aggregate of the Offer Price for all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares  the aggregate of the Offer Price previously credited to the Escrow Account  (c) the Board continuing to be satisfied that that the Company will  immediately following the purchase of all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares (as if all DCAC Ordinary Shareholders were to tender for acquisition their full entitlement)  satisfy the statutory solvency test prescribed by the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 as amended and (d) the Tender Offer is not terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Tender Offer Document. The Company may at its sole discretion terminate or postpone the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Tender Offer Document  if the Company (acting through the Directors) considers in its reasonable opinion that (a) it has become unlawful  impractical or inappropriate for the Company to fund the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares without materially harming DCAC Ordinary Shareholders as a whole or (b) the completion of the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer would have material adverse fiscal or other consequences (whether by reason of a change in legislation or practice or otherwise) for the Company or its DCAC Ordinary Shareholders taken as a whole if the Tender Offer were to proceed or (c) if the Company will not immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Tender Offer  continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test under the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008  as amended. If these conditions are not met or if the Board decides to delay or terminate the Tender Offer prior to the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share at a later point in time or not at all.The net consideration received by a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder may be less than ¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary ShareThe cash consideration of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share does not include costs relating to a Shareholder‚Äôs broker  bank or other financial intermediary or advisor. Nor is the Company responsible for any taxes  duties or similar imposts suffered by the Shareholder. The net payment per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share received by DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may therefore be lower than the ¬£10.789 repurchase price.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date and such deadline may differ for each individual broker  bank or other financial intermediary. The Company does not have any knowledge on such deadlines and therefore the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder should consult its broker  bank or other financial intermediary in this regard.Any tenders not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Tender Document and in a timely manner may be invalid.Submitting a tender that is not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Tender Document  may result in an invalid tender and ultimately not being able to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer (thereby also not receiving the cash consideration of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share). DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that none of Van Lanschot Kempen  Admina  the Company or any other person is or will be obliged to give notice of any defects  irregularities  omissions  delays or non-receipts in tenders of DCAC Ordinary Shareholders  and that none of them will incur any liability for failure to give any such notice.The Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase up to 95% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares  and following the Tender Offer you will no longer have a repurchase right  other than potentially through the Stub Tender Offer.The Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase up to 95% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that the articles of association of the Company no longer provide for a repurchase right and that there is no assurance that the Company will provide for such a repurchase right in the future  other than potentially through the Stub Tender Offer. There is therefore no assurance that DCAC Ordinary Shareholders can have their DCAC Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Company other than through this one-time Tender Offer and the Stub Tender Offer.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender their full entitlement of DCAC Ordinary Shares will not be eligible to use the balance of DCAC Ordinary Shares not so tendered to participate in the Stub Tender OfferThe Company intends  through the Stub Tender Offer  to offer DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders the opportunity to tender for repurchase up to 5% of DCAC Ordinary Shares (that are not the subject of and are not tenders for purchase under this Tender Offer) held as at the Record Date (at all times subject to the Stub Tender Offer being limited to 325 000 DCAC Ordinary Shares in aggregate) and all of their DCAC Public Warrants  provided that should DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Warrant Holders decide to tender  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders shall be required to tender their entire holdings of DCAC Public Warrants together with their DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Stub Tender Offer as at the Record Date. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that their decision to offer DCAC Ordinary Shares under this Tender Offer therefore also affects their eligibility to offer DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Stub Tender Offer and that tendering less than their full entitlement of DCAC Ordinary Shares  or nothing at all  will result in their being ineligible to tender such DCAC Ordinary Shares in the Stub Tender Offer.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may face a significant decrease in net asset value of their shareholdingFollowing the provision and distribution of cash to meet the Tender Offer  a substantial part of DCAC‚Äôs then remaining cash will be applied to settle outstanding liabilities  resulting in limited remaining assets and a decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share. This may in particular affect DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares  as they will not receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary Share for DCAC Ordinary Shares that they do not (successfully) tender. If the Company is wound up or liquidated in the future  the decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share may result in DCAC Ordinary Shareholders receiving substantially less than ¬£10.25 per DCAC Ordinary Share or nothing at all.There is no guarantee that DCAC will be able to satisfy the statutory solvency test following the acquisition of DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Tender OfferPursuant to section 320 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008  as amended  the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Tender Offer would be considered to be a distribution for the purposes of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 and therefore the Board must comply with section 303 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 in respect of making distributions  including ensuring satisfaction of the statutory ""solvency test"" as defined in section 527 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 being (in respect of companies that are not ""supervised companies""  like DCAC) that DCAC is able to pay its debts as they become due and that the value of DCAC's assets is greater than the value of its liabilities. There is no guarantee that DCAC will  immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Tender Offer  meet and/or continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test.The repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares by the Company may result in taxes being imposed on the Company or on DCAC Ordinary Shareholders.The repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares by the Company may result in taxes  duties or other imposts being imposed on the Company or on DCAC Ordinary Shareholders as at the date of such repurchase or redemption. The Company is not responsible for any taxes  duties or other imposts that are imposed on a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and the Company does not intend to make any cash distributions to DCAC Ordinary Shareholders to pay any such taxes  duties or other imposts. The materialisation of this risk may adversely affect the post-tax return for certain DCAC Ordinary Shareholders.DEFINITIONSThe following definitions apply throughout this Tender Document unless the context requires otherwise.""Admina"" means Admina Fund Services Limited;‚ÄúAdmitted Institution‚Äù means the institutions admitted to Euroclear Nederland other than Van Lanschot Kempen  in its capacity as listing  transfer and paying agent to the Company for the DCAC Ordinary Shares held through Euroclear Nederland;""AFM"" means the Dutch Authority for Financial Markets;""Board"" means the board of directors of the Company;‚ÄúClosing Date‚Äù means 16:00 (CET) on 22 February 2023;‚ÄúCompany‚Äù means Disruptive Capital Acquisition Company Limited;‚ÄúDCAC Ordinary Shareholders‚Äù means holders of DCAC Ordinary Shares;""DCAC Ordinary Shares"" means the ordinary shares of ¬£0.0001 each in the capital of the Company;""DCAC Public Warrants"" means the redeemable public warrants issued by the Company;""DCAC Sponsor Warrants"" means the warrants issued to the Sponsor;""DCAC Warrant Holders"" means the holders of DCAC Warrants;""DCAC Warrants"" means the DCAC Public Warrants and DCAC Sponsor Warrants;""Directors"" means the directors of the Company from time to time;""Escrow Account"" means the escrow account opened by the Company;‚ÄúEuroclear Nederland‚Äù means Nederlands Centraal Instituut voor Giraal Effectenverkeer B.V.  the central securities depositary and settlement system in the Netherlands;‚ÄúEuronext Amsterdam‚Äù means Euronext in Amsterdam  the regulated market operated by Euronext Amsterdam N.V.;‚ÄúFinal Settlement Date‚Äù means 24 February 2023  or as soon as practicable thereafter;""Force Majeure Event"" means any circumstance not within the Company's control including  without limitation:(a) acts of God  flood  drought  earthquake or other natural disaster;(b) epidemic or pandemic;(c) terrorist attack  civil war  civil commotion or riots  war  threat of or preparation for war  armed conflict  imposition of sanctions  embargo  or breaking off of diplomatic relations;(d) nuclear  chemical or biological contamination or sonic boom;(e) any law or any action taken by a government or public authority  including without limitation imposing an export or import restriction  quota or prohibition  or failing to grant a necessary licence or consent;(f) collapse of buildings  fire  explosion or accident;(g) any labour or trade dispute  strikes  industrial action or lockouts;(h) non-performance by suppliers or subcontractors; and(i) interruption or failure of a utility service;""Material Adverse Change"" means a material adverse change in the business  assets  properties  liabilities (actual or contingent)  operations  condition (financial or otherwise)  or prospects of the Company and/or the Sponsor  individually  or taken as a whole;‚ÄúOffer Price‚Äù means the offer price for the Tender Offer being ¬£10.789 per repurchased DCAC Ordinary Share;‚ÄúRecord Date‚Äù means 17:40 (CET) on 10 February 2023;‚ÄúRegister‚Äù means the register of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Ordinary Shareholders of the Company;‚ÄúRemaining Holding‚Äù has the meaning given that term in Part II of this Tender Document;""Sponsor"" means Disruptive Capital GP Limited  a non-cellular company limited by shares incorporated in Guernsey under registration number 61432;""Stub Tender Offer"" means the offer by the Company to acquire up to 5% of the DCAC Ordinary Shares not subject to the Tender Offer and all DCAC Warrants;‚ÄúTender Document‚Äù means this document;‚ÄúTender Offer‚Äù means the tender offer by the Company to DCAC Ordinary Shareholders to tender up to 95% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares on the terms and conditions set out in this Tender Document and  where the context admits  any revision or subsequent version  variation  extension or renewal thereof;‚ÄúTender Offer Authority‚Äù means the authority granted by the DCAC Ordinary Shareholders at the Company‚Äôs adjourned extraordinary general meeting held on 18 January 2023 to acquire up to 95 per cent.

Stub Tender OfferIf the Company (acting through the DCAC Directors)  at any time prior to the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants tendered in the Stub Tender Offer (and including where it has previously deferred the Closing Date in accordance with paragraph 2.2 of this section 5) considers that  in its reasonable opinion  either:it has become unlawful  impractical or inappropriate for the Company to fund the purchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants pursuant to the Stub Tender Offer without materially harming DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders as a whole; or the completion of the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer would have material adverse fiscal or other consequences (whether by reason of a change in legislation or practice or otherwise) for the Company or its DCAC Ordinary Shareholders or its DCAC Public Warrant Holders taken as a whole if the Tender Offer were to proceed; or the Company will not  immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants validly tendered in the Stub Tender Offer  continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test under the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008  as amended the Company shall be entitled at its discretion to delay or terminate the Stub Tender Offer by a public announcement to DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders.Settlement9.1 Subject to paragraphs 2.2 and 8 of this section 5  the Company will use all reasonable endeavours  and intends to promptly settle the applicable Offer Price payable to a tendering DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder pursuant to valid tenders accepted by the Company by 20 March 2023 (the ""Final Settlement Date"").9.2 If due solely to a Material Adverse Change or Force Majeure Event  the Company is unable to fund the payment of the applicable Offer Price for all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants which would be settled by the Final Settlement Date  the Company may terminate the Stub Tender Offer in accordance with paragraph 8 of this section 5 at any time prior to effecting the purchase of the relevant DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants pursuant to the Stub Tender Offer.9.3 The payment of any consideration for DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants pursuant to the Stub Tender Offer will be made to the Admitted Institution who has delivered the tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCC Public Warrants pursuant to the Stub Tender Offer following a valid instruction to them (in an acceptable form)  via any (sub) custodian  for and on behalf of a tendering DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder.10 Effect

Public Warrant Holders to the jurisdiction of the courts of Guernsey in relation to all matters arising out of or in connection with the Stub Tender Offer.10.2 To the extent not prohibited by or ineffective under applicable law  each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder by whom or on whose behalf a tender through an Admitted Institution is given irrevocably agrees to assume liability for  pay and indemnify the Company from and against any and all liabilities  obligations  damages  losses  settlements  judgments  claims  actions  suits  penalties  costs  expenses and other sanctions (civil or criminal) suffered or incurred by either of them as a result of the breach by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders of any of the undertakings  representations  warranties  or agreements contained in paragraph 8.1 of this Part III.10.3 A reference above to a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders includes a reference to the person or persons giving tender through an Admitted Institution. In the event of more than one person giving a tender through an Admitted Institution  the above provisions will apply to them jointly and severally.11 Tenders through Euroclear Nederland11.1 Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder by whom  or on whose behalf  a tender through an Admitted Institution is made irrevocably undertakes  represents  warrants and agrees to and with the Company (so as to bind it  its personal representatives  custodian  sub-custodian  heirs  successors and assigns) on the date that such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are tendered up to and including the Final Settlement Date that:(a) the tender of any DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants constitutes an acceptance by the holder of the DCAC Ordinary Shares of the terms  conditions and restrictions of the Stub Tender Offer;(b) such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder is not over-tendering his/her position by tendering 5% of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and all of the DCAC Public Warrants held by it and will deliver the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants on the Closing Date;(c) such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder has full power and authority to tender  sell and deliver  and has not entered into any other agreement to tender  sell or deliver the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants stated to have been tendered to any party other than the Company (together with all rights attaching thereto) and  when such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are purchased by the Company for cash  the Company acquires such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  with full title guarantee and free from all liens  charges  encumbrances  rights of pre-emption or other third party rights of any nature and together with all the rights attaching thereto;(d) such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are being tendered in compliance with the restrictions set out in this Circular and the securities and other applicable laws or regulations of the jurisdiction in which the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders is located or of which it is a resident and no registration  approval or filing with any regulatory authority of such jurisdiction is required in connection with the tendering of such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants; and(e) if requested by the Company or Van Lanschot Kempen  provide the legal name of the beneficial DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders wishing to tender.12 Restricted jurisdictions12.1 The making of the Stub Tender Offer in  or to persons who are citizens or nationals of  or resident in  jurisdictions outside Guernsey or the Netherlands or custodians  nominees or trustees for citizens  nationals or residents of jurisdictions outside Guernsey or the Netherlands may be prohibited or affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders who are not resident in Guernsey or the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal requirements. It is the responsibility of any DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder wishing to make a tender to satisfy himself  herself or itself as to the full observance of the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in connection with the Stub Tender Offer  including the obtaining of any governmental  exchange control or other consents which may be required  the compliance with other necessary formalities and the payment of any transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due in such jurisdiction. Any such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder will be responsible for payment of any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due by whomsoever payable and the Company and any person acting on its behalf shall be fully indemnified and held harmless by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder for any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments such person may be required to pay.

If you are in any doubt about your position  you should consult your professional adviser in the relevant territory.RISK FACTORSPrior to deciding whether or not to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should carefully consider this Circular in its entirety  as well as the section ""Risk Factors"" in the DCAC IPO Prospectus and the risk factors discussed in the section ""Risk Factors"" in the Shareholders Circular dated 20 December 2022 (the ""December Circular"").The risks described below have emerged or changed in light of the Stub Tender Offer. The occurrence of any of the risks below could have a material adverse effect on the Stub Tender Offer and on the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants.All of these risk factors and events are contingencies that may or may not occur. A number of these risks described below may occur simultaneously. The order in which these risks are presented is not necessarily an indication of the likelihood of the risks actually materialising  of the potential significance of the risks or of the scope of any potential negative impact to the Stub Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should carefully consider all of the risk factors set out in this section 6.Although the Company believes that the risks described below are the material risks concerning the Stub Tender Offer  they are not the only risks relating to the Stub Tender Offer. Other risks  events  facts or circumstances not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial could  individually or cumulatively  prove to be important and may have a significant negative impact on the Stub Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders cannot withdraw their tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants without the written consent of the Company or once their tender has become unconditional.Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be deemed to have agreed that  in consideration of the Company to process his tender  such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder will not revoke its tender or its DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants without the prior written consent of the Company. Once tendered  a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder can therefore not withdraw its tender under the Stub Tender Offer  unless the Company consents to such withdrawal. Once the tender has become unconditional  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders cannot withdraw their DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants tendered under the Stub Tender Offer.As the DCAC Sponsor and/or other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may decide to not participate in the Stub Tender Offer  they may obtain a controlling interest in the Company.The DCAC Sponsor and/or such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder may decide not to participate in the Stub Tender Offer. This may cause the DCAC Sponsor and/or such other DCAC Ordinary Shareholder to obtain increased voting power  which may results in a controlling interest and a decisive influence over all matters requiring DCAC Ordinary Shareholder approval  including  subject to the Amended Articles  approval of a future business combination.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be locked.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be locked. During this period  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders will not be able to (re)sell  pledge  encumber or otherwise transfer such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares  DCAC Public Warrants or any rights related thereto.The Stub Tender Offer is subject to certain conditions and the DCAC Board may decide to postpone or terminate the Stub Tender Offer at any time prior to the purchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer as a result of which DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders may receive the repurchase price tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and DCAC Public Warrants  as applicable  at a later point in time or not at all.The Stub Tender Offer is subject to the conditions that (a) the Stub Tender Resolutions being passed at the EGM  (b) there has been no Material Adverse Change nor Force Majeure Event  (c) the DCAC Board being satisfied that the Company has in its control or to its order the aggregate of the Offer Price for all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  the aggregate of the Offer Price previously credited to the Escrow Account  (d) the DCAC Board continuing to be satisfied that that the Company will  immediately following the purchase of all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants (as if all DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders were to tender for acquisition their full entitlement)  satisfy the statutory solvency test prescribed by the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 as amended and (e) the Stub Tender Offer is not terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Tender Offer Document. The Company may at its sole discretion terminate or postpone the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in this Circular  if the Company (acting through the DCAC Directors) considers in its reasonable opinion that (a) it has become unlawful  impractical or inappropriate for the Company to fund the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants without materially harming DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders as a whole or (b) the completion of the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer would have material adverse fiscal or other consequences (whether by reason of a change in legislation or practice or otherwise) for the Company or its DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders taken as a whole if the Stub Tender Offer were to proceed or (c) if the Company will not immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants validly tendered in the Tender Offer  continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test under the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008  as amended. If these conditions are not met or if the Board decides to delay or terminate the Tender Offer prior to the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and the DCAC Public Warrant Holders may receive the repurchase price of up to ¬£2.20 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per tendered DCAC Public Warrant at a later point in time or not at all.The net consideration received by a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder may be less than ¬£2.20 per DCAC Ordinary Share and less than ¬£0.066 per DCAC Public Warrant.The cash consideration of up to ¬£2.20 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per tendered DCAC Public Warrant does not include costs relating to a Shareholder‚Äôs or Warrant Holder's broker  bank or other financial intermediary or advisor. Nor is the Company responsible for any taxes  duties or similar imposts suffered by the Shareholder or Warrant Holder. The net payment per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share received by DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant received by DCAC Public Warrant Holders may therefore be lower than the maximum ¬£2.20 and ¬£0.066  as applicable  repurchase price.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date and such deadline may differ for each individual broker  bank or other financial intermediary. The Company does not have any knowledge on such deadlines and therefore the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should consult its broker  bank or other financial intermediary in this regard.Any tenders not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Circular may be invalid.Submitting a tender that is not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Circular  may result in an invalid tender and ultimately not being able to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer (thereby also not receiving the cash consideration of up to ¬£2.20 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per tendered DCAC Public Warrant). DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should note that none of Van Lanschot Kempen  Admina  the Company or any other person is or will be obliged to give notice of any defects  irregularities  omissions  delays or non-receipts in tenders of DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders  and that none of them will incur any liability for failure to give any such notice.The Stub Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase 5% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares and all of your DCAC Public Warrants  and following the Stub Tender Offer you will no longer have a repurchase right.The Stub Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase up to 5% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares and all of your DCAC Public Warrants. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should note that the articles of incorporation of the Company no longer provide for a repurchase right and that there is no assurance that the Company will provide for such a repurchase right in the future. There is therefore no assurance that DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders can have their DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants repurchased by the Company other than through this one-time Stub Tender Offer.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may face a significant decrease in net asset value of their shareholdingFollowing the provision and distribution of cash to meet the Repurchase Offer  a substantial part of DCAC‚Äôs then remaining cash will be applied to settle outstanding liabilities  resulting in limited remaining assets and a decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share. This may in particular affect DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares  as they will not receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary Share for DCAC Ordinary Shares that they do not (successfully) tender. If the Company is wound up or liquidated in the future  the decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share may result in DCAC Ordinary Shareholders receiving substantially less than ¬£10.25 per DCAC Ordinary Share or nothing at all.There is no guarantee that DCAC will be able to satisfy the statutory solvency test following the acquisition of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants validly tendered in the Stub Tender OfferPursuant to section 320 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008  as amended  the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Stub Tender Offer would be considered to be a distribution for the purposes of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 and therefore the DCAC Board must comply with section 303 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 in respect of making distributions  including ensuring satisfaction of the statutory ""solvency test"" as defined in section 527 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 being (in respect of companies that are not ""supervised companies""  like DCAC) that DCAC is able to pay its debts as they become due and that the value of DCAC's assets is greater than the value of its liabilities. There is no guarantee that DCAC will  immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Stub Tender Offer  meet and/or continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test.The repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants by the Company may result in taxes being imposed on the Company or on DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders.The repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants by the Company may result in taxes being imposed on the Company or on DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders as at the date of such repurchase or redemption. The Company does not intend to make any cash distributions to DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders to pay any such taxes. The materialisation of this risk may adversely affect the post-tax return for certain DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders.OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATIONInformation Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this Circular other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements.

OfferIf the Company (acting through the Directors)  at any time prior to the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares tendered in the Tender Offer (and including where it has previously deferred the Closing Date in accordance with paragraph 2.2 of this Part III) considers that  in its reasonable opinion  either:(a) it has become unlawful  impractical or inappropriate for the Company to fund the purchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Tender Offer without materially harming DCAC Ordinary Shareholders as a whole; or(b) the completion of the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer would have material adverse fiscal or other consequences (whether by reason of a change in legislation or practice or otherwise) for the Company or its DCAC Ordinary Shareholders taken as a whole if the Tender Offer were to proceed; or(c) the Company will not  immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Tender Offer  continue to

Adverse Change or Force Majeure Event  the Company is unable to fund the payment of the Offer Price for allsuccessfully tendered Shares which would be settled by the Final Settlement Date  the Company

DCAC Ordinary Shareholder to the jurisdiction of the courts of Guernsey in relation to all matters arising out of or in connection with the Tender Offer.8.2 To the extent not prohibited by or ineffective under applicable law  each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder by whom or on whose behalf a tender through an Admitted Institution is given irrevocably agrees to assume liability for  pay and indemnify the Company from and against any and all liabilities  obligations  damages  losses  settlements  judgments  claims  actions  suits  penalties  costs  expenses and other sanctions (civil or criminal) suffered or incurred by either of them as a result of the breach by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder of any of the undertakings  representations  warranties  or agreements contained in

DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who are not resident in Guernsey or the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal requirements. It is the responsibility of any DCAC Ordinary Shareholder wishing to make a tender to satisfy himself  herself or itself as to the full observance of the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in connection with the Tender Offer  including the obtaining of any governmental  exchange control or other consents which may berequired  the compliance with other necessary formalities and the payment of any transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due insuch jurisdiction. Any such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder will be responsible for payment of any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due by whomsoever payable and the Company and any person acting on its behalf shall be fully indemnified and heldharmless by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder for any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments such person may be required to pay. No steps have been taken to authorise the extending of the Tender Offer in any territory outside Guernsey or the Netherlands.10.2 The provisions of this paragraph and any other terms of the Tender Offer relating to shareholders outside Guernsey and the Netherlands may be waived  varied or modified as regards specific DCAC Ordinary Shareholders or on a general basis by the Company.10.3 The provisions of this paragraph 10 supersede any terms of the Tender Offer which may be inconsistent with it.10.4 All DCAC Ordinary Shareholders wishing to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares in the Tender Offer should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal or regulatory requirements. If you are in any doubt about your position  you should consult your professional adviser in the relevant territory.PART IV ‚Äì RISK FACTORSPrior to deciding whether or not to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should carefully consider this Tender Document in its entirety  as well as the section ""Risk Factors"" in the DCAC IPO Prospectus and the risk factors discussed in the section ""Risk Factors"" in the Shareholders Circular dated 20 December 2022 (the ""Circular"").The risks described below have emerged or changed in light of the Tender Offer. The occurrence of any of the risks below could have a material adverse effect on the Tender Offer and on the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares.All of these risk factors and events are contingencies that may or may not occur. A number of these risks described below may occur simultaneously. The order in which these risks are presented is not necessarily an indication of the likelihood of the risks actually materialising  of the potential significance of the risks or of the scope of any potential negative impact to the Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should carefully consider all of the risk factors set out in this Part IV.Although the Company believes that the risks described below are the material risks concerning the Tender Offer  they are not the only risks relating to the Tender Offer. Other risks  events  facts or circumstances not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial could  individually or cumulatively  prove to be important and may have a significant negative impact on the Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders can only tender up to 95% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will consequently retain 5% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares.Under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders can only tender up to 95% of their shareholding in the Company. As a result  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will in any case retain 5% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares and remain DCAC Ordinary Shareholder in the Company for the remainder of their shareholding. Other than through the Stub Tender Offer  which is  at the date of this Tender Document still subject to approval by an extraordinary general meeting of the Company and which is only available for DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tendered their full entitlement of DCAC Ordinary Shares under this Tender Offer  there is no certainty that DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will be able to sell or otherwise dispose of their Remaining Holding  should they so wish.As the Sponsor may not tender its DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer and/or other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may decide not to tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may experience immediate and substantial dilution of their shareholding in the Company.The Sponsor may (or may not) tender its DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer. In addition  other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may decide not to tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares. As a result  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may experience an immediate and substantial dilution of their shareholding in the Company  causing the Sponsor and/or such other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders to obtain increased voting power  thereby increasing their respective influence over all matters requiring DCAC Ordinary Shareholder approval and decreasing your influence over matters presented to the DCAC Ordinary Shareholders for approval  including  subject to the Amended Articles  approval of a future business combination.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tender their DCAC Ordinary Shares may suffer from reduced value or proceeds in future.Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares will experience an immediate and substantial dilution of their shareholding in the Company  so that the Sponsor and other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will obtain an increased proportion of the economic value of the Company. Whilst there is no guarantee of future success  such tendering DCAC Ordinary Shareholder may accordingly suffer reduced overall value compared to those DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender their DCAC Ordinary Shares.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders cannot withdraw their tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares without the written consent of the Company or once their tender has become unconditional.Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares will be deemed to have agreed that  in consideration of the Company to process his tender  such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder will not revoke its tender or its DCAC Ordinary Shares without the prior consent of the Company. Once tendered  a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder can therefore not withdraw its tender under the Tender Offer  unless the Company consents to such withdrawal.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares will be locked.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares will be locked. During this period  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will not be able to (re)sell  pledge  encumber or otherwise transfer such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares or any rights related thereto.The Tender Offer is subject to certain conditions and the Board may decide to postpone or terminate the Tender Offer at any time prior to the purchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer as a result of which DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share at a later point in time or not at all.The Tender Offer is subject to the conditions that (a) there has been no Material Adverse Change nor Force Majeure Event  (b) the Board being satisfied that the Company has in its control or to its order the aggregate of the Offer Price for all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares  the aggregate of the Offer Price previously credited to the Escrow Account  (c) the Board continuing to be satisfied that that the Company will  immediately following the purchase of all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares (as if all DCAC Ordinary Shareholders were to tender for acquisition their full entitlement)  satisfy the statutory solvency test prescribed by the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 as amended and (d) the Tender Offer is not terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Tender Offer Document. The Company may at its sole discretion terminate or postpone the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Tender Offer Document  if the Company (acting through the Directors) considers in its reasonable opinion that (a) it has become unlawful  impractical or inappropriate for the Company to fund the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares without materially harming DCAC Ordinary Shareholders as a whole or (b) the completion of the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer would have material adverse fiscal or other consequences (whether by reason of a change in legislation or practice or otherwise) for the Company or its DCAC Ordinary Shareholders taken as a whole if the Tender Offer were to proceed or (c) if the Company will not immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Tender Offer  continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test under the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008  as amended. If these conditions are not met or if the Board decides to delay or terminate the Tender Offer prior to the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share at a later point in time or not at all.The net consideration received by a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder may be less than ¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary ShareThe cash consideration of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share does not include costs relating to a Shareholder‚Äôs broker  bank or other financial intermediary or advisor. Nor is the Company responsible for any taxes  duties or similar imposts suffered by the Shareholder. The net payment per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share received by DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may therefore be lower than the ¬£10.789 repurchase price.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date and such deadline may differ for each individual broker  bank or other financial intermediary. The Company does not have any knowledge on such deadlines and therefore the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder should consult its broker  bank or other financial intermediary in this regard.Any tenders not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Tender Document and in a timely manner may be invalid.Submitting a tender that is not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Tender Document  may result in an invalid tender and ultimately not being able to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer (thereby also not receiving the cash consideration of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share). DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that none of Van Lanschot Kempen  Admina  the Company or any other person is or will be obliged to give notice of any defects  irregularities  omissions  delays or non-receipts in tenders of DCAC Ordinary Shareholders  and that none of them will incur any liability for failure to give any such notice.The Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase up to 95% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares  and following the Tender Offer you will no longer have a repurchase right  other than potentially through the Stub Tender Offer.The Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase up to 95% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that the articles of association of the Company no longer provide for a repurchase right and that there is no assurance that the Company will provide for such a repurchase right in the future  other than potentially through the Stub Tender Offer. There is therefore no assurance that DCAC Ordinary Shareholders can have their DCAC Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Company other than through this one-time Tender Offer and the Stub Tender Offer.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender their full entitlement of DCAC Ordinary Shares will not be eligible to use the balance of DCAC Ordinary Shares not so tendered to participate in the Stub Tender OfferThe Company intends  through the Stub Tender Offer  to offer DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders the opportunity to tender for repurchase up to 5% of DCAC Ordinary Shares (that are not the subject of and are not tenders for purchase under this Tender Offer) held as at the Record Date (at all times subject to the Stub Tender Offer being limited to 325 000 DCAC Ordinary Shares in aggregate) and all of their DCAC Public Warrants  provided that should DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Warrant Holders decide to tender  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders shall be required to tender their entire holdings of DCAC Public Warrants together with their DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Stub Tender Offer as at the Record Date. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that their decision to offer DCAC Ordinary Shares under this Tender Offer therefore also affects their eligibility to offer DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Stub Tender Offer and that tendering less than their full entitlement of DCAC Ordinary Shares  or nothing at all  will result in their being ineligible to tender such DCAC Ordinary Shares in the Stub Tender Offer.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may face a significant decrease in net asset value of their shareholdingFollowing the provision and distribution of cash to meet the Tender Offer  a substantial part of DCAC‚Äôs then remaining cash will be applied to settle outstanding liabilities  resulting in limited remaining assets and a decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share. This may in particular affect DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares  as they will not receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary Share for DCAC Ordinary Shares that they do not (successfully) tender. If the Company is wound up or liquidated in the future  the decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share may result in DCAC Ordinary Shareholders receiving substantially less than ¬£10.25 per DCAC Ordinary Share or nothing at all.There is no guarantee that DCAC will be able to satisfy the statutory solvency test following the acquisition of DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Tender OfferPursuant to section 320 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008  as amended  the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Tender Offer would be considered to be a distribution for the purposes of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 and therefore the Board must comply with section 303 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 in respect of making distributions  including ensuring satisfaction of the statutory ""solvency test"" as defined in section 527 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 being (in respect of companies that are not ""supervised companies""  like DCAC) that DCAC is able to pay its debts as they become due and that the value of DCAC's assets is greater than the value of its liabilities.

17093,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inside-information-north-holdings-3-025300951.html,Inside information: North Holdings 3 Oy improves consideration  extends offer period and lowers the acceptance threshold of its tender offer; Caverion board renews its recommendation,"North Holdings 3 Oy (the ""Offeror"")  a private limited liability company incorporated and existing under the laws of Finland  that will be indirectly owned...","NOT FOR RELEASE  PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION  IN WHOLE OR IN PART  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  IN OR INTO AUSTRALIA  CANADA  HONG KONG  JAPAN  NEW ZEALAND OR SOUTH AFRICA OR IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE TENDER OFFER WOULD BE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.HELSINKI  Jan. 25  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- North Holdings 3 Oy (the ""Offeror"")  a private limited liability company incorporated and existing under the laws of Finland  that will be indirectly owned by a consortium led by North (BC) Lux Holdco SARL (""Bain Luxco"") (a vehicle owned and controlled by funds managed or advised by Bain Capital Private Equity (Europe)  LLP  and/or its affiliates (together ""Bain Capital"" and such funds being the ""Bain Capital Funds"")) and further including Security Trading Oy (""Security Trading"")  Fennogens Investments S.A. (""Fennogens"") and Corbis S.A. (""Corbis"") (together the ""Consortium"")  announced on November 3  2022  a voluntary recommended public cash tender offer for all the issued and outstanding shares in Caverion Corporation (""Caverion"" or the ""Company"") that are not held by Caverion or its subsidiaries (the ""Shares"" or  individually  a ""Share"") (the ""Tender Offer""). The Offeror and Caverion have today entered into an amendment to the combination agreement initially entered into by the Offeror and Caverion on November 3  2022 (the ""Combination Agreement"")  according to which the Offeror has  among other things  agreed to improve the consideration offered for each Share in the Tender Offer (the ""Improved Tender Offer"").KEY HIGHLIGHTS AND SUMMARY OF THE IMPROVED TENDER OFFERThe shareholders of Caverion are given the possibility to choose either: (i) a debt instrument entitling to a fixed cash payment of EUR 8.50 in nine months from the completion of the Improved Tender Offer (the "" Alternative Consideration "")  or (ii) an immediate cash consideration of EUR 8.00 (the "" Improved Cash Price "") upon completion of the Improved Tender Offer for each Share tendered in the Improved Tender Offer.The Alternative Consideration will be implemented by the Offeror by issuing debt instruments with the nominal principal amount of EUR 8.50  which will be redeemed at their full nominal amount upon their maturity nine months from their issuance ("" Alternative Consideration Instruments ""). Shareholders choosing the Alternative Consideration will be issued one Alternative Consideration Instrument for each Share tendered in the Tender Offer in connection with the completion trades of the Tender Offer. The equity commitments given to the Offeror by Bain Capital Funds and the other members of the Consortium to finance the Tender Offer have been amended to include financing also of the Alternative Consideration Instruments  so that their cash redemption by the Offeror will be backed by the funding commitments from the Consortium in the same way as funding for the Improved Cash Price.The Offeror has agreed to lower the minimum acceptance threshold of the Improved Tender Offer from more than 90 percent to more than 66 2/3 percent of all Shares.The Offeror will supplement the Tender Offer Document with detailed information on the terms and conditions of the Improved Tender Offer  including the Alternative Consideration Instruments  as soon as practically possible  and expects the supplement to be approved and published in early February. Shareholders of Caverion will be able to choose the Alternative Consideration when tendering into the Tender Offer only after the supplement to the Tender Offer Document has been published.The Offeror extends the offer period until February 28  2023  in order to ensure that the shareholders of Caverion have the possibility to carefully review the supplement to the Tender Offer Document and to evaluate the terms and conditions of the Improved Tender Offer. Given the advanced stage of the Offeror's regulatory clearance process  the Offeror is highly confident that the Improved Tender Offer can be completed in this timeline. On this basis  the Offeror currently estimates that the completion trades in the Tender Offer  and the payment of the Improved Cash Price for the shareholders who elect this option  would take place in the second half of March  2023 and that the cash redemption of the Alternative Consideration Instruments would take place in the second half of December  2023.The Offeror believes that the recommended Improved Tender Offer holds significant advantages  particularly in terms of transaction certainty and timeline  compared to the competing offer published by Crayfish BidCo Oy (the "" Crayfish Offer ""). Based on the experience of the Offeror's external legal advisers  the merger control review of Crayfish's Offer could take even up to 12 months or more from its announcement  and gives rise to significant execution risk. In contrast  the Offeror received unconditional merger control clearance from the European Commission on January 11  2023  and unconditional foreign investment clearances in Austria and Denmark on January 18 and January 20  2023  respectively  and expects to obtain the only outstanding regulatory approval soon.The Alternative Consideration represents a premium of 6.25 percent compared to the cash consideration of EUR 8.00 offered in the Crayfish Offer (without adjusting for the interest component included in the Crayfish Offer). The Alternative Consideration provides Caverion shareholders the possibility to receive a superior consideration to the Crayfish Offer with potentially an earlier payment date profile  given the complexities of the regulatory approvals for the Crayfish Offer  and without the long uncertainty relating to the fulfilment of offer conditions.Elo Mutual Pension Insurance Company  Ilmarinen Mutual Pension Insurance Company  Mandatum Life Insurance Company Limited and Varma Mutual Pension Insurance Company  as well as Antti Herlin  Hisra Consulting and Finance Oy and Autumn Spirit O√º  have renewed their irrevocable undertakings to accept the Improved Tender Offer  and Veritas Pension Insurance Company Ltd. has given an irrevocable undertaking to accept the Improved Tender Offer. These irrevocable undertakings together represent approximately 16.4 percent of all outstanding Shares and votes in Caverion.The Offeror has secured new acquisition financing  in addition to the existing debt commitments provided to the indirect parent of the Offeror  North Holdings 1 Oy  in the form of senior secured  covenant-lite debt commitments. A summary of the financing has been provided below under section ""Financing"".The members of the Board of Directors of Caverion who participated in the decision-making have unanimously decided to recommend that the shareholders of the Company accept the Improved Tender Offer.Halvor Meyer Horten  Managing Director  Head of Nordics  Bain Capital comments:""The Consortium is fully committed to supporting the long-term development of Caverion and improves its tender offer. As a way of offering the most attractive proposition to Caverion's shareholders  we will provide the possibility to choose between a competitive cash price immediately after our offer closes  or an even higher price at a later date through a debt instrument. In addition to the Improved Tender Offer and its terms  the only outstanding foreign direct investment clearance for our offer is expected soon  and our Improved Tender Offer has the support of the Caverion Board. We believe that our offer represents an attractive and superior option to Caverion shareholders in terms of price  deal certainty and timeline.""Klaus Caw√©n  on behalf of Security Trading  Fennogens Investments and Corbis  comments:""As committed and active long-term core shareholders of Caverion  we are dedicated to developing and growing Caverion as a stand-alone company and to ensuring its competitiveness in the long run. We believe that the Improved Tender Offer is clearly superior to the competing offer by Crayfish BidCo and believe that it provides an attractive and feasible option to Caverion shareholders. We also see that it is in the best interests of the business continuity of Caverion as well as of Caverion's employees to avoid uncertainty and potentially lengthy merger control processes the competing offer would be likely to cause.""THE IMPROVED TENDER OFFER IN BRIEFThe Offeror and Caverion have today entered into an amendment to the Combination Agreement  according to which the Offeror has  among other things  agreed to improve the consideration offered for each Share in the Tender Offer by offering the Alternative Consideration of EUR 8.50 or the Improved Cash Price of EUR 8.00 for each Share validly tendered in the Tender Offer  subject to any adjustments as set out in the section ""The Offer Price"" below.The Offer PriceThe shareholders of Caverion may choose either the Alternative Consideration in the form of an Alternative Consideration Instrument with the nominal principal amount of EUR 8.50 or the Improved Cash Price of EUR 8.00 for each Share validly tendered in the Tender Offer (the Improved Cash Price and the Alternative Consideration jointly  the ""Offer Price"")  subject to any adjustments as set out below. A shareholder may only choose to receive either the Alternative Consideration or the Improved Cash Price for all Shares held on the same book-entry account  and  consequently  shareholders may only tender for mixed consideration if Shares are held on separate book-entry accounts.The Improved Cash Price represents a premium of approximately 70.58 percent compared to the closing price (EUR 4.69) of the Share on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd (""Nasdaq Helsinki"") on November 2  2022  the last trading day immediately preceding the announcement of the Tender Offer  and a premium of approximately 69.85 percent compared to the volume-weighted average price (EUR 4.71) of the Share on Nasdaq Helsinki during the three-month period prior to and up to November 2  2022.The Alternative Consideration represents a premium of approximately 81.24 percent compared to the closing price (EUR 4.69) of the Share on Nasdaq Helsinki on November 2  2022  the last trading day immediately preceding the announcement of the Tender Offer  and a premium of approximately 80.47 percent compared to the volume-weighted average price (EUR 4.71) of the Share on Nasdaq Helsinki during the three-month period prior to and up to November 2  2022.The Alternative Consideration represents a premium of 6.25 percent compared to the cash consideration of EUR 8.00 offered in the Crayfish Offer (without adjusting for the interest component included in the Crayfish Offer).Each of Security Trading  Fennogens and Corbis as well as Antti Herlin  Hisra Consulting and Finance Oy and Autumn Spirit O√º have agreed to waive part of the EUR 1.00 increase to the offer price and to sell all their Shares to the Offeror for a cash consideration of EUR 7.50 per Share in  or in connection with the completion of  the Improved Tender Offer.The Improved Cash Price and the Alternative Consideration have been determined based on 136 472 645 issued and outstanding Shares. Should the Company increase the number of Shares that are issued and outstanding on the date hereof as a result of a new share issue  reclassification  stock split (including a reverse split) or any other similar transaction with dilutive effect  or should the Company distribute a dividend or otherwise distribute funds or any other assets to its shareholders  or if a record date with respect to any of the foregoing occurs prior to any of the settlements of the completion trades (whether after the expiry of the offer period or any subsequent offer period)  resulting in the distribution of funds not being payable to the Offeror  the Improved Cash Price and the Alternative Consideration payable by the Offeror shall be reduced accordingly on a euro-for-euro basis. However  after their issuance the Alternative Consideration Instruments are not subject to any adjustments and will be redeemed upon maturity at their full nominal amount.The Offer PeriodThe offer period for the Tender Offer (the ""Offer Period"") commenced on November 24  2022  and is currently ongoing. The Offeror extends the Offer Period until February 28  2023  in order to ensure that the shareholders of Caverion have the possibility to carefully review the supplement to the Tender Offer Document and to evaluate the terms and conditions of the Improved Tender Offer. Given the advanced stage of the Offeror's regulatory clearance process the Offeror is highly confident that the Tender Offer can be completed in this timeline. However  the Offeror reserves the right to extend the Offer Period in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.The Offeror will supplement the tender offer document  dated November 24  2022  and as supplemented on January 13  2023  concerning the Tender Offer (together  the ""Tender Offer Document"") with detailed information on the terms and conditions of the Improved Tender Offer  including the Alternative Consideration Instruments  as well as additional information on the Offeror  and will publish the supplement to the Tender Offer Document once it has been approved by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority. The Offeror is currently expecting that the supplement to the Tender Offer Document will be published in early February  2023.Until the supplement to the Tender Offer Document has been published  shareholders of Caverion tendering their Shares to the Tender Offer may only choose the cash consideration. Shareholders will be able to choose the Alternative Consideration when tendering into the Improved Tender Offer only after the supplement to the Tender Offer Document has been published. In connection with the publication of the supplement to the Tender Offer Document  the Offeror will also publish instructions to shareholders who wish to choose the Alternative Consideration instead of the Improved Cash Price.Each shareholder of Caverion who has already accepted the Tender Offer or accepts the Tender Offer before the supplement regarding the Improved Tender Offer is published will  after such supplement is published  be deemed to have accepted the Tender Offer with the Improved Cash Price. Therefore  a shareholder of Caverion who has already tendered his/her Shares in the Tender Offer or tenders before such supplement is made public  and who wishes to receive the Improved Cash Price  does not have to re-tender his/her Shares or take any other action as a result of the Improved Tender Offer before or after the publication of the supplement regarding the Improved Tender Offer. All such shareholders will then receive the Improved Cash Price  if the Tender Offer will be completed.Shareholders of Caverion who have already tendered their Shares in the Tender Offer  and who wish to choose the Alternative Consideration instead of the Improved Cash Price are given an opportunity to withdraw their previous acceptance and to submit the new acceptance form for the Alternative Consideration after the supplement regarding the Improved Tender Offer is published. The target is to give shareholders an opportunity to withdraw their previous acceptance without additional fees  in case such withdrawal is made after the supplement regarding the Improved Tender Offer is published.Terms of the Alternative Consideration InstrumentCaverion's shareholders who validly accept the Improved Tender Offer may choose  in respect of all (but not part only) of their holdings of Shares per each book-entry account  to receive Alternative Consideration Instruments instead of the Improved Cash Price under the terms of the Improved Tender Offer on the following basis:One validly tendered Caverion Share entitles its holder to one Alternative Consideration Instrument issued by the Offeror. The nominal principal amount and book-entry unit of each of the Alternative Consideration Instrument is EUR 8.50. The Alternative Consideration Instrument shall not accrue any interest.The equity commitments given to the Offeror by Bain Capital Funds and the other members of the Consortium to finance the Tender Offer have been amended to include financing also of the Alternative Consideration Instruments  so that their cash redemption by the Offeror will be backed by the funding commitments from the Consortium in the same way as funding for the Improved Cash Price.The Alternative Consideration Instruments will be issued on the date of the completion trades of the Tender Offer and they will mature nine (9) months from their issue date. The Alternative Consideration Instruments will be redeemed at their full nominal amount of EUR 8.50 on the date of maturity (the ""Redemption Date""). If the Redemption Date falls on a date which is not a Business Day  the Redemption Date will be postponed to the next following Business Day. ""Business Day"" shall mean a day on which the European TARGET2 System is open for the settlement of payment orders.Holders of the Alternative Consideration Instruments are not entitled to demand prepayment of their Alternative Consideration Instruments prior to the Redemption Date.The Alternative Consideration Instruments will be issued as book-entry form debt securities in Euroclear Finland's Infinity system and no physical certificates will be issued. The Finnish Act on the Book-Entry System and Clearing Operations  Act on Book-Entry Accounts as well as the rules and CEO's decisions of Euroclear Finland will be applied to the handling of the Alternative Consideration Instruments.The Alternative Consideration Instruments are direct  unsubordinated  unsecured and unguaranteed obligations of the Offeror ranking pari passu and without any preference among them.The Alternative Consideration Instruments are transferable after they have been registered into the respective book-entry account of the relevant holder of such Alternative Consideration Instruments  but no arrangements will be made to create a secondary market. No application has been or will be made to have the Alternative Consideration Instruments admitted to trading on any trading venue.Conditions to Completion of the Tender OfferIn connection with the Improved Tender Offer  the Offeror has agreed to lower the Condition to Completion of the Tender Offer concerning the minimum acceptance threshold from more than 90 percent to more than 66 2/3 percent of all Shares. Therefore  a condition to the completion of the Improved Tender Offer is that the Improved Tender Offer has been validly accepted with respect to the Shares representing  together with any other Shares otherwise acquired by the Offeror prior to or during the Offer Period  more than sixty-six and two thirds (66 2/3) percent of the Shares and voting rights in the Company calculated in accordance with Chapter 18 Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act (624/2006  as amended). Other Conditions to Completion (as defined in the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer) remain unchanged.The Offeror reserves the right to waive any of the Conditions to Completion that have not been fulfilled. If all Conditions to Completion have been fulfilled or the Offeror has waived the requirements for the fulfilment of all or some of them no later than at the time of announcement of the final results of the Improved Tender Offer  the Offeror will consummate the Improved Tender Offer in accordance with its terms and conditions after the expiration of the Offer Period by purchasing the Shares validly tendered in the Improved Tender Offer and paying the Offer Price to the holders of the Shares that have validly accepted the Improved Tender Offer.Recommendation by the Board of Directors of CaverionFollowing extensive review and discussions and after having regarded factors such as deal certainty for the Company and its shareholders  timeline to closing  including the fact that the regulatory approval process for the Offeror's Improved Tender Offer is expected to be completed shortly  and potential disruption for the Company and its employees and other stakeholders  and after consultation with its financial and legal advisors  the Board of Directors of Caverion has assessed the Offeror's Improved Tender Offer in comparison with the Crayfish Offer. The Board of Directors of Caverion has concluded that following the significant increase in the Offer Price by the Offeror  together with the other amended terms and conditions of the Improved Tender Offer and deal certainty aspects related to the timing and feasibility of obtaining required approvals from the regulatory authorities  and possible structural remedies being required as a condition to completion of the Crayfish Offer  the Improved Tender Offer by the Offeror is more beneficial for the Company  its shareholders and other stakeholders as compared to Crayfish Offer. Therefore  The Board of Directors of Caverion  represented by a quorum comprising the non-conflicted members of the Board of Directors  has unanimously decided to recommend that the shareholders of Caverion accept the Improved Tender Offer  having concluded that the Improved Tender Offer is fair to Caverion's shareholders from a financial point of view and provides Caverion's shareholders with greater deal certainty than the Crayfish Offer as it is likely to complete significantly faster than the Crayfish Offer. The Board of Directors expects to supplement its statement and renew its recommendation regarding the Tender Offer that was issued and announced on November 18  2022 after having received a substantially final draft of the supplement to the Tender Offer Document. The Board of Directors of Caverion has received an updated opinion  dated January 24  2023  of Caverion's exclusive financial adviser  Bank of America Europe DAC  Stockholm branch (""BofA Securities"")  to the effect that  as of the date of such opinion  the increased Offer Price to be paid to holders of Shares (other than Security Trading  Fennogens and Corbis and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the Improved Tender Offer  was fair from a financial point of view  to such holders  which opinion was based upon and subject to the assumptions made  procedures followed  matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken as more fully described in such opinion. The opinion of BofA Securities was provided for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors of Caverion and does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holders of Shares should act in connection with the Tender Offer or any related matter. The updated opinion will be attached to the statement of the Board of Directors of Caverion.Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors Markus Ehrnrooth  who is closely associated with two of the parties of the Consortium  Fennogens and Corbis  has not participated in any assessment or review of the implications of the Tender Offer by the Board of Directors or in any decision-making concerning the recommendation of the Board of Directors or the Combination Agreement. Markus Ehrnrooth has not participated in and has refrained from the work of the Board of Directors in Caverion during the pendency of the discussions between the Consortium and Caverion concerning the Tender Offer due to his material connections to and interests in the Offeror.Support by certain shareholders of CaverionElo Mutual Pension Insurance Company  Ilmarinen Mutual Pension Insurance Company  Mandatum Life Insurance Company Limited and Varma Mutual Pension Insurance Company  together representing approximately 15.4 percent of all Shares and votes in Caverion  as well as Antti Herlin  Hisra Consulting and Finance Oy and Autumn Spirit O√º  which are not part of the Consortium but are related parties to the Consortium members and together represent approximately 0.5 percent of all Shares and votes in Caverion  have renewed their irrevocable undertakings to accept the Improved Tender Offer  and Veritas Pension Insurance Company Ltd.  which holds approximately 0.6 percent of all Shares and votes in Caverion  has given an irrevocable undertaking to accept the Improved Tender Offer. These irrevocable undertakings may be terminated only in the event that the Offeror withdraws or does not complete the Tender Offer  or in the event that a competing offer is announced by a third party with a consideration of at least EUR 8.95 per Share and the Offeror does not match or exceed the consideration offered in such competing offer within a certain period of time.Together with the Shares directly held by the Consortium members  the irrevocable undertakings represent approximately 43.0 percent of all the Shares and votes in Caverion in aggregate.FinancingThe equity commitments given to the Offeror by Bain Capital Funds and the other members of the Consortium to finance the Tender Offer have been amended to include also financing for the redemption of the Alternative Consideration Instruments by the Offeror when they fall due.As described in the Tender Offer Document  the Offeror has received equity commitments  as evidenced in equity commitment letters addressed to the Offeror  the indirect parent of the Offeror  North Holdings 1 Oy (the ""PIK Borrower"") has received debt commitments (as supplemented by supplemental deeds dated January 10  2023 and January 20  2023 respectively) and the Offeror has received debt commitments (and interim debt commitments) as evidenced in debt commitment letters addressed to the Offeror  in each case  to finance the Tender Offer at completion and compulsory redemption proceedings  if any.The Offeror's obligation to complete the Tender Offer is not conditional upon availability of financing. The debt financing has been committed on a customary European ""certain funds"" basis and thus its availability is subject to only limited conditions.

The Tender Offer is made in the United States pursuant to Section 14(e) and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act  subject to the exemption provided under Rule 14d-1(c) under the Exchange Act for a Tier I tender offer (the ""Tier I Exemption"") and Rule 802 (the ""802 Exemption"") under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (the ""U.S. Securities Act"")  and otherwise in accordance with the disclosure and procedural requirements of Finnish law  including with respect to the Tender Offer timetable  settlement procedures  withdrawal  waiver of conditions and timing of payments  which are different from those of the United States. In particular  the financial information included in this stock exchange release has been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in Finland  which may not be comparable to the financial statements or financial information of U.S. companies. The Tender Offer is made to Caverion's shareholders resident in the United States on the same terms and conditions as those made to all other shareholders of Caverion to whom an offer is made. Any informational documents  including this stock exchange release  are being disseminated to U.S. shareholders on a basis comparable to the method that such documents are provided to Caverion's other shareholders.As permitted under the Tier I Exemption  the settlement of the Tender Offer is based on the applicable Finnish law provisions  which differ from the settlement procedures customary in the United States  particularly as regards to the time when payment of the consideration is rendered. The Tender Offer  which is subject to Finnish law  is being made to the U.S. shareholders in accordance with the applicable U.S. securities laws  and applicable exemptions thereunder  in particular the Tier I Exemption and the 802 Exemption. To the extent the Tender Offer is subject to U.S. securities laws  those laws only apply to U.S. shareholders and will not give rise to claims on the part of any other person. U.S. shareholders should consider that (whether paid initially in cash or upon redemption of any Alternative Consideration Instruments) the offer price for the Tender Offer is being paid in EUR and that no adjustment will be made based on any changes in the exchange rate.To the extent permissible under applicable law or regulations  the Offeror and its affiliates or its brokers and its brokers' affiliates (acting as agents for the Offeror or its affiliates  as applicable) may from time to time after the date of this stock exchange release and during the pendency of the Tender Offer  and other than pursuant to the Tender Offer  directly or indirectly purchase or arrange to purchase Shares or any securities that are convertible into  exchangeable for or exercisable for Shares. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. To the extent information about such purchases or arrangements to purchase is made public in Finland  such information will be disclosed by means of a press release or other means reasonably calculated to inform U.S. shareholders of Caverion of such information. In addition  the financial advisers to the Offeror may also engage in ordinary course trading activities in securities of Caverion  which may include purchases or arrangements to purchase such securities. To the extent required in Finland  any information about such purchases will be made public in Finland in the manner required by Finnish law.Neither the SEC nor any U.S. state securities commission has approved or disapproved the Tender Offer (including the offer of the Alternative Consideration Instruments)  passed upon the merits or fairness of the Tender Offer (including the offer of the Alternative Consideration Instruments)  or passed any comment upon the adequacy  accuracy or completeness of the disclosure in relation to the Tender Offer (including in relation to the Alternative Consideration Instruments).

Any such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder will be responsible for payment of any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due by whomsoever payable and the Company and any person acting on its behalf shall be fully indemnified and held harmless by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder for any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments such person may be required to pay. No steps have been taken to authorise the extending of the Stub Tender Offer in any territory outside Guernsey or the Netherlands.12.2 The provisions of this paragraph and any other terms of the Stub Tender Offer relating to shareholders outside Guernsey the Netherlands may be waived  varied or modified as regards specific DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holder or on a general basis by the Company.12.3 The provisions of this paragraph 12 supersede any terms of the Stub Tender Offer which may be inconsistent with it.12.4 All DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders wishing to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants in the Stub Tender Offer should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal or regulatory requirements. If you are in any doubt about your position  you should consult your professional adviser in the relevant territory.RISK FACTORSPrior to deciding whether or not to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should carefully consider this Circular in its entirety  as well as the section ""Risk Factors"" in the DCAC IPO Prospectus and the risk factors discussed in the section ""Risk Factors"" in the Shareholders Circular dated 20 December 2022 (the ""December Circular"").The risks described below have emerged or changed in light of the Stub Tender Offer. The occurrence of any of the risks below could have a material adverse effect on the Stub Tender Offer and on the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants.All of these risk factors and events are contingencies that may or may not occur. A number of these risks described below may occur simultaneously. The order in which these risks are presented is not necessarily an indication of the likelihood of the risks actually materialising  of the potential significance of the risks or of the scope of any potential negative impact to the Stub Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should carefully consider all of the risk factors set out in this section 6.Although the Company believes that the risks described below are the material risks concerning the Stub Tender Offer  they are not the only risks relating to the Stub Tender Offer. Other risks  events  facts or circumstances not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial could  individually or cumulatively  prove to be important and may have a significant negative impact on the Stub Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders cannot withdraw their tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants without the written consent of the Company or once their tender has become unconditional.Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be deemed to have agreed that  in consideration of the Company to process his tender  such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder will not revoke its tender or its DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants without the prior written consent of the Company. Once tendered  a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder can therefore not withdraw its tender under the Stub Tender Offer  unless the Company consents to such withdrawal. Once the tender has become unconditional  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders cannot withdraw their DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants tendered under the Stub Tender Offer.As the DCAC Sponsor and/or other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may decide to not participate in the Stub Tender Offer  they may obtain a controlling interest in the Company.The DCAC Sponsor and/or such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder may decide not to participate in the Stub Tender Offer. This may cause the DCAC Sponsor and/or such other DCAC Ordinary Shareholder to obtain increased voting power  which may results in a controlling interest and a decisive influence over all matters requiring DCAC Ordinary Shareholder approval  including  subject to the Amended Articles  approval of a future business combination.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be locked.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be locked. During this period  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders will not be able to (re)sell  pledge  encumber or otherwise transfer such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares  DCAC Public Warrants or any rights related thereto.The Stub Tender Offer is subject to certain conditions and the DCAC Board may decide to postpone or terminate the Stub Tender Offer at any time prior to the purchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer as a result of which DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders may receive the repurchase price tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and DCAC Public Warrants  as applicable  at a later point in time or not at all.The Stub Tender Offer is subject to the conditions that (a) the Stub Tender Resolutions being passed at the EGM  (b) there has been no Material Adverse Change nor Force Majeure Event  (c) the DCAC Board being satisfied that the Company has in its control or to its order the aggregate of the Offer Price for all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  the aggregate of the Offer Price previously credited to the Escrow Account  (d) the DCAC Board continuing to be satisfied that that the Company will  immediately following the purchase of all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants (as if all DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders were to tender for acquisition their full entitlement)  satisfy the statutory solvency test prescribed by the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 as amended and (e) the Stub Tender Offer is not terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Tender Offer Document. The Company may at its sole discretion terminate or postpone the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in this Circular  if the Company (acting through the DCAC Directors) considers in its reasonable opinion that (a) it has become unlawful  impractical or inappropriate for the Company to fund the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants without materially harming DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders as a whole or (b) the completion of the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer would have material adverse fiscal or other consequences (whether by reason of a change in legislation or practice or otherwise) for the Company or its DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders taken as a whole if the Stub Tender Offer were to proceed or (c) if the Company will not immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants validly tendered in the Tender Offer  continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test under the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008  as amended. If these conditions are not met or if the Board decides to delay or terminate the Tender Offer prior to the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and the DCAC Public Warrant Holders may receive the repurchase price of up to ¬£2.20 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per tendered DCAC Public Warrant at a later point in time or not at all.The net consideration received by a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder may be less than ¬£2.20 per DCAC Ordinary Share and less than ¬£0.066 per DCAC Public Warrant.The cash consideration of up to ¬£2.20 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per tendered DCAC Public Warrant does not include costs relating to a Shareholder‚Äôs or Warrant Holder's broker  bank or other financial intermediary or advisor. Nor is the Company responsible for any taxes  duties or similar imposts suffered by the Shareholder or Warrant Holder. The net payment per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share received by DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant received by DCAC Public Warrant Holders may therefore be lower than the maximum ¬£2.20 and ¬£0.066  as applicable  repurchase price.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date and such deadline may differ for each individual broker  bank or other financial intermediary. The Company does not have any knowledge on such deadlines and therefore the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should consult its broker  bank or other financial intermediary in this regard.Any tenders not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Circular may be invalid.Submitting a tender that is not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Circular  may result in an invalid tender and ultimately not being able to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer (thereby also not receiving the cash consideration of up to ¬£2.20 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per tendered DCAC Public Warrant). DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should note that none of Van Lanschot Kempen  Admina  the Company or any other person is or will be obliged to give notice of any defects  irregularities  omissions  delays or non-receipts in tenders of DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders  and that none of them will incur any liability for failure to give any such notice.The Stub Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase 5% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares and all of your DCAC Public Warrants  and following the Stub Tender Offer you will no longer have a repurchase right.The Stub Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase up to 5% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares and all of your DCAC Public Warrants. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should note that the articles of incorporation of the Company no longer provide for a repurchase right and that there is no assurance that the Company will provide for such a repurchase right in the future. There is therefore no assurance that DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders can have their DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants repurchased by the Company other than through this one-time Stub Tender Offer.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may face a significant decrease in net asset value of their shareholdingFollowing the provision and distribution of cash to meet the Repurchase Offer  a substantial part of DCAC‚Äôs then remaining cash will be applied to settle outstanding liabilities  resulting in limited remaining assets and a decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share. This may in particular affect DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares  as they will not receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary Share for DCAC Ordinary Shares that they do not (successfully) tender. If the Company is wound up or liquidated in the future  the decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share may result in DCAC Ordinary Shareholders receiving substantially less than ¬£10.25 per DCAC Ordinary Share or nothing at all.There is no guarantee that DCAC will be able to satisfy the statutory solvency test following the acquisition of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants validly tendered in the Stub Tender OfferPursuant to section 320 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008  as amended  the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Stub Tender Offer would be considered to be a distribution for the purposes of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 and therefore the DCAC Board must comply with section 303 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 in respect of making distributions  including ensuring satisfaction of the statutory ""solvency test"" as defined in section 527 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 being (in respect of companies that are not ""supervised companies""  like DCAC) that DCAC is able to pay its debts as they become due and that the value of DCAC's assets is greater than the value of its liabilities. There is no guarantee that DCAC will  immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Stub Tender Offer  meet and/or continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test.The repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants by the Company may result in taxes being imposed on the Company or on DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders.The repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants by the Company may result in taxes being imposed on the Company or on DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders as at the date of such repurchase or redemption. The Company does not intend to make any cash distributions to DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders to pay any such taxes. The materialisation of this risk may adversely affect the post-tax return for certain DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders.OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATIONInformation Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this Circular other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements. In particular  this Circular contains forward-looking statements under the following headings: ""Risk Factors""  regarding DCAC's strategy  targets  expectations  objectives  future plans and other future events or prospects are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on DCAC's current beliefs and projections and on information currently available to us. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond DCAC's control and all of which are based on its current beliefs and expectations about future events. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as ""believe""  ""expect""  ""may""  ""will""  ""seek""  ""would""  ""could""  ""should""  ""intend""  ""estimate""  ""plan""  ""assume""  ""predict""  ""anticipate""  ""annualised""  ""goal""  ""target""  ""potential""  ""continue""  ""hope""  ""objective""  ""position""  ""project""  ""risk"" or ""aim"" or the highlights or negatives thereof or other variations thereof or comparable terminology  or by discussions of DCAC's strategy  short-term and mid-term objectives and future plans that involve risks and uncertainties.Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and speak only as of the date they are made. Except as required by applicable law  DCAC does not undertake and it expressly disclaims any duty to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement in this Circular  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise. Such forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs  assumptions  expectations  estimates and projections of the members of the DCAC Board and DCAC's management of  public statements made by it  present and future business strategies and the environment in which DCAC will operate in the future. By their nature  they are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties  which could cause DCAC's actual results and future events to differ materially from those implied or expressed by forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this Circular include those described under ""Risk Factors"".Although DCAC believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable  forward-looking statements are based on the opinions  assumptions and estimates of the members of the DCAC Board and its management at the date the statements are made and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors.The Shareholders are advised to read ""Risk Factors"" for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect DCAC's future performance. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialise  or should any of the assumptions underlying the above or other factors prove to be incorrect  DCAC's actual results of operations or future financial condition could differ materially from those described herein as currently anticipated  believed  estimated or expected. In light of the risks  uncertainties and assumptions underlying the above factors  the forward-looking events described in this Circular may not occur or be realised. Additional risks not known to DCAC or that DCAC does not currently consider material could also cause the forward-looking events discussed in this Circular not to occur.Rounding and negative amountsCertain figures in this Circular  including financial data  have been rounded.

The decision of the Company as to which DCAC Ordinary Shares have been successfully tendered shall be final and binding on all DCAC Ordinary Shareholders. 5.12 None of Van Lanschot Kempen  Admina  the Company or any other person is or will be obliged to give notice of any defects or irregularities in tenders  and none of them will incur any liability for failure to give any such notice. 5.13 Any accidental omission to provide or any delay or non-receipt of this Circular by any person entitled to receive the same shall not invalidate any aspect of the Stub Tender Offer. 5.14 Further copies of this document may be obtained on request from Admina. 5.15 Any changes to the terms of  or any decision to suspend  extend or terminate the Stub Tender Offer will be followed as soon as possible by a public announcement thereof. 5.16 None of the Admina  Van Lanschot Kempen or the Company will accept responsibility for documentation lost or delayed in the postal system. 6 Record Date  Commencement of Stub Tender Offer and Offer Period 6.1 The record date for the Stub Tender Offer shall be 17:40 (CET) on 10 February 2023  being the time and date on which DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders are eligible to participate in the Repurchase Offer and the Stub Tender Offer (the ""Record Date""). 6.2 Subject to and conditional upon the Stub Tender Resolutions passing at the EGM  the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter issue an announcement (the ""Announcement"") confirming  inter alia  that the Stub Tender Resolutions have passed  the Stub Tender Offer has become unconditional and that the Stub Tender Offer period has commenced. 6.3 The last time and date for tenders of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants shall be 14:00 (CET) on 16 March 2023. 7 Closing Date 7.1 The Stub Tender Offer will remain open for acceptance from the date and time of the Announcement until 16:00 (CET) on 15 March 7.2 2023 (the ‚ÄúClosing Date‚Äù). 8 Termination of the Stub Tender Offer If the Company (acting through the DCAC Directors)  at any time prior to the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants tendered in the Stub Tender Offer (and including where it has previously deferred the Closing Date in accordance with paragraph 2.2 of this section 5) considers that  in its reasonable opinion  either: it has become unlawful  impractical or inappropriate for the Company to fund the purchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants pursuant to the Stub Tender Offer without materially harming DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders as a whole; or the completion of the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer would have material adverse fiscal or other consequences (whether by reason of a change in legislation or practice or otherwise) for the Company or its DCAC Ordinary Shareholders or its DCAC Public Warrant Holders taken as a whole if the Tender Offer were to proceed; or the Company will not  immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants validly tendered in the Stub Tender Offer  continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test under the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008  as amended  the Company shall be entitled at its discretion to delay or terminate the Stub Tender Offer by a public announcement to DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders.

In the event of more than one person giving a tender through an Admitted Institution  the above provisions will apply to them jointly and severally. 11 Tenders through Euroclear Nederland 11.1 Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder by whom  or on whose behalf  a tender through an Admitted Institution is made irrevocably undertakes  represents  warrants and agrees to and with the Company (so as to bind it  its personal representatives  custodian  sub-custodian  heirs  successors and assigns) on the date that such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are tendered up to and including the Final Settlement Date that: (a) the tender of any DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants constitutes an acceptance by the holder of the DCAC Ordinary Shares of the terms  conditions and restrictions of the Stub Tender Offer; (b) such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder is not over-tendering his/her position by tendering 5% of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and all of the DCAC Public Warrants held by it and will deliver the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants on the Closing Date; (c) such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder has full power and authority to tender  sell and deliver  and has not entered into any other agreement to tender  sell or deliver the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants stated to have been tendered to any party other than the Company (together with all rights attaching thereto) and  when such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are purchased by the Company for cash  the Company acquires such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  with full title guarantee and free from all liens  charges  encumbrances  rights of pre-emption or other third party rights of any nature and together with all the rights attaching thereto; (d) such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are being tendered in compliance with the restrictions set out in this Circular and the securities and other applicable laws or regulations of the jurisdiction in which the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders is located or of which it is a resident and no registration  approval or filing with any regulatory authority of such jurisdiction is required in connection with the tendering of such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants; and (e) if requested by the Company or Van Lanschot Kempen  provide the legal name of the beneficial DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders wishing to tender. 12 Restricted jurisdictions 12.1 The making of the Stub Tender Offer in  or to persons who are citizens or nationals of  or resident in  jurisdictions outside Guernsey or the Netherlands or custodians  nominees or trustees for citizens  nationals or residents of jurisdictions outside Guernsey or the Netherlands may be prohibited or affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders who are not resident in Guernsey or the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal requirements. It is the responsibility of any DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder wishing to make a tender to satisfy himself  herself or itself as to the full observance of the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in connection with the Stub Tender Offer  including the obtaining of any governmental  exchange control or other consents which may be required  the compliance with other necessary formalities and the payment of any transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due in such jurisdiction. Any such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder will be responsible for payment of any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due by whomsoever payable and the Company and any person acting on its behalf shall be fully indemnified and held harmless by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder for any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments such person may be required to pay.

The risks described below have emerged or changed in light of the Stub Tender Offer. The occurrence of any of the risks below could have a material adverse effect on the Stub Tender Offer and on the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants. All of these risk factors and events are contingencies that may or may not occur. A number of these risks described below may occur simultaneously. The order in which these risks are presented is not necessarily an indication of the likelihood of the risks actually materialising  of the potential significance of the risks or of the scope of any potential negative impact to the Stub Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should carefully consider all of the risk factors set out in this section 6. Although the Company believes that the risks described below are the material risks concerning the Stub Tender Offer  they are not the only risks relating to the Stub Tender Offer. Other risks  events  facts or circumstances not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial could  individually or cumulatively  prove to be important and may have a significant negative impact on the Stub Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders cannot withdraw their tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants without the written consent of the Company or once their tender has become unconditional. Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be deemed to have agreed that  in consideration of the Company to process his tender  such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder will not revoke its tender or its DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants without the prior written consent of the Company. Once tendered  a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder can therefore not withdraw its tender under the Stub Tender Offer  unless the Company consents to such withdrawal. Once the tender has become unconditional  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders cannot withdraw their DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants tendered under the Stub Tender Offer. As the DCAC Sponsor and/or other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may decide to not participate in the Stub Tender Offer  they may obtain a controlling interest in the Company. The DCAC Sponsor and/or such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder may decide not to participate in the Stub Tender Offer. This may cause the DCAC Sponsor and/or such other DCAC Ordinary Shareholder to obtain increased voting power  which may results in a controlling interest and a decisive influence over all matters requiring DCAC Ordinary Shareholder approval  including  subject to the Amended Articles  approval of a future business combination. As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be locked. As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be locked. During this period  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders will not be able to (re)sell  pledge  encumber or otherwise transfer such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares  DCAC Public Warrants or any rights related thereto. The Stub Tender Offer is subject to certain conditions and the DCAC Board may decide to postpone or terminate the Stub Tender Offer at any time prior to the purchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer as a result of which DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders may receive the repurchase price tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and DCAC Public Warrants  as applicable  at a later point in time or not at all. The Stub Tender Offer is subject to the conditions that (a) the Stub Tender Resolutions being passed at the EGM  (b) there has been no Material Adverse Change nor Force Majeure Event  (c) the DCAC Board being satisfied that the Company has in its control or to its order the aggregate of the Offer Price for all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  the aggregate of the Offer Price previously credited to the Escrow Account  (d) the DCAC Board continuing to be satisfied that that the Company will  immediately following the purchase of all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants (as if all DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders were to tender for acquisition their full entitlement)  satisfy the statutory solvency test prescribed by the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 as amended and (e) the Stub Tender Offer is not terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Tender Offer Document. The Company may at its sole discretion terminate or postpone the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in this Circular  if the Company (acting through the DCAC Directors) considers in its reasonable opinion that (a) it has become unlawful  impractical or inappropriate for the Company to fund the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants without materially harming DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders as a whole or (b) the completion of the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer would have material adverse fiscal or other consequences (whether by reason of a change in legislation or practice or otherwise) for the Company or its DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders taken as a whole if the Stub Tender Offer were to proceed or (c) if the Company will not immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants validly tendered in the Tender Offer  continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test under the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008  as amended. If these conditions are not met or if the Board decides to delay or terminate the Tender Offer prior to the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and the DCAC Public Warrant Holders may receive the repurchase price of up to ¬£2.20 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per tendered DCAC Public Warrant at a later point in time or not at all. The net consideration received by a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder may be less than ¬£2.20 per DCAC Ordinary Share and less than ¬£0.066 per DCAC Public Warrant. The cash consideration of up to ¬£2.20 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per tendered DCAC Public Warrant does not include costs relating to a Shareholder‚Äôs or Warrant Holder's broker  bank or other financial intermediary or advisor. Nor is the Company responsible for any taxes  duties or similar imposts suffered by the Shareholder or Warrant Holder. The net payment per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share received by DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant received by DCAC Public Warrant Holders may therefore be lower than the maximum ¬£2.20 and ¬£0.066  as applicable  repurchase price. The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date. The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date and such deadline may differ for each individual broker  bank or other financial intermediary. The Company does not have any knowledge on such deadlines and therefore the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should consult its broker  bank or other financial intermediary in this regard. Any tenders not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Circular may be invalid. Submitting a tender that is not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Circular  may result in an invalid tender and ultimately not being able to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer (thereby also not receiving the cash consideration of up to ¬£2.20 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per tendered DCAC Public Warrant). DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should note that none of Van Lanschot Kempen  Admina  the Company or any other person is or will be obliged to give notice of any defects  irregularities  omissions  delays or non-receipts in tenders of DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders  and that none of them will incur any liability for failure to give any such notice. The Stub Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase 5% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares and all of your DCAC Public Warrants  and following the Stub Tender Offer you will no longer have a repurchase right. The Stub Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase up to 5% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares and all of your DCAC Public Warrants. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should note that the articles of incorporation of the Company no longer provide for a repurchase right and that there is no assurance that the Company will provide for such a repurchase right in the future. There is therefore no assurance that DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders can have their DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants repurchased by the Company other than through this one-time Stub Tender Offer. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may face a significant decrease in net asset value of their shareholding Following the provision and distribution of cash to meet the Repurchase Offer  a substantial part of DCAC‚Äôs then remaining cash will be applied to settle outstanding liabilities  resulting in limited remaining assets and a decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share. This may in particular affect DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares  as they will not receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary Share for DCAC Ordinary Shares that they do not (successfully) tender. If the Company is wound up or liquidated in the future  the decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share may result in DCAC Ordinary Shareholders receiving substantially less than ¬£10.25 per DCAC Ordinary Share or nothing at all. There is no guarantee that DCAC will be able to satisfy the statutory solvency test following the acquisition of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants validly tendered in the Stub Tender Offer Pursuant to section 320 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008  as amended  the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Stub Tender Offer would be considered to be a distribution for the purposes of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 and therefore the DCAC Board must comply with section 303 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 in respect of making distributions  including ensuring satisfaction of the statutory ""solvency test"" as defined in section 527 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 being (in respect of companies that are not ""supervised companies""  like DCAC) that DCAC is able to pay its debts as they become due and that the value of DCAC's assets is greater than the value of its liabilities. There is no guarantee that DCAC will  immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Stub Tender Offer  meet and/or continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test. The repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants by the Company may result in taxes being imposed on the Company or on DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders. The repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants by the Company may result in taxes being imposed on the Company or on DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders as at the date of such repurchase or redemption. The Company does not intend to make any cash distributions to DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders to pay any such taxes. The materialisation of this risk may adversely affect the post-tax return for certain DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders.OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements in this Circular other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements.

(TEL +81-3-3282-2112) Notice Regarding the Establishment of a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary through a Corporate Spinoff Marubeni Corporation (""Marubeni"") announces that the Board of Directors of Marubeni resolved today that on April 3  2023 (scheduled) an intermediate holding company (the newly established company) will be established as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marubeni through a corporate spinoff and acquire the rights and obligations of the business management of Marubeni's subsidiaries in the information and telecommunications field. Specifically  the rights and obligations will include Marubeni's shares of Marubeni Information Systems Co.  Ltd. (Marubeni's shareholding ratio: 100%)  Marubeni Network Solutions Inc. (Marubeni's shareholding ratio: 100%)  and Marubeni IT Solutions Inc. (Marubeni's shareholding ratio: 46%; Marubeni Information Systems' shareholding ratio: 34%). Since the corporate spinoff will be a simple incorporation-type separation and conducted by Marubeni as an entirely independent action  certain details are omitted from this disclosure. 1. Objective of the Corporate Spinoff In recent years  the domestic ICT market has been rapidly expanding and is expected to continue to grow steadily. At the same time  the structure of the domestic ICT market itself is drastically changing because of the acceleration of digital transformation and the increasing responsibility for ESG and SDGs. Under these circumstances  Marubeni Information Systems  Marubeni Network Solutions  and Marubeni IT Solutions  Marubeni group companies active in the ICT field  are creating and promoting their own ICT businesses respectively. However  to keep up with the rapid changes in the ICT market more quickly and strategically  Marubeni will inaugurate a new structure led by a newly established company through the corporate spinoff. This company will gather human capital partly from each group company. It will also lead activities such as planning and executing strategies  including investments to advanced technologies or future growth fields  and creating synergies among group companies. 12. Outline of the Corporate Spinoff Ôºà1ÔºâSchedule January 25  2023 Resolution by the Board of Directors April 3  2023 (scheduled) Effective date of the corporate spinoff *The corporate spinoff  pursuant to Article 805 of the Companies Act  will be executed without the approval of a general meeting of the shareholders. (Simple Incorporation-Type Separations) Ôºà2ÔºâMethod The corporate spinoff will be a simple incorporation-type separation. Marubeni will be the separated company. The newly established company will be the succeeding company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marubeni. Ôºà3ÔºâAllotment of Shares The newly established company will issue 10 000 shares of common stock  all of which shall be allotted to Marubeni. Ôºà4ÔºâTreatment of Share Purchase Warrant and Bonds with Share Purchase Warrants Marubeni has not issued share purchase warrants and bonds with share purchase warrants. Ôºà5ÔºâChange in Capital Resulting from the Corporate Spinoff There will be no change in Marubeni's capital resulting from the corporate spinoff. Ôºà6ÔºâRights and Obligations Transferred to the Newly Established Company The newly established company will succeed to the assets  liabilities  and other rights and obligations related to the business management of Marubeni's subsidiaries in the information and telecommunications field from Marubeni as set forth in the incorporation-type company separation plan dated January 25  2023. Specifically  1 010 000 shares of Marubeni Information Systems Co.  Ltd.  5 882 shares of Marubeni Network Solutions Inc.  and 46 000 shares of Marubeni IT Solutions Inc. will be transferred to the newly established company. The newly established company will not succeed to any liabilities  employment contracts and other contractual relationships  or rights and obligations based on such contracts from Marubeni. Ôºà7ÔºâAbility to Fulfill Obligations Marubeni has determined that there will be no problems with the prospects for fulfillment of obligations to be borne by the newly established company after the corporate spinoff. 23.

Companies and investors now search for alternatives  including swaps  buybacks and direct payments to bondholders.Some companies like fertilizer producer Uralkali  miner Norilsk Nikel and metals giant Metalloinvest have opted to change bond documentation and pay the debt directly to investors in rubles  the outlet said. The country‚Äôs energy major Gazprom and one of the world‚Äôs largest steel producers  Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works PJSC  have swapped some of their eurobonds for ruble debt.Gazprom Deputy Chairman Famil Sadygov told Bloomberg that replacement bonds were ‚Äúthe most reliable way‚Äù to service debt given the restrictions on financial infrastructure. He noted that holdings of ten of the bonds have already been substituted and another 12 will be replaced by the end of March  adding that Gazprom pays coupons on both the swapped Russian bonds and the remaining international bonds.Following EU sanctions  Europe‚Äôs two major central depositories ‚Äì Euroclear and Clearstream ‚Äì have only been processing transactions verified by paying agents. The clearing houses have been reluctant to process corporate actions  forcing companies to find ways to bypass European depositories.Companies have realized that sanctions have disrupted so many processes needed to keep bonds that it‚Äôs become necessary to take them out of the market.A portfolio manager at Armbrok investment company  Dmitry Dorofeev  told Bloomberg that ‚Äúin a couple of months everything is going to be bought out‚Äù by local investors  adding that ‚ÄúRussian companies will replace bonds and return to Russia.‚ÄùRussia‚Äôs international corporate bond market declined by about $12.7 billion from $85.6 billion since the imposition of Ukraine-related sanctions on Moscow  according to the outlet.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,negative,0.0,0.06,0.94,True,English,"['Russian companies', 'new ways', 'debt', 'Bloomberg', 'Gazprom Deputy Chairman Famil Sadygov', 'two major central depositories', 'international corporate bond market', 'energy major Gazprom', 'metals giant Metalloinvest', 'largest steel producers', 'Steel Works PJSC', 'Armbrok investment company', 'critical financial operations', 'remaining international bonds', 'bond documentation', 'corporate actions', 'European depositories', 'financial processes', 'financial infrastructure', 'unsanctioned ones', 'Wall Street', 'large number', 'direct payments', 'fertilizer producer', 'Norilsk Nikel', 'Magnitogorsk Iron', 'reliable way', 'paying agents', 'clearing houses', 'many processes', 'portfolio manager', 'Dmitry Dorofeev', 'business section', 'servicing bonds', 'replacement bonds', 'Russian bonds', 'Western sanctions', 'EU sanctions', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'outstanding debt', 'ruble debt', 'biggest companies', 'local investors', 'Russian companies', 'firms', 'eurobonds', 'denomination', 'outlet', 'Bloomberg', 'Monday', 'Restrictions', 'borrower', 'alternatives', 'swaps', 'buybacks', 'bondholders', 'Uralkali', 'miner', 'rubles', 'country', 'world', 'holdings', 'end', 'March', 'coupons', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'transactions', 'ways', 'couple', 'months', 'everything', 'Moscow', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-01-25,2023-01-25,rt.com

Only services in China and its platform for governments were not hit.By late morning Azure said most customers should have seen services resume after a full recovery of the Microsoft Wide Area Network (WAN).An outage of Azure  which has 15 million corporate customers and over 500 million active users  according to Microsoft data  can impact multiple services and create a domino effect as almost all of the world‚Äôs largest companies use the platform.Businesses have become increasingly dependent on online platforms after the pandemic caused a shift to more employees working from home.Earlier  Microsoft said it had determined a network connectivity issue was occurring with devices across the Microsoft WAN. This impacts connectivity between clients on the internet to Azure  as well as connectivity between services in data centres  it said.Microsoft later tweeted that it had rolled back a network change that it believed was causing the issue and was using ‚Äúadditional infrastructure to expedite the recovery process‚Äù.Microsoft did not disclose the number of users affected by the disruption  but data from outage tracking website Downdetector showed thousands of incidents across continents.The Downdetector site tracks outages by collating status reports from various sources including users.Microsoft‚Äôs cloud business had helped shore up its fiscal second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. It forecast third-quarter revenue in its so-called intelligent cloud business would be $21.7 billion to $22 billion despite worries that the lucrative cloud segment for big tech companies could be hit hard as customers look to cut spending.Azure‚Äôs share of the cloud computing market rose to 30% in 2022  trailing Amazon‚Äôs AWS  according to estimates from BofA Global Research.Microsoft joined other big tech companies in turning to layoffs to ride out the weaker economy  announcing last week it was cutting over 10 000 jobs.Its shares were down 2.4% in pre-market trading.Outages of Big Tech platforms are not uncommon as several companies ranging from Google to Meta have seen service disruptions. Azure  the second largest cloud services provider after Amazon  faced outages last year.We're investigating an issue in which some users are experiencing delays or connection issues when accessing the Exchange Online service. Please see EX394347 in the admin center for more information. ‚Äî Microsoft 365 Status (@MSFT365Status) June 21  2022During the outage  users faced problems in exchanging messages  joining calls or using any features of Teams application. Many users took to Twitter to share updates about the service disruption  with #MicrosoftTeams trending as a hashtag on the social media site.Microsoft Teams  used by more than 280 million people globally  forms an integral part of daily operations for businesses and schools  which use the service to make calls  schedule meetings and organise their workflow.There were few signs of significant disruption at major UK-based financial services firms  where multiple messaging applications offered by providers like Movius and Symphony are used alongside Microsoft Teams to connect bankers with clients  and office-based staff with colleagues working remotely.Two London-based sources  working at two major global banks  said they hadn‚Äôt even noticed a problem.Deutsche Boerse Group  which operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange  said there had been no impact on trading.

The job cuts are taking place over a 12 month-period and about 15 locations will be affected  he said.‚ÄúThe reality is that the macro environment has become more difficult and has changed a lot ‚Äù Van Dijk said. ‚ÄúThis also means that the cost of capital has changed a lot  as interest rates go up and risk premiums also go up.‚ÄùVan Dijk declined to say how many people would lose their jobs. Prosus employed 30 000 people globally at the end of March last year  according to an earnings report  but these roles are spread across corporate hubs and a range of businesses the e-commerce group invests in and operates  including in classified advertising  food delivery and internet payments.Naspers shares closed 1.7% lower in Johannesburg on Wednesday  and Prosus declined 0.2% at 5:15 p.m. in Amsterdam.Companies from Amazon.com Inc. to Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google have recently announced staff reductions after years of growth  as they seek to lower costs and improve profitability. The tech sector announced 97 171 job cuts in 2022  up 649% compared to the previous year  according to consulting firm Challenger  Gray & Christmas Inc.Prosus will also seek to cut costs at the more than 80 companies it has invested in  although those efforts have different timelines and scales  according to Van Dijk. The company has already closed some offices and made cuts at others  he said. The Euronext-listed firm previously closed its iFood business in Colombia and its autos business in Peru and Ecuador.Story continuesThe measures should help Prosus become profitable by the first half of 2025  according to Van Dijk.The e-commerce firm has been working on narrowing the discount between the sum of its parts and its stake in China‚Äôs Tencent Holdings Ltd. for years  with both Prosus and its Cape Town-based parent Naspers having taken a number of steps to address the problem.These include the spinoff of its African PayTV business  the creation of Prosus through the Euronext-listing of its internet holdings  a share swap between Naspers and Prosus  and a number of share buybacks that are ongoing.Tencent  in which Prosus is the largest investor  has already announced job cuts in recent months.

By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world‚Äôs first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world‚Äôs first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Story continuesLocated at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ (ALDEI ‚Äì code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010. The Company has 45 employees and relies on a network of world-class academic  technological  industrial and institutional partners.CONTACTSInvestorsMario AlcarazChief Financial and Administrative Officer+33 (0)4 48 19 01 00ir@deinove.comMediaATCG Partners+33 (0)9 81 87 46 72communication@deinove.comAttachment,neutral,0.0,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.07,0.19,0.74,True,English,"['judicial liquidation proceedings', 'receivership proceedings', 'Conversion', 'proc√©dure de liquidation judiciaire', 'Ma√Ætre Christine Dauverchain', 'Phase II clinical trial', 'severe Clostridioides difficile infection', 'first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms', 'world-class academic, technological, industrial', 'microbial dark matter', 'several development programs', 'low concentrated compounds', 'JUDICIAL LIQUIDATION PROCEEDINGS', 'French biotech company', 'French biotechnology company', 'first antibiotic candidate', 'complex chemical structures', 'urgent, global challenge', 'Montpellier Commercial Court', 'new bacterial micro-factories', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'liquidateur judiciaire', 'liquidation surplus', 'first emergencies', 'industrial production', 'judicial liquidator', 'RECEIVERSHIP PROCEEDINGS', 'antibiotic resistance', 'Euronext Paris', 'global health', 'economic challenge', 'chemical synthesis', 'bacterial biodiversity', 'new domain', 'new therapies', 'bacterial extracts', 'EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ', 'The Company', 'press release', 'delisting procedure', 'metabolic potential', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'life-threatening infections', 'high speed', 'breakthrough approach', 'unique collection', 'other issue', 'Euromedecine park', 'institutional partners', 'Mario Alcaraz', 'Chief Financial', 'Administrative Officer', 'ATCG Partners', 'rare bacteria', '10,000 rare strains', 'Deinove shares', 'CONVERSION', 'ALDEI', 'pioneer', 'exploration', 'exploitation', 'January', 'judgment', 'November', 'offer', 'deadline', 'noon', 'result', 'publication', 'notice', 'end', 'place', 'consultation', 'distribution', 'shareholders', 'superbugs', 'microbes', 'antimicrobials', 'rise', 'thousands', 'race', 'Story', 'heart', 'code', 'ISIN', '45 employees', 'network', 'CONTACTS', 'Investors', 'Media', 'communication', 'Attachment', '9']",2023-01-24,2023-01-25,finance.yahoo.com

Pursuant to the amendment  Negma agrees to subscribe to up to EUR 4 million (1 600 bonds) in three tranches to be called at Oxurion‚Äôs discretion. The initial funding program totaled EUR 30 million in two parts  and pursuant to the amendment  Oxurion and Negma have mutually agreed to wind-down the funding program after the completion of the first part  which reduces the total funding under the funding program to EUR 15 million. Negma has waived the liquidity requirement and agreed to a reduced cool down period of 15 trading days  allowing Oxurion to access the full EUR 4 million over less than two months starting in February 2023 (provided the other terms and conditions of the agreement and the bonds are met).While Oxurion continues to carefully manage its cash requirements  the Negma funding alone is not sufficient to finish Oxurion‚Äôs ongoing KALAHARI Phase 2  Part B clinical trial. Oxurion therefore continues to seek additional funding through debt  equity  or non-dilutive funding to support the KALAHARI trial. The KALAHARI trial is evaluating THR-149  Oxurion‚Äôs novel therapeutic for second line therapy  against market leader aflibercept  for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME) for the 40-50% of DME patients that respond suboptimally to standard of care anti-VEGF therapy. The KALAHARI trial has recruited more than 50% of the patients and topline data is currently expected before the end of 2023.Story continues‚ÄúThe urgency for novel therapeutics like THR-149 that could treat DME  the leading cause of blindness in working age adults  remains critical ‚Äù said Tom Graney  CEO of Oxurion. ‚ÄúRecent interim analysis of Part B of our two-part Phase 2 clinical trial of THR-149 indicated that our study should continue. We are on track to have topline results later this year as we advance our approach to developing the next generation standard of care for retinal disorders.‚ÄùAbout OxurionOxurion (Euronext Brussels: OXUR) is a biopharmaceutical company developing next generation standard of care ophthalmic therapies  which are designed to improve and better preserve vision in patients with retinal disorders including diabetic macular edema (DME)  the leading cause of vision loss in working-age people  as well as other conditions.

The decision follows a positive opinion from the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has previously granted ODD and Fast Track Designation to both PXL770 and PXL065 for the treatment of ALD.These molecules have separate and distinct mechanisms of action. PXL770 is a novel  first-in-class direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator. PXL065 is a novel  proprietary deuterium-stabilized R-stereoisomer of pioglitazone which exerts effects via multiple non-genomic pathways engaged by thiazolidinedione molecules. Both compounds are preparing to enter into Phase 2a clinical Proof-of-Concept (POC) biomarker studies in ALD patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) as soon as possible  subject to financing.‚ÄúOrphan Drug Designation in adrenoleukodystrophy for both PXL770 and PXL065 further strengthens the value of these clinical assets where we are preparing to initiate Phase 2 proof-of-concept studies  pending additional financing‚Äù  noted Thomas Kuhn  CEO of Poxel. ‚ÄúWe are in active discussions to restructure our current debt obligations and secure the funding to execute our strategy in rare metabolic diseases‚Äù.Orphan Drug Designation (ODD)ODD in the European Union (EU) is granted by the European Commission based on a positive opinion issued by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Orphan Medical Products (COMP). To qualify for ODD from the European Commission  a product candidate must be intended to treat  prevent  or diagnose a life-threatening or chronically debilitating disease that does not affect more than 5 in 10 000 people across the EU. In addition  there must be sufficient clinical or non-clinical data to suggest the product candidate may produce clinically relevant outcomes  and grounds to indicate it can provide a significant benefit over any currently authorized products. Receiving an orphan drug designation from the European Commission provides companies with certain benefits and incentives including clinical protocol assistance  access to a centralized marketing authorization procedure valid in all EU member states  reduced regulatory fees  and ten years of market exclusivity upon receipt of marketing authorization in the EU. The availability of market exclusivity is intended to encourage the development of medicines for rare diseases by protecting them from competition from similar medicines with similar indications  which cannot be marketed during the exclusivity period.About ALDX-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an orphan neurometabolic disease caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene which encodes for a key protein that is required for metabolism of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) by peroxisomes (cellular organelles). ALD is the most common leukodystrophy with a prevalence similar to hemophilia ‚Äì up to 1/10 000 individuals in the general population have ALD [https://rarediseases.org]. Forms of this disease include cerebral ALD (C-ALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) which is the most common form ‚Äì typically occurring in adolescence through adulthood. AMN is characterized by chronic and progressive distal axonopathy involving the long tracts of the spinal cord and to a lesser extent the peripheral nerves resulting in progressive stiffness and weakness in the legs  impaired gait and balance  incontinence  and loss of sensation. Nearly all men with a diagnosis of ALD will develop AMN  and many women also present with features of AMN with a later onset. C-ALD is characterized by inflammatory demyelination of cells in the brain and typically afflicts children  but many men with AMN may also develop cerebral disease; these white matter brain lesions lead to severe neurologic deficits and death. There are no approved medicines for ALD (other than glucocorticoid supplements for associated adrenal insufficiency). C-ALD when first detected in early childhood  can be treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. HSCT is currently limited to early stage of C-ALD and this procedure is at risk of severe adverse reactions.About Poxel SAPoxel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for chronic serious diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and rare disorders. For the treatment of NASH  PXL065 (deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone) met its primary endpoint in a streamlined Phase 2 trial (DESTINY-1). In rare diseases  development of PXL770  a first-in-class direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator  is focused on the treatment of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). TWYMEEG¬Æ (Imeglimin)  Poxel‚Äôs first-in-class product that targets mitochondrial dysfunction  is marketed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Japan by Sumitomo Pharma and Poxel expects to receive royalties and sales-based payments.

Operating margin: Headline PBIT/Gross profit.Didier Chabassieu  Chairman of the Management Board  stated  ‚ÄúHighCo‚Äôs performance in 2022 is in line with expectations  with slight growth in gross profit (up 0.8%). Last year  we focused on accelerating the growth of our Mobile businesses (up 12.2%)  bringing the share of Digital business to two-thirds of the Group‚Äôs total gross profit. This business growth  combined with sound cost control  has enabled us to deliver very strong operating profitability (21%) and recommend a record-high dividend payout of ‚Ç¨0.40 per share. In a context of high inflation  our teams are working even more closely with our clients to help then in overcoming new challenges.‚ÄùStory continuesSLIGHT BUSINESS GROWTH IN 2022 DRIVEN BY THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF MOBILEAs anticipated  HighCo showed stable business activity in Q4 2022  with gross profit of ‚Ç¨20.04 M (up 0.2%).The Group‚Äôs businesses showed slight growth for FY 2022  up 0.8% to ‚Ç¨77.16 m  with:Double-digit growth in Mobile (up 12.2%);Number of coupons cleared unchanged;Drop in the management of traditional promotions;Downturn in marketing and communication consulting.Digital business was up 1% for FY 2022. Its share in total gross profit rose very slightly to 67% in 2022.Offline businesses held up well over the year (up 0.5%).The Group‚Äôs revenue for FY 2022 came to ‚Ç¨146.4 m.Growth in France of 1.5%FRANCEGross Profit (in ‚Ç¨ M) 2022/2021Change% Totalgross profit2022 2021 Q1 16.14 15.98 +1.0% 85.9% Q2 17.05 16.50 +3.4% 87.4% Q3 16.46 16.30 +1.0% 87.5% Q4 17.79 17.66 +0.7% 88.8% 12-month total 67.44 66.45 +1.5% 87.4%In France  Q4 2022 gross profit rose 0.7% to ‚Ç¨17.79 M.As a result  French business activity grew 1.5% for FY 2022  accounting for 87.4% of the Group‚Äôs gross profit. The main reasons for this growth are: double-digit growth in Mobile businesses (up 11%)  the rise in volumes of coupons cleared (up 2%)  while the management of traditional promotions and the marketing and communication consulting businesses declined.Digital businesses grew 1.7% over the year  and their share increased slightly to account for more than two-thirds of gross profit (67.6%). This growth in Digital stems directly from Mobile activities  which represent 25% of business in France.Impacted by the loss of a marketing and communication consulting client  offline businesses nevertheless grew 1.1% over the year.International business fell 3.6%INTERNATIONALGross Profit (in ‚Ç¨ M) 2022/2021Change% Totalgross profit2022 2021 Q1 2.65 2.61 +1.8% 14.1% Q2 2.46 2.71 -9.5% 12.6% Q3 2.35 2.42 -2.7% 12.5% Q4 2.25 2.34 -3.7% 11.2% 12-month total 9.71 10.07 -3.6% 12.6%In International business  Q4 2022 gross profit decreased 3.7% to ‚Ç¨2.25 M.For the full year 2022  International business fell 3.6% to ‚Ç¨9.71 M  accounting for 12.6% of the Group‚Äôs gross profit. The share of Digital in International businesses represented 62.8% of gross profit.In Belgium  gross profit was down by 7.3%  impacted by the sharp decline in the number of discount coupons cleared (down 18%) and the sharp slowdown in promotion management.With double-digit growth (up 25.8%)  all in digital  business in Other countries (Spain and Italy) is strong and now accounts for 1.9% of the Group‚Äôs gross profit.2022 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONSBased on the year-end closing in progress  slight business growth combined with very sound cost control shows a further increase in headline PBIT. The Group consequently estimates operating margin at 21%  for an increase of 70 basis points  i.e. 20 basis points higher than guidance (2021 operating margin: 20.3%).Due to the performance of Belgian businesses in 2022  medium-term forecasts for the geographical segment have been lowered. Despite steady profitability  partial goodwill impairment is expected to be recognised at 31 December 2022. The impairment would have no impact on the Group‚Äôs annual cash flow or its net cash position.In light of the Group‚Äôs expected results and solid financial position  the Management Board plans to maintain its policy of high shareholder returns:by recommending that the Supervisory Board propose a record-high dividend payout of ‚Ç¨0.40 per share at the next General Meeting  with a further sharp increase of 25% (‚Ç¨0.32 per share paid in 2022 for FY 2021);and by moving forward with its share buyback programme (2022: ‚Ç¨1.68 m  up 28.2% from 2021).2022 annual earnings will be released on 28 March after market close.

Agricultural commodity prices have dipped slightly from their spring 2022 peak but remain high  boosting order intake.SUGAR BEET HARVESTING up 10.5%Although this quarter is not representative for this activity subject to seasonal trends  first-quarter sales showed sustained double-digit growth  in line with Q4 2021‚Äì2022. Sales were driven by new machines  in particular the first sales of the Terra Dos 5  the latest generation of sugar beet harvesters.LEISURE down 19.3%The garden equipment market declined in the Group‚Äôs three main operating regions (primarily in the United Kingdom and  to a lesser extent  in France and Italy). After a challenging 2022  marked by a fall in demand  periods of hot weather  water restrictions and increased inventories at dealers  this quarter‚Äôs sales were nevertheless comparable to Q1 2019. There was an unfavorable basis of comparison  as sales in the first quarter of the previous year were generally higher than usual  in line with the post-COVID surge in this business.The EXEL Yachting business remained broadly stable during the quarter  a period that is not very representative of the business  given its seasonal nature.Story continuesINDUSTRY up 4.8%The trend of the previous year was confirmed in industrial spraying  with stable activity overall  marked by a slight decline in demand in Europe  but offset by continuing robust demand in Asia and North America. With regard to technical hoses  volumes remained low as a result of a decline in demand since the summer of 2022 and destocking at customers‚Äô at the end of the year.OutlookAGRICULTURAL SPRAYINGAgricultural commodity prices are expected to remain high  which will continue to drive machine replacement.Despite the uncertainty surrounding the Russia-Ukraine conflict  our business in the region is thriving  in compliance with the international regulations and with strict controls on customer receipts.The order book remains solid for the coming quarters.The business is maintaining rigorous discipline with regard to selling prices in line with the impact of inflation on costs.Commercialization of TRAXX  an autonomous high-clearance tractor  and 3S Spot Spray Sensor¬Æ  our sensor-based ultra-localized spraying solution for large-crops has begun and will gain momentum over the coming months. Both are major innovations resulting from the work of EXXACT Robotics  our pooled research center dedicated to agricultural equipment.

ESA is working closely with the European Commission to ensure that space benefits EU citizens and to foster a strong and resilient European space economy.""ESA and the EU have been partners in European space for decades. ESA designed and developed the EU's Galileo system - with its 28-satellite constellation and its global ground stations - that together provide a highly accurate  guaranteed global positioning service under civilian control  as well as more than 30 EU Copernicus Earth observation satellites that deliver data to improve the management of the environment  understand and mitigate the effects of climate change  and ensure civil security. ESA has also created the EU's European satellite navigation system for aircraft.Cyberattacks and geopolitics threaten today's increasingly digital world  leading to the disruption of essential supplies such as power and water. In response  ESA has started work on supporting the EU's new flagship space programme - a highly secure  satellite-enabled connectivity system called Iris2 that will promote digital autonomy and provide a strategic asset for the EU.Javier Benedicto  ESA Director of Navigation and Acting Director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications  will tell the conference how ESA will work with space companies in the EU to deliver the Iris2 constellation. The satellites and their ground stations are expected to be operational by the end of 2027  based on contracts to be signed in 2024.He will also outline how ESA is developing the new generation of the EU's Galileo navigation satellites that will support European autonomy and resilience.Simonetta Cheli  ESA Director of Earth Observation  will highlight how ESA can support the evolution and modernisation of the EU's Copernicus Earth observation satellites. Advanced use of Copernicus data and information services will support better policy definition  improved planning  increased transparency and accountability  enabling Europe to achieve the ambitious goal of becoming the first net-zero continent by 2050.Geraldine Naja  ESA Director of Commercialisation  Industry and Procurement  will speak about how ESA is supporting the development of European space innovation  technology and skills.Today the European space stock index - an index of European space-based companies that are currently listed on the stock market - will be launched. The index enables investors and people working in finance to monitor the financial performance of European space companies. It was developed in a partnership between ESA  the European Commission and Euronext  which operates regulated exchanges in Belgium  France  Ireland  Italy  the Netherlands  Norway and Portugal.David Parker  ESA Director of Human and Robotic Exploration  will describe ESA's ambitious plans for space exploration alongside Daniel Neuenschwander  ESA Director of Space Transportation.ESA Astronaut Samatha Cristoforetti will also address the event and speak about the new frontiers of exploration from the Moon to Mars and beyond in a panel session that also includes Eric Morel  ESA's Director of European  Legal and International Matters.Finally Rolf Densing  ESA Director of Operations  will speak on space traffic management for Europe's safe  secure and sustainable use of space  while Massimo Mercati  Head of the ESA Security Office  will address how space assets and services can help with cybersecurity.ESA has also produced a series of images that show how the agency works closely with the EU that are being displayed at the conference.Related Links15th European Space ConferenceThe latest information about the Commercial Satellite IndustryThanks for being there;We need your help.

This decrease is explained on the one hand by the sale of the VSM2 and VSM4 wind power plants in Brazil ((which had produced 0.6 TWh in 2021)  and on the other hand by lower wind and solar resources than in 2021.The increase in revenues (+18%) in a context of lower production (-13%) reflects an increase in the average selling price per MWh in 2022 and is explained by: (i) the contractual indexation of selling prices to inflation for 83% of revenues in 2021  (ii) the replacement of plants with low prices per MWh by projects with higher tariffs  and (iii) the strengthening of the Brazilian real.The year was also marked by a sustained commercial dynamic with a 3.6-fold increase in the volume of long-term electricity sales contracts won in 2022 compared to 2021  from 310 to 1 128 megawatts. The bulk of the volumes won are represented by solar  ground-mounted or rooftop  and corporate PPAs (long-term contracts that link the producer  a Voltalia power plant  directly to the end consumer of the electricity  a large company)8.Q4 2022 revenues from Energy Sales reach ‚Ç¨74.3 million  up +34% (+19% at constant exchange rates) compared to Q4 2021.Quarterly revenues increase due to the higher average selling price per MWh compared to Q4 2021  while quarterly production  at 1.2 TWh  is almost stable compared to Q4 2021: new capacities commissioned have compensated for the exit of the VSM2 and VSM4 projects and the lower resource.By country:In Brazil  revenues benefited from the production of the new SSM1-2 solar plant commissioned in the course of 2022  and from the strengthening of the Brazilian real  but no longer benefited from the production of VSM2 and VSM4 which contributed until the end of November 2021  when they were sold. Q4 2022 was also characterised by less favourable wind conditions than a year earlier;In France  revenue growth was mainly due to the commissioning of a new solar power plant (Carri√®res des Plaines) and the growth of Helexia;In the United Kingdom  revenues benefited from the commissioning of the South Farm solar power plant (49.9 MW) and the Hallen battery storage unit (32 MW / 32 MWh);In the other countries (Belgium  Portugal  Spain  Italy  Greece  Jordan and Egypt)  the contribution of solar energy has been strengthened  in particular by the continued ramp-up of Helexia.SERVICESRevenues in 2022 from Services (internal and external) reach ‚Ç¨386.5 million  up +47% (+45% at constant exchange rates) compared to 2021. Internal revenues (eliminated in consolidation) were up +77% at ‚Ç¨129.1 million  while with third-party customers increased by +35% to 257.4 million euros. The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment grew by +50% to reach ‚Ç¨353.8 million  and the Operation & Maintenance segment by +19% to reach ‚Ç¨32.7 million.Q4 2022 revenues from Services (internal and external) reach ‚Ç¨146.2 million  up +31% (+30% at constant exchange rates) compared to Q4 2021. Revenues from third-party customers decreased (-13%) while internal revenues (eliminated in consolidation) increased 3.3 times. The analysis by segment shows the following developments:The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment posted revenues of ‚Ç¨136.5 million  up +28% at current exchange rates (+27% at constant exchange rates). The segment's internal revenues are multiplied by x2.7  reflecting in particular the dynamics of internal demand for the construction of new power plants  while revenues for third-party customers are down -19%. External Development revenues were lower compared to Q4 2021  which had benefited from the sale of the VSM2 and VSM4 power plants. Other revenue from third-party customers increased. Indeed  Construction is performing well  particularly in Portugal and Greece  as is Equipment Procurement  which continues to be very dynamic  particularly in Italy  Portugal and the United Kingdom.The Operations-Maintenance segment reports revenues of ‚Ç¨9.6 million  up +40% compared to Q4 2021 (+36 at constant exchange rates). Third party customers represent 56% of the segment's revenues.Revenue eliminations for the year 2022 and Q4 2022 amount to respectively ‚Ç¨129.1 million (+77% at current exchange rates and +74% at constant exchange rates) and ‚Ç¨67.3 million (x3.3 at current and constant exchange rates)  reflecting the strong increase in internal services for the benefit of the plants under construction and operation owned by Voltalia.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (SELECTED)Renault Group signs a 350 MW solar electricity supply contract to support its energy transition9The 15-year contract is the largest corporate renewable electricity supply contract (Corporate PPA) ever signed in France by a company.

The job cuts will take place over the next year and about 15 locations will be affected  he said.‚ÄúThe reality is that the macro environment has become more difficult and has changed a lot "" Van Dijk said. ‚ÄúThis also means that the cost of capital has changed a lot  as interest rates go up and risk premiums also go up.""Van Dijk declined to say how many people would lose their jobs. Prosus employed 30 000 people globally at the end of March last year  according to an earnings report  but these roles are spread across corporate hubs and a range of businesses the e-commerce group invests in and operates  including in classified advertising  food delivery and internet payments.Companies from Amazon. com Inc. to Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google have recently announced staff reductions after years of growth  as they seek to lower costs and improve profitability. The tech sector announced 97 171 job cuts in 2022  up 649% compared to the previous year  according to consulting firm Challenger  Gray & Christmas Inc.Prosus will also seek to cut costs at the more than 80 companies it has invested in  although those efforts have different timelines and scales  according to Van Dijk. The company has already closed some offices and made cuts at others  he said. The Euronext-listed firm previously closed its iFood business in Colombia and its autos business in Peru and Ecuador.The measures should help Prosus become profitable by the first half of 2025  according to Van Dijk.The e-commerce firm has been working on narrowing the discount between the sum of its parts and its stake in China‚Äôs Tencent Holdings Ltd. for years  with both Prosus and its Cape Town-based parent Naspers having taken a number of steps to address the problem.These include the spinoff of its African PayTV business  the creation of Prosus through the Euronext-listing of its internet holdings  a share swap between Naspers and Prosus  and a number of share buybacks that are ongoing.Tencent  in which Prosus is the largest investor  has already announced job cuts in recent months.

OfferIf the Company (acting through the Directors)  at any time prior to the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares tendered in the Tender Offer (and including where it has previously deferred the

taken as a whole if the Tender Offer were to proceed; or(c) the Company will not  immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Tender Offer  continue to

DCAC Ordinary Shareholder to the jurisdiction of the courts of Guernsey in relation to all matters arising out of or in connection with the Tender Offer.8.2 To the extent not prohibited by or ineffective under applicable law  each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder by whom or on whose behalf a tender through an Admitted Institution is given irrevocably agrees to assume liability for  pay and indemnify the Company from and against any and all liabilities  obligations  damages  losses  settlements  judgments  claims  actions  suits  penalties  costs  expenses and other sanctions (civil or criminal) suffered or incurred by either of them as a result of the breach by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder of any of the undertakings  representations  warranties  or agreements contained in

DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who are not resident in Guernsey or the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal requirements. It is the responsibility of any DCAC Ordinary Shareholder wishing to make a tender to satisfy himself  herself or itself as to the full observance of the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in connection with the Tender Offer  including the obtaining of any governmental  exchange control or other consents which may berequired  the compliance with other necessary formalities and the payment of any transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due insuch jurisdiction. Any such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder will be responsible for payment of any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due by whomsoever payable and the Company and any person acting on its behalf shall be fully indemnified and heldharmless by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder for any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments such person may be required to pay. No steps have been taken to authorise the extending of the Tender Offer in any territory outside Guernsey or the Netherlands.10.2 The provisions of this paragraph and any other terms of the Tender Offer relating to shareholders outside Guernsey and the Netherlands may be waived  varied or modified as regards specific DCAC Ordinary Shareholders or on a general basis by the Company.10.3 The provisions of this paragraph 10 supersede any terms of the Tender Offer which may be inconsistent with it.10.4 All DCAC Ordinary Shareholders wishing to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares in the Tender Offer should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal or regulatory requirements. If you are in any doubt about your position  you should consult your professional adviser in the relevant territory.PART IV ‚Äì RISK FACTORSPrior to deciding whether or not to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should carefully consider this Tender Document in its entirety  as well as the section ""Risk Factors"" in the DCAC IPO Prospectus and the risk factors discussed in the section ""Risk Factors"" in the Shareholders Circular dated 20 December 2022 (the ""Circular"").The risks described below have emerged or changed in light of the Tender Offer. The occurrence of any of the risks below could have a material adverse effect on the Tender Offer and on the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares.All of these risk factors and events are contingencies that may or may not occur. A number of these risks described below may occur simultaneously. The order in which these risks are presented is not necessarily an indication of the likelihood of the risks actually materialising  of the potential significance of the risks or of the scope of any potential negative impact to the Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should carefully consider all of the risk factors set out in this Part IV.Although the Company believes that the risks described below are the material risks concerning the Tender Offer  they are not the only risks relating to the Tender Offer. Other risks  events  facts or circumstances not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial could  individually or cumulatively  prove to be important and may have a significant negative impact on the Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders can only tender up to 95% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will consequently retain 5% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares.Under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders can only tender up to 95% of their shareholding in the Company. As a result  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will in any case retain 5% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares and remain DCAC Ordinary Shareholder in the Company for the remainder of their shareholding. Other than through the Stub Tender Offer  which is  at the date of this Tender Document still subject to approval by an extraordinary general meeting of the Company and which is only available for DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tendered their full entitlement of DCAC Ordinary Shares under this Tender Offer  there is no certainty that DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will be able to sell or otherwise dispose of their Remaining Holding  should they so wish.As the Sponsor may not tender its DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer and/or other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may decide not to tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may experience immediate and substantial dilution of their shareholding in the Company.The Sponsor may (or may not) tender its DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer. In addition  other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may decide not to tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares. As a result  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may experience an immediate and substantial dilution of their shareholding in the Company  causing the Sponsor and/or such other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders to obtain increased voting power  thereby increasing their respective influence over all matters requiring DCAC Ordinary Shareholder approval and decreasing your influence over matters presented to the DCAC Ordinary Shareholders for approval  including  subject to the Amended Articles  approval of a future business combination.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tender their DCAC Ordinary Shares may suffer from reduced value or proceeds in future.Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares will experience an immediate and substantial dilution of their shareholding in the Company  so that the Sponsor and other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will obtain an increased proportion of the economic value of the Company. Whilst there is no guarantee of future success  such tendering DCAC Ordinary Shareholder may accordingly suffer reduced overall value compared to those DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender their DCAC Ordinary Shares.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders cannot withdraw their tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares without the written consent of the Company or once their tender has become unconditional.Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares will be deemed to have agreed that  in consideration of the Company to process his tender  such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder will not revoke its tender or its DCAC Ordinary Shares without the prior consent of the Company. Once tendered  a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder can therefore not withdraw its tender under the Tender Offer  unless the Company consents to such withdrawal.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares will be locked.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares will be locked. During this period  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will not be able to (re)sell  pledge  encumber or otherwise transfer such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares or any rights related thereto.The Tender Offer is subject to certain conditions and the Board may decide to postpone or terminate the Tender Offer at any time prior to the purchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer as a result of which DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share at a later point in time or not at all.The Tender Offer is subject to the conditions that (a) there has been no Material Adverse Change nor Force Majeure Event  (b) the Board being satisfied that the Company has in its control or to its order the aggregate of the Offer Price for all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares  the aggregate of the Offer Price previously credited to the Escrow Account  (c) the Board continuing to be satisfied that that the Company will  immediately following the purchase of all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares (as if all DCAC Ordinary Shareholders were to tender for acquisition their full entitlement)  satisfy the statutory solvency test prescribed by the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 as amended and (d) the Tender Offer is not terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Tender Offer Document. The Company may at its sole discretion terminate or postpone the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Tender Offer Document  if the Company (acting through the Directors) considers in its reasonable opinion that (a) it has become unlawful  impractical or inappropriate for the Company to fund the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares without materially harming DCAC Ordinary Shareholders as a whole or (b) the completion of the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer would have material adverse fiscal or other consequences (whether by reason of a change in legislation or practice or otherwise) for the Company or its DCAC Ordinary Shareholders taken as a whole if the Tender Offer were to proceed or (c) if the Company will not immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Tender Offer  continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test under the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008  as amended. If these conditions are not met or if the Board decides to delay or terminate the Tender Offer prior to the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share at a later point in time or not at all.The net consideration received by a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder may be less than ¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary ShareThe cash consideration of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share does not include costs relating to a Shareholder‚Äôs broker  bank or other financial intermediary or advisor. Nor is the Company responsible for any taxes  duties or similar imposts suffered by the Shareholder. The net payment per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share received by DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may therefore be lower than the ¬£10.789 repurchase price.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date and such deadline may differ for each individual broker  bank or other financial intermediary. The Company does not have any knowledge on such deadlines and therefore the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder should consult its broker  bank or other financial intermediary in this regard.Any tenders not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Tender Document and in a timely manner may be invalid.Submitting a tender that is not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Tender Document  may result in an invalid tender and ultimately not being able to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer (thereby also not receiving the cash consideration of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share). DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that none of Van Lanschot Kempen  Admina  the Company or any other person is or will be obliged to give notice of any defects  irregularities  omissions  delays or non-receipts in tenders of DCAC Ordinary Shareholders  and that none of them will incur any liability for failure to give any such notice.The Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase up to 95% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares  and following the Tender Offer you will no longer have a repurchase right  other than potentially through the Stub Tender Offer.The Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase up to 95% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that the articles of association of the Company no longer provide for a repurchase right and that there is no assurance that the Company will provide for such a repurchase right in the future  other than potentially through the Stub Tender Offer. There is therefore no assurance that DCAC Ordinary Shareholders can have their DCAC Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Company other than through this one-time Tender Offer and the Stub Tender Offer.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender their full entitlement of DCAC Ordinary Shares will not be eligible to use the balance of DCAC Ordinary Shares not so tendered to participate in the Stub Tender OfferThe Company intends  through the Stub Tender Offer  to offer DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders the opportunity to tender for repurchase up to 5% of DCAC Ordinary Shares (that are not the subject of and are not tenders for purchase under this Tender Offer) held as at the Record Date (at all times subject to the Stub Tender Offer being limited to 325 000 DCAC Ordinary Shares in aggregate) and all of their DCAC Public Warrants  provided that should DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Warrant Holders decide to tender  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders shall be required to tender their entire holdings of DCAC Public Warrants together with their DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Stub Tender Offer as at the Record Date. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that their decision to offer DCAC Ordinary Shares under this Tender Offer therefore also affects their eligibility to offer DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Stub Tender Offer and that tendering less than their full entitlement of DCAC Ordinary Shares  or nothing at all  will result in their being ineligible to tender such DCAC Ordinary Shares in the Stub Tender Offer.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may face a significant decrease in net asset value of their shareholdingFollowing the provision and distribution of cash to meet the Tender Offer  a substantial part of DCAC‚Äôs then remaining cash will be applied to settle outstanding liabilities  resulting in limited remaining assets and a decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share. This may in particular affect DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares  as they will not receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary Share for DCAC Ordinary Shares that they do not (successfully) tender. If the Company is wound up or liquidated in the future  the decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share may result in DCAC Ordinary Shareholders receiving substantially less than ¬£10.25 per DCAC Ordinary Share or nothing at all.There is no guarantee that DCAC will be able to satisfy the statutory solvency test following the acquisition of DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Tender OfferPursuant to section 320 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008  as amended  the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Tender Offer would be considered to be a distribution for the purposes of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 and therefore the Board must comply with section 303 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 in respect of making distributions  including ensuring satisfaction of the statutory ""solvency test"" as defined in section 527 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 being (in respect of companies that are not ""supervised companies""  like DCAC) that DCAC is able to pay its debts as they become due and that the value of DCAC's assets is greater than the value of its liabilities.

Pursuant to the amendment  Negma agrees to subscribe to up to EUR 4 million (1 600 bonds) in three tranches to be called at Oxurion‚Äôs discretion. The initial funding program totaled EUR 30 million in two parts  and pursuant to the amendment  Oxurion and Negma have mutually agreed to wind-down the funding program after the completion of the first part  which reduces the total funding under the funding program to EUR 15 million. Negma has waived the liquidity requirement and agreed to a reduced cool down period of 15 trading days  allowing Oxurion to access the full EUR 4 million over less than two months starting in February 2023 (provided the other terms and conditions of the agreement and the bonds are met).While Oxurion continues to carefully manage its cash requirements  the Negma funding alone is not sufficient to finish Oxurion‚Äôs ongoing KALAHARI Phase 2  Part B clinical trial. Oxurion therefore continues to seek additional funding through debt  equity  or non-dilutive funding to support the KALAHARI trial. The KALAHARI trial is evaluating THR-149  Oxurion‚Äôs novel therapeutic for second line therapy  against market leader aflibercept  for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME) for the 40-50% of DME patients that respond suboptimally to standard of care anti-VEGF therapy. The KALAHARI trial has recruited more than 50% of the patients and topline data is currently expected before the end of 2023.‚ÄúThe urgency for novel therapeutics like THR-149 that could treat DME  the leading cause of blindness in working age adults  remains critical ‚Äù said Tom Graney  CEO of Oxurion. ‚ÄúRecent interim analysis of Part B of our two-part Phase 2 clinical trial of THR-149 indicated that our study should continue. We are on track to have topline results later this year as we advance our approach to developing the next generation standard of care for retinal disorders.‚ÄùAbout OxurionOxurion (Euronext Brussels: OXUR) is a biopharmaceutical company developing next generation standard of care ophthalmic therapies  which are designed to improve and better preserve vision in patients with retinal disorders including diabetic macular edema (DME)  the leading cause of vision loss in working-age people  as well as other conditions. Oxurion intends to play an important role in the treatment of retinal disorders  including the successful development of THR-149  its novel therapeutic for the treatment of DME. THR-149 is a potent plasma kallikrein inhibitor being developed as a potential new standard of care for the up to 50% of DME patients showing suboptimal response to anti-VEGF therapy.

This three-week exercise was organized in December by the US Navy's 5th Fleet in Bahrain to test new autonomous technologies. It is part of the US Navy's plan to establish the world's first autonomous drone fleet  comprising one hundred drones  in the Persian Gulf.The U.S. Navy established Task Force 59 in September 2021 to speed new tech integration across the 5th Fleet  and seek alternative  cost-effective solutions for conducting Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) missions.DriX  Exail's unmanned surface vehicle (USV)  was one of 15 USVs and aerial drones (UAVs) selected to participate in the exercise  which staged an MDA mission. The USVs and UAVs were tasked with gathering data on the surface in order to detect and identify potential threats and communicate with each other using a common system.With its highly hydrodynamic monohull  DriX showed high reliability with excellent seakeeping and speed results  accomplishing its mission of gathering data on the surface and proving its capacity to integrate third party radar and cameras. The ability of DriX to integrate within a military communications network was also successfully proven and the USV further meets requirements in terms of communications redundancy  crucial for minimizing risk during military operations.The success of these trials  which demonstrated the added value that autonomous technologies can bring to the maritime domain  confirms the prospects for large-scale deployment of robotic systems in applications beyond mine-hunting.About Exail TechnologiesExail Technologies is an industrial company specialized in advanced technologies in the fields of autonomous robotics  navigation  aerospace and photonics.

The current production capacity of 750 kW will be increased to 2.5 MW (approx. 1 t./day) in early 2024 to meet increased customer demand in the region. Its storage capacity  currently around 700 kg  will also be increased to almost 5 tonnes.Lhyfe Bretagne (Morbihan  France)In the second half of 2022  Lhyfe obtained the building permit for a unit with a total capacity of 5 MW (i.e. approximately 2 t/day of green hydrogen) located in Morbihan in Bretagne. This unit  supported by the ADEME (French Environment and Energy Management Agency) to the tune of ‚Ç¨2.8 million and expected to be operational in the second half of 2023  will be the company's second hydrogen production site.As a reminder  the consortium made up of the companies HyGO  GNVert and Lhyfe has been appointed by the Lorient agglomeration as the successful bidder for a Global Performance Contract for the design  construction  operation and maintenance of two renewable hydrogen refueling stations. Lhyfe will supply the renewable hydrogen for a period of 10 years.Lhyfe Occitanie (Bessi√®res  France)In Occitanie (France)  Lhyfe has also obtained the permit for the construction of the 5 MW production unit in Bessi√®res (Haute-Garonne)  which is scheduled to be commissioned at the end of 2023.This project is the winner of the Corridor H2 tender for projects  supported by the Occitanie region  whose objective is to decarbonize the transport of goods and passengers on a North/South axis running from the Mediterranean to the North Sea  through the development of green hydrogen uses.Lhyfe Bade-W√ºrtemberg (Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd  Germany)In Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd  Germany  Lhyfe has submitted the permit for the construction of a plant with a production capacity of 10 MW (about 3 t/day). The plant is expected to be commissioned in the first half of 2024. It will be accompanied by a hydrogen distribution station accessible to the general public  built and operated by a Lhyfe partner  and a pipeline to supply the future ""H2-Aspen"" technology park with green hydrogen.This project is part of the HyFIVE (Hydrogen For Innovative Vehicles) project which has received ‚Ç¨33 million in funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).Lhyfe Groningen (Delfzijl  The Netherlands)In the Netherlands  Lhyfe aims to build a large-scale renewable green hydrogen production plant in the Delfzijl chemical cluster in the northern province of Groningen. This plant could reach a production capacity of 200 MW (about 55 t/day).Lhyfe has already secured the land and the electrical connection of the plant. The realization of the project is subject to obtaining the required operating licenses and building permits  as well as the financial investment decision. It is expected to be commissioned in 2026 at the earliest.Signing of industrial and technological agreements for the supply of key equipment'sThrough these agreements  Lhyfe has secured its access to strategic equipment (electrolysers  compressors  distribution systems) for the construction of its production units  the production of green and renewable hydrogen and its logistical distribution throughout Europe.Agreement with Hexagon Purus for the delivery of hydrogen distribution systemsLhyfe and Hexagon Purus  a leading supplier of hydrogen systems  have entered into an agreement for the supply of hydrogen distribution systems with Hexagon Purus Type 4 composite high-pressure cylinders. Lhyfe will be able to deliver up to 19 tonnes of green hydrogen per trip  equivalent to the consumption of 650 buses.Agreement with Hiperbaric for the supply of high-pressure compressorsLhyfe and Hiperbaric  a Spanish group and world leader in high pressure technologies  have signed an agreement to supply high pressure compressors for the storage and transportation of green and renewable hydrogen.The Hiperbaric hydrogen compression technology approaches an isothermal compression process  resulting in high reliability and low energy consumption. The Hiperbaric range of compressors is capable of compressing hydrogen from an input pressure of 20 bar up to 200-950 bar for storage tank filling.Order of Plug electrolysers for a total capacity of 50 MWLhyfe has signed a purchase agreement for ten Plug electrolyser systems of 5 MW each with the American Plug Group  a major player in green hydrogen. These electrolysers  with a total capacity of 50 MW (up to 20 tonnes per day)  are intended to enable Lhyfe to produce green hydrogen for mobility in several onshore plants across Europe  with delivery of the equipment from 2023.The order follows on from a partnership with Plug to jointly develop green hydrogen production plants across Europe. The aim of the collaboration is to co-develop by 2025 a total hydrogen production capacity of 300 MW (up to 120 tonnes of green hydrogen per day) across Europe  which will mainly serve on- and off-road mobility applications.Structuring & development of the companySuccess of the 2022 recruitment planLhyfe is pleased to announce the remarkable success of its 2022 recruitment campaign  a year marked by the arrival of more than a hundred new employees to support the increase in the number of projects and the internationalization of the company  with now 6 subsidiaries across Europe and a presence in 11 countries.At the end of 2022  Lhyfe's workforce will be 150 employees (vs. 57 at the end of 2021)  of which 40% will be dedicated to engineering  in order to pursue the development of solutions and the deployment of production sites  and 40% to business development in all the geographical regions targeted by the company. By the end of 2022  20% of Lhyfe's workforce was internationally based.In order to support its development  Lhyfe has continued to structure itself on a human level with the creation of key positions.Philippe Desorme joined Lhyfe in 2022 as Vice President Sales & Business Development  to enhance Lhyfe's business development capabilities alongside Taia Kronborg  Chief Business Officer. Prior to joining Lhyfe  Philippe Desorme spent most of his career since 1998 in the industrial gases sector at Linde Group where he held several position as Head of Market Segment & Application for the Southern Europe region and Sales Director in Africa and France.In order to strengthen its health  safety and environment policy  Lhyfe has also recruited Cl√©ment Falk as HSE (Health  Safety and Environment) Director. An expert in process safety engineering and chemical technologies  Cl√©ment Falk has over 16 years of international experience in the chemical  oil and gas (onshore & offshore) and new energies (offshore wind farms) industries.For international development  Colin Brown and Frans-Pieter Lindeboom have been appointed Country Manager UK & Ireland and Country Manager Spain respectively  following the incorporation of these two new subsidiaries in 2022. Colin Brown has held various Development positions in groups in the sector renewable energies (Aker  Vattenfall  SSE Renewables  etc.). Frans-Pieter Lindeboom has 20 years of experience in the energy sector  including nearly 15 years in the Spanish group Repsol  in charge of supply chain management for the group's offshore platforms.Finally  Nathalie Guillot joined Lhyfe in early 2023 as Human Resources Director. Prior to joining Lhyfe  Nathalie Guillot was Deputy Human Resources Director  in charge of France  for the Antargaz group.Continued progress in offshore green hydrogen productionInauguration of the world's first offshore green hydrogen production pilot siteIn September 2022  Lhyfe inaugurated its offshore green hydrogen production demonstrator  the world's first offshore hydrogen production pilot plant  on the SEM-REV  Europe's first multi-technology offshore test site off the coast of Le Croisic. The Sealhyfe platform has a capacity of 1 MW  which means it can produce about 400 kg of green hydrogen per day.At the end of the 6-month test phase for all the equipment (desalination systems  cooling  stack behavior  remote control  energy management  resistance to environmental conditions  etc.) the Sealhyfe platform  docked in the port of Saint-Nazaire  will leave for a 12-month period off the Atlantic coast  less than 1 km from the floating wind turbine.Collaboration with Nantes Saint-Nazaire Port to develop offshore green hydrogenLhyfe and Nantes Saint-Nazaire Port  France's fourth largest seaport  have signed a partnership agreement to develop the renewable hydrogen sector at sea and thus accelerate the energy transition in the Loire estuary.This collaboration should make it possible to identify port spaces and facilities likely to host prototypes and to test innovative solutions. The partnership also covers the identification of industrial needs related to the construction of equipment for the mass production of hydrogen at sea and the port infrastructures necessary for the production  launching and integration of this future equipment. Finally  the two parties are combining their thinking on the issue of repatriating the hydrogen produced massively at sea to land in order to define the industrial and logistical requirements for receiving and injecting the gas into the land network.Offshore project of 10 MW in BelgiumThe HOPE (Hydrogen Offshore Production for Europe) project  led by a consortium coordinated by Lhyfe  has received a positive evaluation under the 2022-TC01-10 call for projects of the Clean Hydrogen Partnership  co-funded by the European Union. As a result  the project partners started the preparation phase of the subsidy agreement  which will end no later than May 2023.The project consists of designing  building and operating by 2025 the first 10 MW renewable hydrogen production unit in the North Sea off the coast of Belgium. The purpose is to prove the technical and financial viability of producing renewable hydrogen offshore and transporting it by pipeline to serve onshore customers. The project will produce a wide range of exploitable results  as well as pre-feasibility studies and techno-economic assessments of large-scale offshore concepts.Commercial pipeline at the end of 2022: 9.8 GW of production capacitySupported by the RepowerEU European Energy Independence Plan  Lhyfe's commercial portfolio continued to strengthen in the 2nd half of 2022.At the end of 2022  Lhyfe's commercial pipeline[2] represented a total installed production capacity of 9.8 GW (unchanged from mid-September 2022).Within this commercial portfolio  projects at an advanced stage of development[3] represented a total installed generation capacity of 759 MW at the end of the year (vs. 629 MW mid-September 2022).With this strong commercial pipeline  Lhyfe confirms the objectives set at the time of its IPO to make the company one of the leaders in green hydrogen production in Europe[4].Lhyfe aims to have a total installed capacity of 55 MW by 2024.By 2026  Lhyfe aims to have a total installed capacity of 200 MW  as well as:around ‚Ç¨200m in consolidated revenue;Group EBITDA[5] at breakeven.By 2030  the company plans to become a green hydrogen production reference player and more specifically to have over 3 GW in total installed capacity.Long term  Lhyfe is targeting a Group EBITDA margin above 30%[6].Financial calendarDate Release Wednesday 22 March 2023 FY 2022 results (audited) Tuesday 23 May 2023 General Meeting Wednesday 20 September 2023 H1 2023 results (audited)About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group dedicated to the energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen.

The current production capacity of 750 kW will be increased to 2.5 MW (approx. 1 t./day) in early 2024 to meet increased customer demand in the region. Its storage capacity  currently around 700 kg  will also be increased to almost 5 tonnes.Lhyfe Bretagne (Morbihan  France)In the second half of 2022  Lhyfe obtained the building permit for a unit with a total capacity of 5 MW (i.e. approximately 2 t/day of green hydrogen) located in Morbihan in Bretagne. This unit  supported by the ADEME (French Environment and Energy Management Agency) to the tune of ‚Ç¨2.8 million and expected to be operational in the second half of 2023  will be the company's second hydrogen production site.As a reminder  the consortium made up of the companies HyGO  GNVert and Lhyfe has been appointed by the Lorient agglomeration as the successful bidder for a Global Performance Contract for the design  construction  operation and maintenance of two renewable hydrogen refueling stations. Lhyfe will supply the renewable hydrogen for a period of 10 years.Lhyfe Occitanie (Bessi√®res  France)In Occitanie (France)  Lhyfe has also obtained the permit for the construction of the 5 MW production unit in Bessi√®res (Haute-Garonne)  which is scheduled to be commissioned at the end of 2023.This project is the winner of the Corridor H2 tender for projects  supported by the Occitanie region  whose objective is to decarbonize the transport of goods and passengers on a North/South axis running from the Mediterranean to the North Sea  through the development of green hydrogen uses.Lhyfe Bade-W√ºrtemberg (Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd  Germany)In Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd  Germany  Lhyfe has submitted the permit for the construction of a plant with a production capacity of 10 MW (about 3 t/day). The plant is expected to be commissioned in the first half of 2024. It will be accompanied by a hydrogen distribution station accessible to the general public  built and operated by a Lhyfe partner  and a pipeline to supply the future ""H2-Aspen"" technology park with green hydrogen.This project is part of the HyFIVE (Hydrogen For Innovative Vehicles) project which has received ‚Ç¨33 million in funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).Lhyfe Groningen (Delfzijl  The Netherlands)In the Netherlands  Lhyfe aims to build a large-scale renewable green hydrogen production plant in the Delfzijl chemical cluster in the northern province of Groningen. This plant could reach a production capacity of 200 MW (about 55 t/day).Lhyfe has already secured the land and the electrical connection of the plant. The realization of the project is subject to obtaining the required operating licenses and building permits  as well as the financial investment decision. It is expected to be commissioned in 2026 at the earliest.Signing of industrial and technological agreements for the supply of key equipment'sThrough these agreements  Lhyfe has secured its access to strategic equipment (electrolysers  compressors  distribution systems) for the construction of its production units  the production of green and renewable hydrogen and its logistical distribution throughout Europe.Agreement with Hexagon Purus for the delivery of hydrogen distribution systemsLhyfe and Hexagon Purus  a leading supplier of hydrogen systems  have entered into an agreement for the supply of hydrogen distribution systems with Hexagon Purus Type 4 composite high-pressure cylinders. Lhyfe will be able to deliver up to 19 tonnes of green hydrogen per trip  equivalent to the consumption of 650 buses.Agreement with Hiperbaric for the supply of high-pressure compressorsLhyfe and Hiperbaric  a Spanish group and world leader in high pressure technologies  have signed an agreement to supply high pressure compressors for the storage and transportation of green and renewable hydrogen.The Hiperbaric hydrogen compression technology approaches an isothermal compression process  resulting in high reliability and low energy consumption. The Hiperbaric range of compressors is capable of compressing hydrogen from an input pressure of 20 bar up to 200-950 bar for storage tank filling.Order of Plug electrolysers for a total capacity of 50 MWLhyfe has signed a purchase agreement for ten Plug electrolyser systems of 5 MW each with the American Plug Group  a major player in green hydrogen. These electrolysers  with a total capacity of 50 MW (up to 20 tonnes per day)  are intended to enable Lhyfe to produce green hydrogen for mobility in several onshore plants across Europe  with delivery of the equipment from 2023.The order follows on from a partnership with Plug to jointly develop green hydrogen production plants across Europe. The aim of the collaboration is to co-develop by 2025 a total hydrogen production capacity of 300 MW (up to 120 tonnes of green hydrogen per day) across Europe  which will mainly serve on- and off-road mobility applications.Structuring & development of the companySuccess of the 2022 recruitment planLhyfe is pleased to announce the remarkable success of its 2022 recruitment campaign  a year marked by the arrival of more than a hundred new employees to support the increase in the number of projects and the internationalization of the company  with now 6 subsidiaries across Europe and a presence in 11 countries.At the end of 2022  Lhyfe's workforce will be 150 employees (vs. 57 at the end of 2021)  of which 40% will be dedicated to engineering  in order to pursue the development of solutions and the deployment of production sites  and 40% to business development in all the geographical regions targeted by the company. By the end of 2022  20% of Lhyfe's workforce was internationally based.In order to support its development  Lhyfe has continued to structure itself on a human level with the creation of key positions.Philippe Desorme joined Lhyfe in 2022 as Vice President Sales & Business Development  to enhance Lhyfe's business development capabilities alongside Taia Kronborg  Chief Business Officer. Prior to joining Lhyfe  Philippe Desorme spent most of his career since 1998 in the industrial gases sector at Linde Group where he held several position as Head of Market Segment & Application for the Southern Europe region and Sales Director in Africa and France.In order to strengthen its health  safety and environment policy  Lhyfe has also recruited Cl√©ment Falk as HSE (Health  Safety and Environment) Director. An expert in process safety engineering and chemical technologies  Cl√©ment Falk has over 16 years of international experience in the chemical  oil and gas (onshore & offshore) and new energies (offshore wind farms) industries.For international development  Colin Brown and Frans-Pieter Lindeboom have been appointed Country Manager UK & Ireland and Country Manager Spain respectively  following the incorporation of these two new subsidiaries in 2022. Colin Brown has held various Development positions in groups in the sector renewable energies (Aker  Vattenfall  SSE Renewables  etc.). Frans-Pieter Lindeboom has 20 years of experience in the energy sector  including nearly 15 years in the Spanish group Repsol  in charge of supply chain management for the group's offshore platforms.Finally  Nathalie Guillot joined Lhyfe in early 2023 as Human Resources Director.

Prosus employed 30 000 people globally at the end of March last year  according to an earnings report  but these roles are spread across corporate hubs and a range of businesses the e-commerce group invests in and operates  including in classified advertising  food delivery and internet payments.Naspers shares closed 1.7% lower in Johannesburg on Wednesday  and Prosus declined 0.2% at 5:15 p.m. in Amsterdam.Companies from Amazon.com Inc. to Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google have recently announced staff reductions after years of growth  as they seek to lower costs and improve profitability. The tech sector announced 97 171 job cuts in 2022  up 649% compared to the previous year  according to consulting firm Challenger  Gray & Christmas Inc.Prosus will also seek to cut costs at the more than 80 companies it has invested in  although those efforts have different timelines and scales  according to Van Dijk. The company has already closed some offices and made cuts at others  he said. The Euronext-listed firm previously closed its iFood business in Colombia and its autos business in Peru and Ecuador.The measures should help Prosus become profitable by the first half of 2025  according to Van Dijk.The e-commerce firm has been working on narrowing the discount between the sum of its parts and its stake in China‚Äôs Tencent Holdings Ltd. for years  with both Prosus and its Cape Town-based parent Naspers having taken a number of steps to address the problem.These include the spinoff of its African PayTV business  the creation of Prosus through the Euronext-listing of its internet holdings  a share swap between Naspers and Prosus  and a number of share buybacks that are ongoing.Tencent  in which Prosus is the largest investor  has already announced job cuts in recent months.

This three-week exercise was organized in December by the US Navy's 5th Fleet in Bahrain to test new autonomous technologies. It is part of the US Navy's plan to establish the world's first autonomous drone fleet  comprising one hundred drones  in the Persian Gulf.The U.S. Navy established Task Force 59 in September 2021 to speed new tech integration across the 5th Fleet  and seek alternative  cost-effective solutions for conducting Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) missions.DriX  Exail's unmanned surface vehicle (USV)  was one of 15 USVs and aerial drones (UAVs) selected to participate in the exercise  which staged an MDA mission. The USVs and UAVs were tasked with gathering data on the surface in order to detect and identify potential threats and communicate with each other using a common system.With its highly hydrodynamic monohull  DriX showed high reliability with excellent seakeeping and speed results  accomplishing its mission of gathering data on the surface and proving its capacity to integrate third party radar and cameras. The ability of DriX to integrate within a military communications network was also successfully proven and the USV further meets requirements in terms of communications redundancy  crucial for minimizing risk during military operations.The success of these trials  which demonstrated the added value that autonomous technologies can bring to the maritime domain  confirms the prospects for large-scale deployment of robotic systems in applications beyond mine-hunting.About Exail TechnologiesExail Technologies is an industrial company specialized in advanced technologies in the fields of autonomous robotics  navigation  aerospace and photonics.

The job cuts are taking place over a 12 month-period and about 15 locations will be affected  he said.¬© Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg Prosus NV Chief Executive Officer Bob van Dijk Interview‚ÄúThe reality is that the macro environment has become more difficult and has changed a lot ‚Äù Van Dijk said. ‚ÄúThis also means that the cost of capital has changed a lot  as interest rates go up and risk premiums also go up.‚ÄùVan Dijk declined to say how many people would lose their jobs. Prosus employed 30 000 people globally at the end of March last year  according to an earnings report  but these roles are spread across corporate hubs and a range of businesses the e-commerce group invests in and operates  including in classified advertising  food delivery and internet payments.Naspers shares closed 1.7% lower in Johannesburg on Wednesday  and Prosus declined 0.2% at 5:15 p.m. in Amsterdam.Companies from Amazon.com Inc. to Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google have recently announced staff reductions after years of growth  as they seek to lower costs and improve profitability.
