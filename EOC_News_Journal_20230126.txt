Companies and investors now search for alternatives  including swaps  buybacks and direct payments to bondholders.Some companies like fertilizer producer Uralkali  miner Norilsk Nikel and metals giant Metalloinvest have opted to change bond documentation and pay the debt directly to investors in rubles  the outlet said. The country‚Äôs energy major Gazprom and one of the world‚Äôs largest steel producers  Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works PJSC  have swapped some of their eurobonds for ruble debt.Gazprom Deputy Chairman Famil Sadygov told Bloomberg that replacement bonds were ‚Äúthe most reliable way‚Äù to service debt given the restrictions on financial infrastructure. He noted that holdings of ten of the bonds have already been substituted and another 12 will be replaced by the end of March  adding that Gazprom pays coupons on both the swapped Russian bonds and the remaining international bonds.Following EU sanctions  Europe‚Äôs two major central depositories ‚Äì Euroclear and Clearstream ‚Äì have only been processing transactions verified by paying agents. The clearing houses have been reluctant to process corporate actions  forcing companies to find ways to bypass European depositories.Companies have realized that sanctions have disrupted so many processes needed to keep bonds that it‚Äôs become necessary to take them out of the market.A portfolio manager at Armbrok investment company  Dmitry Dorofeev  told Bloomberg that ‚Äúin a couple of months everything is going to be bought out‚Äù by local investors  adding that ‚ÄúRussian companies will replace bonds and return to Russia.‚ÄùRussia‚Äôs international corporate bond market declined by about $12.7 billion from $85.6 billion since the imposition of Ukraine-related sanctions on Moscow  according to the outlet.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,negative,0.0,0.06,0.94,True,English,"['Russian companies', 'new ways', 'debt', 'Bloomberg', 'Gazprom Deputy Chairman Famil Sadygov', 'two major central depositories', 'international corporate bond market', 'energy major Gazprom', 'metals giant Metalloinvest', 'largest steel producers', 'Steel Works PJSC', 'Armbrok investment company', 'critical financial operations', 'remaining international bonds', 'bond documentation', 'corporate actions', 'European depositories', 'financial processes', 'financial infrastructure', 'unsanctioned ones', 'Wall Street', 'large number', 'direct payments', 'fertilizer producer', 'Norilsk Nikel', 'Magnitogorsk Iron', 'reliable way', 'paying agents', 'clearing houses', 'many processes', 'portfolio manager', 'Dmitry Dorofeev', 'business section', 'servicing bonds', 'replacement bonds', 'Russian bonds', 'Western sanctions', 'EU sanctions', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'outstanding debt', 'ruble debt', 'biggest companies', 'local investors', 'Russian companies', 'firms', 'eurobonds', 'denomination', 'outlet', 'Bloomberg', 'Monday', 'Restrictions', 'borrower', 'alternatives', 'swaps', 'buybacks', 'bondholders', 'Uralkali', 'miner', 'rubles', 'country', 'world', 'holdings', 'end', 'March', 'coupons', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'transactions', 'ways', 'couple', 'months', 'everything', 'Moscow', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-01-25,2023-01-26,rt.com

OfferIf the Company (acting through the Directors)  at any time prior to the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares tendered in the Tender Offer (and including where it has previously deferred the

purchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Tender Offer without materially harming DCAC Ordinary Shareholders as a whole; or(b) the completion of the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares under

taken as a whole if the Tender Offer were to proceed; or(c) the Company will not  immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Tender Offer  continue to

DCAC Ordinary Shareholder to the jurisdiction of the courts of Guernsey in relation to all matters arising out of or in connection with the Tender Offer.8.2 To the extent not prohibited by or ineffective under applicable law  each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder by whom or on whose behalf a tender through an Admitted Institution is given irrevocably agrees to assume liability for  pay and indemnify the Company from and against any and all liabilities  obligations  damages  losses  settlements  judgments  claims  actions  suits  penalties  costs  expenses and other sanctions (civil or criminal) suffered or incurred by either of them as a result of the breach by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder of any of the undertakings  representations  warranties  or agreements contained in

In the event of more than one person giving a tender through an Admitted Institution  the above provisions will apply to them jointly and severally.9 Tenders through Euroclear Nederland9.1 Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder by whom  or on whose behalf  a tender through an Admitted Institution is made irrevocably undertakes  represents  warrants and agrees to and with the Company (so as to bind it  its personal representatives  custodian  sub-custodian  heirs  successors and assigns) on the date that such DCAC Ordinary Shares are tendered up to and including the Final Settlement Date that:(a) the tender of any DCAC Ordinary Shares constitutes an acceptance by the holder of the DCAC Ordinary Shares of the terms  conditions and restrictions of the Tender Offer;(b) such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder is not over-tendering his/her position by tendering more than 95% of the DCAC Ordinary Shares held by it and will deliver the DCAC Ordinary Shares on the Closing Date;(c) such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder has full power and authority to tender  sell and deliver  and has not entered into any other agreement to tender  sell or deliver the DCAC Ordinary Shares stated to have been tendered to any party other than the Company (together with all rights attaching thereto) and  when such DCAC Ordinary Shares are purchased by the Company for cash  theCompany acquires such DCAC Ordinary Shares  with full title guarantee and free from all liens  charges  encumbrances  rights of pre-emption or other third party rights of any nature and together with all the rights attaching thereto;(d) such DCAC Ordinary Shares are being tendered in compliance with the restrictions set out in this Tender Document and the securities and other applicable laws or regulations of the jurisdiction in which the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder is located or of which it is a resident and no registration  approval or filing with any regulatory authority of such jurisdiction is required in connection with the tendering of such DCAC Ordinary Shares; and(e) if requested by the Company or Van Lanschot Kempen  provide the legal name of the beneficial DCAC Ordinary Shareholder wishing to tender.10 Restricted jurisdictions10.1 The making of the Tender Offer in  or to persons who are citizens or nationals of  or resident in  jurisdictions outside Guernsey or the Netherlands or custodians  nominees or trustees for citizens  nationals or residents of jurisdictions outside Guernsey or the Netherlands may be prohibited or affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who are not resident in Guernsey or the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal requirements. It is the responsibility of any DCAC Ordinary Shareholder wishing to make a tender to satisfy himself  herself or itself as to the full observance of the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in connection with the Tender Offer  including the obtaining of any governmental  exchange control or other consents which may berequired  the compliance with other necessary formalities and the payment of any transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due insuch jurisdiction. Any such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder will be responsible for payment of any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due by whomsoever payable and the Company and any person acting on its behalf shall be fully indemnified and heldharmless by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder for any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments such person may be required to pay. No steps have been taken to authorise the extending of the Tender Offer in any territory outside Guernsey or the Netherlands.10.2 The provisions of this paragraph and any other terms of the Tender Offer relating to shareholders outside Guernsey and the Netherlands may be waived  varied or modified as regards specific DCAC Ordinary Shareholders or on a general basis by the Company.10.3 The provisions of this paragraph 10 supersede any terms of the Tender Offer which may be inconsistent with it.10.4 All DCAC Ordinary Shareholders wishing to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares in the Tender Offer should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal or regulatory requirements. If you are in any doubt about your position  you should consult your professional adviser in the relevant territory.PART IV ‚Äì RISK FACTORSPrior to deciding whether or not to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should carefully consider this Tender Document in its entirety  as well as the section ""Risk Factors"" in the DCAC IPO Prospectus and the risk factors discussed in the section ""Risk Factors"" in the Shareholders Circular dated 20 December 2022 (the ""Circular"").The risks described below have emerged or changed in light of the Tender Offer. The occurrence of any of the risks below could have a material adverse effect on the Tender Offer and on the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares.All of these risk factors and events are contingencies that may or may not occur. A number of these risks described below may occur simultaneously. The order in which these risks are presented is not necessarily an indication of the likelihood of the risks actually materialising  of the potential significance of the risks or of the scope of any potential negative impact to the Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should carefully consider all of the risk factors set out in this Part IV.Although the Company believes that the risks described below are the material risks concerning the Tender Offer  they are not the only risks relating to the Tender Offer. Other risks  events  facts or circumstances not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial could  individually or cumulatively  prove to be important and may have a significant negative impact on the Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders can only tender up to 95% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will consequently retain 5% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares.Under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders can only tender up to 95% of their shareholding in the Company. As a result  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will in any case retain 5% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares and remain DCAC Ordinary Shareholder in the Company for the remainder of their shareholding. Other than through the Stub Tender Offer  which is  at the date of this Tender Document still subject to approval by an extraordinary general meeting of the Company and which is only available for DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tendered their full entitlement of DCAC Ordinary Shares under this Tender Offer  there is no certainty that DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will be able to sell or otherwise dispose of their Remaining Holding  should they so wish.As the Sponsor may not tender its DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer and/or other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may decide not to tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may experience immediate and substantial dilution of their shareholding in the Company.The Sponsor may (or may not) tender its DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer. In addition  other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may decide not to tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares. As a result  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may experience an immediate and substantial dilution of their shareholding in the Company  causing the Sponsor and/or such other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders to obtain increased voting power  thereby increasing their respective influence over all matters requiring DCAC Ordinary Shareholder approval and decreasing your influence over matters presented to the DCAC Ordinary Shareholders for approval  including  subject to the Amended Articles  approval of a future business combination.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tender their DCAC Ordinary Shares may suffer from reduced value or proceeds in future.Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares will experience an immediate and substantial dilution of their shareholding in the Company  so that the Sponsor and other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will obtain an increased proportion of the economic value of the Company. Whilst there is no guarantee of future success  such tendering DCAC Ordinary Shareholder may accordingly suffer reduced overall value compared to those DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender their DCAC Ordinary Shares.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders cannot withdraw their tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares without the written consent of the Company or once their tender has become unconditional.Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares will be deemed to have agreed that  in consideration of the Company to process his tender  such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder will not revoke its tender or its DCAC Ordinary Shares without the prior consent of the Company. Once tendered  a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder can therefore not withdraw its tender under the Tender Offer  unless the Company consents to such withdrawal.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares will be locked.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares will be locked. During this period  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will not be able to (re)sell  pledge  encumber or otherwise transfer such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares or any rights related thereto.The Tender Offer is subject to certain conditions and the Board may decide to postpone or terminate the Tender Offer at any time prior to the purchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer as a result of which DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share at a later point in time or not at all.The Tender Offer is subject to the conditions that (a) there has been no Material Adverse Change nor Force Majeure Event  (b) the Board being satisfied that the Company has in its control or to its order the aggregate of the Offer Price for all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares  the aggregate of the Offer Price previously credited to the Escrow Account  (c) the Board continuing to be satisfied that that the Company will  immediately following the purchase of all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares (as if all DCAC Ordinary Shareholders were to tender for acquisition their full entitlement)  satisfy the statutory solvency test prescribed by the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 as amended and (d) the Tender Offer is not terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Tender Offer Document. The Company may at its sole discretion terminate or postpone the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Tender Offer Document  if the Company (acting through the Directors) considers in its reasonable opinion that (a) it has become unlawful  impractical or inappropriate for the Company to fund the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares without materially harming DCAC Ordinary Shareholders as a whole or (b) the completion of the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer would have material adverse fiscal or other consequences (whether by reason of a change in legislation or practice or otherwise) for the Company or its DCAC Ordinary Shareholders taken as a whole if the Tender Offer were to proceed or (c) if the Company will not immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Tender Offer  continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test under the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008  as amended. If these conditions are not met or if the Board decides to delay or terminate the Tender Offer prior to the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share at a later point in time or not at all.The net consideration received by a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder may be less than ¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary ShareThe cash consideration of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share does not include costs relating to a Shareholder‚Äôs broker  bank or other financial intermediary or advisor. Nor is the Company responsible for any taxes  duties or similar imposts suffered by the Shareholder. The net payment per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share received by DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may therefore be lower than the ¬£10.789 repurchase price.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date and such deadline may differ for each individual broker  bank or other financial intermediary. The Company does not have any knowledge on such deadlines and therefore the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder should consult its broker  bank or other financial intermediary in this regard.Any tenders not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Tender Document and in a timely manner may be invalid.Submitting a tender that is not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Tender Document  may result in an invalid tender and ultimately not being able to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer (thereby also not receiving the cash consideration of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share). DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that none of Van Lanschot Kempen  Admina  the Company or any other person is or will be obliged to give notice of any defects  irregularities  omissions  delays or non-receipts in tenders of DCAC Ordinary Shareholders  and that none of them will incur any liability for failure to give any such notice.The Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase up to 95% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares  and following the Tender Offer you will no longer have a repurchase right  other than potentially through the Stub Tender Offer.The Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase up to 95% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that the articles of association of the Company no longer provide for a repurchase right and that there is no assurance that the Company will provide for such a repurchase right in the future  other than potentially through the Stub Tender Offer. There is therefore no assurance that DCAC Ordinary Shareholders can have their DCAC Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Company other than through this one-time Tender Offer and the Stub Tender Offer.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender their full entitlement of DCAC Ordinary Shares will not be eligible to use the balance of DCAC Ordinary Shares not so tendered to participate in the Stub Tender OfferThe Company intends  through the Stub Tender Offer  to offer DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders the opportunity to tender for repurchase up to 5% of DCAC Ordinary Shares (that are not the subject of and are not tenders for purchase under this Tender Offer) held as at the Record Date (at all times subject to the Stub Tender Offer being limited to 325 000 DCAC Ordinary Shares in aggregate) and all of their DCAC Public Warrants  provided that should DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Warrant Holders decide to tender  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders shall be required to tender their entire holdings of DCAC Public Warrants together with their DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Stub Tender Offer as at the Record Date. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that their decision to offer DCAC Ordinary Shares under this Tender Offer therefore also affects their eligibility to offer DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Stub Tender Offer and that tendering less than their full entitlement of DCAC Ordinary Shares  or nothing at all  will result in their being ineligible to tender such DCAC Ordinary Shares in the Stub Tender Offer.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may face a significant decrease in net asset value of their shareholdingFollowing the provision and distribution of cash to meet the Tender Offer  a substantial part of DCAC‚Äôs then remaining cash will be applied to settle outstanding liabilities  resulting in limited remaining assets and a decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share. This may in particular affect DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares  as they will not receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary Share for DCAC Ordinary Shares that they do not (successfully) tender. If the Company is wound up or liquidated in the future  the decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share may result in DCAC Ordinary Shareholders receiving substantially less than ¬£10.25 per DCAC Ordinary Share or nothing at all.There is no guarantee that DCAC will be able to satisfy the statutory solvency test following the acquisition of DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Tender OfferPursuant to section 320 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008  as amended  the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Tender Offer would be considered to be a distribution for the purposes of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 and therefore the Board must comply with section 303 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 in respect of making distributions  including ensuring satisfaction of the statutory ""solvency test"" as defined in section 527 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 being (in respect of companies that are not ""supervised companies""  like DCAC) that DCAC is able to pay its debts as they become due and that the value of DCAC's assets is greater than the value of its liabilities.

Stub Tender OfferIf the Company (acting through the DCAC Directors)  at any time prior to the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants tendered in the Stub Tender Offer (and including where it has previously deferred the Closing Date in accordance with paragraph 2.2 of this section 5) considers that  in its reasonable opinion  either:it has become unlawful  impractical or inappropriate for the Company to fund the purchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants pursuant to the Stub Tender Offer without materially harming DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders as a whole; or the completion of the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer would have material adverse fiscal or other consequences (whether by reason of a change in legislation or practice or otherwise) for the Company or its DCAC Ordinary Shareholders or its DCAC Public Warrant Holders taken as a whole if the Tender Offer were to proceed; or the Company will not  immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants validly tendered in the Stub Tender Offer  continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test under the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008  as amended the Company shall be entitled at its discretion to delay or terminate the Stub Tender Offer by a public announcement to DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders.Settlement9.1 Subject to paragraphs 2.2 and 8 of this section 5  the Company will use all reasonable endeavours  and intends to promptly settle the applicable Offer Price payable to a tendering DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder pursuant to valid tenders accepted by the Company by 20 March 2023 (the ""Final Settlement Date"").9.2 If due solely to a Material Adverse Change or Force Majeure Event  the Company is unable to fund the payment of the applicable Offer Price for all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants which would be settled by the Final Settlement Date  the Company may terminate the Stub Tender Offer in accordance with paragraph 8 of this section 5 at any time prior to effecting the purchase of the relevant DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants pursuant to the Stub Tender Offer.9.3 The payment of any consideration for DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants pursuant to the Stub Tender Offer will be made to the Admitted Institution who has delivered the tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCC Public Warrants pursuant to the Stub Tender Offer following a valid instruction to them (in an acceptable form)  via any (sub) custodian  for and on behalf of a tendering DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder.10 Effect

Public Warrant Holders to the jurisdiction of the courts of Guernsey in relation to all matters arising out of or in connection with the Stub Tender Offer.10.2 To the extent not prohibited by or ineffective under applicable law  each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder by whom or on whose behalf a tender through an Admitted Institution is given irrevocably agrees to assume liability for  pay and indemnify the Company from and against any and all liabilities  obligations  damages  losses  settlements  judgments  claims  actions  suits  penalties  costs  expenses and other sanctions (civil or criminal) suffered or incurred by either of them as a result of the breach by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders of any of the undertakings  representations  warranties  or agreements contained in paragraph 8.1 of this Part III.10.3 A reference above to a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders includes a reference to the person or persons giving tender through an Admitted Institution. In the event of more than one person giving a tender through an Admitted Institution  the above provisions will apply to them jointly and severally.11 Tenders through Euroclear Nederland11.1 Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder by whom  or on whose behalf  a tender through an Admitted Institution is made irrevocably undertakes  represents  warrants and agrees to and with the Company (so as to bind it  its personal representatives  custodian  sub-custodian  heirs  successors and assigns) on the date that such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are tendered up to and including the Final Settlement Date that:(a) the tender of any DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants constitutes an acceptance by the holder of the DCAC Ordinary Shares of the terms  conditions and restrictions of the Stub Tender Offer;(b) such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder is not over-tendering his/her position by tendering 5% of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and all of the DCAC Public Warrants held by it and will deliver the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants on the Closing Date;(c) such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder has full power and authority to tender  sell and deliver  and has not entered into any other agreement to tender  sell or deliver the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants stated to have been tendered to any party other than the Company (together with all rights attaching thereto) and  when such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are purchased by the Company for cash  the Company acquires such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  with full title guarantee and free from all liens  charges  encumbrances  rights of pre-emption or other third party rights of any nature and together with all the rights attaching thereto;(d) such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are being tendered in compliance with the restrictions set out in this Circular and the securities and other applicable laws or regulations of the jurisdiction in which the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders is located or of which it is a resident and no registration  approval or filing with any regulatory authority of such jurisdiction is required in connection with the tendering of such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants; and(e) if requested by the Company or Van Lanschot Kempen  provide the legal name of the beneficial DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders wishing to tender.12 Restricted jurisdictions12.1 The making of the Stub Tender Offer in  or to persons who are citizens or nationals of  or resident in  jurisdictions outside Guernsey or the Netherlands or custodians  nominees or trustees for citizens  nationals or residents of jurisdictions outside Guernsey or the Netherlands may be prohibited or affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders who are not resident in Guernsey or the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal requirements. It is the responsibility of any DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder wishing to make a tender to satisfy himself  herself or itself as to the full observance of the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in connection with the Stub Tender Offer  including the obtaining of any governmental  exchange control or other consents which may be required  the compliance with other necessary formalities and the payment of any transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due in such jurisdiction. Any such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder will be responsible for payment of any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due by whomsoever payable and the Company and any person acting on its behalf shall be fully indemnified and held harmless by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder for any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments such person may be required to pay.

If you are in any doubt about your position  you should consult your professional adviser in the relevant territory.RISK FACTORSPrior to deciding whether or not to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should carefully consider this Circular in its entirety  as well as the section ""Risk Factors"" in the DCAC IPO Prospectus and the risk factors discussed in the section ""Risk Factors"" in the Shareholders Circular dated 20 December 2022 (the ""December Circular"").The risks described below have emerged or changed in light of the Stub Tender Offer. The occurrence of any of the risks below could have a material adverse effect on the Stub Tender Offer and on the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants.All of these risk factors and events are contingencies that may or may not occur. A number of these risks described below may occur simultaneously. The order in which these risks are presented is not necessarily an indication of the likelihood of the risks actually materialising  of the potential significance of the risks or of the scope of any potential negative impact to the Stub Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should carefully consider all of the risk factors set out in this section 6.Although the Company believes that the risks described below are the material risks concerning the Stub Tender Offer  they are not the only risks relating to the Stub Tender Offer. Other risks  events  facts or circumstances not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial could  individually or cumulatively  prove to be important and may have a significant negative impact on the Stub Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders cannot withdraw their tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants without the written consent of the Company or once their tender has become unconditional.Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be deemed to have agreed that  in consideration of the Company to process his tender  such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder will not revoke its tender or its DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants without the prior written consent of the Company. Once tendered  a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder can therefore not withdraw its tender under the Stub Tender Offer  unless the Company consents to such withdrawal. Once the tender has become unconditional  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders cannot withdraw their DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants tendered under the Stub Tender Offer.As the DCAC Sponsor and/or other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may decide to not participate in the Stub Tender Offer  they may obtain a controlling interest in the Company.The DCAC Sponsor and/or such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder may decide not to participate in the Stub Tender Offer. This may cause the DCAC Sponsor and/or such other DCAC Ordinary Shareholder to obtain increased voting power  which may results in a controlling interest and a decisive influence over all matters requiring DCAC Ordinary Shareholder approval  including  subject to the Amended Articles  approval of a future business combination.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be locked.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be locked. During this period  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders will not be able to (re)sell  pledge  encumber or otherwise transfer such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares  DCAC Public Warrants or any rights related thereto.The Stub Tender Offer is subject to certain conditions and the DCAC Board may decide to postpone or terminate the Stub Tender Offer at any time prior to the purchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer as a result of which DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders may receive the repurchase price tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and DCAC Public Warrants  as applicable  at a later point in time or not at all.The Stub Tender Offer is subject to the conditions that (a) the Stub Tender Resolutions being passed at the EGM  (b) there has been no Material Adverse Change nor Force Majeure Event  (c) the DCAC Board being satisfied that the Company has in its control or to its order the aggregate of the Offer Price for all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  the aggregate of the Offer Price previously credited to the Escrow Account  (d) the DCAC Board continuing to be satisfied that that the Company will  immediately following the purchase of all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants (as if all DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders were to tender for acquisition their full entitlement)  satisfy the statutory solvency test prescribed by the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 as amended and (e) the Stub Tender Offer is not terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Tender Offer Document. The Company may at its sole discretion terminate or postpone the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in this Circular  if the Company (acting through the DCAC Directors) considers in its reasonable opinion that (a) it has become unlawful  impractical or inappropriate for the Company to fund the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants without materially harming DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders as a whole or (b) the completion of the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer would have material adverse fiscal or other consequences (whether by reason of a change in legislation or practice or otherwise) for the Company or its DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders taken as a whole if the Stub Tender Offer were to proceed or (c) if the Company will not immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants validly tendered in the Tender Offer  continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test under the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008  as amended. If these conditions are not met or if the Board decides to delay or terminate the Tender Offer prior to the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and the DCAC Public Warrant Holders may receive the repurchase price of up to ¬£2.20 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per tendered DCAC Public Warrant at a later point in time or not at all.The net consideration received by a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder may be less than ¬£2.20 per DCAC Ordinary Share and less than ¬£0.066 per DCAC Public Warrant.The cash consideration of up to ¬£2.20 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per tendered DCAC Public Warrant does not include costs relating to a Shareholder‚Äôs or Warrant Holder's broker  bank or other financial intermediary or advisor. Nor is the Company responsible for any taxes  duties or similar imposts suffered by the Shareholder or Warrant Holder. The net payment per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share received by DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant received by DCAC Public Warrant Holders may therefore be lower than the maximum ¬£2.20 and ¬£0.066  as applicable  repurchase price.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date and such deadline may differ for each individual broker  bank or other financial intermediary. The Company does not have any knowledge on such deadlines and therefore the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should consult its broker  bank or other financial intermediary in this regard.Any tenders not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Circular may be invalid.Submitting a tender that is not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Circular  may result in an invalid tender and ultimately not being able to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer (thereby also not receiving the cash consideration of up to ¬£2.20 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per tendered DCAC Public Warrant). DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should note that none of Van Lanschot Kempen  Admina  the Company or any other person is or will be obliged to give notice of any defects  irregularities  omissions  delays or non-receipts in tenders of DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders  and that none of them will incur any liability for failure to give any such notice.The Stub Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase 5% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares and all of your DCAC Public Warrants  and following the Stub Tender Offer you will no longer have a repurchase right.The Stub Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase up to 5% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares and all of your DCAC Public Warrants. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should note that the articles of incorporation of the Company no longer provide for a repurchase right and that there is no assurance that the Company will provide for such a repurchase right in the future. There is therefore no assurance that DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders can have their DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants repurchased by the Company other than through this one-time Stub Tender Offer.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may face a significant decrease in net asset value of their shareholdingFollowing the provision and distribution of cash to meet the Repurchase Offer  a substantial part of DCAC‚Äôs then remaining cash will be applied to settle outstanding liabilities  resulting in limited remaining assets and a decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share. This may in particular affect DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares  as they will not receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary Share for DCAC Ordinary Shares that they do not (successfully) tender. If the Company is wound up or liquidated in the future  the decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share may result in DCAC Ordinary Shareholders receiving substantially less than ¬£10.25 per DCAC Ordinary Share or nothing at all.There is no guarantee that DCAC will be able to satisfy the statutory solvency test following the acquisition of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants validly tendered in the Stub Tender OfferPursuant to section 320 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008  as amended  the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Stub Tender Offer would be considered to be a distribution for the purposes of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 and therefore the DCAC Board must comply with section 303 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 in respect of making distributions  including ensuring satisfaction of the statutory ""solvency test"" as defined in section 527 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 being (in respect of companies that are not ""supervised companies""  like DCAC) that DCAC is able to pay its debts as they become due and that the value of DCAC's assets is greater than the value of its liabilities. There is no guarantee that DCAC will  immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Stub Tender Offer  meet and/or continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test.The repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants by the Company may result in taxes being imposed on the Company or on DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders.The repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants by the Company may result in taxes being imposed on the Company or on DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders as at the date of such repurchase or redemption. The Company does not intend to make any cash distributions to DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders to pay any such taxes. The materialisation of this risk may adversely affect the post-tax return for certain DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders.OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATIONInformation Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this Circular other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements.

OfferIf the Company (acting through the Directors)  at any time prior to the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares tendered in the Tender Offer (and including where it has previously deferred the

taken as a whole if the Tender Offer were to proceed; or(c) the Company will not  immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Tender Offer  continue to

DCAC Ordinary Shareholder to the jurisdiction of the courts of Guernsey in relation to all matters arising out of or in connection with the Tender Offer.8.2 To the extent not prohibited by or ineffective under applicable law  each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder by whom or on whose behalf a tender through an Admitted Institution is given irrevocably agrees to assume liability for  pay and indemnify the Company from and against any and all liabilities  obligations  damages  losses  settlements  judgments  claims  actions  suits  penalties  costs  expenses and other sanctions (civil or criminal) suffered or incurred by either of them as a result of the breach by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder of any of the undertakings  representations  warranties  or agreements contained in

DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who are not resident in Guernsey or the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal requirements. It is the responsibility of any DCAC Ordinary Shareholder wishing to make a tender to satisfy himself  herself or itself as to the full observance of the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in connection with the Tender Offer  including the obtaining of any governmental  exchange control or other consents which may berequired  the compliance with other necessary formalities and the payment of any transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due insuch jurisdiction. Any such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder will be responsible for payment of any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due by whomsoever payable and the Company and any person acting on its behalf shall be fully indemnified and heldharmless by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder for any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments such person may be required to pay. No steps have been taken to authorise the extending of the Tender Offer in any territory outside Guernsey or the Netherlands.10.2 The provisions of this paragraph and any other terms of the Tender Offer relating to shareholders outside Guernsey and the Netherlands may be waived  varied or modified as regards specific DCAC Ordinary Shareholders or on a general basis by the Company.10.3 The provisions of this paragraph 10 supersede any terms of the Tender Offer which may be inconsistent with it.10.4 All DCAC Ordinary Shareholders wishing to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares in the Tender Offer should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal or regulatory requirements. If you are in any doubt about your position  you should consult your professional adviser in the relevant territory.PART IV ‚Äì RISK FACTORSPrior to deciding whether or not to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should carefully consider this Tender Document in its entirety  as well as the section ""Risk Factors"" in the DCAC IPO Prospectus and the risk factors discussed in the section ""Risk Factors"" in the Shareholders Circular dated 20 December 2022 (the ""Circular"").The risks described below have emerged or changed in light of the Tender Offer. The occurrence of any of the risks below could have a material adverse effect on the Tender Offer and on the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares.All of these risk factors and events are contingencies that may or may not occur. A number of these risks described below may occur simultaneously. The order in which these risks are presented is not necessarily an indication of the likelihood of the risks actually materialising  of the potential significance of the risks or of the scope of any potential negative impact to the Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should carefully consider all of the risk factors set out in this Part IV.Although the Company believes that the risks described below are the material risks concerning the Tender Offer  they are not the only risks relating to the Tender Offer. Other risks  events  facts or circumstances not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial could  individually or cumulatively  prove to be important and may have a significant negative impact on the Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders can only tender up to 95% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will consequently retain 5% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares.Under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders can only tender up to 95% of their shareholding in the Company. As a result  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will in any case retain 5% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares and remain DCAC Ordinary Shareholder in the Company for the remainder of their shareholding. Other than through the Stub Tender Offer  which is  at the date of this Tender Document still subject to approval by an extraordinary general meeting of the Company and which is only available for DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tendered their full entitlement of DCAC Ordinary Shares under this Tender Offer  there is no certainty that DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will be able to sell or otherwise dispose of their Remaining Holding  should they so wish.As the Sponsor may not tender its DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer and/or other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may decide not to tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may experience immediate and substantial dilution of their shareholding in the Company.The Sponsor may (or may not) tender its DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer. In addition  other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may decide not to tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares. As a result  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may experience an immediate and substantial dilution of their shareholding in the Company  causing the Sponsor and/or such other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders to obtain increased voting power  thereby increasing their respective influence over all matters requiring DCAC Ordinary Shareholder approval and decreasing your influence over matters presented to the DCAC Ordinary Shareholders for approval  including  subject to the Amended Articles  approval of a future business combination.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tender their DCAC Ordinary Shares may suffer from reduced value or proceeds in future.Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares will experience an immediate and substantial dilution of their shareholding in the Company  so that the Sponsor and other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will obtain an increased proportion of the economic value of the Company. Whilst there is no guarantee of future success  such tendering DCAC Ordinary Shareholder may accordingly suffer reduced overall value compared to those DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender their DCAC Ordinary Shares.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders cannot withdraw their tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares without the written consent of the Company or once their tender has become unconditional.Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares will be deemed to have agreed that  in consideration of the Company to process his tender  such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder will not revoke its tender or its DCAC Ordinary Shares without the prior consent of the Company. Once tendered  a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder can therefore not withdraw its tender under the Tender Offer  unless the Company consents to such withdrawal.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares will be locked.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares will be locked. During this period  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will not be able to (re)sell  pledge  encumber or otherwise transfer such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares or any rights related thereto.The Tender Offer is subject to certain conditions and the Board may decide to postpone or terminate the Tender Offer at any time prior to the purchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer as a result of which DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share at a later point in time or not at all.The Tender Offer is subject to the conditions that (a) there has been no Material Adverse Change nor Force Majeure Event  (b) the Board being satisfied that the Company has in its control or to its order the aggregate of the Offer Price for all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares  the aggregate of the Offer Price previously credited to the Escrow Account  (c) the Board continuing to be satisfied that that the Company will  immediately following the purchase of all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares (as if all DCAC Ordinary Shareholders were to tender for acquisition their full entitlement)  satisfy the statutory solvency test prescribed by the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 as amended and (d) the Tender Offer is not terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Tender Offer Document. The Company may at its sole discretion terminate or postpone the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Tender Offer Document  if the Company (acting through the Directors) considers in its reasonable opinion that (a) it has become unlawful  impractical or inappropriate for the Company to fund the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares without materially harming DCAC Ordinary Shareholders as a whole or (b) the completion of the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer would have material adverse fiscal or other consequences (whether by reason of a change in legislation or practice or otherwise) for the Company or its DCAC Ordinary Shareholders taken as a whole if the Tender Offer were to proceed or (c) if the Company will not immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Tender Offer  continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test under the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008  as amended. If these conditions are not met or if the Board decides to delay or terminate the Tender Offer prior to the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share at a later point in time or not at all.The net consideration received by a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder may be less than ¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary ShareThe cash consideration of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share does not include costs relating to a Shareholder‚Äôs broker  bank or other financial intermediary or advisor. Nor is the Company responsible for any taxes  duties or similar imposts suffered by the Shareholder. The net payment per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share received by DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may therefore be lower than the ¬£10.789 repurchase price.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date and such deadline may differ for each individual broker  bank or other financial intermediary. The Company does not have any knowledge on such deadlines and therefore the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder should consult its broker  bank or other financial intermediary in this regard.Any tenders not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Tender Document and in a timely manner may be invalid.Submitting a tender that is not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Tender Document  may result in an invalid tender and ultimately not being able to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer (thereby also not receiving the cash consideration of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share). DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that none of Van Lanschot Kempen  Admina  the Company or any other person is or will be obliged to give notice of any defects  irregularities  omissions  delays or non-receipts in tenders of DCAC Ordinary Shareholders  and that none of them will incur any liability for failure to give any such notice.The Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase up to 95% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares  and following the Tender Offer you will no longer have a repurchase right  other than potentially through the Stub Tender Offer.The Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase up to 95% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that the articles of association of the Company no longer provide for a repurchase right and that there is no assurance that the Company will provide for such a repurchase right in the future  other than potentially through the Stub Tender Offer. There is therefore no assurance that DCAC Ordinary Shareholders can have their DCAC Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Company other than through this one-time Tender Offer and the Stub Tender Offer.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender their full entitlement of DCAC Ordinary Shares will not be eligible to use the balance of DCAC Ordinary Shares not so tendered to participate in the Stub Tender OfferThe Company intends  through the Stub Tender Offer  to offer DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders the opportunity to tender for repurchase up to 5% of DCAC Ordinary Shares (that are not the subject of and are not tenders for purchase under this Tender Offer) held as at the Record Date (at all times subject to the Stub Tender Offer being limited to 325 000 DCAC Ordinary Shares in aggregate) and all of their DCAC Public Warrants  provided that should DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Warrant Holders decide to tender  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders shall be required to tender their entire holdings of DCAC Public Warrants together with their DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Stub Tender Offer as at the Record Date. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that their decision to offer DCAC Ordinary Shares under this Tender Offer therefore also affects their eligibility to offer DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Stub Tender Offer and that tendering less than their full entitlement of DCAC Ordinary Shares  or nothing at all  will result in their being ineligible to tender such DCAC Ordinary Shares in the Stub Tender Offer.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may face a significant decrease in net asset value of their shareholdingFollowing the provision and distribution of cash to meet the Tender Offer  a substantial part of DCAC‚Äôs then remaining cash will be applied to settle outstanding liabilities  resulting in limited remaining assets and a decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share. This may in particular affect DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares  as they will not receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary Share for DCAC Ordinary Shares that they do not (successfully) tender. If the Company is wound up or liquidated in the future  the decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share may result in DCAC Ordinary Shareholders receiving substantially less than ¬£10.25 per DCAC Ordinary Share or nothing at all.There is no guarantee that DCAC will be able to satisfy the statutory solvency test following the acquisition of DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Tender OfferPursuant to section 320 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008  as amended  the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Tender Offer would be considered to be a distribution for the purposes of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 and therefore the Board must comply with section 303 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 in respect of making distributions  including ensuring satisfaction of the statutory ""solvency test"" as defined in section 527 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 being (in respect of companies that are not ""supervised companies""  like DCAC) that DCAC is able to pay its debts as they become due and that the value of DCAC's assets is greater than the value of its liabilities.

17093,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inside-information-north-holdings-3-025300951.html,Inside information: North Holdings 3 Oy improves consideration  extends offer period and lowers the acceptance threshold of its tender offer; Caverion board renews its recommendation,"North Holdings 3 Oy (the ""Offeror"")  a private limited liability company incorporated and existing under the laws of Finland  that will be indirectly owned...","NOT FOR RELEASE  PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION  IN WHOLE OR IN PART  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  IN OR INTO AUSTRALIA  CANADA  HONG KONG  JAPAN  NEW ZEALAND OR SOUTH AFRICA OR IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE TENDER OFFER WOULD BE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.HELSINKI  Jan. 25  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- North Holdings 3 Oy (the ""Offeror"")  a private limited liability company incorporated and existing under the laws of Finland  that will be indirectly owned by a consortium led by North (BC) Lux Holdco SARL (""Bain Luxco"") (a vehicle owned and controlled by funds managed or advised by Bain Capital Private Equity (Europe)  LLP  and/or its affiliates (together ""Bain Capital"" and such funds being the ""Bain Capital Funds"")) and further including Security Trading Oy (""Security Trading"")  Fennogens Investments S.A. (""Fennogens"") and Corbis S.A. (""Corbis"") (together the ""Consortium"")  announced on November 3  2022  a voluntary recommended public cash tender offer for all the issued and outstanding shares in Caverion Corporation (""Caverion"" or the ""Company"") that are not held by Caverion or its subsidiaries (the ""Shares"" or  individually  a ""Share"") (the ""Tender Offer""). The Offeror and Caverion have today entered into an amendment to the combination agreement initially entered into by the Offeror and Caverion on November 3  2022 (the ""Combination Agreement"")  according to which the Offeror has  among other things  agreed to improve the consideration offered for each Share in the Tender Offer (the ""Improved Tender Offer"").KEY HIGHLIGHTS AND SUMMARY OF THE IMPROVED TENDER OFFERThe shareholders of Caverion are given the possibility to choose either: (i) a debt instrument entitling to a fixed cash payment of EUR 8.50 in nine months from the completion of the Improved Tender Offer (the "" Alternative Consideration "")  or (ii) an immediate cash consideration of EUR 8.00 (the "" Improved Cash Price "") upon completion of the Improved Tender Offer for each Share tendered in the Improved Tender Offer.The Alternative Consideration will be implemented by the Offeror by issuing debt instruments with the nominal principal amount of EUR 8.50  which will be redeemed at their full nominal amount upon their maturity nine months from their issuance ("" Alternative Consideration Instruments ""). Shareholders choosing the Alternative Consideration will be issued one Alternative Consideration Instrument for each Share tendered in the Tender Offer in connection with the completion trades of the Tender Offer. The equity commitments given to the Offeror by Bain Capital Funds and the other members of the Consortium to finance the Tender Offer have been amended to include financing also of the Alternative Consideration Instruments  so that their cash redemption by the Offeror will be backed by the funding commitments from the Consortium in the same way as funding for the Improved Cash Price.The Offeror has agreed to lower the minimum acceptance threshold of the Improved Tender Offer from more than 90 percent to more than 66 2/3 percent of all Shares.The Offeror will supplement the Tender Offer Document with detailed information on the terms and conditions of the Improved Tender Offer  including the Alternative Consideration Instruments  as soon as practically possible  and expects the supplement to be approved and published in early February. Shareholders of Caverion will be able to choose the Alternative Consideration when tendering into the Tender Offer only after the supplement to the Tender Offer Document has been published.The Offeror extends the offer period until February 28  2023  in order to ensure that the shareholders of Caverion have the possibility to carefully review the supplement to the Tender Offer Document and to evaluate the terms and conditions of the Improved Tender Offer. Given the advanced stage of the Offeror's regulatory clearance process  the Offeror is highly confident that the Improved Tender Offer can be completed in this timeline. On this basis  the Offeror currently estimates that the completion trades in the Tender Offer  and the payment of the Improved Cash Price for the shareholders who elect this option  would take place in the second half of March  2023 and that the cash redemption of the Alternative Consideration Instruments would take place in the second half of December  2023.The Offeror believes that the recommended Improved Tender Offer holds significant advantages  particularly in terms of transaction certainty and timeline  compared to the competing offer published by Crayfish BidCo Oy (the "" Crayfish Offer ""). Based on the experience of the Offeror's external legal advisers  the merger control review of Crayfish's Offer could take even up to 12 months or more from its announcement  and gives rise to significant execution risk. In contrast  the Offeror received unconditional merger control clearance from the European Commission on January 11  2023  and unconditional foreign investment clearances in Austria and Denmark on January 18 and January 20  2023  respectively  and expects to obtain the only outstanding regulatory approval soon.The Alternative Consideration represents a premium of 6.25 percent compared to the cash consideration of EUR 8.00 offered in the Crayfish Offer (without adjusting for the interest component included in the Crayfish Offer). The Alternative Consideration provides Caverion shareholders the possibility to receive a superior consideration to the Crayfish Offer with potentially an earlier payment date profile  given the complexities of the regulatory approvals for the Crayfish Offer  and without the long uncertainty relating to the fulfilment of offer conditions.Elo Mutual Pension Insurance Company  Ilmarinen Mutual Pension Insurance Company  Mandatum Life Insurance Company Limited and Varma Mutual Pension Insurance Company  as well as Antti Herlin  Hisra Consulting and Finance Oy and Autumn Spirit O√º  have renewed their irrevocable undertakings to accept the Improved Tender Offer  and Veritas Pension Insurance Company Ltd. has given an irrevocable undertaking to accept the Improved Tender Offer. These irrevocable undertakings together represent approximately 16.4 percent of all outstanding Shares and votes in Caverion.The Offeror has secured new acquisition financing  in addition to the existing debt commitments provided to the indirect parent of the Offeror  North Holdings 1 Oy  in the form of senior secured  covenant-lite debt commitments. A summary of the financing has been provided below under section ""Financing"".The members of the Board of Directors of Caverion who participated in the decision-making have unanimously decided to recommend that the shareholders of the Company accept the Improved Tender Offer.Halvor Meyer Horten  Managing Director  Head of Nordics  Bain Capital comments:""The Consortium is fully committed to supporting the long-term development of Caverion and improves its tender offer. As a way of offering the most attractive proposition to Caverion's shareholders  we will provide the possibility to choose between a competitive cash price immediately after our offer closes  or an even higher price at a later date through a debt instrument. In addition to the Improved Tender Offer and its terms  the only outstanding foreign direct investment clearance for our offer is expected soon  and our Improved Tender Offer has the support of the Caverion Board. We believe that our offer represents an attractive and superior option to Caverion shareholders in terms of price  deal certainty and timeline.""Klaus Caw√©n  on behalf of Security Trading  Fennogens Investments and Corbis  comments:""As committed and active long-term core shareholders of Caverion  we are dedicated to developing and growing Caverion as a stand-alone company and to ensuring its competitiveness in the long run. We believe that the Improved Tender Offer is clearly superior to the competing offer by Crayfish BidCo and believe that it provides an attractive and feasible option to Caverion shareholders. We also see that it is in the best interests of the business continuity of Caverion as well as of Caverion's employees to avoid uncertainty and potentially lengthy merger control processes the competing offer would be likely to cause.""THE IMPROVED TENDER OFFER IN BRIEFThe Offeror and Caverion have today entered into an amendment to the Combination Agreement  according to which the Offeror has  among other things  agreed to improve the consideration offered for each Share in the Tender Offer by offering the Alternative Consideration of EUR 8.50 or the Improved Cash Price of EUR 8.00 for each Share validly tendered in the Tender Offer  subject to any adjustments as set out in the section ""The Offer Price"" below.The Offer PriceThe shareholders of Caverion may choose either the Alternative Consideration in the form of an Alternative Consideration Instrument with the nominal principal amount of EUR 8.50 or the Improved Cash Price of EUR 8.00 for each Share validly tendered in the Tender Offer (the Improved Cash Price and the Alternative Consideration jointly  the ""Offer Price"")  subject to any adjustments as set out below. A shareholder may only choose to receive either the Alternative Consideration or the Improved Cash Price for all Shares held on the same book-entry account  and  consequently  shareholders may only tender for mixed consideration if Shares are held on separate book-entry accounts.The Improved Cash Price represents a premium of approximately 70.58 percent compared to the closing price (EUR 4.69) of the Share on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd (""Nasdaq Helsinki"") on November 2  2022  the last trading day immediately preceding the announcement of the Tender Offer  and a premium of approximately 69.85 percent compared to the volume-weighted average price (EUR 4.71) of the Share on Nasdaq Helsinki during the three-month period prior to and up to November 2  2022.The Alternative Consideration represents a premium of approximately 81.24 percent compared to the closing price (EUR 4.69) of the Share on Nasdaq Helsinki on November 2  2022  the last trading day immediately preceding the announcement of the Tender Offer  and a premium of approximately 80.47 percent compared to the volume-weighted average price (EUR 4.71) of the Share on Nasdaq Helsinki during the three-month period prior to and up to November 2  2022.The Alternative Consideration represents a premium of 6.25 percent compared to the cash consideration of EUR 8.00 offered in the Crayfish Offer (without adjusting for the interest component included in the Crayfish Offer).Each of Security Trading  Fennogens and Corbis as well as Antti Herlin  Hisra Consulting and Finance Oy and Autumn Spirit O√º have agreed to waive part of the EUR 1.00 increase to the offer price and to sell all their Shares to the Offeror for a cash consideration of EUR 7.50 per Share in  or in connection with the completion of  the Improved Tender Offer.The Improved Cash Price and the Alternative Consideration have been determined based on 136 472 645 issued and outstanding Shares. Should the Company increase the number of Shares that are issued and outstanding on the date hereof as a result of a new share issue  reclassification  stock split (including a reverse split) or any other similar transaction with dilutive effect  or should the Company distribute a dividend or otherwise distribute funds or any other assets to its shareholders  or if a record date with respect to any of the foregoing occurs prior to any of the settlements of the completion trades (whether after the expiry of the offer period or any subsequent offer period)  resulting in the distribution of funds not being payable to the Offeror  the Improved Cash Price and the Alternative Consideration payable by the Offeror shall be reduced accordingly on a euro-for-euro basis. However  after their issuance the Alternative Consideration Instruments are not subject to any adjustments and will be redeemed upon maturity at their full nominal amount.The Offer PeriodThe offer period for the Tender Offer (the ""Offer Period"") commenced on November 24  2022  and is currently ongoing. The Offeror extends the Offer Period until February 28  2023  in order to ensure that the shareholders of Caverion have the possibility to carefully review the supplement to the Tender Offer Document and to evaluate the terms and conditions of the Improved Tender Offer. Given the advanced stage of the Offeror's regulatory clearance process the Offeror is highly confident that the Tender Offer can be completed in this timeline. However  the Offeror reserves the right to extend the Offer Period in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.The Offeror will supplement the tender offer document  dated November 24  2022  and as supplemented on January 13  2023  concerning the Tender Offer (together  the ""Tender Offer Document"") with detailed information on the terms and conditions of the Improved Tender Offer  including the Alternative Consideration Instruments  as well as additional information on the Offeror  and will publish the supplement to the Tender Offer Document once it has been approved by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority. The Offeror is currently expecting that the supplement to the Tender Offer Document will be published in early February  2023.Until the supplement to the Tender Offer Document has been published  shareholders of Caverion tendering their Shares to the Tender Offer may only choose the cash consideration. Shareholders will be able to choose the Alternative Consideration when tendering into the Improved Tender Offer only after the supplement to the Tender Offer Document has been published. In connection with the publication of the supplement to the Tender Offer Document  the Offeror will also publish instructions to shareholders who wish to choose the Alternative Consideration instead of the Improved Cash Price.Each shareholder of Caverion who has already accepted the Tender Offer or accepts the Tender Offer before the supplement regarding the Improved Tender Offer is published will  after such supplement is published  be deemed to have accepted the Tender Offer with the Improved Cash Price. Therefore  a shareholder of Caverion who has already tendered his/her Shares in the Tender Offer or tenders before such supplement is made public  and who wishes to receive the Improved Cash Price  does not have to re-tender his/her Shares or take any other action as a result of the Improved Tender Offer before or after the publication of the supplement regarding the Improved Tender Offer. All such shareholders will then receive the Improved Cash Price  if the Tender Offer will be completed.Shareholders of Caverion who have already tendered their Shares in the Tender Offer  and who wish to choose the Alternative Consideration instead of the Improved Cash Price are given an opportunity to withdraw their previous acceptance and to submit the new acceptance form for the Alternative Consideration after the supplement regarding the Improved Tender Offer is published. The target is to give shareholders an opportunity to withdraw their previous acceptance without additional fees  in case such withdrawal is made after the supplement regarding the Improved Tender Offer is published.Terms of the Alternative Consideration InstrumentCaverion's shareholders who validly accept the Improved Tender Offer may choose  in respect of all (but not part only) of their holdings of Shares per each book-entry account  to receive Alternative Consideration Instruments instead of the Improved Cash Price under the terms of the Improved Tender Offer on the following basis:One validly tendered Caverion Share entitles its holder to one Alternative Consideration Instrument issued by the Offeror. The nominal principal amount and book-entry unit of each of the Alternative Consideration Instrument is EUR 8.50. The Alternative Consideration Instrument shall not accrue any interest.The equity commitments given to the Offeror by Bain Capital Funds and the other members of the Consortium to finance the Tender Offer have been amended to include financing also of the Alternative Consideration Instruments  so that their cash redemption by the Offeror will be backed by the funding commitments from the Consortium in the same way as funding for the Improved Cash Price.The Alternative Consideration Instruments will be issued on the date of the completion trades of the Tender Offer and they will mature nine (9) months from their issue date. The Alternative Consideration Instruments will be redeemed at their full nominal amount of EUR 8.50 on the date of maturity (the ""Redemption Date""). If the Redemption Date falls on a date which is not a Business Day  the Redemption Date will be postponed to the next following Business Day. ""Business Day"" shall mean a day on which the European TARGET2 System is open for the settlement of payment orders.Holders of the Alternative Consideration Instruments are not entitled to demand prepayment of their Alternative Consideration Instruments prior to the Redemption Date.The Alternative Consideration Instruments will be issued as book-entry form debt securities in Euroclear Finland's Infinity system and no physical certificates will be issued. The Finnish Act on the Book-Entry System and Clearing Operations  Act on Book-Entry Accounts as well as the rules and CEO's decisions of Euroclear Finland will be applied to the handling of the Alternative Consideration Instruments.The Alternative Consideration Instruments are direct  unsubordinated  unsecured and unguaranteed obligations of the Offeror ranking pari passu and without any preference among them.The Alternative Consideration Instruments are transferable after they have been registered into the respective book-entry account of the relevant holder of such Alternative Consideration Instruments  but no arrangements will be made to create a secondary market. No application has been or will be made to have the Alternative Consideration Instruments admitted to trading on any trading venue.Conditions to Completion of the Tender OfferIn connection with the Improved Tender Offer  the Offeror has agreed to lower the Condition to Completion of the Tender Offer concerning the minimum acceptance threshold from more than 90 percent to more than 66 2/3 percent of all Shares. Therefore  a condition to the completion of the Improved Tender Offer is that the Improved Tender Offer has been validly accepted with respect to the Shares representing  together with any other Shares otherwise acquired by the Offeror prior to or during the Offer Period  more than sixty-six and two thirds (66 2/3) percent of the Shares and voting rights in the Company calculated in accordance with Chapter 18 Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act (624/2006  as amended). Other Conditions to Completion (as defined in the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer) remain unchanged.The Offeror reserves the right to waive any of the Conditions to Completion that have not been fulfilled. If all Conditions to Completion have been fulfilled or the Offeror has waived the requirements for the fulfilment of all or some of them no later than at the time of announcement of the final results of the Improved Tender Offer  the Offeror will consummate the Improved Tender Offer in accordance with its terms and conditions after the expiration of the Offer Period by purchasing the Shares validly tendered in the Improved Tender Offer and paying the Offer Price to the holders of the Shares that have validly accepted the Improved Tender Offer.Recommendation by the Board of Directors of CaverionFollowing extensive review and discussions and after having regarded factors such as deal certainty for the Company and its shareholders  timeline to closing  including the fact that the regulatory approval process for the Offeror's Improved Tender Offer is expected to be completed shortly  and potential disruption for the Company and its employees and other stakeholders  and after consultation with its financial and legal advisors  the Board of Directors of Caverion has assessed the Offeror's Improved Tender Offer in comparison with the Crayfish Offer. The Board of Directors of Caverion has concluded that following the significant increase in the Offer Price by the Offeror  together with the other amended terms and conditions of the Improved Tender Offer and deal certainty aspects related to the timing and feasibility of obtaining required approvals from the regulatory authorities  and possible structural remedies being required as a condition to completion of the Crayfish Offer  the Improved Tender Offer by the Offeror is more beneficial for the Company  its shareholders and other stakeholders as compared to Crayfish Offer. Therefore  The Board of Directors of Caverion  represented by a quorum comprising the non-conflicted members of the Board of Directors  has unanimously decided to recommend that the shareholders of Caverion accept the Improved Tender Offer  having concluded that the Improved Tender Offer is fair to Caverion's shareholders from a financial point of view and provides Caverion's shareholders with greater deal certainty than the Crayfish Offer as it is likely to complete significantly faster than the Crayfish Offer. The Board of Directors expects to supplement its statement and renew its recommendation regarding the Tender Offer that was issued and announced on November 18  2022 after having received a substantially final draft of the supplement to the Tender Offer Document. The Board of Directors of Caverion has received an updated opinion  dated January 24  2023  of Caverion's exclusive financial adviser  Bank of America Europe DAC  Stockholm branch (""BofA Securities"")  to the effect that  as of the date of such opinion  the increased Offer Price to be paid to holders of Shares (other than Security Trading  Fennogens and Corbis and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the Improved Tender Offer  was fair from a financial point of view  to such holders  which opinion was based upon and subject to the assumptions made  procedures followed  matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken as more fully described in such opinion. The opinion of BofA Securities was provided for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors of Caverion and does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holders of Shares should act in connection with the Tender Offer or any related matter. The updated opinion will be attached to the statement of the Board of Directors of Caverion.Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors Markus Ehrnrooth  who is closely associated with two of the parties of the Consortium  Fennogens and Corbis  has not participated in any assessment or review of the implications of the Tender Offer by the Board of Directors or in any decision-making concerning the recommendation of the Board of Directors or the Combination Agreement. Markus Ehrnrooth has not participated in and has refrained from the work of the Board of Directors in Caverion during the pendency of the discussions between the Consortium and Caverion concerning the Tender Offer due to his material connections to and interests in the Offeror.Support by certain shareholders of CaverionElo Mutual Pension Insurance Company  Ilmarinen Mutual Pension Insurance Company  Mandatum Life Insurance Company Limited and Varma Mutual Pension Insurance Company  together representing approximately 15.4 percent of all Shares and votes in Caverion  as well as Antti Herlin  Hisra Consulting and Finance Oy and Autumn Spirit O√º  which are not part of the Consortium but are related parties to the Consortium members and together represent approximately 0.5 percent of all Shares and votes in Caverion  have renewed their irrevocable undertakings to accept the Improved Tender Offer  and Veritas Pension Insurance Company Ltd.  which holds approximately 0.6 percent of all Shares and votes in Caverion  has given an irrevocable undertaking to accept the Improved Tender Offer. These irrevocable undertakings may be terminated only in the event that the Offeror withdraws or does not complete the Tender Offer  or in the event that a competing offer is announced by a third party with a consideration of at least EUR 8.95 per Share and the Offeror does not match or exceed the consideration offered in such competing offer within a certain period of time.Together with the Shares directly held by the Consortium members  the irrevocable undertakings represent approximately 43.0 percent of all the Shares and votes in Caverion in aggregate.FinancingThe equity commitments given to the Offeror by Bain Capital Funds and the other members of the Consortium to finance the Tender Offer have been amended to include also financing for the redemption of the Alternative Consideration Instruments by the Offeror when they fall due.As described in the Tender Offer Document  the Offeror has received equity commitments  as evidenced in equity commitment letters addressed to the Offeror  the indirect parent of the Offeror  North Holdings 1 Oy (the ""PIK Borrower"") has received debt commitments (as supplemented by supplemental deeds dated January 10  2023 and January 20  2023 respectively) and the Offeror has received debt commitments (and interim debt commitments) as evidenced in debt commitment letters addressed to the Offeror  in each case  to finance the Tender Offer at completion and compulsory redemption proceedings  if any.The Offeror's obligation to complete the Tender Offer is not conditional upon availability of financing. The debt financing has been committed on a customary European ""certain funds"" basis and thus its availability is subject to only limited conditions. The Offeror was incorporated for the purpose of implementing the Tender Offer. The completion of the Tender Offer or offering of Alternative Consideration Instruments as alternative consideration in the Improved Tender Offer is not in itself expected to have any significant effect on the business operations  profit and financial position of the Offeror.FURTHER INFORMATIONThe Offeror will supplement the Tender Offer Document with detailed information on the terms and conditions of the Improved Tender Offer  including the Alternative Consideration Instruments  as well as additional information on the Offeror  and will publish the supplement to the Tender Offer Document once it has been approved by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority. The Offeror is currently expecting that the supplement to the Tender Offer Document will be published in early February  2023.Each shareholder  who wishes to choose the Alternative Consideration instead of the Improved Cash Price in connection with the Improved Tender Offer should carefully read the supplement to the Tender Offer Document before making an investment decision in order to fully understand the potential risks and rewards associated with the decision to invest in the Alternative Consideration Instruments.The supplement to the Tender Offer Document as well as additional materials and instructions will be available at www.caverion-offer.com and at www.nordea.fi/caverion-offer.CAVERION CORPORATIONDistribution: Nasdaq Helsinki  key media  www.caverion.comABOUT THE CONSORTIUMBain Luxco is owned and controlled by the Bain Capital Funds.

The Tender Offer is made in the United States pursuant to Section 14(e) and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act  subject to the exemption provided under Rule 14d-1(c) under the Exchange Act for a Tier I tender offer (the ""Tier I Exemption"") and Rule 802 (the ""802 Exemption"") under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (the ""U.S. Securities Act"")  and otherwise in accordance with the disclosure and procedural requirements of Finnish law  including with respect to the Tender Offer timetable  settlement procedures  withdrawal  waiver of conditions and timing of payments  which are different from those of the United States. In particular  the financial information included in this stock exchange release has been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in Finland  which may not be comparable to the financial statements or financial information of U.S. companies. The Tender Offer is made to Caverion's shareholders resident in the United States on the same terms and conditions as those made to all other shareholders of Caverion to whom an offer is made. Any informational documents  including this stock exchange release  are being disseminated to U.S. shareholders on a basis comparable to the method that such documents are provided to Caverion's other shareholders.As permitted under the Tier I Exemption  the settlement of the Tender Offer is based on the applicable Finnish law provisions  which differ from the settlement procedures customary in the United States  particularly as regards to the time when payment of the consideration is rendered. The Tender Offer  which is subject to Finnish law  is being made to the U.S. shareholders in accordance with the applicable U.S. securities laws  and applicable exemptions thereunder  in particular the Tier I Exemption and the 802 Exemption. To the extent the Tender Offer is subject to U.S. securities laws  those laws only apply to U.S. shareholders and will not give rise to claims on the part of any other person. U.S. shareholders should consider that (whether paid initially in cash or upon redemption of any Alternative Consideration Instruments) the offer price for the Tender Offer is being paid in EUR and that no adjustment will be made based on any changes in the exchange rate.To the extent permissible under applicable law or regulations  the Offeror and its affiliates or its brokers and its brokers' affiliates (acting as agents for the Offeror or its affiliates  as applicable) may from time to time after the date of this stock exchange release and during the pendency of the Tender Offer  and other than pursuant to the Tender Offer  directly or indirectly purchase or arrange to purchase Shares or any securities that are convertible into  exchangeable for or exercisable for Shares. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. To the extent information about such purchases or arrangements to purchase is made public in Finland  such information will be disclosed by means of a press release or other means reasonably calculated to inform U.S. shareholders of Caverion of such information. In addition  the financial advisers to the Offeror may also engage in ordinary course trading activities in securities of Caverion  which may include purchases or arrangements to purchase such securities. To the extent required in Finland  any information about such purchases will be made public in Finland in the manner required by Finnish law.Neither the SEC nor any U.S. state securities commission has approved or disapproved the Tender Offer (including the offer of the Alternative Consideration Instruments)  passed upon the merits or fairness of the Tender Offer (including the offer of the Alternative Consideration Instruments)  or passed any comment upon the adequacy  accuracy or completeness of the disclosure in relation to the Tender Offer (including in relation to the Alternative Consideration Instruments).

In the event of more than one person giving a tender through an Admitted Institution  the above provisions will apply to them jointly and severally.11 Tenders through Euroclear Nederland11.1 Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder by whom  or on whose behalf  a tender through an Admitted Institution is made irrevocably undertakes  represents  warrants and agrees to and with the Company (so as to bind it  its personal representatives  custodian  sub-custodian  heirs  successors and assigns) on the date that such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are tendered up to and including the Final Settlement Date that:(a) the tender of any DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants constitutes an acceptance by the holder of the DCAC Ordinary Shares of the terms  conditions and restrictions of the Stub Tender Offer;(b) such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder is not over-tendering his/her position by tendering 5% of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and all of the DCAC Public Warrants held by it and will deliver the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants on the Closing Date;(c) such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder has full power and authority to tender  sell and deliver  and has not entered into any other agreement to tender  sell or deliver the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants stated to have been tendered to any party other than the Company (together with all rights attaching thereto) and  when such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are purchased by the Company for cash  the Company acquires such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  with full title guarantee and free from all liens  charges  encumbrances  rights of pre-emption or other third party rights of any nature and together with all the rights attaching thereto;(d) such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are being tendered in compliance with the restrictions set out in this Circular and the securities and other applicable laws or regulations of the jurisdiction in which the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders is located or of which it is a resident and no registration  approval or filing with any regulatory authority of such jurisdiction is required in connection with the tendering of such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants; and(e) if requested by the Company or Van Lanschot Kempen  provide the legal name of the beneficial DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders wishing to tender.12 Restricted jurisdictions12.1 The making of the Stub Tender Offer in  or to persons who are citizens or nationals of  or resident in  jurisdictions outside Guernsey or the Netherlands or custodians  nominees or trustees for citizens  nationals or residents of jurisdictions outside Guernsey or the Netherlands may be prohibited or affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders who are not resident in Guernsey or the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal requirements. It is the responsibility of any DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder wishing to make a tender to satisfy himself  herself or itself as to the full observance of the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in connection with the Stub Tender Offer  including the obtaining of any governmental  exchange control or other consents which may be required  the compliance with other necessary formalities and the payment of any transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due in such jurisdiction. Any such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder will be responsible for payment of any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due by whomsoever payable and the Company and any person acting on its behalf shall be fully indemnified and held harmless by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder for any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments such person may be required to pay. No steps have been taken to authorise the extending of the Stub Tender Offer in any territory outside Guernsey or the Netherlands.12.2 The provisions of this paragraph and any other terms of the Stub Tender Offer relating to shareholders outside Guernsey the Netherlands may be waived  varied or modified as regards specific DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holder or on a general basis by the Company.12.3 The provisions of this paragraph 12 supersede any terms of the Stub Tender Offer which may be inconsistent with it.12.4 All DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders wishing to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants in the Stub Tender Offer should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal or regulatory requirements. If you are in any doubt about your position  you should consult your professional adviser in the relevant territory.RISK FACTORSPrior to deciding whether or not to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should carefully consider this Circular in its entirety  as well as the section ""Risk Factors"" in the DCAC IPO Prospectus and the risk factors discussed in the section ""Risk Factors"" in the Shareholders Circular dated 20 December 2022 (the ""December Circular"").The risks described below have emerged or changed in light of the Stub Tender Offer. The occurrence of any of the risks below could have a material adverse effect on the Stub Tender Offer and on the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants.All of these risk factors and events are contingencies that may or may not occur. A number of these risks described below may occur simultaneously. The order in which these risks are presented is not necessarily an indication of the likelihood of the risks actually materialising  of the potential significance of the risks or of the scope of any potential negative impact to the Stub Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should carefully consider all of the risk factors set out in this section 6.Although the Company believes that the risks described below are the material risks concerning the Stub Tender Offer  they are not the only risks relating to the Stub Tender Offer. Other risks  events  facts or circumstances not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial could  individually or cumulatively  prove to be important and may have a significant negative impact on the Stub Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders cannot withdraw their tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants without the written consent of the Company or once their tender has become unconditional.Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be deemed to have agreed that  in consideration of the Company to process his tender  such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder will not revoke its tender or its DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants without the prior written consent of the Company. Once tendered  a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder can therefore not withdraw its tender under the Stub Tender Offer  unless the Company consents to such withdrawal. Once the tender has become unconditional  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders cannot withdraw their DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants tendered under the Stub Tender Offer.As the DCAC Sponsor and/or other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may decide to not participate in the Stub Tender Offer  they may obtain a controlling interest in the Company.The DCAC Sponsor and/or such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder may decide not to participate in the Stub Tender Offer. This may cause the DCAC Sponsor and/or such other DCAC Ordinary Shareholder to obtain increased voting power  which may results in a controlling interest and a decisive influence over all matters requiring DCAC Ordinary Shareholder approval  including  subject to the Amended Articles  approval of a future business combination.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be locked.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be locked. During this period  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders will not be able to (re)sell  pledge  encumber or otherwise transfer such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares  DCAC Public Warrants or any rights related thereto.The Stub Tender Offer is subject to certain conditions and the DCAC Board may decide to postpone or terminate the Stub Tender Offer at any time prior to the purchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer as a result of which DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders may receive the repurchase price tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and DCAC Public Warrants  as applicable  at a later point in time or not at all.The Stub Tender Offer is subject to the conditions that (a) the Stub Tender Resolutions being passed at the EGM  (b) there has been no Material Adverse Change nor Force Majeure Event  (c) the DCAC Board being satisfied that the Company has in its control or to its order the aggregate of the Offer Price for all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  the aggregate of the Offer Price previously credited to the Escrow Account  (d) the DCAC Board continuing to be satisfied that that the Company will  immediately following the purchase of all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants (as if all DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders were to tender for acquisition their full entitlement)  satisfy the statutory solvency test prescribed by the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 as amended and (e) the Stub Tender Offer is not terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Tender Offer Document. The Company may at its sole discretion terminate or postpone the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in this Circular  if the Company (acting through the DCAC Directors) considers in its reasonable opinion that (a) it has become unlawful  impractical or inappropriate for the Company to fund the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants without materially harming DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders as a whole or (b) the completion of the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer would have material adverse fiscal or other consequences (whether by reason of a change in legislation or practice or otherwise) for the Company or its DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders taken as a whole if the Stub Tender Offer were to proceed or (c) if the Company will not immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants validly tendered in the Tender Offer  continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test under the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008  as amended. If these conditions are not met or if the Board decides to delay or terminate the Tender Offer prior to the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and the DCAC Public Warrant Holders may receive the repurchase price of up to ¬£2.20 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per tendered DCAC Public Warrant at a later point in time or not at all.The net consideration received by a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder may be less than ¬£2.20 per DCAC Ordinary Share and less than ¬£0.066 per DCAC Public Warrant.The cash consideration of up to ¬£2.20 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per tendered DCAC Public Warrant does not include costs relating to a Shareholder‚Äôs or Warrant Holder's broker  bank or other financial intermediary or advisor. Nor is the Company responsible for any taxes  duties or similar imposts suffered by the Shareholder or Warrant Holder. The net payment per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share received by DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant received by DCAC Public Warrant Holders may therefore be lower than the maximum ¬£2.20 and ¬£0.066  as applicable  repurchase price.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date and such deadline may differ for each individual broker  bank or other financial intermediary. The Company does not have any knowledge on such deadlines and therefore the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should consult its broker  bank or other financial intermediary in this regard.Any tenders not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Circular may be invalid.Submitting a tender that is not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Circular  may result in an invalid tender and ultimately not being able to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer (thereby also not receiving the cash consideration of up to ¬£2.20 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per tendered DCAC Public Warrant). DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should note that none of Van Lanschot Kempen  Admina  the Company or any other person is or will be obliged to give notice of any defects  irregularities  omissions  delays or non-receipts in tenders of DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders  and that none of them will incur any liability for failure to give any such notice.The Stub Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase 5% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares and all of your DCAC Public Warrants  and following the Stub Tender Offer you will no longer have a repurchase right.The Stub Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase up to 5% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares and all of your DCAC Public Warrants. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should note that the articles of incorporation of the Company no longer provide for a repurchase right and that there is no assurance that the Company will provide for such a repurchase right in the future. There is therefore no assurance that DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders can have their DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants repurchased by the Company other than through this one-time Stub Tender Offer.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may face a significant decrease in net asset value of their shareholdingFollowing the provision and distribution of cash to meet the Repurchase Offer  a substantial part of DCAC‚Äôs then remaining cash will be applied to settle outstanding liabilities  resulting in limited remaining assets and a decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share. This may in particular affect DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares  as they will not receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary Share for DCAC Ordinary Shares that they do not (successfully) tender. If the Company is wound up or liquidated in the future  the decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share may result in DCAC Ordinary Shareholders receiving substantially less than ¬£10.25 per DCAC Ordinary Share or nothing at all.There is no guarantee that DCAC will be able to satisfy the statutory solvency test following the acquisition of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants validly tendered in the Stub Tender OfferPursuant to section 320 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008  as amended  the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Stub Tender Offer would be considered to be a distribution for the purposes of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 and therefore the DCAC Board must comply with section 303 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 in respect of making distributions  including ensuring satisfaction of the statutory ""solvency test"" as defined in section 527 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 being (in respect of companies that are not ""supervised companies""  like DCAC) that DCAC is able to pay its debts as they become due and that the value of DCAC's assets is greater than the value of its liabilities. There is no guarantee that DCAC will  immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Stub Tender Offer  meet and/or continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test.The repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants by the Company may result in taxes being imposed on the Company or on DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders.The repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants by the Company may result in taxes being imposed on the Company or on DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders as at the date of such repurchase or redemption. The Company does not intend to make any cash distributions to DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders to pay any such taxes. The materialisation of this risk may adversely affect the post-tax return for certain DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders.OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATIONInformation Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this Circular other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements.

By their nature  they are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties  which could cause DCAC's actual results and future events to differ materially from those implied or expressed by forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this Circular include those described under ""Risk Factors"".Although DCAC believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable  forward-looking statements are based on the opinions  assumptions and estimates of the members of the DCAC Board and its management at the date the statements are made and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors.The Shareholders are advised to read ""Risk Factors"" for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect DCAC's future performance. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialise  or should any of the assumptions underlying the above or other factors prove to be incorrect  DCAC's actual results of operations or future financial condition could differ materially from those described herein as currently anticipated  believed  estimated or expected. In light of the risks  uncertainties and assumptions underlying the above factors  the forward-looking events described in this Circular may not occur or be realised.

Such purchases will be market purchases in accordance with applicable law. 5.5 Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares and all DCAC Public Warrants will thereby be deemed to have agreed that  in consideration of the Company agreeing to process his tender  such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder will not revoke his tender or withdraw his  her or its DCAC Ordinary Shares and all DCAC Public Warrants without the prior written consent of the Company. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that  once tendered  DCAC Ordinary Shares may not be sold  transferred  charged or otherwise disposed of. 5.6 Unless it has been extended  suspended or terminated prior to such time in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.2 and/or paragraph 8 of this section 5  the Stub Tender Offer will close on the Closing Date  and any documentation received after that time will (unless the Company  in its absolute discretion determines otherwise) be returned without any transaction taking place. 5.7 All tenders must be made in accordance with the instructions set out in this Circular.

The Company‚Äôs decision shall be final and binding on all of the parties. The Company reserves the right to reject any or all tenders that it determines in its absolute discretion not to be in proper form or the acceptance or payment for which may  in the opinion of the Company  be unlawful. No tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be deemed to be validly made until all defects or irregularities have been cured or waived. The consideration under the Stub Tender Offer will not be dispatched until the Company is duly satisfied. The decision of the Company as to which DCAC Ordinary Shares have been successfully tendered shall be final and binding on all DCAC Ordinary Shareholders. 5.12 None of Van Lanschot Kempen  Admina  the Company or any other person is or will be obliged to give notice of any defects or irregularities in tenders  and none of them will incur any liability for failure to give any such notice. 5.13 Any accidental omission to provide or any delay or non-receipt of this Circular by any person entitled to receive the same shall not invalidate any aspect of the Stub Tender Offer. 5.14 Further copies of this document may be obtained on request from Admina. 5.15 Any changes to the terms of  or any decision to suspend  extend or terminate the Stub Tender Offer will be followed as soon as possible by a public announcement thereof. 5.16 None of the Admina  Van Lanschot Kempen or the Company will accept responsibility for documentation lost or delayed in the postal system. 6 Record Date  Commencement of Stub Tender Offer and Offer Period 6.1 The record date for the Stub Tender Offer shall be 17:40 (CET) on 10 February 2023  being the time and date on which DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders are eligible to participate in the Repurchase Offer and the Stub Tender Offer (the ""Record Date""). 6.2 Subject to and conditional upon the Stub Tender Resolutions passing at the EGM  the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter issue an announcement (the ""Announcement"") confirming  inter alia  that the Stub Tender Resolutions have passed  the Stub Tender Offer has become unconditional and that the Stub Tender Offer period has commenced. 6.3 The last time and date for tenders of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants shall be 14:00 (CET) on 16 March 2023. 7 Closing Date 7.1 The Stub Tender Offer will remain open for acceptance from the date and time of the Announcement until 16:00 (CET) on 15 March 7.2 2023 (the ‚ÄúClosing Date‚Äù). 8 Termination of the Stub Tender Offer If the Company (acting through the DCAC Directors)  at any time prior to the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants tendered in the Stub Tender Offer (and including where it has previously deferred the Closing Date in accordance with paragraph 2.2 of this section 5) considers that  in its reasonable opinion  either: it has become unlawful  impractical or inappropriate for the Company to fund the purchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants pursuant to the Stub Tender Offer without materially harming DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders as a whole; or the completion of the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer would have material adverse fiscal or other consequences (whether by reason of a change in legislation or practice or otherwise) for the Company or its DCAC Ordinary Shareholders or its DCAC Public Warrant Holders taken as a whole if the Tender Offer were to proceed; or the Company will not  immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants validly tendered in the Stub Tender Offer  continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test under the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008  as amended  the Company shall be entitled at its discretion to delay or terminate the Stub Tender Offer by a public announcement to DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders.

(g) if not resident in Guernsey or the Netherlands  he  she or it has fully observed any applicable legal requirements  that the invitation under the Stub Tender Offer may be made to that DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant holders under the laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction in which the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder is located and that the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder is entitled to accept the Stub Tender Offer under the laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction; (h) receipt of a tender through an Admitted Institution constitutes the submission of the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders to the jurisdiction of the courts of Guernsey in relation to all matters arising out of or in connection with the Stub Tender Offer. 10.2 To the extent not prohibited by or ineffective under applicable law  each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder by whom or on whose behalf a tender through an Admitted Institution is given irrevocably agrees to assume liability for  pay and indemnify the Company from and against any and all liabilities  obligations  damages  losses  settlements  judgments  claims  actions  suits  penalties  costs  expenses and other sanctions (civil or criminal) suffered or incurred by either of them as a result of the breach by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders of any of the undertakings  representations  warranties  or agreements contained in paragraph 8.1 of this Part III. 10.3 A reference above to a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders includes a reference to the person or persons giving tender through an Admitted Institution. In the event of more than one person giving a tender through an Admitted Institution  the above provisions will apply to them jointly and severally. 11 Tenders through Euroclear Nederland 11.1 Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder by whom  or on whose behalf  a tender through an Admitted Institution is made irrevocably undertakes  represents  warrants and agrees to and with the Company (so as to bind it  its personal representatives  custodian  sub-custodian  heirs  successors and assigns) on the date that such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are tendered up to and including the Final Settlement Date that: (a) the tender of any DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants constitutes an acceptance by the holder of the DCAC Ordinary Shares of the terms  conditions and restrictions of the Stub Tender Offer; (b) such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder is not over-tendering his/her position by tendering 5% of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and all of the DCAC Public Warrants held by it and will deliver the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants on the Closing Date; (c) such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder has full power and authority to tender  sell and deliver  and has not entered into any other agreement to tender  sell or deliver the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants stated to have been tendered to any party other than the Company (together with all rights attaching thereto) and  when such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are purchased by the Company for cash  the Company acquires such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  with full title guarantee and free from all liens  charges  encumbrances  rights of pre-emption or other third party rights of any nature and together with all the rights attaching thereto; (d) such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are being tendered in compliance with the restrictions set out in this Circular and the securities and other applicable laws or regulations of the jurisdiction in which the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders is located or of which it is a resident and no registration  approval or filing with any regulatory authority of such jurisdiction is required in connection with the tendering of such DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants; and (e) if requested by the Company or Van Lanschot Kempen  provide the legal name of the beneficial DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders wishing to tender. 12 Restricted jurisdictions 12.1 The making of the Stub Tender Offer in  or to persons who are citizens or nationals of  or resident in  jurisdictions outside Guernsey or the Netherlands or custodians  nominees or trustees for citizens  nationals or residents of jurisdictions outside Guernsey or the Netherlands may be prohibited or affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders who are not resident in Guernsey or the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal requirements. It is the responsibility of any DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder wishing to make a tender to satisfy himself  herself or itself as to the full observance of the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in connection with the Stub Tender Offer  including the obtaining of any governmental  exchange control or other consents which may be required  the compliance with other necessary formalities and the payment of any transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due in such jurisdiction. Any such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder will be responsible for payment of any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due by whomsoever payable and the Company and any person acting on its behalf shall be fully indemnified and held harmless by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder for any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments such person may be required to pay.

If you are in any doubt about your position  you should consult your professional adviser in the relevant territory.RISK FACTORS Prior to deciding whether or not to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should carefully consider this Circular in its entirety  as well as the section ""Risk Factors"" in the DCAC IPO Prospectus and the risk factors discussed in the section ""Risk Factors"" in the Shareholders Circular dated 20 December 2022 (the ""December Circular""). The risks described below have emerged or changed in light of the Stub Tender Offer. The occurrence of any of the risks below could have a material adverse effect on the Stub Tender Offer and on the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants. All of these risk factors and events are contingencies that may or may not occur. A number of these risks described below may occur simultaneously. The order in which these risks are presented is not necessarily an indication of the likelihood of the risks actually materialising  of the potential significance of the risks or of the scope of any potential negative impact to the Stub Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should carefully consider all of the risk factors set out in this section 6. Although the Company believes that the risks described below are the material risks concerning the Stub Tender Offer  they are not the only risks relating to the Stub Tender Offer. Other risks  events  facts or circumstances not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial could  individually or cumulatively  prove to be important and may have a significant negative impact on the Stub Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders cannot withdraw their tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants without the written consent of the Company or once their tender has become unconditional. Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be deemed to have agreed that  in consideration of the Company to process his tender  such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder will not revoke its tender or its DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants without the prior written consent of the Company. Once tendered  a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder can therefore not withdraw its tender under the Stub Tender Offer  unless the Company consents to such withdrawal. Once the tender has become unconditional  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders cannot withdraw their DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants tendered under the Stub Tender Offer. As the DCAC Sponsor and/or other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may decide to not participate in the Stub Tender Offer  they may obtain a controlling interest in the Company. The DCAC Sponsor and/or such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder may decide not to participate in the Stub Tender Offer. This may cause the DCAC Sponsor and/or such other DCAC Ordinary Shareholder to obtain increased voting power  which may results in a controlling interest and a decisive influence over all matters requiring DCAC Ordinary Shareholder approval  including  subject to the Amended Articles  approval of a future business combination. As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be locked. As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants will be locked. During this period  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders will not be able to (re)sell  pledge  encumber or otherwise transfer such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares  DCAC Public Warrants or any rights related thereto. The Stub Tender Offer is subject to certain conditions and the DCAC Board may decide to postpone or terminate the Stub Tender Offer at any time prior to the purchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer as a result of which DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders may receive the repurchase price tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and DCAC Public Warrants  as applicable  at a later point in time or not at all. The Stub Tender Offer is subject to the conditions that (a) the Stub Tender Resolutions being passed at the EGM  (b) there has been no Material Adverse Change nor Force Majeure Event  (c) the DCAC Board being satisfied that the Company has in its control or to its order the aggregate of the Offer Price for all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants  the aggregate of the Offer Price previously credited to the Escrow Account  (d) the DCAC Board continuing to be satisfied that that the Company will  immediately following the purchase of all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants (as if all DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders were to tender for acquisition their full entitlement)  satisfy the statutory solvency test prescribed by the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 as amended and (e) the Stub Tender Offer is not terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Tender Offer Document. The Company may at its sole discretion terminate or postpone the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in this Circular  if the Company (acting through the DCAC Directors) considers in its reasonable opinion that (a) it has become unlawful  impractical or inappropriate for the Company to fund the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants without materially harming DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders as a whole or (b) the completion of the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer would have material adverse fiscal or other consequences (whether by reason of a change in legislation or practice or otherwise) for the Company or its DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders taken as a whole if the Stub Tender Offer were to proceed or (c) if the Company will not immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants validly tendered in the Tender Offer  continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test under the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008  as amended. If these conditions are not met or if the Board decides to delay or terminate the Tender Offer prior to the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and the DCAC Public Warrant Holders may receive the repurchase price of up to ¬£2.20 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per tendered DCAC Public Warrant at a later point in time or not at all. The net consideration received by a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holder may be less than ¬£2.20 per DCAC Ordinary Share and less than ¬£0.066 per DCAC Public Warrant. The cash consideration of up to ¬£2.20 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per tendered DCAC Public Warrant does not include costs relating to a Shareholder‚Äôs or Warrant Holder's broker  bank or other financial intermediary or advisor. Nor is the Company responsible for any taxes  duties or similar imposts suffered by the Shareholder or Warrant Holder. The net payment per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share received by DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant received by DCAC Public Warrant Holders may therefore be lower than the maximum ¬£2.20 and ¬£0.066  as applicable  repurchase price. The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date. The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date and such deadline may differ for each individual broker  bank or other financial intermediary. The Company does not have any knowledge on such deadlines and therefore the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should consult its broker  bank or other financial intermediary in this regard. Any tenders not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Circular may be invalid. Submitting a tender that is not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Circular  may result in an invalid tender and ultimately not being able to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants under the Stub Tender Offer (thereby also not receiving the cash consideration of up to ¬£2.20 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per tendered DCAC Public Warrant). DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should note that none of Van Lanschot Kempen  Admina  the Company or any other person is or will be obliged to give notice of any defects  irregularities  omissions  delays or non-receipts in tenders of DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders  and that none of them will incur any liability for failure to give any such notice. The Stub Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase 5% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares and all of your DCAC Public Warrants  and following the Stub Tender Offer you will no longer have a repurchase right. The Stub Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase up to 5% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares and all of your DCAC Public Warrants. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders should note that the articles of incorporation of the Company no longer provide for a repurchase right and that there is no assurance that the Company will provide for such a repurchase right in the future. There is therefore no assurance that DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders can have their DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants repurchased by the Company other than through this one-time Stub Tender Offer. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may face a significant decrease in net asset value of their shareholding Following the provision and distribution of cash to meet the Repurchase Offer  a substantial part of DCAC‚Äôs then remaining cash will be applied to settle outstanding liabilities  resulting in limited remaining assets and a decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share. This may in particular affect DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares  as they will not receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary Share for DCAC Ordinary Shares that they do not (successfully) tender. If the Company is wound up or liquidated in the future  the decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share may result in DCAC Ordinary Shareholders receiving substantially less than ¬£10.25 per DCAC Ordinary Share or nothing at all. There is no guarantee that DCAC will be able to satisfy the statutory solvency test following the acquisition of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants validly tendered in the Stub Tender Offer Pursuant to section 320 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008  as amended  the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Stub Tender Offer would be considered to be a distribution for the purposes of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 and therefore the DCAC Board must comply with section 303 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 in respect of making distributions  including ensuring satisfaction of the statutory ""solvency test"" as defined in section 527 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 being (in respect of companies that are not ""supervised companies""  like DCAC) that DCAC is able to pay its debts as they become due and that the value of DCAC's assets is greater than the value of its liabilities. There is no guarantee that DCAC will  immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Stub Tender Offer  meet and/or continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test. The repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants by the Company may result in taxes being imposed on the Company or on DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders. The repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Public Warrants by the Company may result in taxes being imposed on the Company or on DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders as at the date of such repurchase or redemption. The Company does not intend to make any cash distributions to DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders to pay any such taxes. The materialisation of this risk may adversely affect the post-tax return for certain DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders.OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements in this Circular other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements.

(TEL +81-3-3282-2112) Notice Regarding the Establishment of a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary through a Corporate Spinoff Marubeni Corporation (""Marubeni"") announces that the Board of Directors of Marubeni resolved today that on April 3  2023 (scheduled) an intermediate holding company (the newly established company) will be established as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marubeni through a corporate spinoff and acquire the rights and obligations of the business management of Marubeni's subsidiaries in the information and telecommunications field. Specifically  the rights and obligations will include Marubeni's shares of Marubeni Information Systems Co.  Ltd. (Marubeni's shareholding ratio: 100%)  Marubeni Network Solutions Inc. (Marubeni's shareholding ratio: 100%)  and Marubeni IT Solutions Inc. (Marubeni's shareholding ratio: 46%; Marubeni Information Systems' shareholding ratio: 34%). Since the corporate spinoff will be a simple incorporation-type separation and conducted by Marubeni as an entirely independent action  certain details are omitted from this disclosure. 1. Objective of the Corporate Spinoff In recent years  the domestic ICT market has been rapidly expanding and is expected to continue to grow steadily. At the same time  the structure of the domestic ICT market itself is drastically changing because of the acceleration of digital transformation and the increasing responsibility for ESG and SDGs. Under these circumstances  Marubeni Information Systems  Marubeni Network Solutions  and Marubeni IT Solutions  Marubeni group companies active in the ICT field  are creating and promoting their own ICT businesses respectively. However  to keep up with the rapid changes in the ICT market more quickly and strategically  Marubeni will inaugurate a new structure led by a newly established company through the corporate spinoff. This company will gather human capital partly from each group company. It will also lead activities such as planning and executing strategies  including investments to advanced technologies or future growth fields  and creating synergies among group companies. 12. Outline of the Corporate Spinoff Ôºà1ÔºâSchedule January 25  2023 Resolution by the Board of Directors April 3  2023 (scheduled) Effective date of the corporate spinoff *The corporate spinoff  pursuant to Article 805 of the Companies Act  will be executed without the approval of a general meeting of the shareholders. (Simple Incorporation-Type Separations) Ôºà2ÔºâMethod The corporate spinoff will be a simple incorporation-type separation. Marubeni will be the separated company. The newly established company will be the succeeding company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marubeni. Ôºà3ÔºâAllotment of Shares The newly established company will issue 10 000 shares of common stock  all of which shall be allotted to Marubeni. Ôºà4ÔºâTreatment of Share Purchase Warrant and Bonds with Share Purchase Warrants Marubeni has not issued share purchase warrants and bonds with share purchase warrants. Ôºà5ÔºâChange in Capital Resulting from the Corporate Spinoff There will be no change in Marubeni's capital resulting from the corporate spinoff. Ôºà6ÔºâRights and Obligations Transferred to the Newly Established Company The newly established company will succeed to the assets  liabilities  and other rights and obligations related to the business management of Marubeni's subsidiaries in the information and telecommunications field from Marubeni as set forth in the incorporation-type company separation plan dated January 25  2023. Specifically  1 010 000 shares of Marubeni Information Systems Co.  Ltd.  5 882 shares of Marubeni Network Solutions Inc.  and 46 000 shares of Marubeni IT Solutions Inc. will be transferred to the newly established company. The newly established company will not succeed to any liabilities  employment contracts and other contractual relationships  or rights and obligations based on such contracts from Marubeni. Ôºà7ÔºâAbility to Fulfill Obligations Marubeni has determined that there will be no problems with the prospects for fulfillment of obligations to be borne by the newly established company after the corporate spinoff. 23.

Companies and investors now search for alternatives  including swaps  buybacks and direct payments to bondholders.Some companies like fertilizer producer Uralkali  miner Norilsk Nikel and metals giant Metalloinvest have opted to change bond documentation and pay the debt directly to investors in rubles  the outlet said. The country‚Äôs energy major Gazprom and one of the world‚Äôs largest steel producers  Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works PJSC  have swapped some of their eurobonds for ruble debt.Gazprom Deputy Chairman Famil Sadygov told Bloomberg that replacement bonds were ‚Äúthe most reliable way‚Äù to service debt given the restrictions on financial infrastructure. He noted that holdings of ten of the bonds have already been substituted and another 12 will be replaced by the end of March  adding that Gazprom pays coupons on both the swapped Russian bonds and the remaining international bonds.Following EU sanctions  Europe‚Äôs two major central depositories ‚Äì Euroclear and Clearstream ‚Äì have only been processing transactions verified by paying agents. The clearing houses have been reluctant to process corporate actions  forcing companies to find ways to bypass European depositories.Companies have realized that sanctions have disrupted so many processes needed to keep bonds that it‚Äôs become necessary to take them out of the market.A portfolio manager at Armbrok investment company  Dmitry Dorofeev  told Bloomberg that ‚Äúin a couple of months everything is going to be bought out‚Äù by local investors  adding that ‚ÄúRussian companies will replace bonds and return to Russia.‚ÄùRussia‚Äôs international corporate bond market declined by about $12.7 billion from $85.6 billion since the imposition of Ukraine-related sanctions on Moscow  according to the outlet.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,negative,0.0,0.06,0.94,True,English,"['Russian companies', 'new ways', 'debt', 'Bloomberg', 'Gazprom Deputy Chairman Famil Sadygov', 'two major central depositories', 'international corporate bond market', 'energy major Gazprom', 'metals giant Metalloinvest', 'largest steel producers', 'Steel Works PJSC', 'Armbrok investment company', 'critical financial operations', 'remaining international bonds', 'bond documentation', 'corporate actions', 'European depositories', 'financial processes', 'financial infrastructure', 'unsanctioned ones', 'Wall Street', 'large number', 'direct payments', 'fertilizer producer', 'Norilsk Nikel', 'Magnitogorsk Iron', 'reliable way', 'paying agents', 'clearing houses', 'many processes', 'portfolio manager', 'Dmitry Dorofeev', 'business section', 'servicing bonds', 'replacement bonds', 'Russian bonds', 'Western sanctions', 'EU sanctions', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'outstanding debt', 'ruble debt', 'biggest companies', 'local investors', 'Russian companies', 'firms', 'eurobonds', 'denomination', 'outlet', 'Bloomberg', 'Monday', 'Restrictions', 'borrower', 'alternatives', 'swaps', 'buybacks', 'bondholders', 'Uralkali', 'miner', 'rubles', 'country', 'world', 'holdings', 'end', 'March', 'coupons', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'transactions', 'ways', 'couple', 'months', 'everything', 'Moscow', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-01-25,2023-01-26,rt.com

Only services in China and its platform for governments were not hit.By late morning Azure said most customers should have seen services resume after a full recovery of the Microsoft Wide Area Network (WAN).An outage of Azure  which has 15 million corporate customers and over 500 million active users  according to Microsoft data  can impact multiple services and create a domino effect as almost all of the world‚Äôs largest companies use the platform.Businesses have become increasingly dependent on online platforms after the pandemic caused a shift to more employees working from home.Earlier  Microsoft said it had determined a network connectivity issue was occurring with devices across the Microsoft WAN. This impacts connectivity between clients on the internet to Azure  as well as connectivity between services in data centres  it said.Microsoft later tweeted that it had rolled back a network change that it believed was causing the issue and was using ‚Äúadditional infrastructure to expedite the recovery process‚Äù.Microsoft did not disclose the number of users affected by the disruption  but data from outage tracking website Downdetector showed thousands of incidents across continents.The Downdetector site tracks outages by collating status reports from various sources including users.Microsoft‚Äôs cloud business had helped shore up its fiscal second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. It forecast third-quarter revenue in its so-called intelligent cloud business would be $21.7 billion to $22 billion despite worries that the lucrative cloud segment for big tech companies could be hit hard as customers look to cut spending.Azure‚Äôs share of the cloud computing market rose to 30% in 2022  trailing Amazon‚Äôs AWS  according to estimates from BofA Global Research.Microsoft joined other big tech companies in turning to layoffs to ride out the weaker economy  announcing last week it was cutting over 10 000 jobs.Its shares were down 2.4% in pre-market trading.Outages of Big Tech platforms are not uncommon as several companies ranging from Google to Meta have seen service disruptions. Azure  the second largest cloud services provider after Amazon  faced outages last year.We're investigating an issue in which some users are experiencing delays or connection issues when accessing the Exchange Online service. Please see EX394347 in the admin center for more information. ‚Äî Microsoft 365 Status (@MSFT365Status) June 21  2022During the outage  users faced problems in exchanging messages  joining calls or using any features of Teams application. Many users took to Twitter to share updates about the service disruption  with #MicrosoftTeams trending as a hashtag on the social media site.Microsoft Teams  used by more than 280 million people globally  forms an integral part of daily operations for businesses and schools  which use the service to make calls  schedule meetings and organise their workflow.There were few signs of significant disruption at major UK-based financial services firms  where multiple messaging applications offered by providers like Movius and Symphony are used alongside Microsoft Teams to connect bankers with clients  and office-based staff with colleagues working remotely.Two London-based sources  working at two major global banks  said they hadn‚Äôt even noticed a problem.Deutsche Boerse Group  which operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange  said there had been no impact on trading.

The job cuts are taking place over a 12 month-period and about 15 locations will be affected  he said.‚ÄúThe reality is that the macro environment has become more difficult and has changed a lot ‚Äù Van Dijk said. ‚ÄúThis also means that the cost of capital has changed a lot  as interest rates go up and risk premiums also go up.‚ÄùVan Dijk declined to say how many people would lose their jobs. Prosus employed 30 000 people globally at the end of March last year  according to an earnings report  but these roles are spread across corporate hubs and a range of businesses the e-commerce group invests in and operates  including in classified advertising  food delivery and internet payments.Naspers shares closed 1.7% lower in Johannesburg on Wednesday  and Prosus declined 0.2% at 5:15 p.m. in Amsterdam.Companies from Amazon.com Inc. to Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google have recently announced staff reductions after years of growth  as they seek to lower costs and improve profitability. The tech sector announced 97 171 job cuts in 2022  up 649% compared to the previous year  according to consulting firm Challenger  Gray & Christmas Inc.Prosus will also seek to cut costs at the more than 80 companies it has invested in  although those efforts have different timelines and scales  according to Van Dijk. The company has already closed some offices and made cuts at others  he said. The Euronext-listed firm previously closed its iFood business in Colombia and its autos business in Peru and Ecuador.Story continuesThe measures should help Prosus become profitable by the first half of 2025  according to Van Dijk.The e-commerce firm has been working on narrowing the discount between the sum of its parts and its stake in China‚Äôs Tencent Holdings Ltd. for years  with both Prosus and its Cape Town-based parent Naspers having taken a number of steps to address the problem.These include the spinoff of its African PayTV business  the creation of Prosus through the Euronext-listing of its internet holdings  a share swap between Naspers and Prosus  and a number of share buybacks that are ongoing.Tencent  in which Prosus is the largest investor  has already announced job cuts in recent months.

Pursuant to the amendment  Negma agrees to subscribe to up to EUR 4 million (1 600 bonds) in three tranches to be called at Oxurion‚Äôs discretion. The initial funding program totaled EUR 30 million in two parts  and pursuant to the amendment  Oxurion and Negma have mutually agreed to wind-down the funding program after the completion of the first part  which reduces the total funding under the funding program to EUR 15 million. Negma has waived the liquidity requirement and agreed to a reduced cool down period of 15 trading days  allowing Oxurion to access the full EUR 4 million over less than two months starting in February 2023 (provided the other terms and conditions of the agreement and the bonds are met).While Oxurion continues to carefully manage its cash requirements  the Negma funding alone is not sufficient to finish Oxurion‚Äôs ongoing KALAHARI Phase 2  Part B clinical trial. Oxurion therefore continues to seek additional funding through debt  equity  or non-dilutive funding to support the KALAHARI trial. The KALAHARI trial is evaluating THR-149  Oxurion‚Äôs novel therapeutic for second line therapy  against market leader aflibercept  for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME) for the 40-50% of DME patients that respond suboptimally to standard of care anti-VEGF therapy.

The decision follows a positive opinion from the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has previously granted ODD and Fast Track Designation to both PXL770 and PXL065 for the treatment of ALD.These molecules have separate and distinct mechanisms of action. PXL770 is a novel  first-in-class direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator. PXL065 is a novel  proprietary deuterium-stabilized R-stereoisomer of pioglitazone which exerts effects via multiple non-genomic pathways engaged by thiazolidinedione molecules. Both compounds are preparing to enter into Phase 2a clinical Proof-of-Concept (POC) biomarker studies in ALD patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) as soon as possible  subject to financing.‚ÄúOrphan Drug Designation in adrenoleukodystrophy for both PXL770 and PXL065 further strengthens the value of these clinical assets where we are preparing to initiate Phase 2 proof-of-concept studies  pending additional financing‚Äù  noted Thomas Kuhn  CEO of Poxel. ‚ÄúWe are in active discussions to restructure our current debt obligations and secure the funding to execute our strategy in rare metabolic diseases‚Äù.Orphan Drug Designation (ODD)ODD in the European Union (EU) is granted by the European Commission based on a positive opinion issued by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Orphan Medical Products (COMP). To qualify for ODD from the European Commission  a product candidate must be intended to treat  prevent  or diagnose a life-threatening or chronically debilitating disease that does not affect more than 5 in 10 000 people across the EU. In addition  there must be sufficient clinical or non-clinical data to suggest the product candidate may produce clinically relevant outcomes  and grounds to indicate it can provide a significant benefit over any currently authorized products. Receiving an orphan drug designation from the European Commission provides companies with certain benefits and incentives including clinical protocol assistance  access to a centralized marketing authorization procedure valid in all EU member states  reduced regulatory fees  and ten years of market exclusivity upon receipt of marketing authorization in the EU. The availability of market exclusivity is intended to encourage the development of medicines for rare diseases by protecting them from competition from similar medicines with similar indications  which cannot be marketed during the exclusivity period.About ALDX-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an orphan neurometabolic disease caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene which encodes for a key protein that is required for metabolism of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) by peroxisomes (cellular organelles). ALD is the most common leukodystrophy with a prevalence similar to hemophilia ‚Äì up to 1/10 000 individuals in the general population have ALD [https://rarediseases.org]. Forms of this disease include cerebral ALD (C-ALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) which is the most common form ‚Äì typically occurring in adolescence through adulthood. AMN is characterized by chronic and progressive distal axonopathy involving the long tracts of the spinal cord and to a lesser extent the peripheral nerves resulting in progressive stiffness and weakness in the legs  impaired gait and balance  incontinence  and loss of sensation. Nearly all men with a diagnosis of ALD will develop AMN  and many women also present with features of AMN with a later onset. C-ALD is characterized by inflammatory demyelination of cells in the brain and typically afflicts children  but many men with AMN may also develop cerebral disease; these white matter brain lesions lead to severe neurologic deficits and death. There are no approved medicines for ALD (other than glucocorticoid supplements for associated adrenal insufficiency). C-ALD when first detected in early childhood  can be treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. HSCT is currently limited to early stage of C-ALD and this procedure is at risk of severe adverse reactions.About Poxel SAPoxel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for chronic serious diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and rare disorders. For the treatment of NASH  PXL065 (deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone) met its primary endpoint in a streamlined Phase 2 trial (DESTINY-1). In rare diseases  development of PXL770  a first-in-class direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator  is focused on the treatment of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). TWYMEEG¬Æ (Imeglimin)  Poxel‚Äôs first-in-class product that targets mitochondrial dysfunction  is marketed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Japan by Sumitomo Pharma and Poxel expects to receive royalties and sales-based payments.

Operating margin: Headline PBIT/Gross profit.Didier Chabassieu  Chairman of the Management Board  stated  ‚ÄúHighCo‚Äôs performance in 2022 is in line with expectations  with slight growth in gross profit (up 0.8%). Last year  we focused on accelerating the growth of our Mobile businesses (up 12.2%)  bringing the share of Digital business to two-thirds of the Group‚Äôs total gross profit. This business growth  combined with sound cost control  has enabled us to deliver very strong operating profitability (21%) and recommend a record-high dividend payout of ‚Ç¨0.40 per share. In a context of high inflation  our teams are working even more closely with our clients to help then in overcoming new challenges.‚ÄùStory continuesSLIGHT BUSINESS GROWTH IN 2022 DRIVEN BY THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF MOBILEAs anticipated  HighCo showed stable business activity in Q4 2022  with gross profit of ‚Ç¨20.04 M (up 0.2%).The Group‚Äôs businesses showed slight growth for FY 2022  up 0.8% to ‚Ç¨77.16 m  with:Double-digit growth in Mobile (up 12.2%);Number of coupons cleared unchanged;Drop in the management of traditional promotions;Downturn in marketing and communication consulting.Digital business was up 1% for FY 2022. Its share in total gross profit rose very slightly to 67% in 2022.Offline businesses held up well over the year (up 0.5%).The Group‚Äôs revenue for FY 2022 came to ‚Ç¨146.4 m.Growth in France of 1.5%FRANCEGross Profit (in ‚Ç¨ M) 2022/2021Change% Totalgross profit2022 2021 Q1 16.14 15.98 +1.0% 85.9% Q2 17.05 16.50 +3.4% 87.4% Q3 16.46 16.30 +1.0% 87.5% Q4 17.79 17.66 +0.7% 88.8% 12-month total 67.44 66.45 +1.5% 87.4%In France  Q4 2022 gross profit rose 0.7% to ‚Ç¨17.79 M.As a result  French business activity grew 1.5% for FY 2022  accounting for 87.4% of the Group‚Äôs gross profit. The main reasons for this growth are: double-digit growth in Mobile businesses (up 11%)  the rise in volumes of coupons cleared (up 2%)  while the management of traditional promotions and the marketing and communication consulting businesses declined.Digital businesses grew 1.7% over the year  and their share increased slightly to account for more than two-thirds of gross profit (67.6%). This growth in Digital stems directly from Mobile activities  which represent 25% of business in France.Impacted by the loss of a marketing and communication consulting client  offline businesses nevertheless grew 1.1% over the year.International business fell 3.6%INTERNATIONALGross Profit (in ‚Ç¨ M) 2022/2021Change% Totalgross profit2022 2021 Q1 2.65 2.61 +1.8% 14.1% Q2 2.46 2.71 -9.5% 12.6% Q3 2.35 2.42 -2.7% 12.5% Q4 2.25 2.34 -3.7% 11.2% 12-month total 9.71 10.07 -3.6% 12.6%In International business  Q4 2022 gross profit decreased 3.7% to ‚Ç¨2.25 M.For the full year 2022  International business fell 3.6% to ‚Ç¨9.71 M  accounting for 12.6% of the Group‚Äôs gross profit. The share of Digital in International businesses represented 62.8% of gross profit.In Belgium  gross profit was down by 7.3%  impacted by the sharp decline in the number of discount coupons cleared (down 18%) and the sharp slowdown in promotion management.With double-digit growth (up 25.8%)  all in digital  business in Other countries (Spain and Italy) is strong and now accounts for 1.9% of the Group‚Äôs gross profit.2022 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONSBased on the year-end closing in progress  slight business growth combined with very sound cost control shows a further increase in headline PBIT. The Group consequently estimates operating margin at 21%  for an increase of 70 basis points  i.e. 20 basis points higher than guidance (2021 operating margin: 20.3%).Due to the performance of Belgian businesses in 2022  medium-term forecasts for the geographical segment have been lowered. Despite steady profitability  partial goodwill impairment is expected to be recognised at 31 December 2022. The impairment would have no impact on the Group‚Äôs annual cash flow or its net cash position.In light of the Group‚Äôs expected results and solid financial position  the Management Board plans to maintain its policy of high shareholder returns:by recommending that the Supervisory Board propose a record-high dividend payout of ‚Ç¨0.40 per share at the next General Meeting  with a further sharp increase of 25% (‚Ç¨0.32 per share paid in 2022 for FY 2021);and by moving forward with its share buyback programme (2022: ‚Ç¨1.68 m  up 28.2% from 2021).2022 annual earnings will be released on 28 March after market close.

Agricultural commodity prices have dipped slightly from their spring 2022 peak but remain high  boosting order intake.SUGAR BEET HARVESTING up 10.5%Although this quarter is not representative for this activity subject to seasonal trends  first-quarter sales showed sustained double-digit growth  in line with Q4 2021‚Äì2022. Sales were driven by new machines  in particular the first sales of the Terra Dos 5  the latest generation of sugar beet harvesters.LEISURE down 19.3%The garden equipment market declined in the Group‚Äôs three main operating regions (primarily in the United Kingdom and  to a lesser extent  in France and Italy). After a challenging 2022  marked by a fall in demand  periods of hot weather  water restrictions and increased inventories at dealers  this quarter‚Äôs sales were nevertheless comparable to Q1 2019. There was an unfavorable basis of comparison  as sales in the first quarter of the previous year were generally higher than usual  in line with the post-COVID surge in this business.The EXEL Yachting business remained broadly stable during the quarter  a period that is not very representative of the business  given its seasonal nature.Story continuesINDUSTRY up 4.8%The trend of the previous year was confirmed in industrial spraying  with stable activity overall  marked by a slight decline in demand in Europe  but offset by continuing robust demand in Asia and North America. With regard to technical hoses  volumes remained low as a result of a decline in demand since the summer of 2022 and destocking at customers‚Äô at the end of the year.OutlookAGRICULTURAL SPRAYINGAgricultural commodity prices are expected to remain high  which will continue to drive machine replacement.Despite the uncertainty surrounding the Russia-Ukraine conflict  our business in the region is thriving  in compliance with the international regulations and with strict controls on customer receipts.The order book remains solid for the coming quarters.The business is maintaining rigorous discipline with regard to selling prices in line with the impact of inflation on costs.Commercialization of TRAXX  an autonomous high-clearance tractor  and 3S Spot Spray Sensor¬Æ  our sensor-based ultra-localized spraying solution for large-crops has begun and will gain momentum over the coming months. Both are major innovations resulting from the work of EXXACT Robotics  our pooled research center dedicated to agricultural equipment. These developments are consistent with our CSR policy.SUGAR BEET HARVESTERSGiven the announced surge in beet prices to levels advantageous to farmers  sales of new machines are expected to remain strong in 2022‚Äì2023 and benefit from certain opportunities in Russia.LEISUREAs for the Garden activity  despite an unfavorable basis of comparison  the start of the year is headed in the right direction  with higher sales expected in the second quarter.The D√ºsseldorf boat show and exhibition at the end of January 2023 will provide an opportunity for EXEL Yachting to assess the strength of demand for the year to come.INDUSTRYAsia and North America are expected to remain the drivers of volumes growth.Limited improvement expected in the automotive sector  but changes to models and electrification are driving investment among manufacturers.A new sales and marketing structure has been implemented in the technical hoses business.Yves Belegaud  Chief Executive Officer of the EXEL Industries Group:‚ÄúIn an uncertain global economic environment that continues to be affected by component shortages  the strong increase in our first-quarter 2022‚Äì2023 sales reflects the solid growth capacity of EXEL Industries.

ESA is working closely with the European Commission to ensure that space benefits EU citizens and to foster a strong and resilient European space economy.""ESA and the EU have been partners in European space for decades. ESA designed and developed the EU's Galileo system - with its 28-satellite constellation and its global ground stations - that together provide a highly accurate  guaranteed global positioning service under civilian control  as well as more than 30 EU Copernicus Earth observation satellites that deliver data to improve the management of the environment  understand and mitigate the effects of climate change  and ensure civil security. ESA has also created the EU's European satellite navigation system for aircraft.Cyberattacks and geopolitics threaten today's increasingly digital world  leading to the disruption of essential supplies such as power and water. In response  ESA has started work on supporting the EU's new flagship space programme - a highly secure  satellite-enabled connectivity system called Iris2 that will promote digital autonomy and provide a strategic asset for the EU.Javier Benedicto  ESA Director of Navigation and Acting Director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications  will tell the conference how ESA will work with space companies in the EU to deliver the Iris2 constellation. The satellites and their ground stations are expected to be operational by the end of 2027  based on contracts to be signed in 2024.He will also outline how ESA is developing the new generation of the EU's Galileo navigation satellites that will support European autonomy and resilience.Simonetta Cheli  ESA Director of Earth Observation  will highlight how ESA can support the evolution and modernisation of the EU's Copernicus Earth observation satellites. Advanced use of Copernicus data and information services will support better policy definition  improved planning  increased transparency and accountability  enabling Europe to achieve the ambitious goal of becoming the first net-zero continent by 2050.Geraldine Naja  ESA Director of Commercialisation  Industry and Procurement  will speak about how ESA is supporting the development of European space innovation  technology and skills.Today the European space stock index - an index of European space-based companies that are currently listed on the stock market - will be launched. The index enables investors and people working in finance to monitor the financial performance of European space companies. It was developed in a partnership between ESA  the European Commission and Euronext  which operates regulated exchanges in Belgium  France  Ireland  Italy  the Netherlands  Norway and Portugal.David Parker  ESA Director of Human and Robotic Exploration  will describe ESA's ambitious plans for space exploration alongside Daniel Neuenschwander  ESA Director of Space Transportation.ESA Astronaut Samatha Cristoforetti will also address the event and speak about the new frontiers of exploration from the Moon to Mars and beyond in a panel session that also includes Eric Morel  ESA's Director of European  Legal and International Matters.Finally Rolf Densing  ESA Director of Operations  will speak on space traffic management for Europe's safe  secure and sustainable use of space  while Massimo Mercati  Head of the ESA Security Office  will address how space assets and services can help with cybersecurity.ESA has also produced a series of images that show how the agency works closely with the EU that are being displayed at the conference.Related Links15th European Space ConferenceThe latest information about the Commercial Satellite IndustryThanks for being there;We need your help.

This sale was the result of the integrated strategy of development  construction and maintenance for third parties.The increase was +6% at constant exchange rates (and +17% without the disposal of VSM2 and VSM4). The Brazilian real continued to appreciate in 2022 with an average EUR/BRL rate of 5.4 in 2022 compared with 6.4 in 2021.In 2022  Voltalia benefited from the commissioning of a total of 442 MW  including SSM1-2 (320 MW) in Brazil  South Farm (49.9 MW) in the UK  Stavria (12 MW) in Greece and Carri√®re des Plaines (8.2 MW) in France  as well as the 46 MW growth of Helexia's solar rooftops in Europe (in France  Portugal and Italy). In total  the capacity of plants in operation increased by +39% from 1 129 to 1 571 MW between the end of 2021 and the end of 2022  while the capacity of plants under construction increased by +76% over the same period  from 580 to 1 022 MW.On 31 December 2022  production reached 3.7 TWh  compared to 4.1 TWh on 31 December 2021. This decrease is explained on the one hand by the sale of the VSM2 and VSM4 wind power plants in Brazil ((which had produced 0.6 TWh in 2021)  and on the other hand by lower wind and solar resources than in 2021.The increase in revenues (+18%) in a context of lower production (-13%) reflects an increase in the average selling price per MWh in 2022 and is explained by: (i) the contractual indexation of selling prices to inflation for 83% of revenues in 2021  (ii) the replacement of plants with low prices per MWh by projects with higher tariffs  and (iii) the strengthening of the Brazilian real.The year was also marked by a sustained commercial dynamic with a 3.6-fold increase in the volume of long-term electricity sales contracts won in 2022 compared to 2021  from 310 to 1 128 megawatts. The bulk of the volumes won are represented by solar  ground-mounted or rooftop  and corporate PPAs (long-term contracts that link the producer  a Voltalia power plant  directly to the end consumer of the electricity  a large company)8.Q4 2022 revenues from Energy Sales reach ‚Ç¨74.3 million  up +34% (+19% at constant exchange rates) compared to Q4 2021.Quarterly revenues increase due to the higher average selling price per MWh compared to Q4 2021  while quarterly production  at 1.2 TWh  is almost stable compared to Q4 2021: new capacities commissioned have compensated for the exit of the VSM2 and VSM4 projects and the lower resource.By country:In Brazil  revenues benefited from the production of the new SSM1-2 solar plant commissioned in the course of 2022  and from the strengthening of the Brazilian real  but no longer benefited from the production of VSM2 and VSM4 which contributed until the end of November 2021  when they were sold. Q4 2022 was also characterised by less favourable wind conditions than a year earlier;In France  revenue growth was mainly due to the commissioning of a new solar power plant (Carri√®res des Plaines) and the growth of Helexia;In the United Kingdom  revenues benefited from the commissioning of the South Farm solar power plant (49.9 MW) and the Hallen battery storage unit (32 MW / 32 MWh);In the other countries (Belgium  Portugal  Spain  Italy  Greece  Jordan and Egypt)  the contribution of solar energy has been strengthened  in particular by the continued ramp-up of Helexia.SERVICESRevenues in 2022 from Services (internal and external) reach ‚Ç¨386.5 million  up +47% (+45% at constant exchange rates) compared to 2021. Internal revenues (eliminated in consolidation) were up +77% at ‚Ç¨129.1 million  while with third-party customers increased by +35% to 257.4 million euros. The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment grew by +50% to reach ‚Ç¨353.8 million  and the Operation & Maintenance segment by +19% to reach ‚Ç¨32.7 million.Q4 2022 revenues from Services (internal and external) reach ‚Ç¨146.2 million  up +31% (+30% at constant exchange rates) compared to Q4 2021. Revenues from third-party customers decreased (-13%) while internal revenues (eliminated in consolidation) increased 3.3 times. The analysis by segment shows the following developments:The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment posted revenues of ‚Ç¨136.5 million  up +28% at current exchange rates (+27% at constant exchange rates). The segment's internal revenues are multiplied by x2.7  reflecting in particular the dynamics of internal demand for the construction of new power plants  while revenues for third-party customers are down -19%. External Development revenues were lower compared to Q4 2021  which had benefited from the sale of the VSM2 and VSM4 power plants. Other revenue from third-party customers increased. Indeed  Construction is performing well  particularly in Portugal and Greece  as is Equipment Procurement  which continues to be very dynamic  particularly in Italy  Portugal and the United Kingdom.The Operations-Maintenance segment reports revenues of ‚Ç¨9.6 million  up +40% compared to Q4 2021 (+36 at constant exchange rates). Third party customers represent 56% of the segment's revenues.Revenue eliminations for the year 2022 and Q4 2022 amount to respectively ‚Ç¨129.1 million (+77% at current exchange rates and +74% at constant exchange rates) and ‚Ç¨67.3 million (x3.3 at current and constant exchange rates)  reflecting the strong increase in internal services for the benefit of the plants under construction and operation owned by Voltalia.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (SELECTED)Renault Group signs a 350 MW solar electricity supply contract to support its energy transition9The 15-year contract is the largest corporate renewable electricity supply contract (Corporate PPA) ever signed in France by a company.

The job cuts will take place over the next year and about 15 locations will be affected  he said.‚ÄúThe reality is that the macro environment has become more difficult and has changed a lot "" Van Dijk said. ‚ÄúThis also means that the cost of capital has changed a lot  as interest rates go up and risk premiums also go up.""Van Dijk declined to say how many people would lose their jobs. Prosus employed 30 000 people globally at the end of March last year  according to an earnings report  but these roles are spread across corporate hubs and a range of businesses the e-commerce group invests in and operates  including in classified advertising  food delivery and internet payments.Companies from Amazon. com Inc. to Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google have recently announced staff reductions after years of growth  as they seek to lower costs and improve profitability. The tech sector announced 97 171 job cuts in 2022  up 649% compared to the previous year  according to consulting firm Challenger  Gray & Christmas Inc.Prosus will also seek to cut costs at the more than 80 companies it has invested in  although those efforts have different timelines and scales  according to Van Dijk. The company has already closed some offices and made cuts at others  he said. The Euronext-listed firm previously closed its iFood business in Colombia and its autos business in Peru and Ecuador.The measures should help Prosus become profitable by the first half of 2025  according to Van Dijk.The e-commerce firm has been working on narrowing the discount between the sum of its parts and its stake in China‚Äôs Tencent Holdings Ltd. for years  with both Prosus and its Cape Town-based parent Naspers having taken a number of steps to address the problem.These include the spinoff of its African PayTV business  the creation of Prosus through the Euronext-listing of its internet holdings  a share swap between Naspers and Prosus  and a number of share buybacks that are ongoing.Tencent  in which Prosus is the largest investor  has already announced job cuts in recent months.

DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who are not resident in Guernsey or the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal requirements. It is the responsibility of any DCAC Ordinary Shareholder wishing to make a tender to satisfy himself  herself or itself as to the full observance of the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in connection with the Tender Offer  including the obtaining of any governmental  exchange control or other consents which may berequired  the compliance with other necessary formalities and the payment of any transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due insuch jurisdiction. Any such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder will be responsible for payment of any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments due by whomsoever payable and the Company and any person acting on its behalf shall be fully indemnified and heldharmless by such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder for any such transfer or other taxes or other requisite payments such person may be required to pay. No steps have been taken to authorise the extending of the Tender Offer in any territory outside Guernsey or the Netherlands.10.2 The provisions of this paragraph and any other terms of the Tender Offer relating to shareholders outside Guernsey and the Netherlands may be waived  varied or modified as regards specific DCAC Ordinary Shareholders or on a general basis by the Company.10.3 The provisions of this paragraph 10 supersede any terms of the Tender Offer which may be inconsistent with it.10.4 All DCAC Ordinary Shareholders wishing to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares in the Tender Offer should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal or regulatory requirements. If you are in any doubt about your position  you should consult your professional adviser in the relevant territory.PART IV ‚Äì RISK FACTORSPrior to deciding whether or not to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should carefully consider this Tender Document in its entirety  as well as the section ""Risk Factors"" in the DCAC IPO Prospectus and the risk factors discussed in the section ""Risk Factors"" in the Shareholders Circular dated 20 December 2022 (the ""Circular"").The risks described below have emerged or changed in light of the Tender Offer. The occurrence of any of the risks below could have a material adverse effect on the Tender Offer and on the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares.All of these risk factors and events are contingencies that may or may not occur. A number of these risks described below may occur simultaneously. The order in which these risks are presented is not necessarily an indication of the likelihood of the risks actually materialising  of the potential significance of the risks or of the scope of any potential negative impact to the Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should carefully consider all of the risk factors set out in this Part IV.Although the Company believes that the risks described below are the material risks concerning the Tender Offer  they are not the only risks relating to the Tender Offer. Other risks  events  facts or circumstances not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial could  individually or cumulatively  prove to be important and may have a significant negative impact on the Tender Offer and the value of an investment in DCAC Ordinary Shares.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders can only tender up to 95% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will consequently retain 5% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares.Under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders can only tender up to 95% of their shareholding in the Company. As a result  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will in any case retain 5% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares and remain DCAC Ordinary Shareholder in the Company for the remainder of their shareholding. Other than through the Stub Tender Offer  which is  at the date of this Tender Document still subject to approval by an extraordinary general meeting of the Company and which is only available for DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tendered their full entitlement of DCAC Ordinary Shares under this Tender Offer  there is no certainty that DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will be able to sell or otherwise dispose of their Remaining Holding  should they so wish.As the Sponsor may not tender its DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer and/or other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may decide not to tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may experience immediate and substantial dilution of their shareholding in the Company.The Sponsor may (or may not) tender its DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer. In addition  other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may decide not to tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares. As a result  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tender 95% or some other significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may experience an immediate and substantial dilution of their shareholding in the Company  causing the Sponsor and/or such other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders to obtain increased voting power  thereby increasing their respective influence over all matters requiring DCAC Ordinary Shareholder approval and decreasing your influence over matters presented to the DCAC Ordinary Shareholders for approval  including  subject to the Amended Articles  approval of a future business combination.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who tender their DCAC Ordinary Shares may suffer from reduced value or proceeds in future.Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares will experience an immediate and substantial dilution of their shareholding in the Company  so that the Sponsor and other DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will obtain an increased proportion of the economic value of the Company. Whilst there is no guarantee of future success  such tendering DCAC Ordinary Shareholder may accordingly suffer reduced overall value compared to those DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender their DCAC Ordinary Shares.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders cannot withdraw their tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares without the written consent of the Company or once their tender has become unconditional.Each DCAC Ordinary Shareholder who tenders or procures the tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares will be deemed to have agreed that  in consideration of the Company to process his tender  such DCAC Ordinary Shareholder will not revoke its tender or its DCAC Ordinary Shares without the prior consent of the Company. Once tendered  a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder can therefore not withdraw its tender under the Tender Offer  unless the Company consents to such withdrawal.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares will be locked.As of tendering DCAC Ordinary Shares  all such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares will be locked. During this period  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will not be able to (re)sell  pledge  encumber or otherwise transfer such tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares or any rights related thereto.The Tender Offer is subject to certain conditions and the Board may decide to postpone or terminate the Tender Offer at any time prior to the purchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer as a result of which DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share at a later point in time or not at all.The Tender Offer is subject to the conditions that (a) there has been no Material Adverse Change nor Force Majeure Event  (b) the Board being satisfied that the Company has in its control or to its order the aggregate of the Offer Price for all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares  the aggregate of the Offer Price previously credited to the Escrow Account  (c) the Board continuing to be satisfied that that the Company will  immediately following the purchase of all successfully tendered DCAC Ordinary Shares (as if all DCAC Ordinary Shareholders were to tender for acquisition their full entitlement)  satisfy the statutory solvency test prescribed by the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 as amended and (d) the Tender Offer is not terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Tender Offer Document. The Company may at its sole discretion terminate or postpone the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Tender Offer Document  if the Company (acting through the Directors) considers in its reasonable opinion that (a) it has become unlawful  impractical or inappropriate for the Company to fund the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares without materially harming DCAC Ordinary Shareholders as a whole or (b) the completion of the purchase of the DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer would have material adverse fiscal or other consequences (whether by reason of a change in legislation or practice or otherwise) for the Company or its DCAC Ordinary Shareholders taken as a whole if the Tender Offer were to proceed or (c) if the Company will not immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Tender Offer  continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test under the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008  as amended. If these conditions are not met or if the Board decides to delay or terminate the Tender Offer prior to the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share at a later point in time or not at all.The net consideration received by a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder may be less than ¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary ShareThe cash consideration of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share does not include costs relating to a Shareholder‚Äôs broker  bank or other financial intermediary or advisor. Nor is the Company responsible for any taxes  duties or similar imposts suffered by the Shareholder. The net payment per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share received by DCAC Ordinary Shareholders may therefore be lower than the ¬£10.789 repurchase price.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date.The broker  bank or other financial intermediary through which DCAC Ordinary Shares are held may set an earlier deadline for communicating a tender than the Closing Date and such deadline may differ for each individual broker  bank or other financial intermediary. The Company does not have any knowledge on such deadlines and therefore the DCAC Ordinary Shareholder should consult its broker  bank or other financial intermediary in this regard.Any tenders not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Tender Document and in a timely manner may be invalid.Submitting a tender that is not made fully in accordance with the instructions as set out in the Tender Document  may result in an invalid tender and ultimately not being able to tender DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer (thereby also not receiving the cash consideration of ¬£10.789 per tendered DCAC Ordinary Share). DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that none of Van Lanschot Kempen  Admina  the Company or any other person is or will be obliged to give notice of any defects  irregularities  omissions  delays or non-receipts in tenders of DCAC Ordinary Shareholders  and that none of them will incur any liability for failure to give any such notice.The Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase up to 95% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares  and following the Tender Offer you will no longer have a repurchase right  other than potentially through the Stub Tender Offer.The Tender Offer is a one-time offer by the Company to repurchase up to 95% of your DCAC Ordinary Shares. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that the articles of association of the Company no longer provide for a repurchase right and that there is no assurance that the Company will provide for such a repurchase right in the future  other than potentially through the Stub Tender Offer. There is therefore no assurance that DCAC Ordinary Shareholders can have their DCAC Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Company other than through this one-time Tender Offer and the Stub Tender Offer.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender their full entitlement of DCAC Ordinary Shares will not be eligible to use the balance of DCAC Ordinary Shares not so tendered to participate in the Stub Tender OfferThe Company intends  through the Stub Tender Offer  to offer DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Public Warrant Holders the opportunity to tender for repurchase up to 5% of DCAC Ordinary Shares (that are not the subject of and are not tenders for purchase under this Tender Offer) held as at the Record Date (at all times subject to the Stub Tender Offer being limited to 325 000 DCAC Ordinary Shares in aggregate) and all of their DCAC Public Warrants  provided that should DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Warrant Holders decide to tender  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders shall be required to tender their entire holdings of DCAC Public Warrants together with their DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Stub Tender Offer as at the Record Date. DCAC Ordinary Shareholders should note that their decision to offer DCAC Ordinary Shares under this Tender Offer therefore also affects their eligibility to offer DCAC Ordinary Shares under the Stub Tender Offer and that tendering less than their full entitlement of DCAC Ordinary Shares  or nothing at all  will result in their being ineligible to tender such DCAC Ordinary Shares in the Stub Tender Offer.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares may face a significant decrease in net asset value of their shareholdingFollowing the provision and distribution of cash to meet the Tender Offer  a substantial part of DCAC‚Äôs then remaining cash will be applied to settle outstanding liabilities  resulting in limited remaining assets and a decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share. This may in particular affect DCAC Ordinary Shareholders who do not tender a significant portion of their DCAC Ordinary Shares  as they will not receive the repurchase price of ¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary Share for DCAC Ordinary Shares that they do not (successfully) tender. If the Company is wound up or liquidated in the future  the decreased net asset value per DCAC Ordinary Share may result in DCAC Ordinary Shareholders receiving substantially less than ¬£10.25 per DCAC Ordinary Share or nothing at all.There is no guarantee that DCAC will be able to satisfy the statutory solvency test following the acquisition of DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Tender OfferPursuant to section 320 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008  as amended  the repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Tender Offer would be considered to be a distribution for the purposes of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 and therefore the Board must comply with section 303 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 in respect of making distributions  including ensuring satisfaction of the statutory ""solvency test"" as defined in section 527 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 being (in respect of companies that are not ""supervised companies""  like DCAC) that DCAC is able to pay its debts as they become due and that the value of DCAC's assets is greater than the value of its liabilities. There is no guarantee that DCAC will  immediately following the acquisition of the DCAC Ordinary Shares validly tendered in the Tender Offer  meet and/or continue to satisfy the statutory solvency test.The repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares by the Company may result in taxes being imposed on the Company or on DCAC Ordinary Shareholders.The repurchase of DCAC Ordinary Shares by the Company may result in taxes  duties or other imposts being imposed on the Company or on DCAC Ordinary Shareholders as at the date of such repurchase or redemption. The Company is not responsible for any taxes  duties or other imposts that are imposed on a DCAC Ordinary Shareholder and the Company does not intend to make any cash distributions to DCAC Ordinary Shareholders to pay any such taxes  duties or other imposts. The materialisation of this risk may adversely affect the post-tax return for certain DCAC Ordinary Shareholders.DEFINITIONSThe following definitions apply throughout this Tender Document unless the context requires otherwise.""Admina"" means Admina Fund Services Limited;‚ÄúAdmitted Institution‚Äù means the institutions admitted to Euroclear Nederland other than Van Lanschot Kempen  in its capacity as listing  transfer and paying agent to the Company for the DCAC Ordinary Shares held through Euroclear Nederland;""AFM"" means the Dutch Authority for Financial Markets;""Board"" means the board of directors of the Company;‚ÄúClosing Date‚Äù means 16:00 (CET) on 22 February 2023;‚ÄúCompany‚Äù means Disruptive Capital Acquisition Company Limited;‚ÄúDCAC Ordinary Shareholders‚Äù means holders of DCAC Ordinary Shares;""DCAC Ordinary Shares"" means the ordinary shares of ¬£0.0001 each in the capital of the Company;""DCAC Public Warrants"" means the redeemable public warrants issued by the Company;""DCAC Sponsor Warrants"" means the warrants issued to the Sponsor;""DCAC Warrant Holders"" means the holders of DCAC Warrants;""DCAC Warrants"" means the DCAC Public Warrants and DCAC Sponsor Warrants;""Directors"" means the directors of the Company from time to time;""Escrow Account"" means the escrow account opened by the Company;‚ÄúEuroclear Nederland‚Äù means Nederlands Centraal Instituut voor Giraal Effectenverkeer B.V.  the central securities depositary and settlement system in the Netherlands;‚ÄúEuronext Amsterdam‚Äù means Euronext in Amsterdam  the regulated market operated by Euronext Amsterdam N.V.;‚ÄúFinal Settlement Date‚Äù means 24 February 2023  or as soon as practicable thereafter;""Force Majeure Event"" means any circumstance not within the Company's control including  without limitation:(a) acts of God  flood  drought  earthquake or other natural disaster;(b) epidemic or pandemic;(c) terrorist attack  civil war  civil commotion or riots  war  threat of or preparation for war  armed conflict  imposition of sanctions  embargo  or breaking off of diplomatic relations;(d) nuclear  chemical or biological contamination or sonic boom;(e) any law or any action taken by a government or public authority  including without limitation imposing an export or import restriction  quota or prohibition  or failing to grant a necessary licence or consent;(f) collapse of buildings  fire  explosion or accident;(g) any labour or trade dispute  strikes  industrial action or lockouts;(h) non-performance by suppliers or subcontractors; and(i) interruption or failure of a utility service;""Material Adverse Change"" means a material adverse change in the business  assets  properties  liabilities (actual or contingent)  operations  condition (financial or otherwise)  or prospects of the Company and/or the Sponsor  individually  or taken as a whole;‚ÄúOffer Price‚Äù means the offer price for the Tender Offer being ¬£10.789 per repurchased DCAC Ordinary Share;‚ÄúRecord Date‚Äù means 17:40 (CET) on 10 February 2023;‚ÄúRegister‚Äù means the register of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Ordinary Shareholders of the Company;‚ÄúRemaining Holding‚Äù has the meaning given that term in Part II of this Tender Document;""Sponsor"" means Disruptive Capital GP Limited  a non-cellular company limited by shares incorporated in Guernsey under registration number 61432;""Stub Tender Offer"" means the offer by the Company to acquire up to 5% of the DCAC Ordinary Shares not subject to the Tender Offer and all DCAC Warrants;‚ÄúTender Document‚Äù means this document;‚ÄúTender Offer‚Äù means the tender offer by the Company to DCAC Ordinary Shareholders to tender up to 95% of their DCAC Ordinary Shares on the terms and conditions set out in this Tender Document and  where the context admits  any revision or subsequent version  variation  extension or renewal thereof;‚ÄúTender Offer Authority‚Äù means the authority granted by the DCAC Ordinary Shareholders at the Company‚Äôs adjourned extraordinary general meeting held on 18 January 2023 to acquire up to 95 per cent.

Pursuant to the amendment  Negma agrees to subscribe to up to EUR 4 million (1 600 bonds) in three tranches to be called at Oxurion‚Äôs discretion. The initial funding program totaled EUR 30 million in two parts  and pursuant to the amendment  Oxurion and Negma have mutually agreed to wind-down the funding program after the completion of the first part  which reduces the total funding under the funding program to EUR 15 million. Negma has waived the liquidity requirement and agreed to a reduced cool down period of 15 trading days  allowing Oxurion to access the full EUR 4 million over less than two months starting in February 2023 (provided the other terms and conditions of the agreement and the bonds are met).While Oxurion continues to carefully manage its cash requirements  the Negma funding alone is not sufficient to finish Oxurion‚Äôs ongoing KALAHARI Phase 2  Part B clinical trial. Oxurion therefore continues to seek additional funding through debt  equity  or non-dilutive funding to support the KALAHARI trial. The KALAHARI trial is evaluating THR-149  Oxurion‚Äôs novel therapeutic for second line therapy  against market leader aflibercept  for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME) for the 40-50% of DME patients that respond suboptimally to standard of care anti-VEGF therapy. The KALAHARI trial has recruited more than 50% of the patients and topline data is currently expected before the end of 2023.‚ÄúThe urgency for novel therapeutics like THR-149 that could treat DME  the leading cause of blindness in working age adults  remains critical ‚Äù said Tom Graney  CEO of Oxurion. ‚ÄúRecent interim analysis of Part B of our two-part Phase 2 clinical trial of THR-149 indicated that our study should continue. We are on track to have topline results later this year as we advance our approach to developing the next generation standard of care for retinal disorders.‚ÄùAbout OxurionOxurion (Euronext Brussels: OXUR) is a biopharmaceutical company developing next generation standard of care ophthalmic therapies  which are designed to improve and better preserve vision in patients with retinal disorders including diabetic macular edema (DME)  the leading cause of vision loss in working-age people  as well as other conditions. Oxurion intends to play an important role in the treatment of retinal disorders  including the successful development of THR-149  its novel therapeutic for the treatment of DME.

This three-week exercise was organized in December by the US Navy's 5th Fleet in Bahrain to test new autonomous technologies. It is part of the US Navy's plan to establish the world's first autonomous drone fleet  comprising one hundred drones  in the Persian Gulf.The U.S. Navy established Task Force 59 in September 2021 to speed new tech integration across the 5th Fleet  and seek alternative  cost-effective solutions for conducting Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) missions.DriX  Exail's unmanned surface vehicle (USV)  was one of 15 USVs and aerial drones (UAVs) selected to participate in the exercise  which staged an MDA mission. The USVs and UAVs were tasked with gathering data on the surface in order to detect and identify potential threats and communicate with each other using a common system.With its highly hydrodynamic monohull  DriX showed high reliability with excellent seakeeping and speed results  accomplishing its mission of gathering data on the surface and proving its capacity to integrate third party radar and cameras. The ability of DriX to integrate within a military communications network was also successfully proven and the USV further meets requirements in terms of communications redundancy  crucial for minimizing risk during military operations.The success of these trials  which demonstrated the added value that autonomous technologies can bring to the maritime domain  confirms the prospects for large-scale deployment of robotic systems in applications beyond mine-hunting.About Exail TechnologiesExail Technologies is an industrial company specialized in advanced technologies in the fields of autonomous robotics  navigation  aerospace and photonics.

Below is a description of the main contents of the proposal. The Board of Director‚Äôs complete proposal will be made available on the Company‚Äôs website  www.fingerprints.com/egm2023.A. LTIP 202 3The Board of Directors want to implement a long-term incentive program for the Executive management team  other managers  and key employees in order to attract and retain talent over time  increase engagement and performance and to encourage a personal long-term ownership in the Company. Therefore  the Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting approves the implementation of LTIP 2023 for the Executive management team  other managers and key employees within the Company. The Board of Directors has an intention to maintain the long-term incentive plan recurring on an annual basis.Participants will  after a qualifying period  be given the opportunity to  without consideration  receive allotments of Fingerprint Shares (as defined below). Additionally  participants that are part of the Executive management team will also  after a qualifying period  be given the opportunity to  against consideration  exercise call options issued by the Company which entitle to Fingerprint Shares. The number of allotted Fingerprint Shares and options will depend on the fulfilment of a performance requirement.Fingerprint Shares are Class B shares in the Company (‚ÄúFingerprint Shares‚Äù). The term of LTIP 2023 is approximately three years.The LTIP 2023 will be directed towards not more than 50 executive managers  other managers and key employees in the Company.The participants shall be entitled to  after a certain Vesting Period (as defined below)  provided continued employment and dependent on the fulfilment of a performance requirement during the financial years 2023-2025  receive allotment of Fingerprint Shares (‚ÄúPerformance Shares‚Äù). Executive managers will also be offered to  after the Vesting Period (as defined below)  provided continued employment and dependent on the fulfilment of a performance requirement during the financial years 2023-2025  receive allotment of call options (‚ÄúPerformance Options‚Äù).For executive managers  a part of the allotment of Performance Shares and/or Performance Options will also be conditional upon that the participant holds or acquires Fingerprint Shares and locks such shares into LTIP 2023 (‚ÄúSavings Shares‚Äù). Savings Shares can be newly acquired Fingerprint Shares  Fingerprint Shares already held by the participant at the time of the launch of LTIP 2023  or a combination thereof.Performance Shares are Fingerprint Shares and Performance Options are call options issued by the Company which entitle to Fingerprint Shares.The performance requirement is linked to the Company‚Äôs earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization excluding items affecting comparability (‚ÄúAdjusted EBITDA‚Äù). The participant shall not pay any consideration for the allotted Performance Shares and Performance Options.The participant shall have the right to exercise the Performance Options commencing on the Banking Day after the end of the Vesting Period (as defined below) up until the date falling 10 Banking Days after the date of publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2026 (‚ÄúExercise Period‚Äù). However  exercise right during the Exercise Period will be limited to certain periods following the publication of quarterly reports. The exercise price when the participant exercises the Performance Option shall correspond to 235 per cent of the volume-weighted average price according to Nasdaq Stockholm‚Äôs official price list for the Fingerprint Share during the first ten trading days that directly follows the Meeting (the ‚ÄúExercise Price‚Äù). The exercise of the Performance Options may be made by using so called net strike. Customary recalculation of the number of Performance Shares allotted per Savings Share  the Exercise Price as well as of the number of Fingerprint Shares that each Performance Option corresponds to may occur in certain situations.Allotment of Performance Shares and Performance Options will be made during a limited period of time following the date of the publication of the quarterly report for the first quarter of 2026. The period up to this date is referred to as the ‚ÄúVesting Period‚Äù.The Board of Directors shall be authorised to waive and alter these conditions according to circumstances deemed reasonable and in accordance with customary provisions on so-called ‚Äúgood leavers‚Äù and ‚Äúbad leavers‚Äù.In the event of a change of control of the Company or a direct or indirect sale  transfer or other disposal of all or substantially all of the business and assets  the Vesting Period shall be deemed to have completed and the participants shall be entitled to allotment of the Performance Shares and the Performance Options as of the date when the transaction becomes unconditional.In order for the participant to be entitled to receive allotment of Performance Shares and Performance Options  it is assumed that the participant remains an employee of Fingerprint during the full Vesting Period up until allotment and that the Adjusted EBITDA performance requirement is fulfilled. For participants that are part of the Executive management team  allotment of part of the Performance Shares and/or the Performance Options will also be conditional upon that the participant has kept all its Savings Shares for the full duration of the Vesting Period.The program may comprise a maximum of 13 475 000 Fingerprint Shares (in the form of Performance Shares or Performance Options that entitle to Fingerprint Shares). A more detailed breakdown of the distribution between Performance Shares and Performance Options  maximum allotment within different categories of participants  as well as how much of the allocation to participants within the Executive management team that will be conditional upon an own investment  will be presented in the Board of Directors‚Äô complete proposal for resolution  which will be made available on the Company‚Äôs website not later than three weeks before the Meeting.The Board of Directors shall  in accordance with the resolutions by the Meeting set forth herein  be responsible for the detailed design and implementation of LTIP 2023. The Board of Directors may also decide on the implementation of an alternative cash-based incentive for participants in countries where the acquisition of Savings Shares or allotment of Performance Shares and/or Performance Options is not possible  as well as if otherwise considered appropriate. Such alternative incentive shall to the extent practically possible be designed to correspond to the terms of LTIP 2023.

In order to minimize costs for LTIP 2023  the subscription price shall equal the class C share‚Äôs quota value.As the Board of Directors considers that the most cost-effective method of transferring Fingerprint Shares under LTIP 2023 is to transfer Fingerprint Shares owned by the Company  the Board of Directors proposes that the transfer is hedged in this way in accordance with this item B.

Below is a description of the main contents of the proposal. The complete proposal will be made available on the Company‚Äôs website  www.fingerprints.com/egm2023.A. LTIP Board 2023Under item 7 of the agenda for the Meeting  the Board of Directors proposes the implementation of a long-term incentive program for the Executive management team  other managers  and key employees in order to attract and retain talent over time  increase engagement and performance and to encourage a personal long-term ownership in the Company.The Proposer proposes that a similar program is implemented for the Board of Directors in accordance with this item 8 in order to offer the members of the Board of Directors (‚ÄúBoard Members‚Äù) a similar possibility to take part in a value growth in the Fingerprint Share  which is expected to increase the long-term commitment to the Company‚Äôs operation and earnings development and to raise the motivation and sense of belonging with the Company. The Proposer intends to propose that the long-term incentive plan is renewed on an annual basis.Board Members will  after three qualifying periods and assuming an investment of their own in Fingerprint Shares  be given the opportunity to  without consideration  receive allotments of Fingerprint Shares. The number of allotted Fingerprint Shares will depend on the number of Fingerprint Shares that they hold or have acquired and on the fulfilment of a performance requirement.The LTIP Board 2023 is directed towards the current five Board Members of the Company.Participation in the LTIP Board 2023 assumes that the participant holds or acquires Fingerprint Shares and locks such shares into LTIP Board 2023 (‚ÄúSavings Shares‚Äù) up to and including the date of the publication of the quarterly report for the first quarter of 2026 (‚ÄúLock-up Period‚Äù). Savings Shares can be newly acquired Fingerprint Shares  Fingerprint Shares already held by the participant at the time of the launch of LTIP Board 2023  or a combination thereof. For each Savings Share  the participant shall be entitled to  provided that the Savings Shares are held for the full duration of the Lock-up Period and dependent on the fulfilment of a performance requirement during the financial years 2023-2025  receive allotment of Fingerprint Shares (‚ÄúPerformance Shares‚Äù). The amount of Performance Shares that are allotted to each participant shall vest gradually over approximately three years  conditional upon continued assignment in the Company.The performance requirement is linked to the Company‚Äôs earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization excluding items affecting comparability (‚ÄúAdjusted EBITDA‚Äù). The participant shall not pay any consideration for the allotted Performance Shares.Customary recalculation of the number of Performance Shares allotted per Savings Share may occur in certain situations.Allotment of Performance Shares will be made during a limited period of time following the date of the publication of the quarterly report for the first quarter of 2026. The period from the launch of the LTIP Board 2023 up to this date is divided into three vesting periods  where the first assignment vesting period commences upon launch of LTIP Board 2023 and ends the day before the Annual General Meeting 2024  the next assignment vesting period commences on the date of the Annual General Meeting 2024 and ends the day before the Annual General Meeting 2025  and the last assignment vesting period commences on the date of the Annual General Meeting 2025 and ends at the earlier of the day before the Annual General Meeting 2026 and the date of the publication of the quarterly report for the first quarter of 2026 (each period referred to as an ‚ÄúAssignment Vesting Period‚Äù and together as the ‚ÄúFull Vesting Period‚Äù).The total amount of Performance Shares that are allotted to each participant shall be vested in equal parts as of the final date of each Assignment Vesting Period (i.e. approximately 33 percent of the total number of Performance Shares will be vested after each Assignment Vesting Period)  conditional on continued assignment as a member of the Board of Directors in the Company. For example  a participant that is still a Board Member on the day before the Annual General Meeting 2024 will be allowed to keep the Performance Shares vested during that Assignment Vesting Period (i.e. approximately 33 per cent of the maximum allotment)  a participant that is still a Board Member on the day before the Annual General Meeting 2025 will be allowed to keep the Performance Shares vested during the current and previous Assignment Vesting Periods (i.e. approximately 67 per cent of the maximum allotment)  and a participant that is still a Board Member on the earlier of the day before the Annual General Meeting 2026 and the date of the publication of the quarterly report for the first quarter of 2026 will be allowed to keep all Performance Shares vested during the current and previous Assignment Vesting Periods (i.e. 100 per cent of the maximum allotment).The Nomination Committee shall be authorised to waive and alter the vesting conditions according to circumstances deemed reasonable and in accordance with customary provisions on so-called ‚Äúgood leavers‚Äù.In the event of a change of control of the Company or a direct or indirect sale  transfer or other disposal of all or substantially all of the business and assets  the Full Vesting Period shall be deemed to have completed and the participants shall be entitled to allotment of the Performance Shares as of the date when the transaction becomes unconditional.All vested Performance Shares (i.e. independent of the date of vesting) will be allotted following the Full Vesting Period. In order for the participant to be entitled to receive allotment of vested Performance Shares  it is assumed that the Adjusted EBITDA performance requirement is fulfilled and that the participant has kept all its Savings Shares for the full duration of the Lock-Up Period.The maximum allotment of Performance Shares to the participants will be presented in the complete proposal for resolution  which will be made available on the Company‚Äôs website not later than three weeks before the Meeting.The Nomination Committee (excluding any members thereof who also serve on the Board of Directors  as the case may be) shall be responsible for the implementation of  and shall engage an external advisor to handle the implementation and administration of  the LTIP Board 2023 in accordance with the resolutions by the Meeting set forth herein. The Nomination Committee shall have the right to charge the Company with reasonable costs connected to the implementation and administration of the LTIP Board 2023  including the costs for such advisor. The intention is that the LTIP Board 2023 shall be launched as soon as practicable after the General Meeting.In the event that the necessary majority is not obtained for the resolution on hedging measures according to item B below  the Board of Directors may ensure that the Company instead hedges itself against the financial exposure that LTIP Board 2023 is expected to entail by entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer shares in the Company to the participants in LTIP Board 2023. The relevant number of Fingerprint Shares shall correspond to the number of shares proposed to be issued and repurchased under item B below.B.

The Board proposes  on the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee  that the number of Board members be ten (10). However  should any number of the candidates proposed by the Board not be able to attend the Board  the proposed number of Board members shall be decreased accordingly.On the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee  the Board of Directors further proposes that the following current Board members be re-elected as members of the Nokia Board of Directors for a term ending at the close of the next Annual General Meeting: Sari Baldauf  Thomas Dannenfeldt  Lisa Hook  Jeanette Horan  Thomas Saueressig  S√∏ren Skou  Carla Smits-Nusteling and Kai √ñist√§m√∂.

Other remuneration payable to the Board members would remain at an unchanged level.Consequently  on the recommendation of the Board‚Äôs Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee  and in line with the Company‚Äôs Remuneration Policy  the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the annual fees payable for a term ending at the close of the next Annual General Meeting be as follows:‚Ä¢ EUR 440 000 for the Chair of the Board;‚Ä¢ EUR 210 000 for the Vice Chair of the Board;‚Ä¢ EUR 185 000 for each member of the Board;‚Ä¢ EUR 30 000 each for the Chairs of the Audit Committee and the Personnel Committee and EUR 20 000 for the Chair of the Technology Committee as an additional annual fee; and‚Ä¢ EUR 15 000 for each member of the Audit Committee and Personnel Committee and EUR 10 000 for each member of the Technology Committee as an additional annual fee.The Board proposes that in line with the Company‚Äôs Corporate Governance Guidelines  approximately 40% of the annual fee be paid in Nokia shares either purchased from the market on behalf of the Board members or alternatively delivered as treasury shares held by the Company as soon as practicable after the Annual General Meeting. The rest of the annual fee would be paid in cash to cover taxes arising from the remuneration.In addition  the Board of Directors proposes that the meeting fees for Board and Board Committee meetings paid to all Board members remain at the current level.

The meeting fees  travel expenses and other expenses would be paid in cash.Auditor election and remunerationOn the recommendation of the Audit Committee  the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that Deloitte Oy be re-elected as the auditor of the Company for the financial year 2024.It is also proposed that the elected auditor for the financial year 2024 be reimbursed based on the invoice of the auditor and in compliance with the purchase policy approved by the Audit Committee.Authorization to the Board to issue shares and repurchase Company‚Äôs sharesThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorize the Board to resolve to issue in total a maximum of 550 million shares through issuance of shares or special rights entitling to shares under Chapter 10  Section 1 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act in one or more issues during the effective period of the authorization. The Board may issue either new shares or treasury shares held by the Company. Shares and special rights entitling to shares may be issued in deviation from the shareholders‚Äô pre-emptive rights within the limits set by law.

It is proposed that the authorization be effective until 3 October 2024 and terminate the authorization for issuance of shares and special rights entitling to shares resolved at the Annual General Meeting on 5 April 2022.The Board also proposes that the Board be authorized to resolve to repurchase a maximum of 550 million shares. The repurchases would reduce distributable funds of the Company. The shares may be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the shares held by the shareholders (directed repurchase).

Below is a description of the main contents of the proposal. The Board of Director‚Äôs complete proposal will be made available on the Company‚Äôs website  www.fingerprints.com/egm2023. A. LTIP 202 3 The Board of Directors want to implement a long-term incentive program for the Executive management team  other managers  and key employees in order to attract and retain talent over time  increase engagement and performance and to encourage a personal long-term ownership in the Company. Therefore  the Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting approves the implementation of LTIP 2023 for the Executive management team  other managers and key employees within the Company. The Board of Directors has an intention to maintain the long-term incentive plan recurring on an annual basis. Participants will  after a qualifying period  be given the opportunity to  without consideration  receive allotments of Fingerprint Shares (as defined below). Additionally  participants that are part of the Executive management team will also  after a qualifying period  be given the opportunity to  against consideration  exercise call options issued by the Company which entitle to Fingerprint Shares. The number of allotted Fingerprint Shares and options will depend on the fulfilment of a performance requirement. Fingerprint Shares are Class B shares in the Company (‚ÄúFingerprint Shares‚Äù). The term of LTIP 2023 is approximately three years. The LTIP 2023 will be directed towards not more than 50 executive managers  other managers and key employees in the Company. The participants shall be entitled to  after a certain Vesting Period (as defined below)  provided continued employment and dependent on the fulfilment of a performance requirement during the financial years 2023-2025  receive allotment of Fingerprint Shares (‚ÄúPerformance Shares‚Äù). Executive managers will also be offered to  after the Vesting Period (as defined below)  provided continued employment and dependent on the fulfilment of a performance requirement during the financial years 2023-2025  receive allotment of call options (‚ÄúPerformance Options‚Äù). For executive managers  a part of the allotment of Performance Shares and/or Performance Options will also be conditional upon that the participant holds or acquires Fingerprint Shares and locks such shares into LTIP 2023 (‚ÄúSavings Shares‚Äù). Savings Shares can be newly acquired Fingerprint Shares  Fingerprint Shares already held by the participant at the time of the launch of LTIP 2023  or a combination thereof. Performance Shares are Fingerprint Shares and Performance Options are call options issued by the Company which entitle to Fingerprint Shares. The performance requirement is linked to the Company‚Äôs earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization excluding items affecting comparability (‚ÄúAdjusted EBITDA‚Äù). The participant shall not pay any consideration for the allotted Performance Shares and Performance Options. The participant shall have the right to exercise the Performance Options commencing on the Banking Day after the end of the Vesting Period (as defined below) up until the date falling 10 Banking Days after the date of publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2026 (‚ÄúExercise Period‚Äù). However  exercise right during the Exercise Period will be limited to certain periods following the publication of quarterly reports. The exercise price when the participant exercises the Performance Option shall correspond to 235 per cent of the volume-weighted average price according to Nasdaq Stockholm‚Äôs official price list for the Fingerprint Share during the first ten trading days that directly follows the Meeting (the ‚ÄúExercise Price‚Äù). The exercise of the Performance Options may be made by using so called net strike. Customary recalculation of the number of Performance Shares allotted per Savings Share  the Exercise Price as well as of the number of Fingerprint Shares that each Performance Option corresponds to may occur in certain situations. Allotment of Performance Shares and Performance Options will be made during a limited period of time following the date of the publication of the quarterly report for the first quarter of 2026. The period up to this date is referred to as the ‚ÄúVesting Period‚Äù. The Board of Directors shall be authorised to waive and alter these conditions according to circumstances deemed reasonable and in accordance with customary provisions on so-called ‚Äúgood leavers‚Äù and ‚Äúbad leavers‚Äù. In the event of a change of control of the Company or a direct or indirect sale  transfer or other disposal of all or substantially all of the business and assets  the Vesting Period shall be deemed to have completed and the participants shall be entitled to allotment of the Performance Shares and the Performance Options as of the date when the transaction becomes unconditional. In order for the participant to be entitled to receive allotment of Performance Shares and Performance Options  it is assumed that the participant remains an employee of Fingerprint during the full Vesting Period up until allotment and that the Adjusted EBITDA performance requirement is fulfilled. For participants that are part of the Executive management team  allotment of part of the Performance Shares and/or the Performance Options will also be conditional upon that the participant has kept all its Savings Shares for the full duration of the Vesting Period. The program may comprise a maximum of 13 475 000 Fingerprint Shares (in the form of Performance Shares or Performance Options that entitle to Fingerprint Shares). A more detailed breakdown of the distribution between Performance Shares and Performance Options  maximum allotment within different categories of participants  as well as how much of the allocation to participants within the Executive management team that will be conditional upon an own investment  will be presented in the Board of Directors‚Äô complete proposal for resolution  which will be made available on the Company‚Äôs website not later than three weeks before the Meeting. The Board of Directors shall  in accordance with the resolutions by the Meeting set forth herein  be responsible for the detailed design and implementation of LTIP 2023. The Board of Directors may also decide on the implementation of an alternative cash-based incentive for participants in countries where the acquisition of Savings Shares or allotment of Performance Shares and/or Performance Options is not possible  as well as if otherwise considered appropriate. Such alternative incentive shall to the extent practically possible be designed to correspond to the terms of LTIP 2023. The intention is that the Board of Directors shall launch LTIP 2023 as soon as practicable after the Meeting. In the event that the necessary majority is not obtained for the resolution on hedging measures according to item B below  the Board of Directors may ensure that the Company instead hedges itself against the financial exposure that LTIP 2023 is expected to entail by entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer shares in the Company to the participants in LTIP 2023. The relevant number of Fingerprint Shares shall correspond to the number of shares proposed to be issued and repurchased under item B below. B. Hedge for LTIP 2023 in the form of newly issued class C shares etc. The Board of Directors proposes that the implementation of LTIP 2023 shall be made in a cost-effective and flexible manner  and that the undertakings of the Company for delivery of Performance Shares as well as Fingerprint Shares at exercise of the Performance Options and the Company‚Äôs cash-flow for the payment of social fees primarily shall be hedged by a directed issue of convertible and redeemable class C shares. These shares can be repurchased and converted into Fingerprint Shares and transferred in accordance with the following. In order to enable the hedging measures described above  the Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves in accordance with what is mentioned below in this item B  which resolutions shall be resolved upon as one resolution.

Item 8 ‚Äì Shareholder proposal regarding long-term incentive program for the Board of Directors (LTIP Board 2023)  etc. Johan Carlstr√∂m with company (the ‚ÄúProposer‚Äù)  who represent approximately 5.2 per cent of the shares and 18.9 per cent of the votes in the Company  proposes that the Meeting pass a resolution on the implementation of a long-term incentive program 2023 for the Board of Directors of the Company (LTIP Board 2023). Below is a description of the main contents of the proposal. The complete proposal will be made available on the Company‚Äôs website  www.fingerprints.com/egm2023. A. LTIP Board 2023 Under item 7 of the agenda for the Meeting  the Board of Directors proposes the implementation of a long-term incentive program for the Executive management team  other managers  and key employees in order to attract and retain talent over time  increase engagement and performance and to encourage a personal long-term ownership in the Company. The Proposer proposes that a similar program is implemented for the Board of Directors in accordance with this item 8 in order to offer the members of the Board of Directors (‚ÄúBoard Members‚Äù) a similar possibility to take part in a value growth in the Fingerprint Share  which is expected to increase the long-term commitment to the Company‚Äôs operation and earnings development and to raise the motivation and sense of belonging with the Company. The Proposer intends to propose that the long-term incentive plan is renewed on an annual basis. Board Members will  after three qualifying periods and assuming an investment of their own in Fingerprint Shares  be given the opportunity to  without consideration  receive allotments of Fingerprint Shares. The number of allotted Fingerprint Shares will depend on the number of Fingerprint Shares that they hold or have acquired and on the fulfilment of a performance requirement. The LTIP Board 2023 is directed towards the current five Board Members of the Company. Participation in the LTIP Board 2023 assumes that the participant holds or acquires Fingerprint Shares and locks such shares into LTIP Board 2023 (‚ÄúSavings Shares‚Äù) up to and including the date of the publication of the quarterly report for the first quarter of 2026 (‚ÄúLock-up Period‚Äù). Savings Shares can be newly acquired Fingerprint Shares  Fingerprint Shares already held by the participant at the time of the launch of LTIP Board 2023  or a combination thereof. For each Savings Share  the participant shall be entitled to  provided that the Savings Shares are held for the full duration of the Lock-up Period and dependent on the fulfilment of a performance requirement during the financial years 2023-2025  receive allotment of Fingerprint Shares (‚ÄúPerformance Shares‚Äù). The amount of Performance Shares that are allotted to each participant shall vest gradually over approximately three years  conditional upon continued assignment in the Company. The performance requirement is linked to the Company‚Äôs earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization excluding items affecting comparability (‚ÄúAdjusted EBITDA‚Äù). The participant shall not pay any consideration for the allotted Performance Shares. Customary recalculation of the number of Performance Shares allotted per Savings Share may occur in certain situations. Allotment of Performance Shares will be made during a limited period of time following the date of the publication of the quarterly report for the first quarter of 2026. The period from the launch of the LTIP Board 2023 up to this date is divided into three vesting periods  where the first assignment vesting period commences upon launch of LTIP Board 2023 and ends the day before the Annual General Meeting 2024  the next assignment vesting period commences on the date of the Annual General Meeting 2024 and ends the day before the Annual General Meeting 2025  and the last assignment vesting period commences on the date of the Annual General Meeting 2025 and ends at the earlier of the day before the Annual General Meeting 2026 and the date of the publication of the quarterly report for the first quarter of 2026 (each period referred to as an ‚ÄúAssignment Vesting Period‚Äù and together as the ‚ÄúFull Vesting Period‚Äù). The total amount of Performance Shares that are allotted to each participant shall be vested in equal parts as of the final date of each Assignment Vesting Period (i.e. approximately 33 percent of the total number of Performance Shares will be vested after each Assignment Vesting Period)  conditional on continued assignment as a member of the Board of Directors in the Company. For example  a participant that is still a Board Member on the day before the Annual General Meeting 2024 will be allowed to keep the Performance Shares vested during that Assignment Vesting Period (i.e. approximately 33 per cent of the maximum allotment)  a participant that is still a Board Member on the day before the Annual General Meeting 2025 will be allowed to keep the Performance Shares vested during the current and previous Assignment Vesting Periods (i.e. approximately 67 per cent of the maximum allotment)  and a participant that is still a Board Member on the earlier of the day before the Annual General Meeting 2026 and the date of the publication of the quarterly report for the first quarter of 2026 will be allowed to keep all Performance Shares vested during the current and previous Assignment Vesting Periods (i.e. 100 per cent of the maximum allotment). The Nomination Committee shall be authorised to waive and alter the vesting conditions according to circumstances deemed reasonable and in accordance with customary provisions on so-called ‚Äúgood leavers‚Äù. In the event of a change of control of the Company or a direct or indirect sale  transfer or other disposal of all or substantially all of the business and assets  the Full Vesting Period shall be deemed to have completed and the participants shall be entitled to allotment of the Performance Shares as of the date when the transaction becomes unconditional.

Additionally  participants that are part of the Executive management team will also  after a qualifying period  be given the opportunity to  against consideration  exercise call options issued by the Company which entitle to Fingerprint Shares. The number of allotted Fingerprint Shares and options will depend on the fulfilment of a performance requirement.Fingerprint Shares are Class B shares in the Company (‚ÄúFingerprint Shares‚Äù). The term of LTIP 2023 is approximately three years.The LTIP 2023 will be directed towards not more than 50 executive managers  other managers and key employees in the Company.The participants shall be entitled to  after a certain Vesting Period (as defined below)  provided continued employment and dependent on the fulfilment of a performance requirement during the financial years 2023-2025  receive allotment of Fingerprint Shares (‚ÄúPerformance Shares‚Äù). Executive managers will also be offered to  after the Vesting Period (as defined below)  provided continued employment and dependent on the fulfilment of a performance requirement during the financial years 2023-2025  receive allotment of call options (‚ÄúPerformance Options‚Äù).For executive managers  a part of the allotment of Performance Shares and/or Performance Options will also be conditional upon that the participant holds or acquires Fingerprint Shares and locks such shares into LTIP 2023 (‚ÄúSavings Shares‚Äù). Savings Shares can be newly acquired Fingerprint Shares  Fingerprint Shares already held by the participant at the time of the launch of LTIP 2023  or a combination thereof.Performance Shares are Fingerprint Shares and Performance Options are call options issued by the Company which entitle to Fingerprint Shares.The performance requirement is linked to the Company‚Äôs earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization excluding items affecting comparability (‚ÄúAdjusted EBITDA‚Äù).

However  exercise right during the Exercise Period will be limited to certain periods following the publication of quarterly reports. The exercise price when the participant exercises the Performance Option shall correspond to 235 per cent of the volume-weighted average price according to Nasdaq Stockholm‚Äôs official price list for the Fingerprint Share during the first ten trading days that directly follows the Meeting (the ‚ÄúExercise Price‚Äù). The exercise of the Performance Options may be made by using so called net strike.

The intention is that the Board of Directors shall launch LTIP 2023 as soon as practicable after the Meeting.In the event that the necessary majority is not obtained for the resolution on hedging measures according to item B below  the Board of Directors may ensure that the Company instead hedges itself against the financial exposure that LTIP 2023 is expected to entail by entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer shares in the Company to the participants in LTIP 2023.

Should the necessary majority not be obtained for the proposal in this item B  the Company may enter into a share swap agreement in accordance with item A above.Majority requirementsA valid resolution under item A above requires a majority of more than half of the votes cast at the Meeting.A valid resolution under item B above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths (90%) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Meeting approve the resolution.Item 8 ‚Äì Shareholder proposal regarding long-term incentive program for the Board of Directors (LTIP Board 2023)  etc.Johan Carlstr√∂m with company (the ‚ÄúProposer‚Äù)  who represent approximately 5.2 per cent of the shares and 18.9 per cent of the votes in the Company  proposes that the Meeting pass a resolution on the implementation of a long-term incentive program 2023 for the Board of Directors of the Company (LTIP Board 2023). Below is a description of the main contents of the proposal. The complete proposal will be made available on the Company‚Äôs website  www.fingerprints.com/egm2023.A. LTIP Board 2023Under item 7 of the agenda for the Meeting  the Board of Directors proposes the implementation of a long-term incentive program for the Executive management team  other managers  and key employees in order to attract and retain talent over time  increase engagement and performance and to encourage a personal long-term ownership in the Company.The Proposer proposes that a similar program is implemented for the Board of Directors in accordance with this item 8 in order to offer the members of the Board of Directors (‚ÄúBoard Members‚Äù) a similar possibility to take part in a value growth in the Fingerprint Share  which is expected to increase the long-term commitment to the Company‚Äôs operation and earnings development and to raise the motivation and sense of belonging with the Company. The Proposer intends to propose that the long-term incentive plan is renewed on an annual basis.Board Members will  after three qualifying periods and assuming an investment of their own in Fingerprint Shares  be given the opportunity to  without consideration  receive allotments of Fingerprint Shares. The number of allotted Fingerprint Shares will depend on the number of Fingerprint Shares that they hold or have acquired and on the fulfilment of a performance requirement.The LTIP Board 2023 is directed towards the current five Board Members of the Company.Participation in the LTIP Board 2023 assumes that the participant holds or acquires Fingerprint Shares and locks such shares into LTIP Board 2023 (‚ÄúSavings Shares‚Äù) up to and including the date of the publication of the quarterly report for the first quarter of 2026 (‚ÄúLock-up Period‚Äù). Savings Shares can be newly acquired Fingerprint Shares  Fingerprint Shares already held by the participant at the time of the launch of LTIP Board 2023  or a combination thereof. For each Savings Share  the participant shall be entitled to  provided that the Savings Shares are held for the full duration of the Lock-up Period and dependent on the fulfilment of a performance requirement during the financial years 2023-2025  receive allotment of Fingerprint Shares (‚ÄúPerformance Shares‚Äù). The amount of Performance Shares that are allotted to each participant shall vest gradually over approximately three years  conditional upon continued assignment in the Company.The performance requirement is linked to the Company‚Äôs earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization excluding items affecting comparability (‚ÄúAdjusted EBITDA‚Äù). The participant shall not pay any consideration for the allotted Performance Shares.Customary recalculation of the number of Performance Shares allotted per Savings Share may occur in certain situations.Allotment of Performance Shares will be made during a limited period of time following the date of the publication of the quarterly report for the first quarter of 2026. The period from the launch of the LTIP Board 2023 up to this date is divided into three vesting periods  where the first assignment vesting period commences upon launch of LTIP Board 2023 and ends the day before the Annual General Meeting 2024  the next assignment vesting period commences on the date of the Annual General Meeting 2024 and ends the day before the Annual General Meeting 2025  and the last assignment vesting period commences on the date of the Annual General Meeting 2025 and ends at the earlier of the day before the Annual General Meeting 2026 and the date of the publication of the quarterly report for the first quarter of 2026 (each period referred to as an ‚ÄúAssignment Vesting Period‚Äù and together as the ‚ÄúFull Vesting Period‚Äù).The total amount of Performance Shares that are allotted to each participant shall be vested in equal parts as of the final date of each Assignment Vesting Period (i.e. approximately 33 percent of the total number of Performance Shares will be vested after each Assignment Vesting Period)  conditional on continued assignment as a member of the Board of Directors in the Company. For example  a participant that is still a Board Member on the day before the Annual General Meeting 2024 will be allowed to keep the Performance Shares vested during that Assignment Vesting Period (i.e. approximately 33 per cent of the maximum allotment)  a participant that is still a Board Member on the day before the Annual General Meeting 2025 will be allowed to keep the Performance Shares vested during the current and previous Assignment Vesting Periods (i.e. approximately 67 per cent of the maximum allotment)  and a participant that is still a Board Member on the earlier of the day before the Annual General Meeting 2026 and the date of the publication of the quarterly report for the first quarter of 2026 will be allowed to keep all Performance Shares vested during the current and previous Assignment Vesting Periods (i.e. 100 per cent of the maximum allotment).The Nomination Committee shall be authorised to waive and alter the vesting conditions according to circumstances deemed reasonable and in accordance with customary provisions on so-called ‚Äúgood leavers‚Äù.In the event of a change of control of the Company or a direct or indirect sale  transfer or other disposal of all or substantially all of the business and assets  the Full Vesting Period shall be deemed to have completed and the participants shall be entitled to allotment of the Performance Shares as of the date when the transaction becomes unconditional.All vested Performance Shares (i.e. independent of the date of vesting) will be allotted following the Full Vesting Period. In order for the participant to be entitled to receive allotment of vested Performance Shares  it is assumed that the Adjusted EBITDA performance requirement is fulfilled and that the participant has kept all its Savings Shares for the full duration of the Lock-Up Period.The maximum allotment of Performance Shares to the participants will be presented in the complete proposal for resolution  which will be made available on the Company‚Äôs website not later than three weeks before the Meeting.The Nomination Committee (excluding any members thereof who also serve on the Board of Directors  as the case may be) shall be responsible for the implementation of  and shall engage an external advisor to handle the implementation and administration of  the LTIP Board 2023 in accordance with the resolutions by the Meeting set forth herein. The Nomination Committee shall have the right to charge the Company with reasonable costs connected to the implementation and administration of the LTIP Board 2023  including the costs for such advisor. The intention is that the LTIP Board 2023 shall be launched as soon as practicable after the General Meeting.In the event that the necessary majority is not obtained for the resolution on hedging measures according to item B below  the Board of Directors may ensure that the Company instead hedges itself against the financial exposure that LTIP Board 2023 is expected to entail by entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer shares in the Company to the participants in LTIP Board 2023. The relevant number of Fingerprint Shares shall correspond to the number of shares proposed to be issued and repurchased under item B below.B. Hedge for LTIP Board 2023 in the form of newly issued class C shares etc.The Proposer proposes that the implementation of LTIP Board 2023 shall be made in a cost-effective and flexible manner  and that the undertakings of the Company for delivery of Performance Shares and the Company‚Äôs cash-flow for the payment of social fees primarily shall be hedged by a directed issue of convertible and redeemable class C shares. These shares can be repurchased and converted into Fingerprint Shares and transferred in accordance with the following.In order to enable the hedging measures described above  the Proposer proposes that the Meeting resolves in accordance with what is mentioned below in this item B  which resolutions shall be resolved upon as one resolution.It is noted that the issuance of class C shares is conditional upon the amendment of the Articles of Associations in accordance with the proposal under item 7B above.Authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on a directed issue of class C sharesThe Board of Directors shall be authorized to resolve on a directed issue of Class C Shares on the following terms and conditions:(a) The maximum number of class C shares to be issued is 4 725 000.(b) With derogation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  the new class C Shares may only be subscribed for by a pre-consulted external party.(c) The amount to be paid for each new class C share (the subscription price) shall correspond to the share‚Äôs quota value at the time of subscription.(d) The authorization may be exercised on one or several occasions until the Annual General Meeting 2023.(e) The purpose of the authorization is to hedge the undertakings of the Company according to LTIP Board 2023.Authorization for the Board of Directors to repurchase class C sharesThe Board of Directors shall be authorized to repurchase class C shares on the following terms and conditions:(a) Repurchase can only take place by way of an acquisition offer directed to all holders of class C shares in the Company.(b) The maximum number of class C shares to be repurchased shall amount to 4 725 000.(c) Repurchase shall be made at a cash price per share of minimum 100 and maximum 110 per cent of the quota value applicable to the repurchased class C shares at the time of repurchase.(d) The Board of Directors shall have the right to resolve on other terms and conditions for the repurchase.(e) Repurchase may also be made of a so-called interim shares regarding such class C shares  by Euroclear Sweden AB designated as a Paid Subscribed Share (Sw.

The proposed total authorization for asset distribution is in line with the Company‚Äôs dividend policy. The authorization would be valid until the opening of the next Annual General Meeting.The Board would make separate resolutions on the amount and timing of each distribution of the dividend and/or assets from the reserve for invested unrestricted equity so that the preliminary record and payment dates will be as set out below. Nokia shall make a separate announcement of each such Board resolution.Preliminary record date Preliminary payment date 25 April 2023 4 May 2023 25 July 2023 3 August 2023 24 October 2023 2 November 2023 30 January 2024 8 February 2024Each installment based on the resolution of the Board of Directors will be paid to a shareholder registered in the Company‚Äôs shareholders‚Äô register maintained by Euroclear Finland Ltd on the record date of the relevant installment.Board composition and remunerationBruce Brown and Edward Kozel have informed the Board‚Äôs Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee that they will no longer be available to serve on the Nokia Board of Directors after the Annual General Meeting. The Board proposes  on the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee  that the number of Board members be ten (10). However  should any number of the candidates proposed by the Board not be able to attend the Board  the proposed number of Board members shall be decreased accordingly.On the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee  the Board of Directors further proposes that the following current Board members be re-elected as members of the Nokia Board of Directors for a term ending at the close of the next Annual General Meeting: Sari Baldauf  Thomas Dannenfeldt  Lisa Hook  Jeanette Horan  Thomas Saueressig  S√∏ren Skou  Carla Smits-Nusteling and Kai √ñist√§m√∂. In addition  it is proposed that Timo Ahopelto  entrepreneur and Founding Partner of Lifeline Ventures  a venture capital firm; and Elizabeth Crain  co-founder and Chief Operating Officer of Moelis & Company  a global investment bank  be elected as new members of the Board of Directors for a term until the close of the next Annual General Meeting.Resumes of the Board candidates are presented in the Board‚Äôs proposal available as of today at www.nokia.com/agm.The Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee will propose in the assembly meeting of the new Board of Directors on 4 April 2023 that Sari Baldauf be re-elected as Chair of the Board and S√∏ren Skou be re-elected as Vice Chair of the Board  subject to their election to the Board of Directors.To ensure the competitiveness of the Board remuneration and reflecting the fee development in Nokia‚Äôs global peer group  the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee has resolved to recommend to the Board that the annual fees of Board members  save for the Chair of the Board  would be proposed to be increased by EUR 15 000. Other remuneration payable to the Board members would remain at an unchanged level.Consequently  on the recommendation of the Board‚Äôs Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee  and in line with the Company‚Äôs Remuneration Policy  the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the annual fees payable for a term ending at the close of the next Annual General Meeting be as follows:‚Ä¢ EUR 440 000 for the Chair of the Board;‚Ä¢ EUR 210 000 for the Vice Chair of the Board;‚Ä¢ EUR 185 000 for each member of the Board;‚Ä¢ EUR 30 000 each for the Chairs of the Audit Committee and the Personnel Committee and EUR 20 000 for the Chair of the Technology Committee as an additional annual fee; and‚Ä¢ EUR 15 000 for each member of the Audit Committee and Personnel Committee and EUR 10 000 for each member of the Technology Committee as an additional annual fee.The Board proposes that in line with the Company‚Äôs Corporate Governance Guidelines  approximately 40% of the annual fee be paid in Nokia shares either purchased from the market on behalf of the Board members or alternatively delivered as treasury shares held by the Company as soon as practicable after the Annual General Meeting. The rest of the annual fee would be paid in cash to cover taxes arising from the remuneration.In addition  the Board of Directors proposes that the meeting fees for Board and Board Committee meetings paid to all Board members remain at the current level. The meeting fees are based on potential travel required between the Board member‚Äôs home location and the location of a meeting and paid for a maximum of seven meetings per term as follows:‚Ä¢ EUR 5 000 per meeting requiring intercontinental travel; and‚Ä¢ EUR 2 000 per meeting requiring continental travel.Only one meeting fee is paid if the travel entitling to the fee includes several meetings of the Board and the Board Committees. Moreover  it is proposed that members of the Board of Directors shall be compensated for travel and accommodation expenses as well as other costs directly related to Board and Board Committee work. The meeting fees  travel expenses and other expenses would be paid in cash.Auditor election and remunerationOn the recommendation of the Audit Committee  the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that Deloitte Oy be re-elected as the auditor of the Company for the financial year 2024.It is also proposed that the elected auditor for the financial year 2024 be reimbursed based on the invoice of the auditor and in compliance with the purchase policy approved by the Audit Committee.Authorization to the Board to issue shares and repurchase Company‚Äôs sharesThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorize the Board to resolve to issue in total a maximum of 550 million shares through issuance of shares or special rights entitling to shares under Chapter 10  Section 1 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act in one or more issues during the effective period of the authorization. The Board may issue either new shares or treasury shares held by the Company. Shares and special rights entitling to shares may be issued in deviation from the shareholders‚Äô pre-emptive rights within the limits set by law. The authorization may be used to develop the Company‚Äôs capital structure  diversify the shareholder base  finance or carry out acquisitions or other arrangements  to settle the Company‚Äôs equity-based incentive plans or for other purposes resolved by the Board. It is proposed that the authorization be effective until 3 October 2024 and terminate the authorization for issuance of shares and special rights entitling to shares resolved at the Annual General Meeting on 5 April 2022.The Board also proposes that the Board be authorized to resolve to repurchase a maximum of 550 million shares. The repurchases would reduce distributable funds of the Company. The shares may be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the shares held by the shareholders (directed repurchase). Shares may be repurchased to be cancelled  held to be reissued  transferred further or for other purposes resolved by the Board. It is proposed that the authorization be effective until 3 October 2024 and terminate the authorization for repurchasing the Company‚Äôs shares granted by the Annual General Meeting on 5 April 2022 to the extent that the Board has not previously resolved to repurchase shares based on such authorization.550 million shares correspond to less than 10 percent of the Company‚Äôs total number of shares. The Board shall resolve on all other matters related to the issuance or repurchase of Nokia shares in accordance with the resolution by the Annual General Meeting.Other matters to be addressed by the Annual General MeetingFurthermore  the Annual General Meeting would address adopting the Company‚Äôs financial statements for the financial year 2022  discharging the members of the Board of Directors and the President and Chief Executive Officer from liability for the financial year 2022 and adopting  in an advisory vote  the Remuneration Report for the Company‚Äôs governing bodies.The Remuneration Report for 2022 as well as the ‚ÄúNokia in 2022‚Äù annual report  which includes the Company‚Äôs Annual Accounts  the review by the Board of Directors and the auditor‚Äôs report  are expected to be published and available at www.nokia.com/agm in week 9 of 2023.

The notice of the Annual General Meeting with more detailed information on the participation and voting will be published separately at a later date on the company‚Äôs website and by a stock exchange release.Authorization of the Board of Directors to decide on the distribution of dividend and assets from the reserve for invested unrestricted equityThe Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting to be authorized to decide in its discretion on the distribution of an aggregate maximum of EUR 0.12 per share as dividend from the retained earnings and/or as assets from the reserve for invested unrestricted equity.The authorization will be used to distribute dividend and/or assets from the reserve for invested unrestricted equity in four installments during the period of validity of the authorization unless the Board of Directors decides otherwise for a justified reason. The proposed total authorization for asset distribution is in line with the Company‚Äôs dividend policy. The authorization would be valid until the opening of the next Annual General Meeting.The Board would make separate resolutions on the amount and timing of each distribution of the dividend and/or assets from the reserve for invested unrestricted equity so that the preliminary record and payment dates will be as set out below. Nokia shall make a separate announcement of each such Board resolution.Preliminary record date Preliminary payment date 25 April 2023 4 May 2023 25 July 2023 3 August 2023 24 October 2023 2 November 2023 30 January 2024 8 February 2024Each installment based on the resolution of the Board of Directors will be paid to a shareholder registered in the Company‚Äôs shareholders‚Äô register maintained by Euroclear Finland Ltd on the record date of the relevant installment.Board composition and remunerationBruce Brown and Edward Kozel have informed the Board‚Äôs Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee that they will no longer be available to serve on the Nokia Board of Directors after the Annual General Meeting. The Board proposes  on the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee  that the number of Board members be ten (10). However  should any number of the candidates proposed by the Board not be able to attend the Board  the proposed number of Board members shall be decreased accordingly.On the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee  the Board of Directors further proposes that the following current Board members be re-elected as members of the Nokia Board of Directors for a term ending at the close of the next Annual General Meeting: Sari Baldauf  Thomas Dannenfeldt  Lisa Hook  Jeanette Horan  Thomas Saueressig  S√∏ren Skou  Carla Smits-Nusteling and Kai √ñist√§m√∂. In addition  it is proposed that Timo Ahopelto  entrepreneur and Founding Partner of Lifeline Ventures  a venture capital firm; and Elizabeth Crain  co-founder and Chief Operating Officer of Moelis & Company  a global investment bank  be elected as new members of the Board of Directors for a term until the close of the next Annual General Meeting.Resumes of the Board candidates are presented in the Board‚Äôs proposal available as of today at www.nokia.com/agm.The Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee will propose in the assembly meeting of the new Board of Directors on 4 April 2023 that Sari Baldauf be re-elected as Chair of the Board and S√∏ren Skou be re-elected as Vice Chair of the Board  subject to their election to the Board of Directors.To ensure the competitiveness of the Board remuneration and reflecting the fee development in Nokia‚Äôs global peer group  the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee has resolved to recommend to the Board that the annual fees of Board members  save for the Chair of the Board  would be proposed to be increased by EUR 15 000. Other remuneration payable to the Board members would remain at an unchanged level.Consequently  on the recommendation of the Board‚Äôs Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee  and in line with the Company‚Äôs Remuneration Policy  the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the annual fees payable for a term ending at the close of the next Annual General Meeting be as follows:‚Ä¢ EUR 440 000 for the Chair of the Board;‚Ä¢ EUR 210 000 for the Vice Chair of the Board;‚Ä¢ EUR 185 000 for each member of the Board;‚Ä¢ EUR 30 000 each for the Chairs of the Audit Committee and the Personnel Committee and EUR 20 000 for the Chair of the Technology Committee as an additional annual fee; and‚Ä¢ EUR 15 000 for each member of the Audit Committee and Personnel Committee and EUR 10 000 for each member of the Technology Committee as an additional annual fee.The Board proposes that in line with the Company‚Äôs Corporate Governance Guidelines  approximately 40% of the annual fee be paid in Nokia shares either purchased from the market on behalf of the Board members or alternatively delivered as treasury shares held by the Company as soon as practicable after the Annual General Meeting. The rest of the annual fee would be paid in cash to cover taxes arising from the remuneration.In addition  the Board of Directors proposes that the meeting fees for Board and Board Committee meetings paid to all Board members remain at the current level. The meeting fees are based on potential travel required between the Board member‚Äôs home location and the location of a meeting and paid for a maximum of seven meetings per term as follows:‚Ä¢ EUR 5 000 per meeting requiring intercontinental travel; and‚Ä¢ EUR 2 000 per meeting requiring continental travel.Only one meeting fee is paid if the travel entitling to the fee includes several meetings of the Board and the Board Committees. Moreover  it is proposed that members of the Board of Directors shall be compensated for travel and accommodation expenses as well as other costs directly related to Board and Board Committee work. The meeting fees  travel expenses and other expenses would be paid in cash.Auditor election and remunerationOn the recommendation of the Audit Committee  the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that Deloitte Oy be re-elected as the auditor of the Company for the financial year 2024.It is also proposed that the elected auditor for the financial year 2024 be reimbursed based on the invoice of the auditor and in compliance with the purchase policy approved by the Audit Committee.Authorization to the Board to issue shares and repurchase Company‚Äôs sharesThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorize the Board to resolve to issue in total a maximum of 550 million shares through issuance of shares or special rights entitling to shares under Chapter 10  Section 1 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act in one or more issues during the effective period of the authorization. The Board may issue either new shares or treasury shares held by the Company. Shares and special rights entitling to shares may be issued in deviation from the shareholders‚Äô pre-emptive rights within the limits set by law. The authorization may be used to develop the Company‚Äôs capital structure  diversify the shareholder base  finance or carry out acquisitions or other arrangements  to settle the Company‚Äôs equity-based incentive plans or for other purposes resolved by the Board. It is proposed that the authorization be effective until 3 October 2024 and terminate the authorization for issuance of shares and special rights entitling to shares resolved at the Annual General Meeting on 5 April 2022.The Board also proposes that the Board be authorized to resolve to repurchase a maximum of 550 million shares. The repurchases would reduce distributable funds of the Company. The shares may be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the shares held by the shareholders (directed repurchase). Shares may be repurchased to be cancelled  held to be reissued  transferred further or for other purposes resolved by the Board. It is proposed that the authorization be effective until 3 October 2024 and terminate the authorization for repurchasing the Company‚Äôs shares granted by the Annual General Meeting on 5 April 2022 to the extent that the Board has not previously resolved to repurchase shares based on such authorization.550 million shares correspond to less than 10 percent of the Company‚Äôs total number of shares. The Board shall resolve on all other matters related to the issuance or repurchase of Nokia shares in accordance with the resolution by the Annual General Meeting.Other matters to be addressed by the Annual General MeetingFurthermore  the Annual General Meeting would address adopting the Company‚Äôs financial statements for the financial year 2022  discharging the members of the Board of Directors and the President and Chief Executive Officer from liability for the financial year 2022 and adopting  in an advisory vote  the Remuneration Report for the Company‚Äôs governing bodies.The Remuneration Report for 2022 as well as the ‚ÄúNokia in 2022‚Äù annual report  which includes the Company‚Äôs Annual Accounts  the review by the Board of Directors and the auditor‚Äôs report  are expected to be published and available at www.nokia.com/agm in week 9 of 2023.

The job cuts are taking place over a 12 month-period and about 15 locations will be affected  he said.‚ÄúThe reality is that the macro environment has become more difficult and has changed a lot ‚Äù Van Dijk said. ‚ÄúThis also means that the cost of capital has changed a lot  as interest rates go up and risk premiums also go up.‚ÄùVan Dijk declined to say how many people would lose their jobs. Prosus employed 30 000 people globally at the end of March last year  according to an earnings report  but these roles are spread across corporate hubs and a range of businesses the e-commerce group invests in and operates  including in classified advertising  food delivery and internet payments.Naspers shares closed 1.7% lower in Johannesburg on Wednesday  and Prosus declined 0.2% at 5:15 p.m. in Amsterdam.Read MoreCompanies from Amazon.com Inc. to Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google have recently announced staff reductions after years of growth  as they seek to lower costs and improve profitability.

The company has already closed some offices and made cuts at others  he said. The Euronext-listed firm previously closed its iFood business in Colombia and its autos business in Peru and Ecuador.The measures should help Prosus become profitable by the first half of 2025  according to Van Dijk.The e-commerce firm has been working on narrowing the discount between the sum of its parts and its stake in China‚Äôs Tencent Holdings Ltd. for years  with both Prosus and its Cape Town-based parent Naspers having taken a number of steps to address the problem.These include the spinoff of its African PayTV business  the creation of Prosus through the Euronext-listing of its internet holdings  a share swap between Naspers and Prosus  and a number of share buybacks that are ongoing.,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,negative,0.0,0.13,0.87,True,English,"['Tech Layoff', '30% corporate staff', 'Prosus', 'Chief Executive Officer Bob van Dijk', 'latest global tech company', 'Cape Town-based parent Naspers', 'parent Naspers Ltd.', 'Tencent Holdings Ltd.', 'Amazon.com Inc.', 'African PayTV business', 'The Euronext-listed firm', 'Amsterdam-listed Prosus NV', 'largest e-commerce companies', 'Naspers shares', 'internet holdings', 'e-commerce group', 'Alphabet Inc', 'Christmas Inc.', 'iFood business', 'autos business', 'e-commerce firm', 'corporate workforce', 'asset value', 'corporate centers', 'Hong Kong', 'South Africa', 'macro environment', 'interest rates', 'risk premiums', 'earnings report', 'classified advertising', 'food delivery', 'internet payments', 'staff reductions', 'previous year', 'consulting firm', 'different timelines', 'first half', 'share swap', 'share buybacks', 'job cuts', 'many people', 'corporate hubs', '80 companies', '30,000 people', 'Jobs', 'layoffs', 'Europe', 'interview', 'place', '12 month-period', '15 locations', 'reality', 'cost', 'capital', 'end', 'March', 'roles', 'range', 'businesses', 'Johannesburg', 'Wednesday', 'Google', 'years', 'growth', 'profitability', 'sector', 'Challenger', 'Gray', 'efforts', 'scales', 'offices', 'others', 'Colombia', 'Peru', 'Ecuador', 'measures', 'discount', 'sum', 'parts', 'stake', 'China', 'number', 'steps', 'problem', 'spinoff', 'creation', 'Euronext-listing', '5:15']",2023-01-26,2023-01-26,moneycontrol.com

Through its unique approach of combining enzymes and plastics  Carbios aims to address new consumer expectations and the challenges of a broad ecological transition by taking up a major challenge of our time: plastic and textile pollution. Carbios deconstructs any type of PET (the dominant polymer in bottles  trays  textiles made of polyester) into its basic components which can then be reused to produce new PET plastics with equivalent quality to virgin ones. This PET innovation  the first of its kind in the world  was recently recognized in a scientific paper published in front cover of the prestigious journal Nature. Carbios successfully started up its demonstration plant in Clermont-Ferrand in 2021. It has now taken another key step towards the industrialization of its process with the construction of a first-of-a-kind unit in partnership with Indorama Ventures.In 2017  Carbios and L‚ÄôOr√©al co-founded a consortium to contribute to the industrialization of its proprietary recycling technology. Committed to developing innovative solutions for sustainable development  Nestl√© Waters  PepsiCo and Suntory Beverage & Food Europe joined this consortium in April 2019. In 2022  Carbios signed an agreement with On  Patagonia  PUMA  and Salomon  to develop solutions promoting the recyclability and circularity of their products.The Company has also developed an enzymatic biodegradation technology for PLA-based (a bio sourced polymer) single-use plastics. This technology can create a new generation of plastics that are 100% compostable at ambient temperatures  even in domestic conditions  integrating enzymes at the heart of the plastic product.For more information  please visit carbios.com / Twitter: Carbios / LinkedIn: Carbios / Instagram: insidecarbiosCarbios (ISIN FR0011648716/ALCRB) is eligible for the PEA-PME  a government program allowing French residents investing in SMEs to benefit from income tax rebates.Translation is for information purposes only.In case of discrepancy between the French and the English version of this press release  the French version shall prevail",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.83,0.16,0.0,True,English,"['Executive Committee', 'Pivotal Year', 'Commercial Development', 'Carbios', 'Industrial', 'C√©r√©ales Vall√©es cluster', 'General Manager Biodegradation Division', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'Senior Vice President', 'past six months', 'St√©phane FERREIRA', 'Prof. Alain MARTY', 'broad ecological transition', 'new consumer expectations', 'European public funding', 'Public Affairs Director', 'Intellectual Property Director', 'General Management experience', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Chief Business Officer', 'Chief Scientific Officer', 'major international groups', 'first twenty employees', 'Executive Committee Members', 'green biotech company', 'Innovation Programs Funding', 'Industrial Development Director', 'paper packaging industry', 'Life Cycle Assessment', 'new PET plastics', 'scientific paper', 'Chief Strategy', 'Financial Officer', 'Innovation Funding', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'LCA Director', 'packaging sector', 'international expansion', 'top management', 'major challenge', 'new position', 'PET innovation', 'leadership team', 'Human Resources', 'Safety departments', 'expanding team', 'ambitious targets', 'Emmanuel LADENT', 'track records', 'pivotal year', 'biorecycling solutions', 'future generations', 'Klockner Pentaplast', 'high-potential subsidiary', 'main mission', 'biodegradation technology', 'numerous recruitments', 'strategic topic', 'positive impact', 'environmental performance', 'agricultural industry', 'PET biorecycling', 'environmental impact', 'specific tools', 'Lionel ARRAS', 'Mathieu BERTHOUD', 'Pascal BRICOUT', 'Lise LUCCHESI', 'Truffle Capital', 'unique approach', 'textile pollution', 'dominant polymer', 'basic components', 'front cover', 'prestigious journal', 'demonstration plant', 'key step', 'Project Management', 'Delphine DENOIZ√â', 'Regulatory News', 'regulatory compliance', 'Martine BRISSET', 'exciting challenge', 'biological technologies', 'several years', 'individual member', 'innovative processes', 'equivalent quality', ""Carbios' activities"", 'Carbios‚Äô attractivity', 'Carbios‚Äô website', 'plastic pollution', 'Carbios Group', 'Carbios‚Äô industrialization', '30 years', 'CLERMONT-FERRAND', 'France', 'ALCRB', 'pioneer', 'textiles', 'appointment', '1 January', 'Health', 'Regulation', 'teams', 'order', 'expertise', 'diversity', 'skills', 'commercialization', 'production', 'thousands', 'tons', 'awesome', 'sense', 'Amcor', 'Huhtamaki', 'Linpac', 'Carbiolice', 'training', 'satisfaction', 'concept', 'reality', 'projects', 'work', 'terms', 'time', 'creation', 'charge', 'French', 'products', 'world', 'Sourcing', 'Visit', 'biographies', 'governance', 'enzymes', 'challenges', 'type', 'bottles', 'trays', 'polyester', 'virgin', 'kind', 'Nature']",2023-01-26,2023-01-26,businesswire.com

17216,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4572606-basic-fit-a-hidden-european-multibagger,Basic-Fit: A Hidden European Gem With Tremendous Upside Potential (OTCMKTS:BSFFF),We believe Basic-Fit is significantly undervalued  both in terms of its current earnings and future prospects. Read more here.,"Peerayot/iStock via Getty ImagesThe new year  2023  is upon us. And it seems to be that time of year for New Year's resolutioners to start exercising again. While Basic-Fit N.V. (OTCPK:BSFFF) could benefit from some of those good intentions  it would still undermine its very strong long-term potential  and its very asymmetrical risk/reward profile.In this article  we explain why Basic-Fit is greatly undervalued and why it could deliver tremendous returns in the coming years  through 2030 and for years beyond  as the ""Ryanair"" or ""Planet Fitness"" of gyms in Europe.A Genius Mixture of Domino's & RyanairSo  what is Basic-Fit  and why are we so positive about it? Basic-Fit is exactly what the name implies: it's a low-cost gym with locations throughout Europe  mainly in the Netherlands  Belgium  France and Spain. They also have clubs in Luxembourg and recently started expanding into Germany.Basic-Fit IRThey ended the year with 1 200 clubs  according to their most recent report. By the same token  they ended the year with a stunning 3.35 million members  up from 2.22 million at the beginning of the year.Their founder initially started by opening premium stores  but then discovered the huge demand for low-cost gyms  and since 2010 they have continued to grow at a rapid pace. Back then  they started by offering very basic memberships around ‚Ç¨19.95.Basic-Fit IRThe staggering fact is that the stock is still trading at the same price level  while memberships have nearly doubled since 2018  due to the pandemic and bearish sentiment around Europe entering stagflation with an energy crisis.TradingviewYet we don't think those factors are overly affecting Basic-Fit  given its tremendous growth and unit economics. They're basically a mix between Ryanair and Domino's Pizza. Ryanair in the sense that in Europe  low-cost carriers have been dominant in recent years. And we continue to see that happen in other sectors  such as the success of Aldi and Lidl.And they are also like Domino's Pizza  in that they use population figures  to cluster their stores  to keep the competition away and be as close to their customers as possible. Currently  they are really the only entity that has this many of gym locations  cleverly clustered across these cities.That is also one of the main reasons why they are so successful: with a premium membership  you have access to all Basic-Fit gyms across the country  and even in other countries where Basic-Fit operates. That level of clustering  is what makes the company so special. It also makes it so that people can go to the Basic-Fit closest to their work or home. Or students can visit another Basic-Fit if they are studying in a different city other than closer to home.They create market share or gain market share from the usually smaller  low-cost gyms by providing access to hundreds of gyms for a very low price  and by creating a broad barrier to entry that can only be surpassed with huge amounts of capital  scale and years or decades of expansion  as they spread certain costs across their 1 200 gyms.Basic-Fit IRAt the same time  they are still experiencing the tailwinds of the underdeveloped fitness market in Europe  which is likely to come closer to saturation like the United States and Scandinavian countries  which are at 20%. Markets such as France and Belgium currently only have a penetration rate of about 10%.Basic-Fit IRCost And Unit EconomicsSo let's take a look at the costs and economics of Basic-Fit  because we think these have been completely overlooked. That could also simply be because it is an overseas asset  traded in Amsterdam on Euronext. Nevertheless  it is a ‚Ç¨1.95B ($2.12BN) company.Basic-Fit has also fairly recently changed its membership structure in France  where you still had a basic subscription  which is now being replaced by a ""comfort"" subscription  which will cost ‚Ç¨24.99 per four weeks to access all clubs in France or ‚Ç¨29.99 for Premium which gives you access to clubs across Europe. We think we could start to see that tailwind soon  releasing even more upside potential  as France is currently their largest target market.But to look at Basic-Fit's cost structure  we first look at what makes a mature club. A mature club is one that has generally been around for about 24 months. On average  it costs Basic-Fit ‚Ç¨1.2M to build a club. An adult club has an average of 3 350 members per club. That means they bring in ‚Ç¨840K per year per club.Basic-Fit IRNow the club still has two costs: overhead costs for the club itself  and shared costs that are shared between the clubs. Of the ‚Ç¨840K revenue  about 50% goes to Rent (about 17.5%)  Labor (about 15%) and other costs (about 17.5%). Which means we are left with ‚Ç¨420K of EBITDA per club. In other words  with the 1200 clubs they already have  they should be able to bring in an EBITDA of over ‚Ç¨504M at the end.Of course  you have to subtract from that the shared costs per club  such as headquarters costs  marketing  car rental  etc. Currently  those expenses are still a bit high because  of course  they are still expanding new clubs. Their guideline currently is about 6% of revenue for marketing  and 5-6% for headquarters costs in the medium term due to operating leverage.That leaves ‚Ç¨100.8 million for shared overhead. If we take the clubs' ‚Ç¨504 million EBITDA and subtract the shared costs  we are left with ‚Ç¨403.2 million adjusted EBITDA. For a company that grows memberships and clubs by over 20%  it is only trading at 4-5x adjusted EBITDA  which we think is extremely undervalued.This operating leverage with shared costs should only grow  as the incremental cost of monitoring more clubs should remain more or less the same. It is somewhat the principle of Wright's Law  after which we named ourselves. For each cumulative doubling of the number of units  the cost decreases by a fixed percentage. The law applies perfectly to Basic-Fit  which is currently growing rapidly.Basic-Fit IRDespite being a European company  they are very innovative when it comes to cost savings. Like you can see in the image above  they use AI and computation to monitor their facilities  which they can operate 24/7. Unlike smaller fitness chains  they are also able to centralize every data point they have in order to optimize gym temperature  energy cost savings  repairs  etc.We believe no other competitor even comes close to the level of operational leverage that Basic-Fit currently has. It is virtually impossible to compete as an individual gym that employs 4-5 people as cleaners  bookkeepers  trainers and managers versus a grassroots gym that can theoretically operate 24/7 without full-time employees.ValuationTaking into account the golden rules of value investing  there are always two rules to follow. Rule #1 is don't lose money. Rule 2 is: don't forget rule #1. Basic-Fit seems to fit well into this category  as current earnings provide great downside protection  as the company with their mature clubs right now only trades at 4-5x adjusted EBITDA.But when it comes to what 2030 might look like for Basic-Fit  the upside potential seems huge. They are aiming to expand to 3000-3500 clubs in Europe  adding clubs to the countries where they already operate  while also expanding into new countries such as Germany. They maintain and set their requirements at 30%+ ROIC per club. That  with 20%+ growth in revenue and members.Basic-Fit IRTo stay grounded and remaining somewhat conservative  we assume the low margin of their target of 3 000 clubs by 2030. For the number of members per club  we stick to 3 300 members per club for mature clubs  as we see now and for 2019 in normal times. That would equate to 9.9 million members by 2030.Revenue per member in October 2022 is ‚Ç¨22.50 per month  although we think there is much more leverage because Basic-Fit is priced much  much lower than its competitors. But for this valuation  we assume that Basic-Fit will keep this average monthly price pretty close to absorb all the market share  despite high inflation in Europe and other gym chains raising their prices. We think inflation in Europe could be at least 4%. That would mean that their subscription  adjusted for inflation  should be worth ‚Ç¨29.5 in 2030.But in 2030 we assume ‚Ç¨25.5 per month. That would bring Basic-Fit's revenue to ‚Ç¨252.45M per month  or ‚Ç¨3.03BN per year. In terms of Club EBITDA  which is currently 50%  we think there will be more margin as Basic-Fit achieves economies of scale. But for this example  we will stay at 50% Club Margin  bringing Club EBITDA down to ‚Ç¨1.51BN per year. For overhead costs  however  we believe there is tremendous leverage as they remain relatively fixed as scale increases. Shared overhead costs at 8% of revenues would equate to ‚Ç¨242.4M. ‚Ç¨1.51BN minus ‚Ç¨242.4M shared overhead brings us to ‚Ç¨1.27BN group EBITDA.We still have to deduct maintenance costs  which management says are about ‚Ç¨70K per adult club annually  or ‚Ç¨210M per year. Net interest expense should come down to about ‚Ç¨90M. If we deduct these costs  we arrive at ‚Ç¨970M pre-tax. We apply a simple flat tax rate of 25% and subtract another ‚Ç¨242.5M  arriving at a final result of ‚Ç¨727.5M.Basic-Fit IRThe last piece of the puzzle we still need is the number of shares that will be outstanding. We think Basic-Fit will use excess capital to repurchase shares rather than pay dividends as long as they are growing.Bearing any unforeseen circumstances  we expect to become self-financing halfway 2023 ... I can clearly say that we will finance our own growth. We'll be able to finance our own growth with our own money that we make  our own cash flow. And that will be in the second half - as from the second half of 2023. No different circumstances  no lockdowns  and based off  of course  on the amount of openings that we want to do. (1H 2022 Meeting)That means they could outlay the excess cash they generate to buy back shares unless they are able to grow faster and still meet the 30% ROIC criterion. According to our calculations  they might be able to buy about 6% of float annually  which would reduce the number of shares from 66 million to 38.28 million by 2030.In short  with 38.28 million shares outstanding and ‚Ç¨727.5 million in earnings  our estimates put us at an EPS of ‚Ç¨19.00 per share in 2030. At a reasonable multiple of 15x  that would mean a share price of ‚Ç¨285 per share  or an amazing CAGR of 38.13%.The Untold LeverageEven though those estimates already sound preposterous  there is room to believe there could be even more upside beyond our estimates  and beyond 2030. Let's examine what leverage Basic-Fit could exert if they finally decided to increase membership fees  since they are still well below the industry average.Let's say they increase membership fees by ‚Ç¨1. Price increases alone  in a subscription form  flow directly into the results  unless membership numbers deteriorate  of course. But a price increase of ‚Ç¨1 per month  at 9.9 million members in 2030  means an additional ‚Ç¨9.9 million per month  or ‚Ç¨118.8 million per year in pure profit. At a multiple of 15x  that extra ‚Ç¨1 per month could add another ‚Ç¨1.78BN in market cap to the stock.We think market participants are completely overlooking Basic-Fit's leverage in this regard. They are also quite resilient to inflation. Like Coca-Cola  they have the advantage of enormous scale and can make a huge difference with a small price increase.Basic-Fit IRIf you really want to play the population game  and try to imagine where Basic-Fit might end up  we can look at the aspirations of Planet Fitness. They see a potential of up to 50% market share in the US. If we calculate that back to Europe  the maximum potential could even exceed 35 million members  in some of the countries we think they could enter.Total 352.33M 70.47M 35.23M Country Total Population 20% Propensity 50% Share Spain 47.42M 9.48M 4.74M Portugal 10.33M 2.07M 1.03M France 67.75M 13.55M 6.78M Belgium 11.59M 2.32M 1.16M Netherlands 17.53M 3.51M 1.75M Germany 83.20M 16.64M 8.32M Switzerland 8.70M 1.74M 0.87M Italy 59.11M 11.82M 5.91M Poland 37.75M 7.55M 3.78M Austria 8.95M 1.79M 0.90M Click to enlargeAs for management  they also seem to be very down-to-earth entrepreneurs  with the CEO still a founder. The founder  Ren√© Moos  used to be a professional tennis player  and seems to have brought his competitive spirit to the business landscape. Management seems very united and is trying to look 10 years ahead.The management team is also relatively prudently compensated compared to companies in the United States. Ren√© Moos  who currently owns 14.37% of the outstanding shares  actually bought some more shares on the open market in November when they were trading around ‚Ç¨22. He bought an additional 150 000 shares.Risks To Our ThesisAs for the risks in our thesis  we cannot immediately identify clear direct threats  but would perhaps point to some of the smaller gym chains. We also think that one of the reasons Basic-Fit has been able to make so much progress is that they have had access to capital markets and strong venture capital because their business model works brilliantly.Just as in theory it would be possible to compete with Ryanair  in practice it is a mission that not many would want to fund. Paradoxically  Basic-Fit seems to be the only giant in the room that has such robust liquidity and access to capital. Many of the smaller players are either highly leveraged or unable to raise capital or expand efficiently  it seems to us. It's a difficult flywheel to get started. And it's not like the current players are eager to pick a fight.Landlords also want to rent to Basic-Fit because of their credit rating. And now that they've clustered their locations  they were the first ones to do that and have the first man advantage. You would have to be considered a kamikaze to open an individual gym in a cluster of  say  three Basic-Fit gyms.Unlike the United States  venture capital markets and going public as a company seem to be much less the culture. Europe is not Silicon Valley. And with the ECB and Federal Reserve tightening policy  it's becoming even more difficult to raise additional capital for those players in that increasingly expensive Eurodollar market.Basic-Fit IROutside of competition  the company may still face headwinds in the short to medium term as Europe continues to face an energy crisis and what appears to be a stagflationary environment. Although Basic-Fit can be seen as a company more resilient to all weather conditions  as a cheap fitness club membership is usually the last thing people want to skimp on.They have fixed price contracts for 75% of their projected energy consumption by 2023 and have created an energy task force to reduce their energy expenditures. We believe that by 2030  most  if not all  energy shocks will be gone.Basic-Fit currently has net debt of about ‚Ç¨690 million  which they should be able to carry as they self-fund in the second half of 2023. They have a revolving credit facility/syndicated loan and a net debt/adjusted EBITDA covenant of 3.5x  which we believe will not be exceeded unless there is another force majeure like in 2020.Basic-Fit IRThe Bottom LineWe regard Basic-Fit as one of the best value propositions currently available in the equity markets. It is a fantastic business model  with a large moat  and is efficiently run by a management team with a long-term vision.The company seems to be in the unique position of being the first to trade and build a wide moat around its fortress with clustered gyms. The fact that it currently trades at 4-5x the clubs' current mature underlying EBITDA makes it dirt cheap and should provide a hedge against downside risk  with the upside being in excess of 35% CAGR. The bearishness around Europe  its energy crisis and stagflation environment should not include Basic-Fit.And perhaps it is overlooked because it is a hidden asset traded on Euronext  and its results are not yet visible in its current revenue/cash flow statements. In a European fitness market  with more than 63 000 gyms  we seem to be early to the party.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva is currently advancing one clinical candidate  has a pipeline of two preclinical programs and continues to explore other development opportunities to add to its pipeline.Inventiva‚Äôs lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies. In 2020  Inventiva reported positive results from its Phase IIb clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor for the treatment of patients with NASH and received Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (‚ÄúFDA‚Äù) for lanifibranor in the treatment of NASH.Inventiva‚Äôs pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult MPS VI patients. As part of Inventiva‚Äôs decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended its clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is in the process of selecting an oncology development candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 80 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240 000 pharmacologically relevant molecules  approximately 60% of which are proprietary  as well as a wholly-owned research and development facility.Inventiva is a public company listed on compartment C of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA - ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA). www.inventivapharma.com .ContactsInventivaPascaline ClercVP of Global External Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 240 620 9175 Brunswick GroupTristan Roquet Montegon /Aude Lepreux /Matthieu BenoistMedia relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83 Westwicke  an ICR CompanyPatricia L.

After a strong first half  Tolling Sales (+2.4%) were impacted by the slowdown in demand in the second half  while Package Sales grew steadily over the year as a whole (+14.8%)  driven by the momentum of European markets.Sales evolution by quarter and by activity(‚Ç¨M) 2022 2021 Variation Q1 6.61 5.91 + 12.0 % Q2 7.34 6.54 + 12.2 % Q3 6.73 6.39 + 5.3 % Q4 5.78 6.39 - 9.5 % Annual total 26.47 25.23 + 4.9 % Of which Tolling Sales 20.60 20.13 + 2.4 % Package Sales1 5.86 5.11 + 14.8 %Significant events of the financial yearIn a challenging economic environment marked by the return of high inflation  COIL recorded a solid increase in sales of 4.9% in 2022. However  the fourth quarter was down by 9.5% compared to the prior year due to de-stocking in the distribution chain.In a global environment providing little visibility  particularly with regard to energy costs  the Company continued its strategy of improving its industrial performance by focusing its operations in the short term on its Landen site in Belgium  where energy prices were lower  and by relying on its high-efficiency line 6 in Germany.The Company also stepped up its policy to reduce its carbon footprint by increasing investments in energy efficiency. In partnership with local renewable energy operators  the Company commissioned a photovoltaic farm at its Bernburg site in Germany in October 2022  thereby enabling it to supply 20% of the electricity used by the site with green energy at competitive costs. Studies on a similar action plan for the production site in Belgium have also been initiated.Tolling sales: slowdown in demand in the second halfTolling sales (‚Ç¨20.6 million) increased by 2.4% compared to 2021 and accounted for 77.8% of annual sales in 2022  compared to 79.8% the previous year. They were unstable between the first half (+18.5%) and the second half (-13.2%). Initially  the temporary shortage of aluminium supplies resulting from the post-COVID economic recovery led to exceptionally long delivery times for flat rolled aluminium products from rolling mills. This led distributors to overstock so as to ensure supply to their customers  resulting in a sharp rise in aluminium prices to record levels in the first quarter. Subsequently  as the supply problems eased  the price fell suddenly and dramatically  leading distributors to reduce their stocks.Story continuesPackage sales: recovery driven by the dynamics of European marketsPackage sales (‚Ç¨5.9 million)  which include pre-anodised metal supplied directly to the end-customer  grew by 14.8% compared to 2021 and accounted for 22.2% of 2022 annual sales  compared to 20.2% the previous year. This increase is due to the sustained development of sales in Europe  with deliveries for several emblematic projects. This compensated for the absence of deliveries in Russia due to the conflict in Ukraine and lower billings in Asia due to costs and delivery times of anodising quality aluminium. The Company expects Asian markets to recover in 2023 with the reopening of borders and the delivery of several new projects.OutlookIn an uncertain global economic environment  COIL maintains a cautious approach to 2023 and anticipates lower demand for tolling services in the first half compared to the previous year  as distributors continue to reduce their stocks and competition emerges in the European continuous anodising market.In the short term  the Company has taken steps to limit the impact of the slowdown in tolling activities by increasing its prices in line with inflation  continuing to optimise its variable cost base and supporting the commercial development of its Package offers. Investments made over the last few years and the flexibility of its industrial tool will enable it to react efficiently to market improvements.In the medium to long term  the Company is confident in its development prospects by capitalising on its broad portfolio of premium  sustainable and low carbon footprint products to increase the potential of its business.Indicative 2023 calendar28 April 2023 2022 annual results and annual financial report 7 June 2023 Annual General Meeting 27 July 2023 First half 2023 sales 31 October 2023 First half 2023 results and half-year financial reportPress releases are issued after close of trading.About COILCOIL is the world's leading anodiser in the building and industrial sectors and trades under the ALOXIDE brand name.Anodising is an electrochemical process (electrolysis) which develops a natural  protective oxide layer on the surface of aluminium and can be coloured in a range of UV-proof finishes. It gives the metal excellent resistance to corrosion and/or reinforces its functional qualities. Anodising preserves all the natural and ecological properties of aluminium; it retains its high rigidity and excellent strength-to-weight ratio  its non-magnetic properties  its exceptional resistance to corrosion. The metal remains totally and repeatedly recyclable through simple re-melting.

On the Euronext stock exchange in Paris  shares in the chipmaker rose 9 percent to their highest le‚Ä¶,"PARIS/FRANKFURT (dpa-AFX) - A strong sales forecast from STMicroelectronics  according to analysts  has created a good mood in the semiconductor industry on Thursday. On the Euronext stock exchange in Paris  shares in the chipmaker rose 9 percent to their highest level in just over a year. In its wake  Infineon rose 4.5 percent. The shares of chip industry suppliers such as ASML and Aixtron also rose.STMicroelectronics expects sales of $16.8 billion to $17.8 billion this year. The midpoint of that range of $17.3 billion beats the consensus estimate by more than six percent  analyst Sandeep Deshpande of bank JPMorgan wrote in an initial reaction to numbers and outlook. For year-end earnings  this represents a 25 percent increase in the consensus estimate compared to current market expectations  he added.""The outlook is very strong and should go down well with investors "" the expert said. He added that the company was apparently already able to make a good assessment of future developments at the beginning of the year. However  he added  it is still important to be cautious  because in a difficult economic environment  the order situation can change quickly  even though this has clearly not been the case so far.Analyst J√ºrgen Wagner of investment house Stifel praised STMicroelectronics' targets for profitability in the current first quarter. Thus  the target for the gross margin of 48 percent is above the market expectation of 45.4 percent. The company thus stands out positively from the recent  rather cautious forecasts of the U.S. chip giant Texas Instruments.The German industry giant Infineon will publish its quarterly report on Thursday of next week. Here  investors have recently become somewhat more confident again: From the lows around 28 euros at the end of December  they recovered by almost 15 percent at the closing price on the previous day.

Embracing expressiveness and a sense of home  the brand‚Äôs new vision of design comes to life through three overarching concepts that blend comfort‚Ä¶,Paris - ibis is leading the global charge in the democratization of design with the debut of fresh  new design concepts. Embracing expressiveness and a sense of home  the brand‚Äôs new vision of design comes to life through three overarching concepts that blend comfortably with each hotel‚Äôs local aesthetic.The three new concepts - Agora  Plaza  and Square - were created through a competition that engaged creatives from around the world. Each concept offers a unique take on modern comfort and hospitality  while retaining ibis‚Äô signature style elements such as dotted feature walls  multi-functional spaces  and guestrooms that feel like home.Standout design features include murals  creative design accents and artwork by local artists that embrace and celebrate the local culture and lifestyle. The open concept lobby embraces the vibe of the surrounding neighborhood ‚Äì a social hub designed for a mix of possibilities and atmospheres ‚Äì extending into the street with a transparent facade and outdoor seating areas. The brand‚Äôs passion for music ensures there is always a groove  with live musicians  DJs  and cool playlists throughout the day and night  while a lively bar area welcomes guests  locals  and passersby to enjoy an espresso  a cocktail  a bite to eat  and a chance to freely live in the moment.A trifecta of design conceptsThe Agora design concept was created by Innocad  an Austrian design team  and can be experienced at select hotels around the world including ibis Barcelona Plaza Glories. Here  the social hub/lobby is styled as an urban caf√©  open to the city ‚Äì a place to gather  connect  and share ideas  like an agora of ancient times. With youthful street style  the vibrant interior features a refined design of black and white  with pops of color  signature dotted walls and original art. Boldly patterned floors lead guests through the interior and outdoor space  which features an eclectic mix of seating and trendy lighting. In the Agora guestrooms  crisp white linens and neutral furnishings create a backdrop for monochromatic images of the moon  mars or the ocean printed across the ceilings ‚Äì creating a feeling of calm  lightness and space. The color pop comes in the brightly hued bathroom  creating contrast and visual separation from the bedroom  along with an energizing  mood-lifting vibe.Source: AccorThe Plaza design concept  by FGMF in Brazil  is exemplified at ibis Sao Paulo Barra Funda. The warm woods of South America mix with raw metals  creating a hip  modern residential feel  with a distinctly industrial edge. In the open-air lobby  a central bar dominates the space  inviting guests to gather around and mingle about the social hub  freed from visual boundaries. Banquettes and seating areas with comfy pillows flow from indoors to out. Neon signs guide guests throughout the space  adding color and energy  while abundant plants and ironwork ceiling panels add visual interest and texture. Guestrooms in the Plaza concept continue the theme of a casual  warm  living style  with edgy wood and metal features  such as a wall of open shelving where guests store clothing and personal items  mixed among a display of bold and authentic art objects.Source: AccorThe Square design concept  created by Soda  in Thailand  comes to life in a sublime way at ibis B√©thune. With a calming spirit of zen and loads of natural light  the Square lobby concept feels like an airy loft with a comfortable at-home vibe. The space is designed with a long  linear flow  anchored by a bar along one side  with communal tables for dining or working together. Walls are lined with open shelving to display books and art objects  oversize lighting creates ambiance  and huge comfy sofas are ideal for sinking into and enjoying deep conversations or listening to live music. Movable screens add possibility and flexibility to the multifunctional space. In the aesthetically minimalist guestrooms  a single oversize work of modern art sets the tone  and each piece is chosen for its calming and balancing effects. The bed is the central zone ‚Äì serving as a place of rest  as well as a spot for relaxing or working. Connectivity is key  with ample sockets and hookups for recharging  giving guests the freedom to balance their work  rest and play as they see fit  in the privacy of their own room  or in the social spaces beyond.Source: AccorAbout Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

According to preliminary figures  the company recorded double-digit percentage growth in sales revenue and earnings year-over-year. For fiscal 2023  Sartorius Stedim Biotech projects further growth and continued high profitability.Sartorius Logo (PRNewsfoto/Sartorius)""After two exceptionally dynamic years  we delivered another year of strong results. Despite the challenging operating environment  our growth was broad-based across the portfolio and the geographies  and we see us a good year ahead of our mid-term plan. Not surprisingly  2023 will show a trend back towards our underlying growth path. For the current year  we expect moderate sales revenue growth and aim to maintain our profit margin at around the high prior-year level. As we look ahead  we find the fundamental growth drivers in our markets fully intact. Demand for biopharmaceuticals is on the rise in all indication areas and regions  and at the same time the biotech industry is in an extraordinarily innovative phase. We are excellently positioned to support our customers in their endeavors and to seize the opportunities that arise from this. Substantial investments into capacities and acquisitions that expand our capabilities will therefore remain part of our growth strategy. While our basic assessment of mid-term market trends has not changed  we are raising our 2025 sales revenue forecast to around 4.4 billion euros to reflect changes in price levels caused by inflation. At the same time  we confirm our profitability target of an EBITDA margin of more than 35 percent "" said Joachim Kreuzburg  Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO.Business development of the Group1Sales revenue rose by 15.1 percent in constant currencies (organic: +13.2 percent; reported: +21.0 percent) year-over-year to 3 493 million euros in fiscal 2022  driven by significant organic growth. As expected  the contribution from acquisitions2 was around 2 percentage points. All product areas recorded growth  while the Covid-19-related business declined significantly from the prior year. All three business regions ‚Äì EMEA3  the Americas  and Asia | Pacific ‚Äì expanded significantly  with the Americas region posting the strongest gain. The restrictions in China caused by the pandemic as well as the strong reduction of the business in Russia impacted growth to a relatively minor extent.Following two exceptionally strong years due to the pandemic  order intake1 as expected recorded a year-over-year decline against the backdrop of demand normalization and a significantly lower Covid-19-related business  reaching 3 315 million euros (in constant currencies: -13.0 percent  reported: -9.5 percent). Excluding the Covid-19-related business  order intake would have grown slightly. The development of the previous two years had been positively influenced by high demand from coronavirus vaccine manufacturers and changed ordering patterns by some customers  who had placed orders larger in size and further in advance than usual.Underlying EBITDA rose by 18.2 percent to 1 221 million euros in 2022. The resulting margin was 35.0 percent  compared to 35.8 percent in the prior year. The 2021 margin had been positively influenced by a partially delayed cost development  for example as a result of deferred new hires in relation to sales revenue growth because of the pandemic and low business travel activity. As planned  these cost positions normalized in 2022 and had a dampening effect on profitability. Price effects on the procurement and customer sides largely offset each other.Relevant net profit1 reached 797 million euros  representing an increase of 15.8 percent from the prior year. Underlying earnings per share were 8.64 euros (prior year: 7.46 euros).Key financial indicatorsSartorius Stedim Biotech continues to have a very sound balance sheet and financial base. Equity was 2 514 million euros as of December 31  2022  corresponding to an equity ratio1 of 49.6 percent (December 31  2021: 1 733 million euros and 43.9 percent  respectively)  and gross debt was 1 136 million euros (December 31  2021: 626 million euros). Net debt stood at 1 029 million euros  resulting in a ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA1 of 0.8 (December 31  2021: 402 million euros and 0.4  respectively). Cash flow from investing activities was -442 million euros  compared with -324 million euros in 2021. The ratio of capital expenditures (CAPEX) to sales revenue was 12.3 percent (prior year: 11.2 percent).Increase in the number of employeesAs of December 31  2022  Sartorius Stedim Biotech had a total of 11 934 employees worldwide  1 525 more than at the end of 2021. Following a significant increase in the first six months of 2022  the pace of new hires slowed down as the second half of the year began  as planned.Outlook for fiscal 2023Following the exceptionally strong previous years  Sartorius Stedim Biotech expects further growth in 2023 despite demand normalization and anticipated further declines in the Covid-19-related business. Consolidated sales revenue is expected to increase by an amount in the low single-digit percentage range. Excluding the Covid-19-related business  the increase would be in the mid to high single-digit percentage range. Acquisitions are anticipated to contribute around 1 percentage point to growth. The Group's underlying EBITDA margin should be around the level of the prior year (35.0 percent).The company will continue its comprehensive capacity expansion program in 2023. The CAPEX ratio should be at roughly 12.5 percent and the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA at about 0.5. Possible acquisitions are not included in this projection.Medium-term sales revenue target for fiscal 2025 updatedBased on the unchanged strong fundamental growth trends in its markets and the resulting positive prospects for the company  Sartorius Stedim Biotech confirms its fundamental growth projections. In light of increased inflation and associated price adjustments  the company therefore is making a mathematical adjustment to its medium-term sales revenue forecast and now expects sales revenue of around 4.4 billion euros in 2025 (previously around 4 billion euros). Sartorius Stedim Biotech plans to achieve this sales revenue increase primarily through organic growth and additionally by acquisitions.The forecast for the Group's underlying EBITDA margin in 2025 remains unchanged at more than 35 percent. The margin target includes expenses of around 1 percent of Group sales revenue for measures to reduce the company's CO 2 emission intensity.All forecasts are based on constant currencies  as in the past years. In addition  management points out that the dynamics and volatilities in the life science and biopharma sectors have increased over the past years and the coronavirus pandemic has further amplified these trends. Moreover  the forecasts are based on the assumption of no deterioration in the geopolitical and global economic situation  supply chains  inflation and energy supply  and no new relevant restrictions in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. Accordingly  current forecasts show higher uncertainties than usual.1 Sartorius Stedim Biotech publishes alternative performance measures that are not defined by international accounting standards.

These data demonstrate that efanesoctocog alfa delivered normal to near-normal factor activity levels (>40%) for the majority of the week with once-weekly dosing. Efanesoctocog alfa is currently under priority review by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the target action date for the decision is February 28  2023.Hemophilia A is a rare  lifelong condition in which the ability of a person‚Äôs blood to clot properly is impaired  leading to excessive bleeds that can result in joint damage and chronic pain  and potentially impact their quality of life. The severity of hemophilia is determined by the level of clotting factor activity in a person‚Äôs blood.Angela Weyand  MDInvestigator of the XTEND-1 Clinical Trial and Associate Professor at Michigan Medicine‚ÄúWe are excited about the potential for efanesoctocog alfa to address unmet needs by allowing people living with hemophilia to enjoy an active lifestyle. Currently  they often need to make trade-offs between bleed protection and dosing frequency. Based on the XTEND-1 study results assessing efanesoctocog alfa  we have the opportunity to provide near normal factor activity levels for an extended period of time (the majority of a week) with a single dose  which is a first for hemophilia A. The data show that efanesoctocog alfa can offer patients increased bleed protection  leading to improved outcomes  such as reduced pain and improved physical functioning  that may impact daily life with a reduced treatment burden.‚ÄùThe data from the pivotal XTEND-1 Phase 3 study published in NEJM show that efanesoctocog alfa met primary and key secondary endpoints  demonstrating clinically meaningful prevention of bleeds and superior bleed protection compared to prior factor VIII prophylaxis based on an intra-patient comparison. Treatment with efanesoctocog alfa prophylaxis resulted in significant and clinically meaningful improvements in physical health  pain  and joint health. Key results include:Story continuesThe median and mean annualized bleeding rates (ABR) were 0.00 (IQR: 0.00-1.04) and 0.71 (95% CI: 0.52-0.97)  respectively.A statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in ABR (77%) versus prior factor VIII prophylaxis (p<0.001).Nearly all (97%) bleeding episodes resolved with a single injection of efanesoctocog alfa (50 IU/kg).Efanesoctocog alfa provided mean factor activity >40 IU/dL for the majority of the week and at 15 IU/dL at Day 7.Efanesoctocog alfa prophylaxis improved physical health (p<0.001)  pain intensity (p=0.03)  and joint health (p=0.01) when comparing 52 week and baseline measurements. iIn patients with target joints at baseline  100% of the target joints were resolved after at least 12 months of continuous prophylaxis.Efanesoctocog alfa was well-tolerated  and inhibitor development to factor VIII was not detected. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>5% of participants overall) were headache  arthralgia  fall  and back pain.Dietmar Berger  MD  PhDGlobal Head of Development and Chief Medical Officer at Sanofi‚ÄúWe are steadfast in our commitment to developing novel treatment options that have a meaningful impact for patients. We are hopeful that Altuviiio (efanesoctocog alfa) will help deliver on this goal by offering unprecedented factor activity levels with once-weekly dosing  fulfilling its potential as a best-in-class therapy for hemophilia A.‚ÄùQuality of life data from the XTEND-1 study were recently presented at the 64th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition. The findings provided further evidence of the potential positive impact of once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa prophylaxis to provide normal to near-normal factor activity levels for the majority of the week  reduce pain  and improve physical functioning for people with hemophilia A.About Phase 3 XTEND-1 Study (NCT04161495)The Phase 3 XTEND-1 study (NCT04161495) was an open-label  non-randomized interventional study assessing the safety  efficacy  and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa in people 12 years of age or older (n=159) with severe hemophilia A who were previously treated with factor VIII replacement therapy. The study consisted of two parallel treatment arms ‚Äî the prophylaxis Arm A (n=133)  in which patients who had received prior factor VIII prophylaxis were treated with once-weekly intravenous efanesoctocog alfa prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for 52 weeks  and the on-demand Arm B (n=26)  in which patients who had received prior on-demand factor VIII therapy began 26 weeks of on-demand efanesoctocog alfa (50 IU/kg)  then switched to once-weekly prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for an additional 26 weeks.The primary efficacy endpoint was the annualized bleeding rate (ABR) in Arm A  and the key secondary endpoint was an intra-patient comparison of ABR during the efanesoctocog alfa weekly prophylaxis treatment period versus the prior factor VIII prophylaxis ABR for participants in Arm A who had participated in a previous observational study (Study 242HA201/OBS16221).About hemophilia AHemophilia A is a rare  genetic disorder in which the ability of a person‚Äôs blood to clot is impaired due to a missing or defective factor VIII clotting protein. Hemophilia A occurs in about one in 5 000 male births annually  and more rarely in females. People with hemophilia can experience bleeding episodes that can cause pain  irreversible joint damage and life-threatening hemorrhages. Factor replacement therapy remains a cornerstone of care and can be used across multiple treatment scenarios.About efanesoctocog alfaEfanesoctocog alfa is a novel and investigational recombinant factor VIII therapy that is designed to extend protection from bleeds with once-weekly prophylactic dosing for people with hemophilia A. It builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN¬Æ polypeptides to extend its time in circulation. It is the first investigational factor VIII therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which imposes a half-life limitation on current factor VIII therapies. Altuviiio¬Æ is the intended trade name of efanesoctocog alfa in the US  but it could differ in other territories as per the local regulatory requirements; formerly known as BIVV001. Efanesoctocog alfa is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.Efanesoctocog alfa is currently under FDA review and the target action date for the decision is February 28  2023. The FDA also granted efanesoctocog alfa Breakthrough Therapy designation in May 2022  ‚Äì the first factor VIII therapy to receive this recognition ‚Äì Fast Track designation in February 2021  and Orphan Drug designation in August 2017.Regulatory submission in the EU  anticipated in the second half of 2023  will follow availability of data from the ongoing  fully recruited XTEND-Kids paediatric study  expected in the first half of 2023. The European Commission granted efanesoctocog alfa orphan designation in June 2019.

In 2022  Solutions 30‚Äôs consolidated revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨903.0 million  up +3.3% (+1.2% organic growth).Throughout the year  Solutions 30 continued the operational transition of its activities in France  while other geographic markets saw more favorable trends. Orders for the year amounted to nearly ‚Ç¨920 million  an historic high.In such a context  and with the macroeconomic backdrop of rising inflation  Solutions 30 took action to:Develop new  fast-growing activities  especially in the buoyant energy sector where demand will remain strong  driven by the major challenges of energy independence  the transition to new energies  and the electrification of vehicles.Strengthen its central position in the mature French telecoms sector.Negotiate price increases with customers to cover the impact of inflation  a process that is ongoing in France.Actively manage group cash flow to finance fast ramp-ups for recently signed and upcoming contracts.Strengthen synergies between various activities and reassign technicians to activities with greater potential.Review the group‚Äôs sales strategy and value proposition to focus on three market segments: connectivity solutions (solutions focused on connectivity and corresponding to the former ‚Äútelecoms‚Äù business)  energy solutions (solutions focused on the energy sector and corresponding to the former ‚Äúenergy‚Äù business)  and technology solutions (solutions focused on digital technology and including all other group businesses related to IT  security  retail  and connected health).Story continuesRevenue by regionFrance: In the fourth quarter of 2022  Solutions 30 had revenue of ‚Ç¨106.8 million  down 7.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021  but a clear improvement on the 9-month trend.Connectivity solutions (formerly telecoms business) stabilized  with revenue reaching ‚Ç¨76.2 million  down slightly by 3.5%. After record activity during the COVID crisis  which accelerated the roll-out of ultra-fast connections in France  the market returned to more normal activity levels as the year went on. At the same time  the operational conditions of our contracts became more and more of a challenge  made worse by current inflationary pressures. Price renegotiations were undertaken with major clients  but they are still ongoing. This will have repercussions for the industry as a whole  with some players likely to fail  possibly leading to a new phase of consolidation in the sector.Revenue from energy solutions amounted to ‚Ç¨11.8 million  compared with ‚Ç¨16.8 million a year earlier. This decline of 30.1% is due to the end of smart electricity meter deployments in France (activity down 71%). Revenue from new activities related to the energy transition and electric mobility has not yet made up for decreased revenue from historic activities.Technology solutions (formerly IT and others) generated ‚Ç¨18.8 million in revenue  compared to ‚Ç¨19.6 million one year earlier. Revenue from IT services remained stable  while that from payment services was down and that from installing connected objects and security equipment rose significantly.Over the course of the year  revenue in France reached ‚Ç¨425.4 million  down 16.1%.Benelux: Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was ‚Ç¨69.9 million compared to ‚Ç¨46.2 million a year earlier  representing a rise in pure organic growth to 51.3% and reflecting the excellent dynamics of the Belgian and Dutch markets.Connectivity solutions (formerly Telecoms business) grew 57.4% thanks to fast ramp-ups for fiber-optic contracts in Belgium and the Netherlands. Revenue rose to ‚Ç¨52.9 million in the last quarter of 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨33.6 million one year earlier.Revenue from energy solutions amounted to ‚Ç¨12.5 million  compared with ‚Ç¨8.6 million a year earlier  representing purely organic growth of 45.2%. This business benefited from the roll-out of smart meters in Flanders and was also boosted by a significant increase in charging station installations over the quarter.Revenue from technology solutions (formerly IT and others) was up 12.8% to ‚Ç¨4.4 million  compared to ‚Ç¨3.9 million in Q4 2021.During 2022 as a whole  revenue from the Benelux region broke the ‚Ç¨200 million barrier  reaching ‚Ç¨222.0 million  compared to ‚Ç¨160.4 million one year earlier  with 38.4% purely organic growth.In all other countries  the group posted quarterly revenue of ‚Ç¨69.4 million  an increase of 17.9% (12.2% organic growth) compared to the same period in 2021.In Germany  revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨16.1 million compared to ‚Ç¨16.5 million the previous year.In Italy  revenue grew by 28% in the fourth quarter of 2022  reaching ‚Ç¨18 million  driven by ultra-fast infrastructure deployments  which began in the first quarter of 2021.On the Iberian peninsula  revenue grew by 6% to ‚Ç¨15.4 million  thanks to positive dynamics in the telecommunications sector (fiber and 5th generation mobile networks)  a strong uptick in installations of charging stations for electric vehicles  and pricing increases obtained from several customers.In Poland  the group generated ‚Ç¨11.2 million in revenue  an increase of 48% (35% organic growth) thanks to the start of a new contract with Orange covering the Warsaw region. Solutions 30 is continuing to increase its market share in Poland  while also integrating Sirtel into its 5G network portfolio under favorable conditions.Finally  in the United Kingdom  Solutions 30 posted ‚Ç¨8.8 million in revenue during the quarter  up 42% (+3% organic growth).Revenue across all of these countries amounted to ‚Ç¨255.5 million in 2022  an increase of 23.9% (14.8% organic growth) compared to 2021.Appointment: Wojciech Pomyka≈Ça joins the Solutions 30 Management Board as Chief Operations Officer in charge of Transformation.Over the course of 2021 and 2022  Solutions 30 has significantly strengthened its governance  risk management  and compliance processes. As the group enters the second stage of its transformation  Wojciech Pomyka≈Ça joins the Solutions 30 Management Board as Chief Operations Officer in charge of Transformation  effective February 1  2023. In this position  he will steer operational organization in sync with promising areas of development for the group  in particular its strong growth in the telecom market outside France.He will be replacing Franck D‚ÄôAloia  Chief Operations Officer in charge of Integration  who oversaw the integration of acquired companies and supervised changes to Solutions 30‚Äôs organization and processes. Solutions 30 thanks him for his commitment and hard work.Wojciech Pomyka≈Ça has more than 22 years of experience in operations and sales for companies in the telecommunications and energy industries. He started his career at Siemens ‚Äì now Nokia Siemens Network ‚Äì as a project manager  then sales manager  before being put in charge of services development for the Polish operator Polkomtel. He then joined the PGE  the leading electricity supplier in Poland  as CIO/CTO of the shared services subsidiary PGE Systemy  where he set up centralized processes for their IT and telecom activities. He moved within the group  becoming CEO of the subsidiary Exatel  a fixed telecom operator  to implement a business turnaround strategy. In 2015  he was appointed as country manager of Detecon International in Poland  a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom  and then held several positions as chief executive officer and supervisory board member in the energy sector before joining Solutions 30 in 2019 to launch and develop the group‚Äôs business in Poland.Wojciech Pomyka≈Ça is a graduate of Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology in Poland (Master of Science  electronics and telecommunications  postgraduate  digital telecommunications)  also holding an executive MBA from Kozminski University (Poland  2008) and the Harvard Business School General Management Program (USA  2011).Commenting on the appointment  Gianbeppi Fortis  CEO of Solutions 30  said: ‚ÄúI welcome Wojciech to the management board. His appointment reflects the growing magnitude of our activities outside France and the new European dimension of our company. Since 2019  Wojciech has been working on the successful deployment of our business in Poland  and has participated in many cross-functional projects to strengthen our operational efficiency. His extensive experience in the telecommunications industry  his dedication  thoroughness  and determination are all assets that will help us succeed in the second phase of our transformation and accelerate our growth outside France  in line with our ambitions.‚ÄùOutlook2022 was marked by shifts in the geographic balance of our business  with markets outside of France driving group growth as operations within France were forced to adapt. The complete financial information for the year will be published on April 20th  after market close. The EBITDA margin should remain under some temporary pressure  due to (1) ramp-ups during the second half of the year  to (2) price renegotiations that concluded later than expected  and to (3) the impact of increasingly difficult operational conditions for performing contracts in the French telecoms sector.With strong sales throughout the year and 2022 ending on a promising note  the Group confirms double-digit growth in 2023  which will allow to exceed the ‚Ç¨1 billion milestone in revenue. Growth will continue to depend on momentum in markets outside of France  especially fiber-optic roll-outs in the Benelux and in new markets  such as Germany and the United Kingdom. In France  the group will focus on consolidation in the telecommunications sector and on the development of new markets related to the energy transition.The group has solid growth drivers and an effective business model that will help it strengthen its position at the crossroads of the digital transformation and the energy transition. Solutions 30 hopes to reach ‚Ç¨2.5 billion in revenue over the medium term. To finance this growth  the group has a sensible financial policy in place  with the goal of maximizing cash flow and making it possible to self-finance increases in working capital while maintaining a low-debt balance sheet.Financial Information Publication Schedule2022 Annual Report: April 20  20232023 Q1 Revenue Report: May 10  2023Annual Shareholders Meeting: June 16  20232023 Q2 Revenue Report: July 25  20232023 HY Earnings Report: September 21  20232023 Q3 Revenue Report: November 8  20232023 Revenue Report: January 24  2024About Solutions 30 SEThe Solutions 30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

That‚Äôs the message we‚Äôre getting from investment banks ‚Äù said Niall Jones  Euronext Dublin‚Äôs director of listings  ahead of the launch on Thursday of the company‚Äôs fifth IPOready training programme.This year‚Äôs IPOready intake includes Sigma Retail Partners  a retail asset management company that previously looked at an IPO in 2018; green energy business UrbanVolt; and accounting software firm Big Red Cloud.Also among the 14 companies are mobile and cloud security specialist CWSI; security products supplier Fortus; and Inclusio  a technology platform that tracks diversity and inclusion in both the private and public sectors  which this week unveiled plans to create 80 new jobs following a ‚Ç¨6.2 million investment from Enterprise Ireland and a number of venture capitalists.READ MOREEuronext Dublin established an Irish market advisory committee last year to develop a number of proposals to bring to government to help reboot the Irish market for listings.The company‚Äôs pre-Budget 2023 submission to the Government called for tax incentives to be introduced to allow entrepreneurs to sell some of their own shares in a company as part of an IPO. It also urged that a tax credit scheme to reduce the costs of accessing public markets for small- to medium-sized Irish businesses be put in place.Daryl Byrne  chief executive of Euronext Dublin  said that the committee was also working on developing a potential ‚Äúmechanism‚Äù where institutional investors and family offices could come together to take a 10-20 per cent ‚Äúcornerstone investment‚Äù in a company going through an IPO.Others firms taking part in the IPOready programme include Korec  a provider of surveying equipment and mapping systems; outsourced customer communications specialist Mail Metrics; medical billing business MedServ; and Neurent Medical  which has developed a device to provide relief for people suffering from a chronic runny nose.ReaDI-Watch  a software firm that helps companies manage research and development programmes  and tech start-up Seeyou complete the group.The objective of the IPOready programme  which has seen 44 companies graduate since it started in 2015  is to equip participating businesses with an in-depth understanding of all sources of finance available to them and determine which is most suited to their needs.However  only three companies have come to the market in Dublin in the past four years: Uniphar  the healthcare group that raised ‚Ç¨150 million in an IPO in July 2019; Corre Energy  a developer of underground storage solutions for renewable energy that floated in September 2021; and medtech firm HealthBeacon  which in December 2021 became the first IPOready alumnus to take the plunge.,neutral,0.07,0.92,0.0,negative,0.02,0.26,0.72,True,English,"['Irish stock exchange', '2023 IPOs', 'small- to medium-sized Irish businesses', 'fifth IPOready training programme', 'retail asset management company', 'Irish market advisory committee', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'Sigma Retail Partners', 'Big Red Cloud', 'cloud security specialist', 'security products supplier', 'customer communications specialist', 'chronic runny nose', 'past four years', 'underground storage solutions', 'first IPOready alumnus', 'tax credit scheme', 'medical billing business', 'initial public offerings', 'green energy business', 'accounting software firm', 'participating businesses', 'IPOready programme', 'IPOready intake', 'tax incentives', 'Neurent Medical', 'public sectors', 'public markets', 'Corre Energy', 'renewable energy', 'medtech firm', 'second half', 'investment banks', 'Niall Jones', 'technology platform', '80 new jobs', '‚Ç¨6.2 million investment', 'Enterprise Ireland', 'venture capitalists', 'Daryl Byrne', 'chief executive', 'potential ‚Äúmechanism', 'institutional investors', 'family offices', 'cornerstone investment', 'Others firms', 'surveying equipment', 'mapping systems', 'Mail Metrics', 'development programmes', 'depth understanding', 'Euronext Dublin', 'healthcare group', 'new listings', 'three companies', '14 companies', '44 companies', 'operator', 'head', 'message', 'director', 'launch', 'Thursday', 'UrbanVolt', 'mobile', 'CWSI', 'Fortus', 'Inclusio', 'diversity', 'private', 'plans', 'number', 'proposals', 'government', 'entrepreneurs', 'shares', 'costs', 'place', 'Korec', 'provider', 'outsourced', 'MedServ', 'device', 'relief', 'people', 'ReaDI-Watch', 'research', 'start-up', 'objective', 'sources', 'finance', 'needs', 'Uniphar', 'July', 'developer', 'September', 'HealthBeacon', 'December', 'plunge']",2023-01-25,2023-01-26,irishtimes.com

The team also pursued a targeted number of new placement opportunities and new system sales. This strategy has proven to be successful as evidenced by the 2022 sales figures.The decrease in the number of systems and miniprobes is mainly due to the transition from the direct relationship with Youhe Shanghai Medical to the Joint Venture with Tasly: the Company has stopped selling products to Youhe in anticipation of the transfer.
