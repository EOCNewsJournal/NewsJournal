The job cuts are taking place over a 12 month-period and about 15 locations will be affected  he said.“The reality is that the macro environment has become more difficult and has changed a lot ” Van Dijk said. “This also means that the cost of capital has changed a lot  as interest rates go up and risk premiums also go up.”Van Dijk declined to say how many people would lose their jobs. Prosus employed 30 000 people globally at the end of March last year  according to an earnings report  but these roles are spread across corporate hubs and a range of businesses the e-commerce group invests in and operates  including in classified advertising  food delivery and internet payments.Naspers shares closed 1.7% lower in Johannesburg on Wednesday  and Prosus declined 0.2% at 5:15 p.m. in Amsterdam.Read MoreCompanies from Amazon.com Inc. to Alphabet Inc.’s Google have recently announced staff reductions after years of growth  as they seek to lower costs and improve profitability. The tech sector announced 97 171 job cuts in 2022  up 649% compared to the previous year  according to consulting firm Challenger  Gray & Christmas Inc.Prosus will also seek to cut costs at the more than 80 companies it has invested in  although those efforts have different timelines and scales  according to Van Dijk. The company has already closed some offices and made cuts at others  he said. The Euronext-listed firm previously closed its iFood business in Colombia and its autos business in Peru and Ecuador.The measures should help Prosus become profitable by the first half of 2025  according to Van Dijk.The e-commerce firm has been working on narrowing the discount between the sum of its parts and its stake in China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd. for years  with both Prosus and its Cape Town-based parent Naspers having taken a number of steps to address the problem.These include the spinoff of its African PayTV business  the creation of Prosus through the Euronext-listing of its internet holdings  a share swap between Naspers and Prosus  and a number of share buybacks that are ongoing.,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,negative,0.0,0.13,0.87,True,English,"['Tech Layoff', '30% corporate staff', 'Prosus', 'Chief Executive Officer Bob van Dijk', 'latest global tech company', 'Cape Town-based parent Naspers', 'parent Naspers Ltd.', 'Tencent Holdings Ltd.', 'Amazon.com Inc.', 'African PayTV business', 'The Euronext-listed firm', 'Amsterdam-listed Prosus NV', 'largest e-commerce companies', 'Naspers shares', 'internet holdings', 'e-commerce group', 'Alphabet Inc', 'Christmas Inc.', 'iFood business', 'autos business', 'e-commerce firm', 'corporate workforce', 'asset value', 'corporate centers', 'Hong Kong', 'South Africa', 'macro environment', 'interest rates', 'risk premiums', 'earnings report', 'classified advertising', 'food delivery', 'internet payments', 'staff reductions', 'previous year', 'consulting firm', 'different timelines', 'first half', 'share swap', 'share buybacks', 'job cuts', 'many people', 'corporate hubs', '80 companies', '30,000 people', 'Jobs', 'layoffs', 'Europe', 'interview', 'place', '12 month-period', '15 locations', 'reality', 'cost', 'capital', 'end', 'March', 'roles', 'range', 'businesses', 'Johannesburg', 'Wednesday', 'Google', 'years', 'growth', 'profitability', 'sector', 'Challenger', 'Gray', 'efforts', 'scales', 'offices', 'others', 'Colombia', 'Peru', 'Ecuador', 'measures', 'discount', 'sum', 'parts', 'stake', 'China', 'number', 'steps', 'problem', 'spinoff', 'creation', 'Euronext-listing', '5:15']",2023-01-26,2023-01-27,moneycontrol.com

Through its unique approach of combining enzymes and plastics  Carbios aims to address new consumer expectations and the challenges of a broad ecological transition by taking up a major challenge of our time: plastic and textile pollution. Carbios deconstructs any type of PET (the dominant polymer in bottles  trays  textiles made of polyester) into its basic components which can then be reused to produce new PET plastics with equivalent quality to virgin ones. This PET innovation  the first of its kind in the world  was recently recognized in a scientific paper published in front cover of the prestigious journal Nature. Carbios successfully started up its demonstration plant in Clermont-Ferrand in 2021. It has now taken another key step towards the industrialization of its process with the construction of a first-of-a-kind unit in partnership with Indorama Ventures.In 2017  Carbios and L’Oréal co-founded a consortium to contribute to the industrialization of its proprietary recycling technology. Committed to developing innovative solutions for sustainable development  Nestlé Waters  PepsiCo and Suntory Beverage & Food Europe joined this consortium in April 2019. In 2022  Carbios signed an agreement with On  Patagonia  PUMA  and Salomon  to develop solutions promoting the recyclability and circularity of their products.The Company has also developed an enzymatic biodegradation technology for PLA-based (a bio sourced polymer) single-use plastics. This technology can create a new generation of plastics that are 100% compostable at ambient temperatures  even in domestic conditions  integrating enzymes at the heart of the plastic product.For more information  please visit carbios.com / Twitter: Carbios / LinkedIn: Carbios / Instagram: insidecarbiosCarbios (ISIN FR0011648716/ALCRB) is eligible for the PEA-PME  a government program allowing French residents investing in SMEs to benefit from income tax rebates.Translation is for information purposes only.In case of discrepancy between the French and the English version of this press release  the French version shall prevail",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.83,0.16,0.0,True,English,"['Executive Committee', 'Pivotal Year', 'Commercial Development', 'Carbios', 'Industrial', 'Céréales Vallées cluster', 'General Manager Biodegradation Division', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'Senior Vice President', 'past six months', 'Stéphane FERREIRA', 'Prof. Alain MARTY', 'broad ecological transition', 'new consumer expectations', 'European public funding', 'Public Affairs Director', 'Intellectual Property Director', 'General Management experience', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Chief Business Officer', 'Chief Scientific Officer', 'major international groups', 'first twenty employees', 'Executive Committee Members', 'green biotech company', 'Innovation Programs Funding', 'Industrial Development Director', 'paper packaging industry', 'Life Cycle Assessment', 'new PET plastics', 'scientific paper', 'Chief Strategy', 'Financial Officer', 'Innovation Funding', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'LCA Director', 'packaging sector', 'international expansion', 'top management', 'major challenge', 'new position', 'PET innovation', 'leadership team', 'Human Resources', 'Safety departments', 'expanding team', 'ambitious targets', 'Emmanuel LADENT', 'track records', 'pivotal year', 'biorecycling solutions', 'future generations', 'Klockner Pentaplast', 'high-potential subsidiary', 'main mission', 'biodegradation technology', 'numerous recruitments', 'strategic topic', 'positive impact', 'environmental performance', 'agricultural industry', 'PET biorecycling', 'environmental impact', 'specific tools', 'Lionel ARRAS', 'Mathieu BERTHOUD', 'Pascal BRICOUT', 'Lise LUCCHESI', 'Truffle Capital', 'unique approach', 'textile pollution', 'dominant polymer', 'basic components', 'front cover', 'prestigious journal', 'demonstration plant', 'key step', 'Project Management', 'Delphine DENOIZÉ', 'Regulatory News', 'regulatory compliance', 'Martine BRISSET', 'exciting challenge', 'biological technologies', 'several years', 'individual member', 'innovative processes', 'equivalent quality', ""Carbios' activities"", 'Carbios’ attractivity', 'Carbios’ website', 'plastic pollution', 'Carbios Group', 'Carbios’ industrialization', '30 years', 'CLERMONT-FERRAND', 'France', 'ALCRB', 'pioneer', 'textiles', 'appointment', '1 January', 'Health', 'Regulation', 'teams', 'order', 'expertise', 'diversity', 'skills', 'commercialization', 'production', 'thousands', 'tons', 'awesome', 'sense', 'Amcor', 'Huhtamaki', 'Linpac', 'Carbiolice', 'training', 'satisfaction', 'concept', 'reality', 'projects', 'work', 'terms', 'time', 'creation', 'charge', 'French', 'products', 'world', 'Sourcing', 'Visit', 'biographies', 'governance', 'enzymes', 'challenges', 'type', 'bottles', 'trays', 'polyester', 'virgin', 'kind', 'Nature']",2023-01-26,2023-01-27,businesswire.com

They represent approximately 3% of Danone’s global revenues and had a dilutive impact on Danone’s like-for-like sales growth and recurring operating margin in 2022.Antoine de Saint-Affrique  Chief Executive Officer  said:“Both Horizon Organic and Wallaby are strong  much-loved brands with compelling growth opportunities.That said  seen through the lens of our Renew Strategy which requires us to stay disciplined in how we allocate our resources  they fall outside our priority growth areas of focus.We are confident that exploring strategic options for these brands will enable them to get the focus and resources they need and therefore allow them to maximize their potential and unlock further growth.”o o O o oFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements concerning Danone.

17216,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4572606-basic-fit-a-hidden-european-multibagger,Basic-Fit: A Hidden European Gem With Tremendous Upside Potential (OTCMKTS:BSFFF),We believe Basic-Fit is significantly undervalued  both in terms of its current earnings and future prospects. Read more here.,"Peerayot/iStock via Getty ImagesThe new year  2023  is upon us. And it seems to be that time of year for New Year's resolutioners to start exercising again. While Basic-Fit N.V. (OTCPK:BSFFF) could benefit from some of those good intentions  it would still undermine its very strong long-term potential  and its very asymmetrical risk/reward profile.In this article  we explain why Basic-Fit is greatly undervalued and why it could deliver tremendous returns in the coming years  through 2030 and for years beyond  as the ""Ryanair"" or ""Planet Fitness"" of gyms in Europe.A Genius Mixture of Domino's & RyanairSo  what is Basic-Fit  and why are we so positive about it? Basic-Fit is exactly what the name implies: it's a low-cost gym with locations throughout Europe  mainly in the Netherlands  Belgium  France and Spain. They also have clubs in Luxembourg and recently started expanding into Germany.Basic-Fit IRThey ended the year with 1 200 clubs  according to their most recent report. By the same token  they ended the year with a stunning 3.35 million members  up from 2.22 million at the beginning of the year.Their founder initially started by opening premium stores  but then discovered the huge demand for low-cost gyms  and since 2010 they have continued to grow at a rapid pace. Back then  they started by offering very basic memberships around €19.95.Basic-Fit IRThe staggering fact is that the stock is still trading at the same price level  while memberships have nearly doubled since 2018  due to the pandemic and bearish sentiment around Europe entering stagflation with an energy crisis.TradingviewYet we don't think those factors are overly affecting Basic-Fit  given its tremendous growth and unit economics. They're basically a mix between Ryanair and Domino's Pizza. Ryanair in the sense that in Europe  low-cost carriers have been dominant in recent years. And we continue to see that happen in other sectors  such as the success of Aldi and Lidl.And they are also like Domino's Pizza  in that they use population figures  to cluster their stores  to keep the competition away and be as close to their customers as possible. Currently  they are really the only entity that has this many of gym locations  cleverly clustered across these cities.That is also one of the main reasons why they are so successful: with a premium membership  you have access to all Basic-Fit gyms across the country  and even in other countries where Basic-Fit operates. That level of clustering  is what makes the company so special. It also makes it so that people can go to the Basic-Fit closest to their work or home. Or students can visit another Basic-Fit if they are studying in a different city other than closer to home.They create market share or gain market share from the usually smaller  low-cost gyms by providing access to hundreds of gyms for a very low price  and by creating a broad barrier to entry that can only be surpassed with huge amounts of capital  scale and years or decades of expansion  as they spread certain costs across their 1 200 gyms.Basic-Fit IRAt the same time  they are still experiencing the tailwinds of the underdeveloped fitness market in Europe  which is likely to come closer to saturation like the United States and Scandinavian countries  which are at 20%. Markets such as France and Belgium currently only have a penetration rate of about 10%.Basic-Fit IRCost And Unit EconomicsSo let's take a look at the costs and economics of Basic-Fit  because we think these have been completely overlooked. That could also simply be because it is an overseas asset  traded in Amsterdam on Euronext. Nevertheless  it is a €1.95B ($2.12BN) company.Basic-Fit has also fairly recently changed its membership structure in France  where you still had a basic subscription  which is now being replaced by a ""comfort"" subscription  which will cost €24.99 per four weeks to access all clubs in France or €29.99 for Premium which gives you access to clubs across Europe. We think we could start to see that tailwind soon  releasing even more upside potential  as France is currently their largest target market.But to look at Basic-Fit's cost structure  we first look at what makes a mature club. A mature club is one that has generally been around for about 24 months. On average  it costs Basic-Fit €1.2M to build a club. An adult club has an average of 3 350 members per club. That means they bring in €840K per year per club.Basic-Fit IRNow the club still has two costs: overhead costs for the club itself  and shared costs that are shared between the clubs. Of the €840K revenue  about 50% goes to Rent (about 17.5%)  Labor (about 15%) and other costs (about 17.5%). Which means we are left with €420K of EBITDA per club. In other words  with the 1200 clubs they already have  they should be able to bring in an EBITDA of over €504M at the end.Of course  you have to subtract from that the shared costs per club  such as headquarters costs  marketing  car rental  etc. Currently  those expenses are still a bit high because  of course  they are still expanding new clubs. Their guideline currently is about 6% of revenue for marketing  and 5-6% for headquarters costs in the medium term due to operating leverage.That leaves €100.8 million for shared overhead. If we take the clubs' €504 million EBITDA and subtract the shared costs  we are left with €403.2 million adjusted EBITDA. For a company that grows memberships and clubs by over 20%  it is only trading at 4-5x adjusted EBITDA  which we think is extremely undervalued.This operating leverage with shared costs should only grow  as the incremental cost of monitoring more clubs should remain more or less the same. It is somewhat the principle of Wright's Law  after which we named ourselves. For each cumulative doubling of the number of units  the cost decreases by a fixed percentage. The law applies perfectly to Basic-Fit  which is currently growing rapidly.Basic-Fit IRDespite being a European company  they are very innovative when it comes to cost savings. Like you can see in the image above  they use AI and computation to monitor their facilities  which they can operate 24/7. Unlike smaller fitness chains  they are also able to centralize every data point they have in order to optimize gym temperature  energy cost savings  repairs  etc.We believe no other competitor even comes close to the level of operational leverage that Basic-Fit currently has. It is virtually impossible to compete as an individual gym that employs 4-5 people as cleaners  bookkeepers  trainers and managers versus a grassroots gym that can theoretically operate 24/7 without full-time employees.ValuationTaking into account the golden rules of value investing  there are always two rules to follow. Rule #1 is don't lose money. Rule 2 is: don't forget rule #1. Basic-Fit seems to fit well into this category  as current earnings provide great downside protection  as the company with their mature clubs right now only trades at 4-5x adjusted EBITDA.But when it comes to what 2030 might look like for Basic-Fit  the upside potential seems huge. They are aiming to expand to 3000-3500 clubs in Europe  adding clubs to the countries where they already operate  while also expanding into new countries such as Germany. They maintain and set their requirements at 30%+ ROIC per club. That  with 20%+ growth in revenue and members.Basic-Fit IRTo stay grounded and remaining somewhat conservative  we assume the low margin of their target of 3 000 clubs by 2030. For the number of members per club  we stick to 3 300 members per club for mature clubs  as we see now and for 2019 in normal times. That would equate to 9.9 million members by 2030.Revenue per member in October 2022 is €22.50 per month  although we think there is much more leverage because Basic-Fit is priced much  much lower than its competitors. But for this valuation  we assume that Basic-Fit will keep this average monthly price pretty close to absorb all the market share  despite high inflation in Europe and other gym chains raising their prices. We think inflation in Europe could be at least 4%. That would mean that their subscription  adjusted for inflation  should be worth €29.5 in 2030.But in 2030 we assume €25.5 per month. That would bring Basic-Fit's revenue to €252.45M per month  or €3.03BN per year. In terms of Club EBITDA  which is currently 50%  we think there will be more margin as Basic-Fit achieves economies of scale. But for this example  we will stay at 50% Club Margin  bringing Club EBITDA down to €1.51BN per year. For overhead costs  however  we believe there is tremendous leverage as they remain relatively fixed as scale increases. Shared overhead costs at 8% of revenues would equate to €242.4M. €1.51BN minus €242.4M shared overhead brings us to €1.27BN group EBITDA.We still have to deduct maintenance costs  which management says are about €70K per adult club annually  or €210M per year. Net interest expense should come down to about €90M. If we deduct these costs  we arrive at €970M pre-tax. We apply a simple flat tax rate of 25% and subtract another €242.5M  arriving at a final result of €727.5M.Basic-Fit IRThe last piece of the puzzle we still need is the number of shares that will be outstanding. We think Basic-Fit will use excess capital to repurchase shares rather than pay dividends as long as they are growing.Bearing any unforeseen circumstances  we expect to become self-financing halfway 2023 ... I can clearly say that we will finance our own growth. We'll be able to finance our own growth with our own money that we make  our own cash flow. And that will be in the second half - as from the second half of 2023. No different circumstances  no lockdowns  and based off  of course  on the amount of openings that we want to do. (1H 2022 Meeting)That means they could outlay the excess cash they generate to buy back shares unless they are able to grow faster and still meet the 30% ROIC criterion. According to our calculations  they might be able to buy about 6% of float annually  which would reduce the number of shares from 66 million to 38.28 million by 2030.In short  with 38.28 million shares outstanding and €727.5 million in earnings  our estimates put us at an EPS of €19.00 per share in 2030. At a reasonable multiple of 15x  that would mean a share price of €285 per share  or an amazing CAGR of 38.13%.The Untold LeverageEven though those estimates already sound preposterous  there is room to believe there could be even more upside beyond our estimates  and beyond 2030. Let's examine what leverage Basic-Fit could exert if they finally decided to increase membership fees  since they are still well below the industry average.Let's say they increase membership fees by €1. Price increases alone  in a subscription form  flow directly into the results  unless membership numbers deteriorate  of course. But a price increase of €1 per month  at 9.9 million members in 2030  means an additional €9.9 million per month  or €118.8 million per year in pure profit. At a multiple of 15x  that extra €1 per month could add another €1.78BN in market cap to the stock.We think market participants are completely overlooking Basic-Fit's leverage in this regard. They are also quite resilient to inflation. Like Coca-Cola  they have the advantage of enormous scale and can make a huge difference with a small price increase.Basic-Fit IRIf you really want to play the population game  and try to imagine where Basic-Fit might end up  we can look at the aspirations of Planet Fitness. They see a potential of up to 50% market share in the US. If we calculate that back to Europe  the maximum potential could even exceed 35 million members  in some of the countries we think they could enter.Total 352.33M 70.47M 35.23M Country Total Population 20% Propensity 50% Share Spain 47.42M 9.48M 4.74M Portugal 10.33M 2.07M 1.03M France 67.75M 13.55M 6.78M Belgium 11.59M 2.32M 1.16M Netherlands 17.53M 3.51M 1.75M Germany 83.20M 16.64M 8.32M Switzerland 8.70M 1.74M 0.87M Italy 59.11M 11.82M 5.91M Poland 37.75M 7.55M 3.78M Austria 8.95M 1.79M 0.90M Click to enlargeAs for management  they also seem to be very down-to-earth entrepreneurs  with the CEO still a founder. The founder  René Moos  used to be a professional tennis player  and seems to have brought his competitive spirit to the business landscape. Management seems very united and is trying to look 10 years ahead.The management team is also relatively prudently compensated compared to companies in the United States. René Moos  who currently owns 14.37% of the outstanding shares  actually bought some more shares on the open market in November when they were trading around €22. He bought an additional 150 000 shares.Risks To Our ThesisAs for the risks in our thesis  we cannot immediately identify clear direct threats  but would perhaps point to some of the smaller gym chains. We also think that one of the reasons Basic-Fit has been able to make so much progress is that they have had access to capital markets and strong venture capital because their business model works brilliantly.Just as in theory it would be possible to compete with Ryanair  in practice it is a mission that not many would want to fund. Paradoxically  Basic-Fit seems to be the only giant in the room that has such robust liquidity and access to capital. Many of the smaller players are either highly leveraged or unable to raise capital or expand efficiently  it seems to us. It's a difficult flywheel to get started. And it's not like the current players are eager to pick a fight.Landlords also want to rent to Basic-Fit because of their credit rating. And now that they've clustered their locations  they were the first ones to do that and have the first man advantage. You would have to be considered a kamikaze to open an individual gym in a cluster of  say  three Basic-Fit gyms.Unlike the United States  venture capital markets and going public as a company seem to be much less the culture. Europe is not Silicon Valley. And with the ECB and Federal Reserve tightening policy  it's becoming even more difficult to raise additional capital for those players in that increasingly expensive Eurodollar market.Basic-Fit IROutside of competition  the company may still face headwinds in the short to medium term as Europe continues to face an energy crisis and what appears to be a stagflationary environment. Although Basic-Fit can be seen as a company more resilient to all weather conditions  as a cheap fitness club membership is usually the last thing people want to skimp on.They have fixed price contracts for 75% of their projected energy consumption by 2023 and have created an energy task force to reduce their energy expenditures. We believe that by 2030  most  if not all  energy shocks will be gone.Basic-Fit currently has net debt of about €690 million  which they should be able to carry as they self-fund in the second half of 2023. They have a revolving credit facility/syndicated loan and a net debt/adjusted EBITDA covenant of 3.5x  which we believe will not be exceeded unless there is another force majeure like in 2020.Basic-Fit IRThe Bottom LineWe regard Basic-Fit as one of the best value propositions currently available in the equity markets. It is a fantastic business model  with a large moat  and is efficiently run by a management team with a long-term vision.The company seems to be in the unique position of being the first to trade and build a wide moat around its fortress with clustered gyms. The fact that it currently trades at 4-5x the clubs' current mature underlying EBITDA makes it dirt cheap and should provide a hedge against downside risk  with the upside being in excess of 35% CAGR. The bearishness around Europe  its energy crisis and stagflation environment should not include Basic-Fit.And perhaps it is overlooked because it is a hidden asset traded on Euronext  and its results are not yet visible in its current revenue/cash flow statements.

After a strong first half  Tolling Sales (+2.4%) were impacted by the slowdown in demand in the second half  while Package Sales grew steadily over the year as a whole (+14.8%)  driven by the momentum of European markets.Sales evolution by quarter and by activity(€M) 2022 2021 Variation Q1 6.61 5.91 + 12.0 % Q2 7.34 6.54 + 12.2 % Q3 6.73 6.39 + 5.3 % Q4 5.78 6.39 - 9.5 % Annual total 26.47 25.23 + 4.9 % Of which Tolling Sales 20.60 20.13 + 2.4 % Package Sales1 5.86 5.11 + 14.8 %Significant events of the financial yearIn a challenging economic environment marked by the return of high inflation  COIL recorded a solid increase in sales of 4.9% in 2022. However  the fourth quarter was down by 9.5% compared to the prior year due to de-stocking in the distribution chain.In a global environment providing little visibility  particularly with regard to energy costs  the Company continued its strategy of improving its industrial performance by focusing its operations in the short term on its Landen site in Belgium  where energy prices were lower  and by relying on its high-efficiency line 6 in Germany.The Company also stepped up its policy to reduce its carbon footprint by increasing investments in energy efficiency. In partnership with local renewable energy operators  the Company commissioned a photovoltaic farm at its Bernburg site in Germany in October 2022  thereby enabling it to supply 20% of the electricity used by the site with green energy at competitive costs. Studies on a similar action plan for the production site in Belgium have also been initiated.Tolling sales: slowdown in demand in the second halfTolling sales (€20.6 million) increased by 2.4% compared to 2021 and accounted for 77.8% of annual sales in 2022  compared to 79.8% the previous year. They were unstable between the first half (+18.5%) and the second half (-13.2%). Initially  the temporary shortage of aluminium supplies resulting from the post-COVID economic recovery led to exceptionally long delivery times for flat rolled aluminium products from rolling mills. This led distributors to overstock so as to ensure supply to their customers  resulting in a sharp rise in aluminium prices to record levels in the first quarter. Subsequently  as the supply problems eased  the price fell suddenly and dramatically  leading distributors to reduce their stocks.Story continuesPackage sales: recovery driven by the dynamics of European marketsPackage sales (€5.9 million)  which include pre-anodised metal supplied directly to the end-customer  grew by 14.8% compared to 2021 and accounted for 22.2% of 2022 annual sales  compared to 20.2% the previous year. This increase is due to the sustained development of sales in Europe  with deliveries for several emblematic projects. This compensated for the absence of deliveries in Russia due to the conflict in Ukraine and lower billings in Asia due to costs and delivery times of anodising quality aluminium. The Company expects Asian markets to recover in 2023 with the reopening of borders and the delivery of several new projects.OutlookIn an uncertain global economic environment  COIL maintains a cautious approach to 2023 and anticipates lower demand for tolling services in the first half compared to the previous year  as distributors continue to reduce their stocks and competition emerges in the European continuous anodising market.In the short term  the Company has taken steps to limit the impact of the slowdown in tolling activities by increasing its prices in line with inflation  continuing to optimise its variable cost base and supporting the commercial development of its Package offers. Investments made over the last few years and the flexibility of its industrial tool will enable it to react efficiently to market improvements.In the medium to long term  the Company is confident in its development prospects by capitalising on its broad portfolio of premium  sustainable and low carbon footprint products to increase the potential of its business.Indicative 2023 calendar28 April 2023 2022 annual results and annual financial report 7 June 2023 Annual General Meeting 27 July 2023 First half 2023 sales 31 October 2023 First half 2023 results and half-year financial reportPress releases are issued after close of trading.About COILCOIL is the world's leading anodiser in the building and industrial sectors and trades under the ALOXIDE brand name.Anodising is an electrochemical process (electrolysis) which develops a natural  protective oxide layer on the surface of aluminium and can be coloured in a range of UV-proof finishes. It gives the metal excellent resistance to corrosion and/or reinforces its functional qualities. Anodising preserves all the natural and ecological properties of aluminium; it retains its high rigidity and excellent strength-to-weight ratio  its non-magnetic properties  its exceptional resistance to corrosion. The metal remains totally and repeatedly recyclable through simple re-melting. Anodised aluminium is used in a wide variety of industries and applications: architecture  design  manufacturing and the automotive sector.COIL deploys an industrial model that creates value by leveraging its unique know-how  its operational excellence  the quality of its investments and the expertise of its people. COIL has around 120 employees in Belgium and Germany and generated a turnover of €26 5 million in 2022.Listed on Euronext Growth Paris | Isin: BE0160342011 | Reuters: ALCOI.PA | Bloomberg: ALCOI: FPFor more information  please visit www.aloxide.comContactCOILTim Hutton | Chief Executive Officertim.hutton@coil.be | Tel.: +32 (0)11 88 01 88 CALYPTUSCyril Combecyril.combe@calyptus.net | Tel.: +33 (0)1 53 65 68 681 Anodising and metal includedAttachment,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.36,0.08,0.56,True,English,"['PREVIOUS YEAR', 'COIL', '2022 SALES', 'THE', 'natural, protective oxide layer', 'local renewable energy operators', 'flat rolled aluminium products', 'low carbon footprint products', 'uncertain global economic environment', 'European continuous anodising market', 'challenging economic environment', 'similar action plan', 'several emblematic projects', 'several new projects', 'variable cost base', 'ALOXIDE brand name', 'half-year financial report', 'COVID economic recovery', 'Annual General Meeting', 'annual financial report', 'strong first half', 'First half 2023 results', 'long delivery times', 'global environment', 'market improvements', 'annual results', 'European markets', 'long term', 'energy efficiency', 'green energy', '2022 financial year', '9.5 % Annual total', 'second half', 'energy costs', 'energy prices', 'aluminium anodising', 'Package Sales1', 'Significant events', 'distribution chain', 'little visibility', 'industrial performance', 'short term', 'photovoltaic farm', 'temporary shortage', 'aluminium supplies', 'rolling mills', 'sharp rise', 'first quarter', 'sustained development', 'lower billings', 'quality aluminium', 'Asian markets', 'cautious approach', 'tolling services', 'tolling activities', 'commercial development', 'Package offers', 'industrial tool', 'development prospects', 'broad portfolio', 'premium, sustainable', 'Indicative 2023 calendar', 'Press releases', 'leading anodiser', 'industrial sectors', 'electrochemical process', 'UV-proof finishes', 'excellent resistance', 'functional qualities', 'ecological properties', 'high rigidity', 'excellent strength', 'annual sales', 'PREVIOUS YEAR', 'prior year', 'Landen site', 'Bernburg site', 'production site', 'fourth quarter', 'competitive costs', 'aluminium prices', 'Sales evolution', 'Tolling sales', 'world leader', 'high inflation', 'solid increase', 'high-efficiency line', 'supply problems', 'pre-anodised metal', 'lower demand', 'The Company', '2022 SALES', 'COIL', 'Brussels', 'January', 'slowdown', 'momentum', 'activity', 'Variation', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4', 'return', 'stocking', 'regard', 'strategy', 'operations', 'Belgium', 'Germany', 'policy', 'investments', 'partnership', 'October', 'electricity', 'Studies', 'post', 'distributors', 'customers', 'record', 'levels', 'stocks', 'Story', 'dynamics', 'end-customer', 'deliveries', 'absence', 'Russia', 'conflict', 'Ukraine', 'reopening', 'borders', 'Outlook', 'competition', 'steps', 'impact', 'last', 'years', 'flexibility', 'medium', 'potential', 'business', '28 April', 'close', 'trading', 'building', 'trades', 'electrolysis', 'surface', 'range', 'corrosion']",2023-01-26,2023-01-27,finance.yahoo.com

On the Euronext stock exchange in Paris  shares in the chipmaker rose 9 percent to their highest level in just over a year. In its wake  Infineon rose 4.5 percent. The shares of chip industry suppliers such as ASML and Aixtron also rose.STMicroelectronics expects sales of $16.8 billion to $17.8 billion this year. The midpoint of that range of $17.3 billion beats the consensus estimate by more than six percent  analyst Sandeep Deshpande of bank JPMorgan wrote in an initial reaction to numbers and outlook. For year-end earnings  this represents a 25 percent increase in the consensus estimate compared to current market expectations  he added.""The outlook is very strong and should go down well with investors "" the expert said. He added that the company was apparently already able to make a good assessment of future developments at the beginning of the year. However  he added  it is still important to be cautious  because in a difficult economic environment  the order situation can change quickly  even though this has clearly not been the case so far.Analyst Jürgen Wagner of investment house Stifel praised STMicroelectronics' targets for profitability in the current first quarter. Thus  the target for the gross margin of 48 percent is above the market expectation of 45.4 percent. The company thus stands out positively from the recent  rather cautious forecasts of the U.S. chip giant Texas Instruments.The German industry giant Infineon will publish its quarterly report on Thursday of next week. Here  investors have recently become somewhat more confident again: From the lows around 28 euros at the end of December  they recovered by almost 15 percent at the closing price on the previous day.

Embracing expressiveness and a sense of home  the brand’s new vision of design comes to life through three overarching concepts that blend comfortably with each hotel’s local aesthetic.The three new concepts - Agora  Plaza  and Square - were created through a competition that engaged creatives from around the world. Each concept offers a unique take on modern comfort and hospitality  while retaining ibis’ signature style elements such as dotted feature walls  multi-functional spaces  and guestrooms that feel like home.Standout design features include murals  creative design accents and artwork by local artists that embrace and celebrate the local culture and lifestyle. The open concept lobby embraces the vibe of the surrounding neighborhood – a social hub designed for a mix of possibilities and atmospheres – extending into the street with a transparent facade and outdoor seating areas. The brand’s passion for music ensures there is always a groove  with live musicians  DJs  and cool playlists throughout the day and night  while a lively bar area welcomes guests  locals  and passersby to enjoy an espresso  a cocktail  a bite to eat  and a chance to freely live in the moment.A trifecta of design conceptsThe Agora design concept was created by Innocad  an Austrian design team  and can be experienced at select hotels around the world including ibis Barcelona Plaza Glories. Here  the social hub/lobby is styled as an urban café  open to the city – a place to gather  connect  and share ideas  like an agora of ancient times. With youthful street style  the vibrant interior features a refined design of black and white  with pops of color  signature dotted walls and original art. Boldly patterned floors lead guests through the interior and outdoor space  which features an eclectic mix of seating and trendy lighting. In the Agora guestrooms  crisp white linens and neutral furnishings create a backdrop for monochromatic images of the moon  mars or the ocean printed across the ceilings – creating a feeling of calm  lightness and space. The color pop comes in the brightly hued bathroom  creating contrast and visual separation from the bedroom  along with an energizing  mood-lifting vibe.Source: AccorThe Plaza design concept  by FGMF in Brazil  is exemplified at ibis Sao Paulo Barra Funda. The warm woods of South America mix with raw metals  creating a hip  modern residential feel  with a distinctly industrial edge. In the open-air lobby  a central bar dominates the space  inviting guests to gather around and mingle about the social hub  freed from visual boundaries. Banquettes and seating areas with comfy pillows flow from indoors to out. Neon signs guide guests throughout the space  adding color and energy  while abundant plants and ironwork ceiling panels add visual interest and texture. Guestrooms in the Plaza concept continue the theme of a casual  warm  living style  with edgy wood and metal features  such as a wall of open shelving where guests store clothing and personal items  mixed among a display of bold and authentic art objects.Source: AccorThe Square design concept  created by Soda  in Thailand  comes to life in a sublime way at ibis Béthune. With a calming spirit of zen and loads of natural light  the Square lobby concept feels like an airy loft with a comfortable at-home vibe. The space is designed with a long  linear flow  anchored by a bar along one side  with communal tables for dining or working together. Walls are lined with open shelving to display books and art objects  oversize lighting creates ambiance  and huge comfy sofas are ideal for sinking into and enjoying deep conversations or listening to live music. Movable screens add possibility and flexibility to the multifunctional space. In the aesthetically minimalist guestrooms  a single oversize work of modern art sets the tone  and each piece is chosen for its calming and balancing effects. The bed is the central zone – serving as a place of rest  as well as a spot for relaxing or working. Connectivity is key  with ample sockets and hookups for recharging  giving guests the freedom to balance their work  rest and play as they see fit  in the privacy of their own room  or in the social spaces beyond.Source: AccorAbout Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

According to preliminary figures  the company recorded double-digit percentage growth in sales revenue and earnings year-over-year. For fiscal 2023  Sartorius Stedim Biotech projects further growth and continued high profitability.Sartorius Logo (PRNewsfoto/Sartorius)""After two exceptionally dynamic years  we delivered another year of strong results. Despite the challenging operating environment  our growth was broad-based across the portfolio and the geographies  and we see us a good year ahead of our mid-term plan. Not surprisingly  2023 will show a trend back towards our underlying growth path. For the current year  we expect moderate sales revenue growth and aim to maintain our profit margin at around the high prior-year level. As we look ahead  we find the fundamental growth drivers in our markets fully intact. Demand for biopharmaceuticals is on the rise in all indication areas and regions  and at the same time the biotech industry is in an extraordinarily innovative phase. We are excellently positioned to support our customers in their endeavors and to seize the opportunities that arise from this. Substantial investments into capacities and acquisitions that expand our capabilities will therefore remain part of our growth strategy. While our basic assessment of mid-term market trends has not changed  we are raising our 2025 sales revenue forecast to around 4.4 billion euros to reflect changes in price levels caused by inflation. At the same time  we confirm our profitability target of an EBITDA margin of more than 35 percent "" said Joachim Kreuzburg  Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO.Business development of the Group1Sales revenue rose by 15.1 percent in constant currencies (organic: +13.2 percent; reported: +21.0 percent) year-over-year to 3 493 million euros in fiscal 2022  driven by significant organic growth. As expected  the contribution from acquisitions2 was around 2 percentage points. All product areas recorded growth  while the Covid-19-related business declined significantly from the prior year. All three business regions – EMEA3  the Americas  and Asia | Pacific – expanded significantly  with the Americas region posting the strongest gain. The restrictions in China caused by the pandemic as well as the strong reduction of the business in Russia impacted growth to a relatively minor extent.Following two exceptionally strong years due to the pandemic  order intake1 as expected recorded a year-over-year decline against the backdrop of demand normalization and a significantly lower Covid-19-related business  reaching 3 315 million euros (in constant currencies: -13.0 percent  reported: -9.5 percent). Excluding the Covid-19-related business  order intake would have grown slightly. The development of the previous two years had been positively influenced by high demand from coronavirus vaccine manufacturers and changed ordering patterns by some customers  who had placed orders larger in size and further in advance than usual.Underlying EBITDA rose by 18.2 percent to 1 221 million euros in 2022. The resulting margin was 35.0 percent  compared to 35.8 percent in the prior year. The 2021 margin had been positively influenced by a partially delayed cost development  for example as a result of deferred new hires in relation to sales revenue growth because of the pandemic and low business travel activity. As planned  these cost positions normalized in 2022 and had a dampening effect on profitability. Price effects on the procurement and customer sides largely offset each other.Relevant net profit1 reached 797 million euros  representing an increase of 15.8 percent from the prior year. Underlying earnings per share were 8.64 euros (prior year: 7.46 euros).Key financial indicatorsSartorius Stedim Biotech continues to have a very sound balance sheet and financial base. Equity was 2 514 million euros as of December 31  2022  corresponding to an equity ratio1 of 49.6 percent (December 31  2021: 1 733 million euros and 43.9 percent  respectively)  and gross debt was 1 136 million euros (December 31  2021: 626 million euros). Net debt stood at 1 029 million euros  resulting in a ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA1 of 0.8 (December 31  2021: 402 million euros and 0.4  respectively). Cash flow from investing activities was -442 million euros  compared with -324 million euros in 2021. The ratio of capital expenditures (CAPEX) to sales revenue was 12.3 percent (prior year: 11.2 percent).Increase in the number of employeesAs of December 31  2022  Sartorius Stedim Biotech had a total of 11 934 employees worldwide  1 525 more than at the end of 2021. Following a significant increase in the first six months of 2022  the pace of new hires slowed down as the second half of the year began  as planned.Outlook for fiscal 2023Following the exceptionally strong previous years  Sartorius Stedim Biotech expects further growth in 2023 despite demand normalization and anticipated further declines in the Covid-19-related business. Consolidated sales revenue is expected to increase by an amount in the low single-digit percentage range. Excluding the Covid-19-related business  the increase would be in the mid to high single-digit percentage range. Acquisitions are anticipated to contribute around 1 percentage point to growth. The Group's underlying EBITDA margin should be around the level of the prior year (35.0 percent).The company will continue its comprehensive capacity expansion program in 2023. The CAPEX ratio should be at roughly 12.5 percent and the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA at about 0.5. Possible acquisitions are not included in this projection.Medium-term sales revenue target for fiscal 2025 updatedBased on the unchanged strong fundamental growth trends in its markets and the resulting positive prospects for the company  Sartorius Stedim Biotech confirms its fundamental growth projections. In light of increased inflation and associated price adjustments  the company therefore is making a mathematical adjustment to its medium-term sales revenue forecast and now expects sales revenue of around 4.4 billion euros in 2025 (previously around 4 billion euros). Sartorius Stedim Biotech plans to achieve this sales revenue increase primarily through organic growth and additionally by acquisitions.The forecast for the Group's underlying EBITDA margin in 2025 remains unchanged at more than 35 percent. The margin target includes expenses of around 1 percent of Group sales revenue for measures to reduce the company's CO 2 emission intensity.All forecasts are based on constant currencies  as in the past years. In addition  management points out that the dynamics and volatilities in the life science and biopharma sectors have increased over the past years and the coronavirus pandemic has further amplified these trends. Moreover  the forecasts are based on the assumption of no deterioration in the geopolitical and global economic situation  supply chains  inflation and energy supply  and no new relevant restrictions in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. Accordingly  current forecasts show higher uncertainties than usual.1 Sartorius Stedim Biotech publishes alternative performance measures that are not defined by international accounting standards.

In 2022  Solutions 30’s consolidated revenue amounted to €903.0 million  up +3.3% (+1.2% organic growth).Throughout the year  Solutions 30 continued the operational transition of its activities in France  while other geographic markets saw more favorable trends. Orders for the year amounted to nearly €920 million  an historic high.In such a context  and with the macroeconomic backdrop of rising inflation  Solutions 30 took action to:Develop new  fast-growing activities  especially in the buoyant energy sector where demand will remain strong  driven by the major challenges of energy independence  the transition to new energies  and the electrification of vehicles.Strengthen its central position in the mature French telecoms sector.Negotiate price increases with customers to cover the impact of inflation  a process that is ongoing in France.Actively manage group cash flow to finance fast ramp-ups for recently signed and upcoming contracts.Strengthen synergies between various activities and reassign technicians to activities with greater potential.Review the group’s sales strategy and value proposition to focus on three market segments: connectivity solutions (solutions focused on connectivity and corresponding to the former “telecoms” business)  energy solutions (solutions focused on the energy sector and corresponding to the former “energy” business)  and technology solutions (solutions focused on digital technology and including all other group businesses related to IT  security  retail  and connected health).Story continuesRevenue by regionFrance: In the fourth quarter of 2022  Solutions 30 had revenue of €106.8 million  down 7.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021  but a clear improvement on the 9-month trend.Connectivity solutions (formerly telecoms business) stabilized  with revenue reaching €76.2 million  down slightly by 3.5%. After record activity during the COVID crisis  which accelerated the roll-out of ultra-fast connections in France  the market returned to more normal activity levels as the year went on. At the same time  the operational conditions of our contracts became more and more of a challenge  made worse by current inflationary pressures. Price renegotiations were undertaken with major clients  but they are still ongoing. This will have repercussions for the industry as a whole  with some players likely to fail  possibly leading to a new phase of consolidation in the sector.Revenue from energy solutions amounted to €11.8 million  compared with €16.8 million a year earlier. This decline of 30.1% is due to the end of smart electricity meter deployments in France (activity down 71%). Revenue from new activities related to the energy transition and electric mobility has not yet made up for decreased revenue from historic activities.Technology solutions (formerly IT and others) generated €18.8 million in revenue  compared to €19.6 million one year earlier. Revenue from IT services remained stable  while that from payment services was down and that from installing connected objects and security equipment rose significantly.Over the course of the year  revenue in France reached €425.4 million  down 16.1%.Benelux: Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was €69.9 million compared to €46.2 million a year earlier  representing a rise in pure organic growth to 51.3% and reflecting the excellent dynamics of the Belgian and Dutch markets.Connectivity solutions (formerly Telecoms business) grew 57.4% thanks to fast ramp-ups for fiber-optic contracts in Belgium and the Netherlands. Revenue rose to €52.9 million in the last quarter of 2022  compared to €33.6 million one year earlier.Revenue from energy solutions amounted to €12.5 million  compared with €8.6 million a year earlier  representing purely organic growth of 45.2%. This business benefited from the roll-out of smart meters in Flanders and was also boosted by a significant increase in charging station installations over the quarter.Revenue from technology solutions (formerly IT and others) was up 12.8% to €4.4 million  compared to €3.9 million in Q4 2021.During 2022 as a whole  revenue from the Benelux region broke the €200 million barrier  reaching €222.0 million  compared to €160.4 million one year earlier  with 38.4% purely organic growth.In all other countries  the group posted quarterly revenue of €69.4 million  an increase of 17.9% (12.2% organic growth) compared to the same period in 2021.In Germany  revenue amounted to €16.1 million compared to €16.5 million the previous year.In Italy  revenue grew by 28% in the fourth quarter of 2022  reaching €18 million  driven by ultra-fast infrastructure deployments  which began in the first quarter of 2021.On the Iberian peninsula  revenue grew by 6% to €15.4 million  thanks to positive dynamics in the telecommunications sector (fiber and 5th generation mobile networks)  a strong uptick in installations of charging stations for electric vehicles  and pricing increases obtained from several customers.In Poland  the group generated €11.2 million in revenue  an increase of 48% (35% organic growth) thanks to the start of a new contract with Orange covering the Warsaw region. Solutions 30 is continuing to increase its market share in Poland  while also integrating Sirtel into its 5G network portfolio under favorable conditions.Finally  in the United Kingdom  Solutions 30 posted €8.8 million in revenue during the quarter  up 42% (+3% organic growth).Revenue across all of these countries amounted to €255.5 million in 2022  an increase of 23.9% (14.8% organic growth) compared to 2021.Appointment: Wojciech Pomykała joins the Solutions 30 Management Board as Chief Operations Officer in charge of Transformation.Over the course of 2021 and 2022  Solutions 30 has significantly strengthened its governance  risk management  and compliance processes. As the group enters the second stage of its transformation  Wojciech Pomykała joins the Solutions 30 Management Board as Chief Operations Officer in charge of Transformation  effective February 1  2023. In this position  he will steer operational organization in sync with promising areas of development for the group  in particular its strong growth in the telecom market outside France.He will be replacing Franck D’Aloia  Chief Operations Officer in charge of Integration  who oversaw the integration of acquired companies and supervised changes to Solutions 30’s organization and processes. Solutions 30 thanks him for his commitment and hard work.Wojciech Pomykała has more than 22 years of experience in operations and sales for companies in the telecommunications and energy industries. He started his career at Siemens – now Nokia Siemens Network – as a project manager  then sales manager  before being put in charge of services development for the Polish operator Polkomtel. He then joined the PGE  the leading electricity supplier in Poland  as CIO/CTO of the shared services subsidiary PGE Systemy  where he set up centralized processes for their IT and telecom activities. He moved within the group  becoming CEO of the subsidiary Exatel  a fixed telecom operator  to implement a business turnaround strategy. In 2015  he was appointed as country manager of Detecon International in Poland  a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom  and then held several positions as chief executive officer and supervisory board member in the energy sector before joining Solutions 30 in 2019 to launch and develop the group’s business in Poland.Wojciech Pomykała is a graduate of Wrocław University of Science and Technology in Poland (Master of Science  electronics and telecommunications  postgraduate  digital telecommunications)  also holding an executive MBA from Kozminski University (Poland  2008) and the Harvard Business School General Management Program (USA  2011).Commenting on the appointment  Gianbeppi Fortis  CEO of Solutions 30  said: “I welcome Wojciech to the management board. His appointment reflects the growing magnitude of our activities outside France and the new European dimension of our company. Since 2019  Wojciech has been working on the successful deployment of our business in Poland  and has participated in many cross-functional projects to strengthen our operational efficiency. His extensive experience in the telecommunications industry  his dedication  thoroughness  and determination are all assets that will help us succeed in the second phase of our transformation and accelerate our growth outside France  in line with our ambitions.”Outlook2022 was marked by shifts in the geographic balance of our business  with markets outside of France driving group growth as operations within France were forced to adapt. The complete financial information for the year will be published on April 20th  after market close. The EBITDA margin should remain under some temporary pressure  due to (1) ramp-ups during the second half of the year  to (2) price renegotiations that concluded later than expected  and to (3) the impact of increasingly difficult operational conditions for performing contracts in the French telecoms sector.With strong sales throughout the year and 2022 ending on a promising note  the Group confirms double-digit growth in 2023  which will allow to exceed the €1 billion milestone in revenue. Growth will continue to depend on momentum in markets outside of France  especially fiber-optic roll-outs in the Benelux and in new markets  such as Germany and the United Kingdom. In France  the group will focus on consolidation in the telecommunications sector and on the development of new markets related to the energy transition.The group has solid growth drivers and an effective business model that will help it strengthen its position at the crossroads of the digital transformation and the energy transition. Solutions 30 hopes to reach €2.5 billion in revenue over the medium term. To finance this growth  the group has a sensible financial policy in place  with the goal of maximizing cash flow and making it possible to self-finance increases in working capital while maintaining a low-debt balance sheet.Financial Information Publication Schedule2022 Annual Report: April 20  20232023 Q1 Revenue Report: May 10  2023Annual Shareholders Meeting: June 16  20232023 Q2 Revenue Report: July 25  20232023 HY Earnings Report: September 21  20232023 Q3 Revenue Report: November 8  20232023 Revenue Report: January 24  2024About Solutions 30 SEThe Solutions 30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data prior to 2014  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In Q4 2022  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€74.7 million (-€74.8 million in Q4 2021)  leaving IFRS revenue at €958.7 million (€881.0 million in Q4 2021).For 2022  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€242.5 million (-€222.1 million for 2021)  leaving IFRS revenue at €3 074.0 million (€2 522.5 million for 2021).ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITIONThe Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect.

17270,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biosenic-appoints-yves-sagot-independent-060000202.html,BioSenic appoints Yves Sagot as Independent Director,REGULATED INFORMATION Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium  January 27  2023  7am CET – BioSenic (Euronext Brussels and Paris: BIOS)  the clinical stage company...,BioSenicREGULATED INFORMATIONMont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium  January 27  2023  7am CET – BioSenic (Euronext Brussels and Paris: BIOS)  the clinical stage company specializing in serious autoimmune / inflammatory diseases and cell repair  today announces the appointment of Yves Sagot as a Member of the Board and Independent Director.Yves Sagot has been appointed to the BioSenic Board for his experience and achievements for Relief Therapeutics SA and a number of specific aspects that mirror recent BioSenic developments.Yves co-founded Relief Therapeutics in 2013 to develop a clinical asset acquired from Merck Serono. In 2016  Relief Therapeutics went public on the Swiss stock exchange (SIX) after a reverse merger with THERAMetrics. Whilst maintaining his activities as Chief Scientific Officer at Relief Therapeutics  Yves created MBS Sagot Consulting in 2018 to provide to the life science market senior expertise covering research and early clinical development. Subsequently  after leaving Relief Therapeutics  he is a private investor in biotechnology via MBS Invest & Consult Sàrl. He is also one of the ambassadors of the Léon Bérard Cancer Center  an internationally recognized research center in Lyon  France. He has authored 25 papers that have been published in international peer-reviewed journals  holds three granted patents and received the Serono CEO Award in 2001 and the Merck Serono Reward and Recognition Award in 2008.Yves Sagot replaces Terry Sadler as an Independent Director and Member of the Board at BioSenic.“BioSenic has now completed the acquisition of the majority participation in Medsenic and is now focused on ongoing clinical development on both platforms. As a result  BioSenic is now building further expertise in its senior teams  with recent appointments of a Chief Medical Officer that is responsible for the development of both of BioSenic’s cell therapy and autoimmune disease platforms  and a Chief Scientific Officer to manage BioSenic’s scientific research and development ” said Prof. François Rieger  President and CEO of BioSenic. “We are additionally focusing on ensuring our board of directors has the optimal composition of expertise. Yves Sadler has highly relevant and complimentary professional experience  specifically as a co-founder of a European biotech that also went public following a merger. His ongoing advice and contributions will be vital as BioSenic continues to demonstrate value to investors through development of our pipeline of therapies developed through our cell therapy and autoimmune disease platforms. I would also like to thank Terry Sadler for his contribution as an Independent Director through the acquisition process.”Story continues“The creation of BioSenic has resulted in an intriguing biotech company with multiple targets and platforms. These number of platforms spreads risk  and also will result in increased innovation as the differing expertise of scientific teams share strategies and ideas. As a result  this should be highly attractive for investors ” said Yves Sagot  Independent Director and Member of the Board at BioSenic. “This is a major reason why I have accepted to join the BioSenic board and offer my additional expertise as an Independent Director. The combination now of the experience of the board will provide a significant contribution to the senior team as they develop therapies for patients suffering from a range of high unmet medical needs.”Yves received a Certificate of Advanced Studies in Management of Medtech  Biotech & Pharma Ventures from the Management of Technology EPFL in Lausanne  Switzerland.  holds a Ph.D in Neurobiology and a Masters in Pharmacology and Fundamental Toxicology from the Université Paul Sabatier (UPS)  Toulouse  France.About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company focused on (i) the development of innovative products to address high unmet needs in orthopedics and (ii) exploiting the possibilities offered by the therapeutic use of arsenic salts (mainly arsenic trioxide (ATO)) for patients with autoimmune diseases. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beFor International Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

In the E.U. there are currently only symptomatic treatments for FOP  which do not reduce the formation of extra-skeletal bone in patients with the condition. Ipsen will be requesting a re-examination of the CHMP opinion  based on scientific data available from the existing palovarotene clinical trial program.FOP causes permanent and continuous new bone formation in soft and connective tissues  like muscles  tendons and ligaments  a process known as heterotopic ossification (HO).1 Once formed  it is irreversible.1 The average age of diagnosis is 5 years old2 and ultimately FOP shortens the median life expectancy to 56 years as untimely death is caused by bone formation around the ribcage leading to breathing problems and cardiorespiratory failure.3 FOP has an estimated prevalence of 1.36 per million individuals and about 900 people are diagnosed worldwide; however  the number of confirmed cases varies by country.4 5 6“ We are disappointed with this outcome and will be requesting a re-examination of the CHMP opinion ” said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. “ We continue to work closely with the EMA to address the outstanding concerns that led to the decision today  with the goal of making this investigational medicine available to appropriate patients  living with this debilitating disease  where no other treatment option exists. Ipsen remains committed to bringing new therapeutic options to the FOP community  which has been instrumental in the development of investigational palovarotene through their involvement in clinical trials. We are enormously grateful for their continued support.”The CHMP opinion is based on its review of data from MOVE  the first and largest Phase III efficacy and safety trial conducted in FOP. The primary objectives of MOVE were to evaluate the efficacy of palovarotene in reducing new HO volume  as assessed using whole-body computed tomography  compared with patients untreated beyond standard of care from Ipsen’s global FOP natural history study  and to evaluate the safety of investigational palovarotene in adult and pediatric patients with FOP.7 8“ There is a significant need for a treatment specifically developed to help manage the progression of this disease. The data from MOVE have helped us to understand the potential for treatments that reduce HO progression to be used in the management of FOP.” Said Dr. Genevieve Baujat  Clinical Geneticist Consultant at Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital  Paris  France. “ Currently  the only therapeutic options available to us are for treating symptoms. We in the FOP community have been waiting a long time for innovations to treat this disabling disease.”ENDSAbout palovarotenePalovarotene is an investigational oral medicine that selectively targets the retinoic-acid receptor gamma (RARγ)  which is an important regulator of skeletal development and ectopic bone in the retinoid signaling pathway. Palovarotene is designed to mediate the interactions between the receptors  growth factors and proteins within the retinoid signaling pathway to reduce new abnormal bone formation (HO). Palovarotene received Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the potential treatment of FOP and was granted Priority Review. Palovarotene was also granted orphan medicine designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Palovarotene is in review processes with a number of regulatory authorities including the FDA and the EMA. Palovarotene is currently authorized for use in appropriate patients in Canada and provisionally in the U.A.E. where it is marketed as SohonosTM (palovarotene capsules).9 10About the MOVE trialMOVE (NCT03312634) is a Phase III  multicenter  single-arm  open-label trial to assess the efficacy and safety of palovarotene. 107 study participants with FOP received oral palovarotene as a chronic (5mg once daily) and episodic (20mg once daily for 4 weeks  followed by 10mg for ≥8 weeks for flare-ups and trauma) regimen. The primary endpoint was annualized change in new HO volume measured by low-dose whole-body computed tomography. Efficacy data from participants enrolled in MOVE were compared with data from FOP Natural History Study (NHS) participants untreated beyond standard of care; individuals ≤65 years of age with clinically diagnosed FOP and a verified ACVR1R206H pathogenic variant were eligible for inclusion in the NHS.7About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com____________________________1 Kaplan FS et al.

The additional acceptance period following the mandatory reopening of the Exchange Offer closed on Friday January 20  2023. During this reopening  255 735 additional Picanol Group shares were tendered to the Exchange Offer. Consequently  the Bidder will hold 99.32% of the shares of Picanol Group.The payment of the offer price  consisting of the new shares in Tessenderlo Group (the ""New Shares"") (as per the exchange ratio of 2.36 new shares of Tessenderlo Group per tendered share of Picanol Group) and the cash consideration for the fractions of the New Shares  will take place on Friday February 10  2023.

The Bidder has therefore decided to proceed with a final reopening of the Exchange Offer for acceptance to acquire the remaining 121 427 Picanol Group shares.The final acceptance period for the Exchange Offer will commence on Monday February 13  2023  at 9:00 am (CET). This final acceptance period will close on Friday March 3  2023  at 16:00 (CET). Consequently  shareholders of Picanol Group who have not yet accepted the Exchange Offer will still be able to do so.The reopening will have the effect of a simplified squeeze-out. Shares that have not been tendered prior to the closing of the final acceptance period will be transferred to the Bidder by force of law and the relevant shareholders will have to request payment of the offer price for their shares at the Deposit and Consignment Office. The reopening as a simplified squeeze-out will also result in the delisting of Picanol Group by Euronext on March 3  2023  after close of trading.The results of the final acceptance period will be announced on or around March 10  2023.

While margins and cash were impacted by inflation and supply chain disruption respectively  our connected lighting business and growth platforms grew to reach almost EUR 2 billion of sales. The relevance of our products and solutions was further heightened in 2022  as energy efficiency became even more urgent. This strengthened our competitive position as we executed on our strategic priorities. We brought new innovative and sustainable lighting solutions to our customers and continued to make progress towards doubling our impact on environment and society ” said Eric Rondolat  CEO of Signify.“Looking ahead  we expect volatility to persist in the first half of 2023 and our performance to improve in the second half.

Comparable sales growth was 1.2%  benefiting from traction in the professional segment  partly offset by China  which was impacted by COVID-related measures  and softness in the consumer segment.The Adjusted gross margin declined by 210 bps to 37.3%  mainly due to an adverse currency impact as price increases largely compensated input and energy cost inflation throughout the year. Adjusted indirect costs as a percentage of sales decreased by 70 bps to 28.9%  mainly driven by indirect cost savings.Adjusted EBITA declined by 4.2% to EUR 762 million. Digital Solutions and Digital Products further increased their combined share of Signify's Adjusted EBITA excluding 'Other' to 86% (2021: 82%). The Adjusted EBITA margin declined by 150 bps to 10.1%  mainly driven by the lower gross margin.Total restructuring costs were EUR 64 million  acquisition-related charges were EUR 27 million and other incidental items were a net benefit of EUR 173 million. The other incidental items were mainly related to the gain on the disposal of non-strategic real estate assets. Net income increased by 31.0% to EUR 532 million  mainly driven by the gain on the disposal of non-strategic real estate assets  partly offset by a higher income tax expense  due to higher taxable income  and higher net financial expenses.Fourth quarterNominal sales declined by 1.5% to EUR 1 978 million  with a comparable sales decline of 8.8%. The decline is mainly attributable to a further deterioration of the Chinese market due to COVID-related disruptions  a weaker indoor professional business  continued softness in the consumer segment and lower growth in the OEM channel than anticipated. Nominal sales included a positive currency effect of 4.7%  mainly from the appreciation of the USD versus Q4 21  and a positive impact of 2.6% from the consolidation of Fluence and Pierlite.The Adjusted gross margin decreased by 240 bps to 37.1%  mainly driven by an adverse currency impact. Price increases continued to offset higher input costs and the surge in energy costs. On a sequential basis  the gross margin has stabilized since Q2 22. Adjusted indirect costs as a percentage of sales increased by 50 bps to 28.3%  as indirect cost savings did not fully compensate lower sales volumes.Adjusted EBITA decreased to EUR 202 million. The Adjusted EBITA margin decreased to 10.2%  mainly due to a negative currency impact of 150 bps and fixed cost under-absorption due to lower sales volumes. The negative currency impact was the combination of both the year-on-year weakening of the EUR versus the USD and CNY  and a continued  yet temporary  FX hedging headwind.Total restructuring costs were EUR 47 million  acquisition-related charges were EUR 4 million and various incidental items were a net benefit of EUR 15 million. Net income decreased to EUR 86 million  as a result of lower income from operations and higher financial expenses. The higher financial expenses were mainly impacted by the Virtual Power Purchase Agreements  higher interest costs and the recognition of a monetary loss due to hyperinflation in Turkey.The number of employees (FTE) decreased from 36 824 at the end of Q4 21 to 34 619 at the end of Q4 22. The year-on-year decrease is mostly related to factory personnel. The number of FTEs is affected by fluctuations in volume and seasonality.1 This press release contains certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios  such as comparable sales growth  EBITA  adjusted EBITA and free cash flow  and related ratios  which are not recognized measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS.

17293,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/press-release-dupixent-dupilumab-recommended-060000437.html,Press Release: Dupixent® (dupilumab) recommended for expanded EU approval by the CHMP to treat children as young as six months old with severe atopic dermatitis,Dupixent® (dupilumab) recommended for expanded EU approval by the CHMP to treat children as young as six months old with severe atopic dermatitis If approved...,"Sanofi - Aventis GroupeDupixent® (dupilumab) recommended for expanded EU approval by the CHMP to treat children as young as six months old with severe atopic dermatitisIf approved  Dupixent would be the first and only targeted medicine in the EU for these young childrenRecommendation based on a Phase 3 trial in children 6 months to 5 years old showing Dupixent improved skin clearance  reduced overall disease severity and improved health-related quality of lifeIn Europe  about 80 000 children aged 6 months to 5 years old with uncontrolled severe atopic dermatitis are candidates for systemic therapyParis and Tarrytown  N.Y. January 27  2023. The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion for Dupixent® (dupilumab)  recommending expanded approval in the European Union (EU) to treat severe atopic dermatitis in children 6 months to 5 years old who are candidates for systemic therapy. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months. In June 2022  Dupixent was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for children in this age group.Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Between 85% and 90% of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age  which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense  persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body  resulting in skin dryness  cracking  pain  redness or darkening  crusting and oozing  which can increase the risk of skin infection. Severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of young children and their caregivers. Current treatment options in this age group are primarily topical corticosteroids (TCS)  which can be associated with safety risks and may impair growth when used long-term.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from a Phase 3 trial in children 6 months to 5 years of age recently published in The Lancet  which met all primary and secondary endpoints. At 16 weeks  Dupixent plus low-potency TCS improved skin clearance and reduced overall disease severity compared to TCS alone (the placebo arm). Dupixent patients also experienced reduced itch and skin pain as well as improved sleep quality and health-related quality of life compared to placebo. Long-term data further showed a sustained improvement in these disease measures up to one year. Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent in this atopic dermatitis population compared to placebo included conjunctivitis and eosinophilia.Story continuesThe use of Dupixent in infants and young children less than 6 years of age with severe atopic dermatitis is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and prurigo nodularis  as well as investigational diseases such as eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in the EU.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  prurigo nodularis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

At constant exchange rates  the annual organic growth established itself at +29%.In accordance with French accounting standards  this annual revenue includes the sales of Witbe's electronic components to their Asian contractors  resulting from the company's development and necessary for the manufacturing of the Witbox. The total cost of these billings (at zero gross margin) amounts to €1.2 million in 2022 (vs. €51k in 2021) accounted for in the Asia region. Excluding these billings  the restated 2022 revenue amounted to €24.8 million  up +30% compared to 2021 (+23% at constant exchange rates.).This record performance is the result of the success of the Witbox product line-up  expanded at the start of 2022 with the market release of two new models (the Witbox+ and the WitboxNet) as well as the continued success ofthe Witbe Cloud offering across all geographical areas.Jump of +81% in Cloud sales in 2022  ARR of €4.1M at the end of 2022Sales of Witbe Cloud products (subscription in SaaS form) continued to progress at a sustained pace in the second semester. Over the year as a whole  the turnover achieved in Witbe Cloud jumped by +81%  and +139% for the Americas alone.To reflect the importance of the Cloud  from 2023 onwards Witbe will track its ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue ) of Witbe Cloud contracts signed.

The group maintained the share of recurring revenue compared to last year (30%) in a context of dynamic growth and is aiming in the medium term for a target level of 50% recurring revenue.+73% growth in the Americas  Witbe's new center of gravity in 2022Witbe continued its dynamic development in North America  with teams that were reinforced (with pre-sales engineers  customer relations managers  deployments  etc.) throughout 2022. The Americas market recorded annual revenue of €13.1 million  up sharply by +73% (+54% at constant exchange rates).For the first time ever in the company's history  the Americas became the 1st zone of activity for the group  representing 50% of consolidated revenue in 2022 (vs. 40% in 2021).In EMEA (Europe  Middle East and Africa)  revenue amounted to €11.2 million  up slightly by +1% (same at constant exchange rates) and represents 43% of Witbe's activity in 2022. Cloud sales increased by +50% in this area in 2022.Finally  Asia recorded consolidated revenue of €0.5 million (amount restated for €1.2 million in billings for components)  up +43%.Orion plan's Phase 2: ""Focused on our business""In line with the first phase of the Orion plan  Witbe made the decision early 2022 to focus on its sector of excellence: the testing and monitoring of video services on real devices.This involved the progressive drop throughout 2022 of the traditional enterprise sector (Infrastructure & Technology) and ""business"" customers  allowing the group to focus on its video products (Witbox  REC  Smartgate  etc.) The shortfall in revenue for 2022 was largely offset by the success of the Witbox and Witbe Cloud products for video service providers (operators  content providers  and set-top box manufacturers.)ProspectsDespite an uncertain economic context in 2023  the group remains confident.The year is off to a great start  with revenue to be recorded for the financial year already amounting to €7.7 million (as of January 23  2023 ) up 20% compared to €6.4 million last year at the same time of year.Witbe is continuing work on developing its existing products in order to maintain its technological leadership on the market  with many new functionalities and developments planned for 2023.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion for Dupixent® (dupilumab)  recommending expanded approval in the European Union (EU) to treat severe atopic dermatitis in children 6 months to 5 years old who are candidates for systemic therapy. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months. In June 2022  Dupixent was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for children in this age group.Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Between 85% and 90% of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age  which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense  persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body  resulting in skin dryness  cracking  pain  redness or darkening  crusting and oozing  which can increase the risk of skin infection. Severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of young children and their caregivers. Current treatment options in this age group are primarily topical corticosteroids (TCS)  which can be associated with safety risks and may impair growth when used long-term.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from a Phase 3 trial in children 6 months to 5 years of age recently published in The Lancet  which met all primary and secondary endpoints. At 16 weeks  Dupixent plus low-potency TCS improved skin clearance and reduced overall disease severity compared to TCS alone (the placebo arm). Dupixent patients also experienced reduced itch and skin pain as well as improved sleep quality and health-related quality of life compared to placebo. Long-term data further showed a sustained improvement in these disease measures up to one year. Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent in this atopic dermatitis population compared to placebo included conjunctivitis and eosinophilia.Story continuesThe use of Dupixent in infants and young children less than 6 years of age with severe atopic dermatitis is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and prurigo nodularis  as well as investigational diseases such as eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in the EU.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  prurigo nodularis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 months of age.with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing.

In the E.U. there are currently only symptomatic treatments for FOP  which do not reduce the formation of extra-skeletal bone in patients with the condition. Ipsen will be requesting a re-examination of the CHMP opinion  based on scientific data available from the existing palovarotene clinical trial program.FOP causes permanent and continuous new bone formation in soft and connective tissues  like muscles  tendons and ligaments  a process known as heterotopic ossification (HO).1 Once formed  it is irreversible.1 The average age of diagnosis is 5 years old2 and ultimately FOP shortens the median life expectancy to 56 years as untimely death is caused by bone formation around the ribcage leading to breathing problems and cardiorespiratory failure.3 FOP has an estimated prevalence of 1.36 per million individuals and about 900 people are diagnosed worldwide; however  the number of confirmed cases varies by country.4 5 6“We are disappointed with this outcome and will be requesting a re-examination of the CHMP opinion ” said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. “We continue to work closely with the EMA to address the outstanding concerns that led to the decision today  with the goal of making this investigational medicine available to appropriate patients  living with this debilitating disease  where no other treatment option exists. Ipsen remains committed to bringing new therapeutic options to the FOP community  which has been instrumental in the development of investigational palovarotene through their involvement in clinical trials. We are enormously grateful for their continued support.”The CHMP opinion is based on its review of data from MOVE  the first and largest Phase III efficacy and safety trial conducted in FOP. The primary objectives of MOVE were to evaluate the efficacy of palovarotene in reducing new HO volume  as assessed using whole-body computed tomography  compared with patients untreated beyond standard of care from Ipsen’s global FOP natural history study  and to evaluate the safety of investigational palovarotene in adult and pediatric patients with FOP.7 8“There is a significant need for a treatment specifically developed to help manage the progression of this disease. The data from MOVE have helped us to understand the potential for treatments that reduce HO progression to be used in the management of FOP.” Said Dr. Genevieve Baujat  Clinical Geneticist Consultant at Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital  Paris  France. “Currently  the only therapeutic options available to us are for treating symptoms. We in the FOP community have been waiting a long time for innovations to treat this disabling disease.”ENDSAbout palovarotenePalovarotene is an investigational oral medicine that selectively targets the retinoic-acid receptor gamma (RARγ)  which is an important regulator of skeletal development and ectopic bone in the retinoid signaling pathway. Palovarotene is designed to mediate the interactions between the receptors  growth factors and proteins within the retinoid signaling pathway to reduce new abnormal bone formation (HO). Palovarotene received Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the potential treatment of FOP and was granted Priority Review. Palovarotene was also granted orphan medicine designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Palovarotene is in review processes with a number of regulatory authorities including the FDA and the EMA. Palovarotene is currently authorized for use in appropriate patients in Canada and provisionally in the U.A.E. where it is marketed as SohonosTM (palovarotene capsules).9 10About the MOVE trialMOVE (NCT03312634) is a Phase III  multicenter  single-arm  open-label trial to assess the efficacy and safety of palovarotene. 107 study participants with FOP received oral palovarotene as a chronic (5mg once daily) and episodic (20mg once daily for 4 weeks  followed by 10mg for ≥8 weeks for flare-ups and trauma) regimen. The primary endpoint was annualized change in new HO volume measured by low-dose whole-body computed tomography. Efficacy data from participants enrolled in MOVE were compared with data from FOP Natural History Study (NHS) participants untreated beyond standard of care; individuals ≤65 years of age with clinically diagnosed FOP and a verified ACVR1R206H pathogenic variant were eligible for inclusion in the NHS.7About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com____________________________1 Kaplan FS et al.
