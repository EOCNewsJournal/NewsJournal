17270,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biosenic-appoints-yves-sagot-independent-060000202.html,BioSenic appoints Yves Sagot as Independent Director,REGULATED INFORMATION Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium  January 27  2023  7am CET – BioSenic (Euronext Brussels and Paris: BIOS)  the clinical stage company...,BioSenicREGULATED INFORMATIONMont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium  January 27  2023  7am CET – BioSenic (Euronext Brussels and Paris: BIOS)  the clinical stage company specializing in serious autoimmune / inflammatory diseases and cell repair  today announces the appointment of Yves Sagot as a Member of the Board and Independent Director.Yves Sagot has been appointed to the BioSenic Board for his experience and achievements for Relief Therapeutics SA and a number of specific aspects that mirror recent BioSenic developments.Yves co-founded Relief Therapeutics in 2013 to develop a clinical asset acquired from Merck Serono. In 2016  Relief Therapeutics went public on the Swiss stock exchange (SIX) after a reverse merger with THERAMetrics. Whilst maintaining his activities as Chief Scientific Officer at Relief Therapeutics  Yves created MBS Sagot Consulting in 2018 to provide to the life science market senior expertise covering research and early clinical development. Subsequently  after leaving Relief Therapeutics  he is a private investor in biotechnology via MBS Invest & Consult Sàrl. He is also one of the ambassadors of the Léon Bérard Cancer Center  an internationally recognized research center in Lyon  France. He has authored 25 papers that have been published in international peer-reviewed journals  holds three granted patents and received the Serono CEO Award in 2001 and the Merck Serono Reward and Recognition Award in 2008.Yves Sagot replaces Terry Sadler as an Independent Director and Member of the Board at BioSenic.“BioSenic has now completed the acquisition of the majority participation in Medsenic and is now focused on ongoing clinical development on both platforms. As a result  BioSenic is now building further expertise in its senior teams  with recent appointments of a Chief Medical Officer that is responsible for the development of both of BioSenic’s cell therapy and autoimmune disease platforms  and a Chief Scientific Officer to manage BioSenic’s scientific research and development ” said Prof. François Rieger  President and CEO of BioSenic. “We are additionally focusing on ensuring our board of directors has the optimal composition of expertise. Yves Sadler has highly relevant and complimentary professional experience  specifically as a co-founder of a European biotech that also went public following a merger. His ongoing advice and contributions will be vital as BioSenic continues to demonstrate value to investors through development of our pipeline of therapies developed through our cell therapy and autoimmune disease platforms. I would also like to thank Terry Sadler for his contribution as an Independent Director through the acquisition process.”Story continues“The creation of BioSenic has resulted in an intriguing biotech company with multiple targets and platforms. These number of platforms spreads risk  and also will result in increased innovation as the differing expertise of scientific teams share strategies and ideas. As a result  this should be highly attractive for investors ” said Yves Sagot  Independent Director and Member of the Board at BioSenic. “This is a major reason why I have accepted to join the BioSenic board and offer my additional expertise as an Independent Director. The combination now of the experience of the board will provide a significant contribution to the senior team as they develop therapies for patients suffering from a range of high unmet medical needs.”Yves received a Certificate of Advanced Studies in Management of Medtech  Biotech & Pharma Ventures from the Management of Technology EPFL in Lausanne  Switzerland.  holds a Ph.D in Neurobiology and a Masters in Pharmacology and Fundamental Toxicology from the Université Paul Sabatier (UPS)  Toulouse  France.About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company focused on (i) the development of innovative products to address high unmet needs in orthopedics and (ii) exploiting the possibilities offered by the therapeutic use of arsenic salts (mainly arsenic trioxide (ATO)) for patients with autoimmune diseases. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beFor International Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

In the E.U. there are currently only symptomatic treatments for FOP  which do not reduce the formation of extra-skeletal bone in patients with the condition. Ipsen will be requesting a re-examination of the CHMP opinion  based on scientific data available from the existing palovarotene clinical trial program.FOP causes permanent and continuous new bone formation in soft and connective tissues  like muscles  tendons and ligaments  a process known as heterotopic ossification (HO).1 Once formed  it is irreversible.1 The average age of diagnosis is 5 years old2 and ultimately FOP shortens the median life expectancy to 56 years as untimely death is caused by bone formation around the ribcage leading to breathing problems and cardiorespiratory failure.3 FOP has an estimated prevalence of 1.36 per million individuals and about 900 people are diagnosed worldwide; however  the number of confirmed cases varies by country.4 5 6“ We are disappointed with this outcome and will be requesting a re-examination of the CHMP opinion ” said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. “ We continue to work closely with the EMA to address the outstanding concerns that led to the decision today  with the goal of making this investigational medicine available to appropriate patients  living with this debilitating disease  where no other treatment option exists. Ipsen remains committed to bringing new therapeutic options to the FOP community  which has been instrumental in the development of investigational palovarotene through their involvement in clinical trials. We are enormously grateful for their continued support.”The CHMP opinion is based on its review of data from MOVE  the first and largest Phase III efficacy and safety trial conducted in FOP. The primary objectives of MOVE were to evaluate the efficacy of palovarotene in reducing new HO volume  as assessed using whole-body computed tomography  compared with patients untreated beyond standard of care from Ipsen’s global FOP natural history study  and to evaluate the safety of investigational palovarotene in adult and pediatric patients with FOP.7 8“ There is a significant need for a treatment specifically developed to help manage the progression of this disease. The data from MOVE have helped us to understand the potential for treatments that reduce HO progression to be used in the management of FOP.” Said Dr. Genevieve Baujat  Clinical Geneticist Consultant at Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital  Paris  France. “ Currently  the only therapeutic options available to us are for treating symptoms. We in the FOP community have been waiting a long time for innovations to treat this disabling disease.”ENDSAbout palovarotenePalovarotene is an investigational oral medicine that selectively targets the retinoic-acid receptor gamma (RARγ)  which is an important regulator of skeletal development and ectopic bone in the retinoid signaling pathway. Palovarotene is designed to mediate the interactions between the receptors  growth factors and proteins within the retinoid signaling pathway to reduce new abnormal bone formation (HO). Palovarotene received Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the potential treatment of FOP and was granted Priority Review. Palovarotene was also granted orphan medicine designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Palovarotene is in review processes with a number of regulatory authorities including the FDA and the EMA. Palovarotene is currently authorized for use in appropriate patients in Canada and provisionally in the U.A.E. where it is marketed as SohonosTM (palovarotene capsules).9 10About the MOVE trialMOVE (NCT03312634) is a Phase III  multicenter  single-arm  open-label trial to assess the efficacy and safety of palovarotene. 107 study participants with FOP received oral palovarotene as a chronic (5mg once daily) and episodic (20mg once daily for 4 weeks  followed by 10mg for ≥8 weeks for flare-ups and trauma) regimen. The primary endpoint was annualized change in new HO volume measured by low-dose whole-body computed tomography. Efficacy data from participants enrolled in MOVE were compared with data from FOP Natural History Study (NHS) participants untreated beyond standard of care; individuals ≤65 years of age with clinically diagnosed FOP and a verified ACVR1R206H pathogenic variant were eligible for inclusion in the NHS.7About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

For more information  visit ipsen.comIpsen’s Forward-Looking StatementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com____________________________1 Kaplan FS et al.

The additional acceptance period following the mandatory reopening of the Exchange Offer closed on Friday January 20  2023. During this reopening  255 735 additional Picanol Group shares were tendered to the Exchange Offer. Consequently  the Bidder will hold 99.32% of the shares of Picanol Group.The payment of the offer price  consisting of the new shares in Tessenderlo Group (the ""New Shares"") (as per the exchange ratio of 2.36 new shares of Tessenderlo Group per tendered share of Picanol Group) and the cash consideration for the fractions of the New Shares  will take place on Friday February 10  2023. The New Shares will be listed on Euronext Brussels on or around February 10  2023.Since the Bidder  together with persons acting in concert with him  now holds more than 95% of the shares in Picanol Group and has acquired at least 90% of the shares that were the subject of the Exchange Offer  the Bidder can now oblige the remaining shareholders of Picanol Group to exchange their shares at the offer price. The Bidder has therefore decided to proceed with a final reopening of the Exchange Offer for acceptance to acquire the remaining 121 427 Picanol Group shares.The final acceptance period for the Exchange Offer will commence on Monday February 13  2023  at 9:00 am (CET). This final acceptance period will close on Friday March 3  2023  at 16:00 (CET). Consequently  shareholders of Picanol Group who have not yet accepted the Exchange Offer will still be able to do so.The reopening will have the effect of a simplified squeeze-out. Shares that have not been tendered prior to the closing of the final acceptance period will be transferred to the Bidder by force of law and the relevant shareholders will have to request payment of the offer price for their shares at the Deposit and Consignment Office. The reopening as a simplified squeeze-out will also result in the delisting of Picanol Group by Euronext on March 3  2023  after close of trading.The results of the final acceptance period will be announced on or around March 10  2023.

The external environment grew increasingly more volatile throughout the year  leading us to adapt the company and our objectives accordingly. While margins and cash were impacted by inflation and supply chain disruption respectively  our connected lighting business and growth platforms grew to reach almost EUR 2 billion of sales. The relevance of our products and solutions was further heightened in 2022  as energy efficiency became even more urgent. This strengthened our competitive position as we executed on our strategic priorities. We brought new innovative and sustainable lighting solutions to our customers and continued to make progress towards doubling our impact on environment and society ” said Eric Rondolat  CEO of Signify.“Looking ahead  we expect volatility to persist in the first half of 2023 and our performance to improve in the second half. While top-line growth will be difficult to predict  our key priority in 2023 will be to improve profitability and return to a free cash flow level in line with previous years. We will intensify our focus on managing the decline and profitability of our Conventional Products business  while further driving the transition to energy efficient  connected and sustainable lighting solutions. As we move forward  we remain committed to our strategy to invest and drive innovation in the lighting industry and so create a more sustainable and connected future for all.”Story continuesBrighter Lives  Better World 2025In the fourth quarter  Signify completed the second year of its Brighter Lives  Better World 2025 sustainab il ity program   making continued progress towards doubling its positive impact on the environment and society:Double the pace of the Paris agreement:The cumulative carbon reduction over the value chain is on track to reach the 2025 target.

Comparable sales growth was 1.2%  benefiting from traction in the professional segment  partly offset by China  which was impacted by COVID-related measures  and softness in the consumer segment.The Adjusted gross margin declined by 210 bps to 37.3%  mainly due to an adverse currency impact as price increases largely compensated input and energy cost inflation throughout the year. Adjusted indirect costs as a percentage of sales decreased by 70 bps to 28.9%  mainly driven by indirect cost savings.Adjusted EBITA declined by 4.2% to EUR 762 million. Digital Solutions and Digital Products further increased their combined share of Signify's Adjusted EBITA excluding 'Other' to 86% (2021: 82%). The Adjusted EBITA margin declined by 150 bps to 10.1%  mainly driven by the lower gross margin.Total restructuring costs were EUR 64 million  acquisition-related charges were EUR 27 million and other incidental items were a net benefit of EUR 173 million. The other incidental items were mainly related to the gain on the disposal of non-strategic real estate assets. Net income increased by 31.0% to EUR 532 million  mainly driven by the gain on the disposal of non-strategic real estate assets  partly offset by a higher income tax expense  due to higher taxable income  and higher net financial expenses.Fourth quarterNominal sales declined by 1.5% to EUR 1 978 million  with a comparable sales decline of 8.8%. The decline is mainly attributable to a further deterioration of the Chinese market due to COVID-related disruptions  a weaker indoor professional business  continued softness in the consumer segment and lower growth in the OEM channel than anticipated. Nominal sales included a positive currency effect of 4.7%  mainly from the appreciation of the USD versus Q4 21  and a positive impact of 2.6% from the consolidation of Fluence and Pierlite.The Adjusted gross margin decreased by 240 bps to 37.1%  mainly driven by an adverse currency impact. Price increases continued to offset higher input costs and the surge in energy costs. On a sequential basis  the gross margin has stabilized since Q2 22. Adjusted indirect costs as a percentage of sales increased by 50 bps to 28.3%  as indirect cost savings did not fully compensate lower sales volumes.Adjusted EBITA decreased to EUR 202 million. The Adjusted EBITA margin decreased to 10.2%  mainly due to a negative currency impact of 150 bps and fixed cost under-absorption due to lower sales volumes. The negative currency impact was the combination of both the year-on-year weakening of the EUR versus the USD and CNY  and a continued  yet temporary  FX hedging headwind.Total restructuring costs were EUR 47 million  acquisition-related charges were EUR 4 million and various incidental items were a net benefit of EUR 15 million. Net income decreased to EUR 86 million  as a result of lower income from operations and higher financial expenses. The higher financial expenses were mainly impacted by the Virtual Power Purchase Agreements  higher interest costs and the recognition of a monetary loss due to hyperinflation in Turkey.The number of employees (FTE) decreased from 36 824 at the end of Q4 21 to 34 619 at the end of Q4 22. The year-on-year decrease is mostly related to factory personnel. The number of FTEs is affected by fluctuations in volume and seasonality.1 This press release contains certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios  such as comparable sales growth  EBITA  adjusted EBITA and free cash flow  and related ratios  which are not recognized measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS.

17293,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/press-release-dupixent-dupilumab-recommended-060000437.html,Press Release: Dupixent® (dupilumab) recommended for expanded EU approval by the CHMP to treat children as young as six months old with severe atopic dermatitis,Dupixent® (dupilumab) recommended for expanded EU approval by the CHMP to treat children as young as six months old with severe atopic dermatitis If approved...,"Sanofi - Aventis GroupeDupixent® (dupilumab) recommended for expanded EU approval by the CHMP to treat children as young as six months old with severe atopic dermatitisIf approved  Dupixent would be the first and only targeted medicine in the EU for these young childrenRecommendation based on a Phase 3 trial in children 6 months to 5 years old showing Dupixent improved skin clearance  reduced overall disease severity and improved health-related quality of lifeIn Europe  about 80 000 children aged 6 months to 5 years old with uncontrolled severe atopic dermatitis are candidates for systemic therapyParis and Tarrytown  N.Y. January 27  2023. The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion for Dupixent® (dupilumab)  recommending expanded approval in the European Union (EU) to treat severe atopic dermatitis in children 6 months to 5 years old who are candidates for systemic therapy. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months. In June 2022  Dupixent was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for children in this age group.Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Between 85% and 90% of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age  which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense  persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body  resulting in skin dryness  cracking  pain  redness or darkening  crusting and oozing  which can increase the risk of skin infection. Severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of young children and their caregivers. Current treatment options in this age group are primarily topical corticosteroids (TCS)  which can be associated with safety risks and may impair growth when used long-term.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from a Phase 3 trial in children 6 months to 5 years of age recently published in The Lancet  which met all primary and secondary endpoints. At 16 weeks  Dupixent plus low-potency TCS improved skin clearance and reduced overall disease severity compared to TCS alone (the placebo arm). Dupixent patients also experienced reduced itch and skin pain as well as improved sleep quality and health-related quality of life compared to placebo. Long-term data further showed a sustained improvement in these disease measures up to one year. Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent in this atopic dermatitis population compared to placebo included conjunctivitis and eosinophilia.Story continuesThe use of Dupixent in infants and young children less than 6 years of age with severe atopic dermatitis is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and prurigo nodularis  as well as investigational diseases such as eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in the EU.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  prurigo nodularis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

At constant exchange rates  the annual organic growth established itself at +29%.In accordance with French accounting standards  this annual revenue includes the sales of Witbe's electronic components to their Asian contractors  resulting from the company's development and necessary for the manufacturing of the Witbox. The total cost of these billings (at zero gross margin) amounts to €1.2 million in 2022 (vs. €51k in 2021) accounted for in the Asia region. Excluding these billings  the restated 2022 revenue amounted to €24.8 million  up +30% compared to 2021 (+23% at constant exchange rates.).This record performance is the result of the success of the Witbox product line-up  expanded at the start of 2022 with the market release of two new models (the Witbox+ and the WitboxNet) as well as the continued success ofthe Witbe Cloud offering across all geographical areas.Jump of +81% in Cloud sales in 2022  ARR of €4.1M at the end of 2022Sales of Witbe Cloud products (subscription in SaaS form) continued to progress at a sustained pace in the second semester. Over the year as a whole  the turnover achieved in Witbe Cloud jumped by +81%  and +139% for the Americas alone.To reflect the importance of the Cloud  from 2023 onwards Witbe will track its ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue ) of Witbe Cloud contracts signed. As of December 31  2022  the ARR stood at €4.1 million.Including maintenance services  Witbe's recurring revenue increased by +34% in 2022 to €7.6 million  totaling 29% of the annual revenue. The group maintained the share of recurring revenue compared to last year (30%) in a context of dynamic growth and is aiming in the medium term for a target level of 50% recurring revenue.+73% growth in the Americas  Witbe's new center of gravity in 2022Witbe continued its dynamic development in North America  with teams that were reinforced (with pre-sales engineers  customer relations managers  deployments  etc.) throughout 2022. The Americas market recorded annual revenue of €13.1 million  up sharply by +73% (+54% at constant exchange rates).For the first time ever in the company's history  the Americas became the 1st zone of activity for the group  representing 50% of consolidated revenue in 2022 (vs. 40% in 2021).In EMEA (Europe  Middle East and Africa)  revenue amounted to €11.2 million  up slightly by +1% (same at constant exchange rates) and represents 43% of Witbe's activity in 2022. Cloud sales increased by +50% in this area in 2022.Finally  Asia recorded consolidated revenue of €0.5 million (amount restated for €1.2 million in billings for components)  up +43%.Orion plan's Phase 2: ""Focused on our business""In line with the first phase of the Orion plan  Witbe made the decision early 2022 to focus on its sector of excellence: the testing and monitoring of video services on real devices.This involved the progressive drop throughout 2022 of the traditional enterprise sector (Infrastructure & Technology) and ""business"" customers  allowing the group to focus on its video products (Witbox  REC  Smartgate  etc.) The shortfall in revenue for 2022 was largely offset by the success of the Witbox and Witbe Cloud products for video service providers (operators  content providers  and set-top box manufacturers.)ProspectsDespite an uncertain economic context in 2023  the group remains confident.The year is off to a great start  with revenue to be recorded for the financial year already amounting to €7.7 million (as of January 23  2023 ) up 20% compared to €6.4 million last year at the same time of year.Witbe is continuing work on developing its existing products in order to maintain its technological leadership on the market  with many new functionalities and developments planned for 2023. At the same time  the group is strengthening its operations departments in order to produce more efficiently than ever before and maximize the satisfaction of its customers.Financial calendarDate Publication April 18  2023 Financial Results 2022 July 25  2023 1st Semester Revenue 2023 September 19  2023 Half Year Financial Results 2023 January 23  2024 Annual Revenue 2023These publications will take place after the closing of the Euronext Growth market in Paris.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion for Dupixent® (dupilumab)  recommending expanded approval in the European Union (EU) to treat severe atopic dermatitis in children 6 months to 5 years old who are candidates for systemic therapy. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months. In June 2022  Dupixent was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for children in this age group.Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Between 85% and 90% of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age  which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense  persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body  resulting in skin dryness  cracking  pain  redness or darkening  crusting and oozing  which can increase the risk of skin infection. Severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of young children and their caregivers. Current treatment options in this age group are primarily topical corticosteroids (TCS)  which can be associated with safety risks and may impair growth when used long-term.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from a Phase 3 trial in children 6 months to 5 years of age recently published in The Lancet  which met all primary and secondary endpoints. At 16 weeks  Dupixent plus low-potency TCS improved skin clearance and reduced overall disease severity compared to TCS alone (the placebo arm). Dupixent patients also experienced reduced itch and skin pain as well as improved sleep quality and health-related quality of life compared to placebo. Long-term data further showed a sustained improvement in these disease measures up to one year. Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent in this atopic dermatitis population compared to placebo included conjunctivitis and eosinophilia.Story continuesThe use of Dupixent in infants and young children less than 6 years of age with severe atopic dermatitis is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and prurigo nodularis  as well as investigational diseases such as eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in the EU.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  prurigo nodularis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

No additional data or studies have been requested at this time.“We are confident in the profile of SC efgartigimod and the strength of the ADAPT-SC dataset showing noninferiority of our subcutaneous product to VYVGART®. We will continue to work closely with the FDA as it completes its review to bring this important medicine to people living with gMG "" said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer  argenx.About EfgartigimodEfgartigimod is an antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases  in both an intravenous and subcutaneous (SC) formulation. SC efgartigimod is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme's ENHANZE® drug delivery technology.About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases. Partnering with leading academic researchers through its Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  argenx aims to translate immunology breakthroughs into a world-class portfolio of novel antibody-based medicines. argenx developed and is commercializing the first-and-only approved neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker in the U.S.  the EU and Japan.For further information  please contact:Media:Kelsey Kirkkkirk@argenx.comInvestors:Beth DelGiaccobdelgiacco@argenx.comForward-looking StatementsThe contents of this announcement include statements that are  or may be deemed to be  “forward-looking statements.” These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology  including the terms “believes ” “hope ” “estimates ” “anticipates ” “expects ” “intends ” “may ” “will ” or “should” and include statements argenx makes concerning the profile of subcutaneous (SC) efgartigimod and the strength of the ADAPT-SC dataset; the initiation  timing  progress and results of its anticipated clinical development and regulatory milestones and plans; and the timing and outcome of regulatory filings and regulatory approvals.

FOP is an ultra-rare disease that continuously and permanently causes abnormal bone formation. 1 There are currently no disease-modifying treatment options available in E.U.ultra-rare disease that continuously and permanently causes abnormal bone formation. There are currently no disease-modifying treatment options available in E.U. Regulatory processes are continuing in other countries including the U.S. PARIS  FRANCE  27 January 2023 - Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) announced today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended not to grant marketing authorization for investigational palovarotene as a treatment for the ultra-rare bone disease  fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). In the E.U. there are currently only symptomatic treatments for FOP  which do not reduce the formation of extra-skeletal bone in patients with the condition. Ipsen will be requesting a re-examination of the CHMP opinion  based on scientific data available from the existing palovarotene clinical trial program. FOP causes permanent and continuous new bone formation in soft and connective tissues  like muscles  tendons and ligaments  a process known as heterotopic ossification (HO).1 Once formed  it is irreversible.1 The average age of diagnosis is 5 years old2 and ultimately FOP shortens the median life expectancy to 56 years as untimely death is caused by bone formation around the ribcage leading to breathing problems and cardiorespiratory failure.3 FOP has an estimated prevalence of 1.36 per million individuals and about 900 people are diagnosed worldwide; however  the number of confirmed cases varies by country.4 5 6 ""We are disappointed with this outcome and will be requesting a re-examination of the CHMP opinion "" said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. ""We continue to work closely with the EMA to address the outstanding concerns that led to the decision today  with the goal of making this investigational medicine available to appropriate patients  living with this debilitating disease  where no other treatment option exists. Ipsen remains committed to bringing new therapeutic options to the FOP community  which has been instrumental in the development of investigational palovarotene through their involvement in clinical trials. We are enormously grateful for their continued support."" The CHMP opinion is based on its review of data from MOVE  the first and largest Phase III efficacy and safety trial conducted in FOP. The primary objectives of MOVE were to evaluate the efficacy of palovarotene in reducing new HO volume  as assessed using whole-body computed tomography  compared with patients untreated beyond standard of care from Ipsen's global FOP natural history study  and to evaluate the safety of investigational palovarotene in adult and pediatric patients with FOP.7 8 ""There is a significant need for a treatment specifically developed to help manage the progression of this disease. The data from MOVE have helped us to understand the potential for treatments that reduce HO progression to be used in the management of FOP."" Said Dr. Genevieve Baujat  Clinical Geneticist Consultant at Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital  Paris  France. ""Currently  the only therapeutic options available to us are for treating symptoms. We in the FOP community have been waiting a long time for innovations to treat this disabling disease.""Disclaimer: Intended for international media and investor audiences only ENDS About palovarotene Palovarotene is an investigational oral medicine that selectively targets the retinoic-acid receptor gamma (RARγ)  which is an important regulator of skeletal development and ectopic bone in the retinoid signaling pathway. Palovarotene is designed to mediate the interactions between the receptors  growth factors and proteins within the retinoid signaling pathway to reduce new abnormal bone formation (HO). Palovarotene received Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the potential treatment of FOP and was granted Priority Review. Palovarotene was also granted orphan medicine designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Palovarotene is in review processes with a number of regulatory authorities including the FDA and the EMA. Palovarotene is currently authorized for use in appropriate patients in Canada and provisionally in the U.A.E. where it is marketed as SohonosTM (palovarotene capsules).9 10 About the MOVE trial MOVE (NCT03312634) is a Phase III  multicenter  single-arm open-label trial to assess the efficacy and safety of palovarotene. 107 study participants with FOP received oral palovarotene as a chronic (5mg once daily) and episodic (20mg once daily for 4 weeks  followed by 10mg for ≥8 weeks for flare-ups and trauma) regimen. The primary endpoint was annualized change in new HO volume measured by low-dosewhole-body computed tomography. Efficacy data from participants enrolled in MOVE were compared with data from FOP Natural History Study (NHS) participants untreated beyond standard of care; individuals ≤65 years of age with clinically diagnosed FOP and a verified ACVR1R206H pathogenic variant were eligible for inclusion in the NHS.7 About Ipsen Ipsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen's future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words 'believes'  'anticipates' and 'expects' and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen's expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen's patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen's activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen's partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen's business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward- looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

Whilst maintaining his activities as Chief Scientific Officer at Relief Therapeutics  Yves created MBS Sagot Consulting in 2018 to provide to the life science market senior expertise covering research and early clinical development. Subsequently  after leaving Relief Therapeutics  he is a private investor in biotechnology via MBS Invest & Consult Sàrl. He is also one of the ambassadors of the Léon Bérard Cancer Center  an internationally recognized research center in Lyon  France. He has authored 25 papers that have been published in international peer-reviewed journals  holds three granted patents and received the Serono CEO Award in 2001 and the Merck Serono Reward and Recognition Award in 2008.Yves Sagot replaces Terry Sadler as an Independent Director and Member of the Board at BioSenic.“BioSenic has now completed the acquisition of the majority participation in Medsenic and is now focused on ongoing clinical development on both platforms. As a result  BioSenic is now building further expertise in its senior teams  with recent appointments of a Chief Medical Officer that is responsible for the development of both of BioSenic’s cell therapy and autoimmune disease platforms  and a Chief Scientific Officer to manage BioSenic’s scientific research and development ” said Prof. François Rieger  President and CEO of BioSenic. “We are additionally focusing on ensuring our board of directors has the optimal composition of expertise. Yves Sadler has highly relevant and complimentary professional experience  specifically as a co-founder of a European biotech that also went public following a merger. His ongoing advice and contributions will be vital as BioSenic continues to demonstrate value to investors through development of our pipeline of therapies developed through our cell therapy and autoimmune disease platforms. I would also like to thank Terry Sadler for his contribution as an Independent Director through the acquisition process.”“The creation of BioSenic has resulted in an intriguing biotech company with multiple targets and platforms. These number of platforms spreads risk  and also will result in increased innovation as the differing expertise of scientific teams share strategies and ideas. As a result  this should be highly attractive for investors ” said Yves Sagot  Independent Director and Member of the Board at BioSenic. “This is a major reason why I have accepted to join the BioSenic board and offer my additional expertise as an Independent Director. The combination now of the experience of the board will provide a significant contribution to the senior team as they develop therapies for patients suffering from a range of high unmet medical needs.”Yves received a Certificate of Advanced Studies in Management of Medtech  Biotech & Pharma Ventures from the Management of Technology EPFL in Lausanne  Switzerland.  holds a Ph.D in Neurobiology and a Masters in Pharmacology and Fundamental Toxicology from the Université Paul Sabatier (UPS)  Toulouse  France.About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company focused on (i) the development of innovative products to address high unmet needs in orthopedics and (ii) exploiting the possibilities offered by the therapeutic use of arsenic salts (mainly arsenic trioxide (ATO)) for patients with autoimmune diseases. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beFor International Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

The external environment grew increasingly more volatile throughout the year  leading us to adapt the company and our objectives accordingly. While margins and cash were impacted by inflation and supply chain disruption respectively  our connected lighting business and growth platforms grew to reach almost EUR 2 billion of sales. The relevance of our products and solutions was further heightened in 2022  as energy efficiency became even more urgent. This strengthened our competitive position as we executed on our strategic priorities. We brought new innovative and sustainable lighting solutions to our customers and continued to make progress towards doubling our impact on environment and society ” said Eric Rondolat  CEO of Signify.“Looking ahead  we expect volatility to persist in the first half of 2023 and our performance to improve in the second half. While top-line growth will be difficult to predict  our key priority in 2023 will be to improve profitability and return to a free cash flow level in line with previous years. We will intensify our focus on managing the decline and profitability of our Conventional Products business  while further driving the transition to energy efficient  connected and sustainable lighting solutions. As we move forward  we remain committed to our strategy to invest and drive innovation in the lighting industry and so create a more sustainable and connected future for all.”Brighter Lives  Better World 2025In the fourth quarter  Signify completed the second year of its Brighter Lives  Better World 2025 sustainab il ity program   making continued progress towards doubling its positive impact on the environment and society:Double the pace of the Paris agreement:The cumulative carbon reduction over the value chain is on track to reach the 2025 target. This is mainly driven by energy-efficient and connected LED lighting  which reduce emissions in the use phase.Double Circular revenues to 32%:Circular revenues were 29% and are on track  mainly driven by serviceable and circular luminaires.Double Brighter lives revenues to 32%:Brighter lives revenues of 27%  on track to reach the 2025 target. The consumer well-being and safety & security portfolios continue to be the main contributors to Brighter lives revenues.Double the percentage of women in leadership to 34%:The percentage of women in leadership positions was 28%. An improvement versus the end of last year  yet slightly off track to reach the 2025 target. This quarter  Signify focused on improving inclusive hiring practices and internal talent development. These actions help Signify realize its diversity ambitions.In the fourth quarter  Signify received several external recognitions for its leadership in Sustainability and Climate action. Signify was included on the CDP’s Climate A List   and was included in the DJSI World Index for the 6th consecutive year.OutlookSignify continues to aim for growth  both organic and through selected acquisitions. Given the volatility of the current macro environment  Signify does not provide a comparable sales growth guidance for 2023. The company will focus its efforts on improving its Adjusted EBITA margin and free cash flow. Signify expects for 2023:An Adjusted EBITA margin in the range of 10.5-11.5%Free cash flow between 6-8% of salesCapital allocationSignify proposes a cash dividend of EUR 1.50 per share for 2022  in line with its policy to pay an increasing annual cash dividend per share year on year.

Comparable sales growth was 1.2%  benefiting from traction in the professional segment  partly offset by China  which was impacted by COVID-related measures  and softness in the consumer segment.The Adjusted gross margin declined by 210 bps to 37.3%  mainly due to an adverse currency impact as price increases largely compensated input and energy cost inflation throughout the year. Adjusted indirect costs as a percentage of sales decreased by 70 bps to 28.9%  mainly driven by indirect cost savings.Adjusted EBITA declined by 4.2% to EUR 762 million. Digital Solutions and Digital Products further increased their combined share of Signify's Adjusted EBITA excluding 'Other' to 86% (2021: 82%). The Adjusted EBITA margin declined by 150 bps to 10.1%  mainly driven by the lower gross margin.Total restructuring costs were EUR 64 million  acquisition-related charges were EUR 27 million and other incidental items were a net benefit of EUR 173 million. The other incidental items were mainly related to the gain on the disposal of non-strategic real estate assets. Net income increased by 31.0% to EUR 532 million  mainly driven by the gain on the disposal of non-strategic real estate assets  partly offset by a higher income tax expense  due to higher taxable income  and higher net financial expenses.Fourth quarterNominal sales declined by 1.5% to EUR 1 978 million  with a comparable sales decline of 8.8%. The decline is mainly attributable to a further deterioration of the Chinese market due to COVID-related disruptions  a weaker indoor professional business  continued softness in the consumer segment and lower growth in the OEM channel than anticipated. Nominal sales included a positive currency effect of 4.7%  mainly from the appreciation of the USD versus Q4 21  and a positive impact of 2.6% from the consolidation of Fluence and Pierlite.The Adjusted gross margin decreased by 240 bps to 37.1%  mainly driven by an adverse currency impact. Price increases continued to offset higher input costs and the surge in energy costs. On a sequential basis  the gross margin has stabilized since Q2 22. Adjusted indirect costs as a percentage of sales increased by 50 bps to 28.3%  as indirect cost savings did not fully compensate lower sales volumes.Adjusted EBITA decreased to EUR 202 million. The Adjusted EBITA margin decreased to 10.2%  mainly due to a negative currency impact of 150 bps and fixed cost under-absorption due to lower sales volumes. The negative currency impact was the combination of both the year-on-year weakening of the EUR versus the USD and CNY  and a continued  yet temporary  FX hedging headwind.Total restructuring costs were EUR 47 million  acquisition-related charges were EUR 4 million and various incidental items were a net benefit of EUR 15 million. Net income decreased to EUR 86 million  as a result of lower income from operations and higher financial expenses. The higher financial expenses were mainly impacted by the Virtual Power Purchase Agreements  higher interest costs and the recognition of a monetary loss due to hyperinflation in Turkey.The number of employees (FTE) decreased from 36 824 at the end of Q4 21 to 34 619 at the end of Q4 22. The year-on-year decrease is mostly related to factory personnel. The number of FTEs is affected by fluctuations in volume and seasonality.1 This press release contains certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios  such as comparable sales growth  EBITA  adjusted EBITA and free cash flow  and related ratios  which are not recognized measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS.

January 27  2023. The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion for Dupixent® (dupilumab)  recommending expanded approval in the European Union (EU) to treat severe atopic dermatitis in children 6 months to 5 years old who are candidates for systemic therapy. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months. In June 2022  Dupixent was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for children in this age group.Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Between 85% and 90% of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age  which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense  persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body  resulting in skin dryness  cracking  pain  redness or darkening  crusting and oozing  which can increase the risk of skin infection. Severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of young children and their caregivers. Current treatment options in this age group are primarily topical corticosteroids (TCS)  which can be associated with safety risks and may impair growth when used long-term.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from a Phase 3 trial in children 6 months to 5 years of age recently published in The Lancet  which met all primary and secondary endpoints. At 16 weeks  Dupixent plus low-potency TCS improved skin clearance and reduced overall disease severity compared to TCS alone (the placebo arm). Dupixent patients also experienced reduced itch and skin pain as well as improved sleep quality and health-related quality of life compared to placebo. Long-term data further showed a sustained improvement in these disease measures up to one year. Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent in this atopic dermatitis population compared to placebo included conjunctivitis and eosinophilia.The use of Dupixent in infants and young children less than 6 years of age with severe atopic dermatitis is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and prurigo nodularis  as well as investigational diseases such as eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in the EU.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  prurigo nodularis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion for Dupixent® (dupilumab)  recommending expanded approval in the European Union (EU) to treat severe atopic dermatitis in children 6 months to 5 years old who are candidates for systemic therapy. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months. In June 2022  Dupixent was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for children in this age group.Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Between 85% and 90% of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age  which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense  persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body  resulting in skin dryness  cracking  pain  redness or darkening  crusting and oozing  which can increase the risk of skin infection. Severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of young children and their caregivers. Current treatment options in this age group are primarily topical corticosteroids (TCS)  which can be associated with safety risks and may impair growth when used long-term.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from a Phase 3 trial in children 6 months to 5 years of age recently published in The Lancet  which met all primary and secondary endpoints. At 16 weeks  Dupixent plus low-potency TCS improved skin clearance and reduced overall disease severity compared to TCS alone (the placebo arm). Dupixent patients also experienced reduced itch and skin pain as well as improved sleep quality and health-related quality of life compared to placebo. Long-term data further showed a sustained improvement in these disease measures up to one year. Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent in this atopic dermatitis population compared to placebo included conjunctivitis and eosinophilia.The use of Dupixent in infants and young children less than 6 years of age with severe atopic dermatitis is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and prurigo nodularis  as well as investigational diseases such as eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in the EU.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  prurigo nodularis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.
