17347,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4573288-stellantis-great-business-with-significant-potential-upside,Stellantis: Great Business With Significant Potential Upside (NYSE:STLA),Stellantis has double-digit market share in over 12 countries. Read more to see my thoughts on STLA stock and why we rate this stock a Strong Buy.,"Bill Pugliano/Getty Images NewsCompany description:Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) is an automotive business which design  engineering  manufacturing  distribution  and sale of automobiles and light commercial vehicles  engines  transmission systems  metallurgical products  and production systems worldwide. It provides luxury  premium  and mainstream passenger vehicles; pickup trucks  sport utility vehicles  and commercial vehicles; and parts and services  as well as retail and dealer financing  leasing  and rental services.The business was formed in 2021 as a 50-50 merger between Fiat Chrysler and PSA Group and is listed on the Italian Borsa and French Euronext. This makes Stellantis the 5th largest automaker in the world.Stellantis owns several regionally significant brands including Vauxhall  Fiat  Dodge and Citroen. As well as luxury brands with Alfa and Maserati.Stellantis Brands (Stellantis)What initially drew our interest in Stellantis was its absurdly low valuation. It is so low that there must be something incredibly wrong with this company. If this isn't the case  Stellantis could be one of the best investments made in 2023. Within this paper  we will look to conduct an overarching analysis of the business  including an assessment of current economic conditions  key trends in the automotive industry and an assessment of their current financials. We will conclude with a relative analysis against peers  with an eye on valuation.Economic considerations:Economic conditions began to deteriorate in 2022  with GDP growth beginning to slow  and in many cases decline. The US saw two successive quarters of negative growth in 2022  although did bounce back in H2'22.US Economic Growth (Trading Economics)The leading contributing factor to this is increasing interest rates around the world. Greater rates make it far more expensive for consumers to borrow  while also increasing their cost of living. This has been purposely done to cool demand  as inflation is currently at unsustainable rates. This continues to be driven by supply chain issues and rising energy prices. This has been very hard on many consumers  as they see their income deteriorate on both fronts.Going forward  we expect things to continue to weaken. Inflation expectations remain high in many nations with interest rates forecast to grow further in the US  UK and Eurozone. The 10-year / 3-month yield curve inverted in late 2022  suggesting a recession may be impending. This will further depress consumer sentiment and drive a further decline in demand.10Y/3M Yield Curve (FRED)This is likely to be an issue for Stellantis as if consumers are struggling to meet their current obligations  discretionary spending / significant outlays will be deferred or cancelled. Those who must purchase an automobile will likely go for a cheaper option  being the second-hand market.Change in the market fundamentals:The automotive industry operated historically as a two-tiered system. New cars would be readily available and subsequently sold into the second-hand market  losing value. This has not been the case post-COVID. Now  many consumers are unable to get their hands on even base model vehicles  having to wait several months to over a year. This has led to price-gauging and a boom in the secondary market  in many cases exceeding the RRP price. A contributing factor to the change in characteristics is supply chain issues. Vehicles are becoming more complex and require a greater number of chips. Not only vehicles but everything with technology in society currently  leading to a serious shortage in many other items.Semiconductor shortage (McKinsey)McKinsey sees automotive businesses ordering 10-20% more chips than they need but this has yet to have an impact. Long-term  we expect chip management to be better and a normalization of this craziness  but that is several years in the future yet.So  what does this mean for Stellantis? Well  we see this as a ""soft-landing"" mechanism. What we mean by that is the rules of engagement have changed  vehicle demand has exceeded supply for at least 2 years  with many consumers either waiting or looking at other vehicles. Many will have purchased a Stellantis Group car because they couldn't get their preferred choice. Further  those who have waited may finally get the chance to purchase in 2023 and feel compelled to take up the option. Should we enter a recessionary environment  we envisage the change in demand Y/Y to be less drastic when compared to prior occurrences.When we look at shipments  this seems to support our hypothesis. YTD shipments remain relatively flat when compared to a period with heightened demand.Q3 Investor reporting (Stellantis)Geographical and brand considerations:Brand:One of Stellantis' weaknesses is that they do not own any market leading brands. If we consider some of the many categories for vehicles  Stellantis is always on the second tier.Hatchback - Ford (F) Fiesta and Volkswagen (OTCPK:VWAGY) Polo are superior to the Vauxhall Corsa and Fiat 500.Sedan / Saloon - Toyota (TM) Camry and Honda Civic are superior to the Peugeot 508 / Vauxhall Insignia.Luxury Sedan / Saloon - BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY) 3/4 Series are superior to the Alfa Romeo Giulia.SUV - Chevrolet (GM) Silverado is superior to the Ram pickup.Luxury - Ferrari (RACE) Roma is superior to the Maserati MC20.We do not consider this a bad thing and did not go through the exercise as a criticism  just that we must understand Stellantis' relative position in the market when compared to others. Stellantis offer fantastic vehicles but do not blow the market away. They are a jack-of-all-trades but master of none.Geography:Stellantis earned c.82% of YTD'22 revenues from 2 key markets  North America and Europe. Growth geographically has come from Stellantis' smaller markets  with NA and Europe stagnating somewhat.We should note that Stellantis was not materially impacted by pulling out of Russia  following its invasion of Ukraine.Net revenue by location (Q3 Investor pack)Stellantis has significant market share in all 4 of its key markets. 2020 is an outlier year and so comparing sales would be a folly  we have yet to return to pre-COVID levels clearly. Looking at the regional split  we definitely see this stagnation and growth split. When we consider this on a market share basis  we see growth in SA  which is impressive  but the stagnation in NA and Europe look to be at least partially driven by a decline in market share.Asia is clearly not a market that is a priority of Stellantis  and we think this is a shrewd decision. Competition in the region is rife  these firms have greater financial resources and in some cases are nationally protected.Stellantis sales breakdown (FY21 accounts)We are not too concerned with the stagnation in Europe and NA  the markets are mature  and competition is high. We would like to continually see growth in SA  as this is an area to exploit  given their already impressive market share.EV revolution:Many nations have committed to the complete cessation of petrol / diesel powered vehicles on the road within the next few decades. Led by Tesla (TSLA)  automotive businesses are racing to develop EVs that consumers want to buy. Consumer's requirements come in the form of a business which can easily replicate all the benefits of a combustion engine vehicle  with none of the downsides. The biggest requirement is ease of charging and battery life. From a business perspective  this of course means the development of an electric engine and battery  but also the connectivity to readily accessible battery stations.Stellantis have done a great job with this  having grown its BEV (Battery electric vehicle) sales 41% Y/Y  with impressive growth in LEVs (Low emission vehicle) too. The Fiat 500 BEV is the leading vehicle in Europe  with an estimated 20% market share  having overtaken Tesla. Further  Management intends to launch a further 4 EV by 2025  including the first ever full-electric Jeep.Looking ahead  EV growth is forecast at a CAGR of 17%  which will only increase as we approach the end of the combustion engine era.EV sales (Statista)We see this as a great opportunity for growth  as Stellantis can utilize its strategic approach to the Fiat 500 and roll this out across its other leading brands. This certainly has the ability to revitalize the brand's growth efforts in NA and Europe.Financials:Stellantis - Financials (Tikr Terminal)Given the transaction date  there are not any real historical financials to compare. Looking at the previous iteration of this combination  we see:Fiat - Revenue grew at a CAGR of 9.5% but stagnated for 3 years. EBITDA followed suit  growing 11.1%. FCF-Y was -1.7% and ROE was 0.1%. Long story short  pretty disappointing.Peugeot - The business struggled post-COVID but performed far better in the latter half of the period.(Source: Tikr Terminal).The current version looks far more impressive. The business has grown revenue well into the LTM period and earns a NI margin of 9%. Management attribute this to greater efficiency stemming from the business combination. Much of this transfers straight into FCF  allowing for sustainable funding of dividends and buybacks.From a balance sheet perspective  the business boasts an impressive 28% ROE. This equity balance comprises 50BN in intangibles  leaving asset value of c.‚Ç¨15BN.Inventory turnover has decreased due to greater inventory held by the business in the LTM. This reflects a gradual slowing down we have experienced since the post-COVID period. This has not impacted cash management in any material way  although does increase the risk of the ability to move stock should demand aggressively fall.The Group holds a mammoth ‚Ç¨47BN in cash  which is equivalent to ‚Ç¨14.63 per share. For context  the current share price at the time of writing is c.‚Ç¨14. On a net cash basis  this is c.‚Ç¨5.96 per share. Investors can in effect purchase this business for less than ‚Ç¨10-a-share. There is of course the risk that management wastes the money  but investors have the ability to mitigate this risk.Given the cash identified  it is no surprise that we do not see any credit risk with the business. They have great coverage of their interest payments and are cash generative.Outlook:Analyst consensus forecast (Tikr Terminal)Analysts forecast very steady revenue growth in the next 4 years  with margins expected to contract from 14% in the LTM period to 13% in FY26F. Further FCF-Y is expected to decline also  falling to 3%.This is likely driven by 2 factors. Firstly  greater investment will be required in the development of more EVs and better technology. We have already seen above that R&D spending is increasing period-on-period. Secondly  the business will likely need to trade some margin in order to remain price competitive in the market.With Stellantis' cash balance  we do not see this is a concern. Dividends / BB can be maintained while cash flow is reinvested.Peer group analysis:Peer group analysis (Tikr Terminal)What initially stands out when comparing Stellantis to its peers is the superior profitability. The business is far more profitability on every metric. Even if we compare analyst forecast metrics of margin decline  Stellantis remains superior. A portion of this is inevitably due to the fact the business is far more conservatively financed.Where the business lacks is in growth. Analysts forecast Stellantis to be one of the weakest going forward  which suggests their relatively strong performance in the EV space is not going to be enough. We concur with this assessment as the driving force of growth is the relative attractiveness of the cars. We've already established that Stellantis' fleet is not a market leader.Overall  if one balances superior profitability with inferior growth  the net should be a business which trades around the average of its peers.Valuation:peer group valuation (Tikr Terminal)Finally  we reach what piqued out interest in the business  a 1x EBITDA multiple. The business is trading at a level far below its competitors on every metric. If Stellantis traded in line with its peers  which realistically will not happen via price expansion  the upside would be 871%.We are looking at this business and struggling to apply a fair value  markets seem to have completely mispriced this asset. Taking a conservative view and considering the average EV/EBITDA multiple in the last 1.5-years  we get an upside of 63%.What we must also acknowledge is the current dividend rate  which  based on the current share price  suggests a yield of 7.4%. With the amount of cash the business has and the lack of risk over FCF positivity  this can be maintained.Risks:This investment does not come without risks  we identify the following as potential areas of concern:Inflation deteriorating margins if the business cannot pass on rising costs.Dilution of shares  which Fiat had done for many years in its history.Greater capex in order to push forward with the shift to EV.Current energy prices putting off combustion engine purchases.Conclusion:Stellantis is the perfect example of an above average business. It has a great fleet of brands and covers the entire spectrum of automobiles. The business combination looks to be a success  with the group boasting market leading margins.The problems we see are with slowing demand from economic conditions and the stagnation of sales in NA and Europe. One of these factors is short-term and may be soft due to robust demand for vehicles which has not been satisfied. The second point is a systemic problem  but our hope is that their EV offerings revitalize their brands. At least for now  however  we can reflect both risks by demanding an attractive valuation.Stellantis' upside potential we see is their growth in South America  the large cash balance  margin superiority and successful foray into EVs.It is difficult to comment on valuation because it is the definition of an outlier. To say there is upside on the table goes without saying  but it is difficult to say how much. Our view is that if Tavares is given the time and ability to execute a relatively good transition into the EV era  this stock will increase significantly. If this doesn't occur  enjoy the dividends and FCF.We rate this stock a strong buy.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

To the extent that the fair market value of the Dividend exceeds Sorrento‚Äôs current and accumulated earnings and profits  the Dividend will first be treated as a non-taxable return of basis  and any amounts in excess of such adjusted basis will constitute capital gain.If you are a corporate U.S. Holder  you may be eligible for a dividends-received deduction (subject to certain requirements and limitations) with respect to your receipt of the Dividend  but the Dividend may be subject to certain ‚Äúextraordinary dividend‚Äù provisions of the Code. Such provisions may result in a reduction of the adjusted basis of your Sorrento Common Stock and  potentially  recognition of gain.If you are not a U.S. Holder  the Dividend to be made to you may be subject to withholding at a rate of 30% of the fair market value of such Dividend  unless you establish an entitlement to a reduced rate of withholding by providing a properly executed IRS Form W-8 BEN  W-8BEN-E  or other applicable IRS Form W-8 (or successor form).This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxes. Furthermore  the discussion above is based upon the provisions of the Code  and Treasury regulations  rulings  and judicial decisions thereunder as of the date hereof  and such authorities may be repealed  revoked  or modified  possibly retroactively  and are subject to differing interpretations which could result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed above. You are urged to consult your tax advisor as to the particular U.S. federal  state  local  and non-U.S. tax consequences to you of receiving the Dividend.

Payment of the Dividend is conditioned upon the Sorrento Board not revoking the dividend prior to the Payment Date.Immediately after Sorrento completes the Dividend  Sorrento will hold approximately 52.1% of our currently outstanding voting stock.You are urged to consult your tax advisor as to the particular U.S. federal  state  local  and non-U.S. tax consequences to you of receiving the Dividend.If you are a corporate U.S. Holder (as defined below)  you may be eligible for a dividends-received deduction (subject to certain requirements and limitations) with respect to your receipt of the Dividend  but the Dividend may be subject to certain ‚Äúextraordinary dividend‚Äù provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended (the ‚Äú Code ‚Äù). Such provisions may result in a reduction in the adjusted basis of your Sorrento Common Stock and  potentially  recognition of gain.If you are a non-corporate U.S. Holder (as defined below)  the Dividend (including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) to be made to you may be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 24% of the fair market value of such Dividend  unless you provide a correct taxpayer identification number by delivering a properly executed IRS Form W-9 (or successor form).If you are not a U.S. Holder (as defined below)  the Dividend (including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) to be made to you may be subject to withholding at a rate of 30% of the fair market value of such Dividend  unless you establish an entitlement to a reduced rate of withholding by providing a properly executed IRS Form W-8 BEN  W-8BEN-E  or other applicable IRS Form W-8 (or successor form).As used above  a ‚Äú U.S. Holder ‚Äù is a beneficial owner of Sorrento Common Stock that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is (a) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (b) a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States  any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (c) an estate  the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (d) a trust  if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons has the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust  or  if the trust was in existence on August 20  1996  and it has elected to continue to be treated as a United States person.The Dividend (including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares of Dividend Stock) may be includable in ordinary taxable income to you in the year that includes the Payment Date to the extent of a portion of Sorrento‚Äôs current and accumulated earnings and profits. To the extent that the fair market value of the Dividend exceeds Sorrento‚Äôs current and accumulated earnings and profits  the Dividend will first be treated as a non-taxable return of basis  and any amounts in excess of such adjusted basis will constitute capital gain.No vote or other action is required by you to receive the Dividend Stock. You will not be required to pay anything to Sorrento or Scilex for the new shares or to surrender any of your shares of Sorrento Common Stock. We are not asking you for a proxy  and you should not send us a proxy or your share certificates.In reviewing this information statement  you should carefully review the reports and other information that we file with the SEC and we specifically refer you to our (i) registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-264941)  including the appendices and exhibits thereto  under the Securities Act  initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (‚ÄúSEC‚Äù) on May 13  2022 (as subsequently amended)  which was declared effective by the SEC on October 28  2022 (the ‚Äú Registration Statement ‚Äù)  (ii) final prospectus with respect to the Registration Statement  filed with the SEC on October 28  2022 (the ‚Äú Prospectus ‚Äù)  and (iii) Current Report on Form 8-K  filed with the SEC on November 17  2022 (the ‚Äú Super 8-K ‚Äù and together with the Registration Statement and the Prospectus  the ‚Äú Disclosure Materials ‚Äù).You should also carefully review the risks and uncertainties described under the heading ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù in the Registration Statement and Prospectus.Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission  nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved these securities or determined if this information statement is truthful or complete.

Specifically  this round of fundraising will make it possible to supplement the financing for the CESTO II phase II/III trial  aiming to demonstrate the efficacy of its botanical drug candidate NFL-101 for smoking cessation (results expected in Q4 2023)  and the PRECESTO trial  assessing the potential of NFL-101 to be associated with nicotine replacement therapies (results expected in Q3 2023)  as well as the continued development of NFL-301  aimed at reducing alcohol consumption.For Ignacio Faus  NFL Biosciences CEO: ‚Äú2023 looks set to be a rich year from a clinical perspective  with the first results on our priority projects in the third quarter of 2023 for PRECESTO and in the fourth quarter of 2023 for CESTO II.Story continuesIt is important to note that the cost of the clinical trials that we are carrying out is relatively low compared with other indications  especially because patients are monitored on an outpatient basis  yet smoking cessation in particular offers a very strong level of commercial potential on account of the number of smokers and the limitations involved with current treatments. As we maintain a very low fixed cost structure  the vast majority of the funds are allocated to financing clinical trials and therefore serve to increase the potential value of NFL Biosciences‚Äô projects.With this round of fundraising  we are pushing back our cash horizon to March 2024. Alongside this  we still have two other applications for funding for a combined total to date of 1.7 million euros  which are currently being reviewed by Bpifrance. A response is expected for the first quarter of 2023‚Äù.Round of fundraising to supplement the financing for the NFL-101 clinical trials underway and continue developing NFL-301NFL-101 is a clinically developed  nicotine-free botanical drug candidate from Institut Pasteur  comprising natural proteins extracted from tobacco leaves. It is protected by two international patent families and was subject to a third patent application in 2022. 75% of the funds raised will be allocated to financing the two clinical trials  CESTO II and PRECESTO.CESTO II ‚Ä¢ The CESTO II trial is progressing in line with the schedule set  with 75% of the 318 smokers recruited at the nine clinical investigation centers that are taking part in the study. NFL Biosciences expects to finalize recruitments at the end of the second quarter  which would enable results to be obtained for the main criteria at the end of 2023. CESTO II‚Äôs objectives are to select the best dose and assess the efficacy of NFL-101 versus placebo. The primary end-point for assessment is the subjects‚Äô continued abstinence for four weeks (US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) accepted end-point). Many other secondary end-points will also be assessed  including the subjects‚Äô continued abstinence for six months (European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted end-point)  the number of cigarettes smoked  withdrawal symptoms and level of craving. About 55% of the funds raised will be allocated to finalizing this Phase II/III clinical trial.PRECESTO ‚Ä¢ This Phase IIa clinical trial aims primarily to validate the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation treatments and particularly nicotine replacement therapies (transdermal patches  tablets  chewing gums  inhalers and nicotine sprays) with a view to developing an innovative treatment method by associating NFL-101 with other smoking cessation methods. The PRECESTO trial will compare against a placebo the capacity of NFL-101 to reduce smoking satisfaction and cravings. This is a randomized  double-blind trial that will include 34 smokers who are not looking to stop smoking and get great satisfaction from smoking with a cross-over design. This trial is expected to further strengthen the appeal of NFL-101 for pharmaceutical companies that sell smoking cessation drugs and could be interested in taking out licenses. About 20% of the funds raised will be allocated to putting in place and carrying out this Phase IIa clinical trial. The PRECESTO trial results are expected for the third quarter of 2023.NFL-301 ‚Ä¢ This natural drug candidate to reduce alcohol consumption is subject to a co-development agreement with ATHENA Pharmaceutiques  set up in February 2022. Under this partnership  ATHENA Pharmaceutiques  a market leader for the development and manufacturing of oral delivery drugs  will manage the development and manufacturing of NFL-301  while NFL Biosciences will draw up and lead the clinical program  which could be launched in the United States over the coming months. By allocating about 15% of the funds raised to this project  NFL Biosciences will be able to continue developing NFL-301 and file a pre-IND application with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to a future clinical trial application. The partnership aims to develop NFL-301 at least until its placebo-controlled efficacy has been demonstrated as a treatment for reducing alcohol consumption. NFL Biosciences and ATHENA Pharmaceutiques will make a joint investment and will share future revenues based on their respective investments.The balance of the funds raised  approximately 10%  will be allocated to the day-to-day operations of the Company.Before carrying out this round of fundraising  NFL Biosciences‚Äô cash horizon is the end of the second quarter of 2023. Considering the current level of cash and the estimated proceeds from this round of fundraising  NFL Biosciences is pushing back its cash horizon to March 2024. In addition  two other applications for subsidies for a combined total of 1.7 million euros to date  currently being reviewed by Bpifrance  with a response expected for the first quarter of 2023  would extend this cash horizon. NFL Biosciences will also continue to apply for non-dilutive financing solutions with French and European institutions.Fundraising conditionsThe fundraising will be carried out with two separate  but concomitant components:1) An offer based on issuing new ordinary shares with preferential subscription rights waived for professional investors in accordance with Article L. 225-138 of the French commercial code (Code de commerce) on the one hand  and Article L. 411-2 of the French monetary and financial code (Code mon√©taire et financier) on the other hand (the ‚ÄúReserved Offer‚Äù). The Reserved Offer will be carried out in accordance with the delegations granted to the Board of Directors under the terms of the 12th and 13th resolutions from the Extraordinary General Meeting on May 25  2022.The Reserved Offer is intended for:(i) the following categories of investors based on the 12th resolution:companies  investment funds and family offices that usually invest in small and medium-sized enterprises in the health sector  and the biotech sector in particular  with the Board of Directors to set the corresponding list  while noting that the maximum number of beneficiaries has been capped at 15;holding companies  collective savings management funds or life insurance companies  specialized in investing in small and mid caps from the health sector  and the biotech sector in particular;French or foreign-law companies or groups of companies that have operational activities in the health sector  with the Board of Directors to set the corresponding list  while noting that the maximum number of beneficiaries has been capped at 20 per issue;(ii) the investors covered by Article L. 411-2-1 of the French monetary and financial code based on the 13th resolution.The subscription price for the new shares with the Reserved Offer will as a minimum be equal to the volume-weighted average price of NFL Biosciences shares for the last five trading days prior to the setting of the price  less a potential discount of up to 30% in accordance with the abovementioned delegations.

A judgment in the pending emergency arbitration proceedings is expected on 7 February 2023.Following recent acquisitions of additional shares by Famatown Finance Limited (as disclosed on Euronav's website)  Frontline plc  Famatown Finance Limited  Hemen Holding Limited and Geveran Trading Co. Limited. could be qualified as a related party in the meaning of IAS24. As a precautionary measure the Supervisory Board has therefore taken the decision in relation to the filing of the request for arbitration on the merits against Frontline plc  Famatown Finance Limited  Hemen Holding Limited and Geveran Trading Co. Limited in accordance with the procedure provided for in article 7:116 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations.Euronav has assessed that Frontline's unilateral action in pursuing the termination of the combination agreement has no basis under the terms of the combination agreement and that Frontline failed to provide a satisfactory reason for its decision to pursue termination. After careful consideration  the Supervisory Board  entirely composed of independent directors  has considered that this decision is in the corporate benefit of Euronav. In accordance with article 7:116 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations Euronav's auditor is of the opinion that ""on the basis of our review nothing has come to our attention that would lead us to be of the opinion that the financial and accounting information mentioned in the advice of the Committee of independent members of the Supervisory Board of 26 January 2023 and in the minutes of the Supervisory Board of 26 January 2023  which justifies the envisaged action  are not in all material aspects  true and consistent with the information in our possession in the context of our assignment"".Euronav continues to communicate and maintain a constructive dialogue with its shareholders and will update the market in accordance with applicable regulations.Contact:Contact: Brian Gallagher - Head of IR Communications & Management Board memberTel: +44 20 78 70 04 36",neutral,0.02,0.97,0.0,mixed,0.32,0.16,0.52,True,English,"['Euronav', 'Update', 'Arbitration', 'Geveran Trading Co.

Click here to find out why I start coverage on the stock with a Buy.,"HJBC/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesDear readers/followers One of my ambitions for the year of 2023 is to increase your exposure - in reading  not necessarily in terms of investing (unless you choose to go this way) to European stocks  in particular not only Scandinavian or German (which is much of my coverage)  but also French and the so-called PIGS countries.One of the things I noticed in 2022 when revisiting how my articles and my investments performed  was that I had not given you enough ""pushes"" to look at these companies. And these companies  French ones included  are some of the best 2022 performers out there - and a part of the reason for my own outperformance. I will always try to be as transparent as possible  so because of this  I'm going to increase my coverage here. I also note that there  if I do not do this  is a dearth of coverage on these companies on SA. While this may not necessarily be a problem as such  it limits how potentially profitable you could be.So - here we go.Say ""Hello"" to Amundi (OTCPK:AMDUF)  the largest asset manager in all of Europe.Amundi - Asset manager with over $2T in AssetsSo  I'm not going to pretend that my position in Amundi is massive. Unfortunately  it isn't. I know Amundi because a friend of mine had a wife who worked for the company  and I've spent some time researching it. When it dipped below ‚Ç¨45 for the native stock  I pushed some money to work. And by some money  I mean less than $1 500  a watchlist position for my portfolio.However  after recent outperformance  I'm doing a full-spectrum coverage on Amundi and adding it to my list of covered businesses. It deserves it.Why?Amundi IR (Amundi IR)Amundi is the leading European asset manager. With its AUM  it's one of the 10 leading asset managers in the world. The company doesn't have that much of a history  being less than 15 years old in its current iteration. It contains the legacy assets of Cr√©dit Agricole (Cr√©dit Agricole Asset Management  CAAM) and Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale (Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale Asset Management  SGAM). It listed on Euronext in 2015  which gives it a traceable public history of around 7 years.It's also still majority-owned by Credit Agricole.What the company does is basically most things having to do with investment and asset management. It offers mutual funds both in equity and bonds as well as diversified management  structured products  and treasury management  as well as passive management. Amundi is an ETF issuer and an index fund manager  and also pushes real/alternative asset investment potentials  such as PE and real estate.The company's target customers are retail and institutional investors. In its home country of France  Amundi is more widely known for its activities in the field of French employee savings schemes (√©pargne salariale). Amundi also has a well-respect R&D unit  which provides investing publications on global economic macro  as well as stock market developments.The company isn't just France of course  but the company has offices in Asia and the US as well. It has around 100 million direct or indirect clients  and around 1 000 institutional customers.Amundi IR (Amundi IR)Amundi is A+ rated by Fitch  and it has a very solid dividend  generating more than 5-6% yield on an annual  current basis. The company has been growing organically as well as inorganically. The company acquired Pioneer investments  the asset management arm of Italian UniCredit for ‚Ç¨3.5B  financed by debt issuance and a cap raise. This transaction added a quarter of a trillion euros to the company's AUM  and enabled Italian  German and Austrian expansion. The company also M&A'ed Sabadell - a relatively small Spanish player with around ‚Ç¨22B under management  as well as Lyxor from SocGen for ‚Ç¨825M  adding over ‚Ç¨140B of assets  which also came with high expertise in ETF management and passive management.So  the company has no issues growing - and it's been growing for years  adding business to what it already has. As with any management company like this  the company's core business and income are made up of asset management fees of various kinds - subscription fees  annual management fees  and other ancillary types of income and fees.Like most asset management businesses  Amundi had a very good 2021. The tech froth of that year was simply ""made"" for fee-based businesses  with the insane amount of capital inflows we saw - and reverse again in 2022. Because of this  I tend to exclude these as non-recurring. Amundi saw a 19% EPS decline for the 2022E basis  but still respectably higher than in 2020. 3Q22 mostly confirms this trend for the ongoing fiscal  which we'll see closed fairly soon.Amundi IR (Amundi IR)Now  the company's relatively impressive trends in terms of cost flows come in spite of the market conditions  which for asset managers are extremely unfavorable compared to 2021. Interest rates that have been rising  the index evolution for the past 12 months  it's all pushing the company's trends downward - or as i like to consider it  more towards normalization.The company is currently seeing a decent amount of outflows  but an overall impressive resilience  considering the market we're in. The company's management fees continue to be solid. Net revenues are up 1.9% despite the strong comparative period. Performance fees though  are naturally in line with the market.Amundi IR (Amundi IR)What I'm looking at when I currently check asset management businesses  is how the company is handling the changed nature of expense management  or rather  the expenses themselves. Amundi is impressive here  reporting a 1.7% like-for-like expense decline due to synergies from Lyxor  and significant expense control - and all of this is in spite of a negative FX from the dollar and Euro. On a sequential basis  the company's net income is up 4.7<% thanks to good cost control - on a YoY basis  due to performance fees on net income  the company's results are obviously down on a net basis.A good summary of this business's current quarter and recent results is that the company is doing well despite high-level challenges and impacts. The company also managed to fully integrate Lyxor  and are seeing the results of this integration.The risks and advantages of asset managers are fairly general no matter which one of the companies you're looking at. What is true for one of the top 10's is true for Amundi as well. Any massive EPS growth rate is not something you're going to find here  because asset manager earnings  especially in today's world with a relatively competitive asset management sector already. Essentially  the development of these companies usually reflects the underlying development of the market. In a relatively flat market  these companies perform fairly well and tend toward a 9-12x P/E - in better markets somewhat better.What are things like today then?Amundi's Valuation - not massively attractive  not terrible eitherSo  the right time to buy any asset manager is when there is a significant discount to its overall assets  to its peers  and to the historical valuation overall. We did have that time not terribly long ago when Amundi was trading at around 6-7x P/E - a great discount for a qualitative  A+ rated asset manager such as this. That's for the ADF by the way - the native and the peers for the native trade at closer to 9-15x. Peers for the company come in the form of Schwab (SCHW)  BlackRock (BLK)  State Street (STT)  Franklin Resources (BEN)  Nomura  and others.We don't really have a discount in terms of P/E here though. While we're back to relatively normalized levels even without the massive boost we saw in EPS during 2021.The range for the peers here goes from around 10x for companies like State Street  up to over 20x for Blackrock - so there's a fairly wide spread here  dependant on individual quality  the AUM  and the position in the market. In investments  we either have an upside based on earnings and dividend growth going forward  or we have an upside based on reversion  which we can see from either historical averages  or from peer averages. Preferably  we want a combination of these qualities. We had that back around 3-4 months ago  but we now have an upside that's strictly based on earnings and dividend growth.The company is currently trading at around 10-11x P/E normalized  which is close to its historical average of 11x. The expected forecasted average growth in the next 3-4 years is around 5-6% aper year for EPS and 5-9% for the dividend. A decent growth rate  but based on today's estimates  and based on an 11-12x P/E  which is really the highest you'd want to put Amundi at  would result in an RoR of around 13.8% annually - and that's as high as I would go here.Amundi Upside (F.A.S.T graphs)Peer averages don't give us much help to consider this company higher either. For the native  we have 16 S&P Global analysts following the company. These give the company an average of ‚Ç¨66 per share  which would suggest an upside of 10% here. I don't have much against this target  except that it's perhaps a bit optimistic - I would go a few euros lower to make sure that we're being conservative. There is a degree of volatility to this stock. The analyst range is from ‚Ç¨59 to ‚Ç¨78. I would tend toward the lower end of that range.Now  the company has advantages. The yield is almost double that of a company like Blackrock or Schwab. This could suggest that the risk is significantly higher  which I consider being wrong in this case. Among its peers  it's also one of the best-rated asset managers in existence. I've invested in many of these peers  and I do own shares in Blackrock at the time of writing here.However  we have little data on Amundi's forecast accuracy - only that analysts are perhaps a bit too exuberant about the targets  as they tend to be. For those reasons  I won't allow even a high  covered yield or a credit rating to influence me here.So - my target for the company is ‚Ç¨62/share. This comes to 11x P/E for the 2025E target period  representing a decent but not too exuberant growth. Anything above that will be a positive surprise - but you shouldn't be expecting it  because we're as uncertain about where the market is going from here as we are about the company's overall performance.So  here is my thesis for this French asset manager.ThesisAmundi is a French  world-class asset manager with over ‚Ç¨2T in AUM  A+ rated with a yield of over 6% at a good valuation. The company  like any qualitative asset manager  is a play on overall market development and should be bought at a significant undervaluation.A valuation would consider to be relevant for the company here in order to increase my position is below ‚Ç¨62/share. However  this must also be put into context with other investment opportunities available on the market today.I start coverage on Amundi with a ""BUY""  albeit one with a very limited overall upside.Remember  I'm all about:Buying undervalued - even if that undervaluation is slight  and not mind-numbingly massive - companies at a discount  allowing them to normalize over time and harvesting capital gains and dividends in the meantime. If the company goes well beyond normalization and goes into overvaluation  I harvest gains and rotate my position into other undervalued stocks  repeating #1. If the company doesn't go into overvaluation  but hovers within a fair value  or goes back down to undervaluation  I buy more as time allows. I reinvest proceeds from dividends  savings from work  or other cash inflows as specified in #1.Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (italicized).This company is overall qualitative.This company is fundamentally safe/conservative & well-run.This company pays a well-covered dividend.This company is currently cheap.This company has a realistic upside based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion.The company really can't be considered cheap here  but I still give the company a ""BUY"" with a small upside.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Inventiva is currently advancing one clinical candidate  has a pipeline of two preclinical programs and continues to explore other development opportunities to add to its pipeline.Inventiva‚Äôs lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.

(""GA Mediaset"")  a Spanish wholly-owned direct subsidiary of MES  in exchange for the allotment to MES of all the new shares in GA Mediaset that will be issued as a consequence of its share capital increase serving the segregation (the ""Preliminary Reorganisation"").This Preliminary Reorganisation -aimed at maintaining all the operations and business activities of MES in Spain- will be carried out in parallel to the Merger and is envisaged to be completed prior to the date on which the Merger will be effective.Purpose of the MergerFrom a strategic  operational and industrial perspective  the Merger is aimed at strategically and operationally integrating the Merging Companies  which  until now  have been operating autonomously in their respective territorial areas  resulting in the creation of a pan-European media and entertainment group which  while maintaining its leading position in its domestic markets  will acquire a superior competitive dimension and the potential to expand into certain countries throughout Europe.

Limited in accordance with the procedure provided for in article 7:116 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations.Euronav has assessed that Frontline's unilateral action in pursuing the termination of the combination agreement has no basis under the terms of the combination agreement and that Frontline failed to provide a satisfactory reason for its decision to pursue termination. After careful consideration  the Supervisory Board  entirely composed of independent directors  has considered that this decision is in the corporate benefit of Euronav. In accordance with article 7:116 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations Euronav's auditor is of the opinion that ""on the basis of our review nothing has come to our attention that would lead us to be of the opinion that the financial and accounting information mentioned in the advice of the Committee of independent members of the Supervisory Board of 26 January 2023 and in the minutes of the Supervisory Board of 26 January 2023  which justifies the envisaged action  are not in all material aspects  true and consistent with the information in our possession in the context of our assignment"".Euronav continues to communicate and maintain a constructive dialogue with its shareholders and will update the market in accordance with applicable regulations.Contact: Contact: Brian Gallagher - Head of IR Communications & Management Board member Tel: +44 20 78 70 04 36 Email: IR@euronav.comAnnouncement Q4 2022 results: 2 February 2023About Euronav NVEuronav is an independent tanker company engaged in the ocean transportation and storage of crude oil.

The working day impact was negative over the past quarter ‚Äì standing at -1.6%.At the end of the first nine months of the fiscal year  Wavestone's consolidated revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨376.2m  an increase of +11% ‚Äì equivalent to +5% at constant scope and on a constant forex basis (working day impact -1.0%).Solid growth in sales prices and a consultant utilization rate of 74% over the nine monthsThe consultant utilization rate fell in Q3  due to the arrival of numerous employees since September. Over nine months  the rate stood at 74%  compared with 75% for the first half of the fiscal year.The average daily rate (ADR) reached ‚Ç¨886 over the nine months ‚Äì an increase of +4% compared with the average sales price for the whole of the previous fiscal year (‚Ç¨854). Sales prices have thus continued to rise  in particular due to the integration of PEN Partnership and Coeus Consulting  which contributed +‚Ç¨10 to the ADR over the period. At constant exchange rates  the ADR stood at ‚Ç¨879  up +3%.On the sales side  order intake was solid at the end of the calendar year  as is typically the case at this period. The firm's order book stood at 4.0 months of work at December 31  2022 (3.7 months at the end of September 2022).Annual recruitment plan target exceeded; staff turnover reducingWavestone has maintained a sustained pace of recruitment and now expects to significantly exceed its annual plan of 1 000 gross hires in 2022/23.Staff turnover has slowed down over the quarter. At the end of December  it stood at 17% on a rolling12-month basis  compared with 19% at the mid-point of the fiscal year. Even if this trend is positive  the firm wants to remain cautious about the evolution of turnover over the coming quarters.At December 31  2022  Wavestone had 4 198 employees  including 126 from the mergers with Nomad√©is PEN Partnership and Coeus Consulting  compared with 3 864 at September 30  and 3 732 at the end of March(the end of the 2021/22 fiscal year).Confirmation of 2022/23 annual objectives; less buoyant business environment in 2023Q3 did not see any major changes  either in operational indicators or business development dynamics.The start of 2023 is marked by a market that is less buoyant overall  with clients being more cautious in the face of deteriorating economic indicators. The environment also remains less than favorable in France's public sector. While this backdrop is impacting demand in some business sectors (manufacturing  insurance  and the public sector)  others  such as banking  energy  and the luxury sector continue to offer attractive business development opportunities.The firm remains confident about its continued pursuit of growth in the coming months  and is maintaining intense business development activity targeted at the best-placed sectors.At the end of the first nine months of the fiscal year  the firm confirms its annual objectives for 2022/23:to achieve consolidated revenue of over ‚Ç¨525m  taking into account the consolidation of PEN Partnership and Coeus Consulting  and to achieve an EBIT margin of about 15% over the fiscal year.On external growth  Wavestone intends to pursue its policy of targeted acquisitions  giving priority to the US but without ruling out tactical purchases elsewhere.Next event: publication of Q4 2022/23 revenue: Thursday  April 27  2023  after Euronext market closing.About WavestoneIn a world where knowing how to drive transformation is the key to success  Wavestone's mission is to inform and guide large organizations in their most critical transformations  with the ambition of a positive outcome for all stakeholders.

A judgment in the pending emergency arbitration proceedings is expected on 7 February 2023.Following recent acquisitions of additional shares by Famatown Finance Limited (as disclosed on Euronav's website)  Frontline plc  Famatown Finance Limited  Hemen Holding Limited and Geveran Trading Co.

As a precautionary measure the Supervisory Board has therefore taken the decision in relation to the filing of the request for arbitration on the merits against Frontline plc  Famatown Finance Limited  Hemen Holding Limited and Geveran Trading Co. Limited in accordance with the procedure provided for in article 7:116 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations.Euronav has assessed that Frontline's unilateral action in pursuing the termination of the combination agreement has no basis under the terms of the combination agreement and that Frontline failed to provide a satisfactory reason for its decision to pursue termination. After careful consideration  the Supervisory Board  entirely composed of independent directors  has considered that this decision is in the corporate benefit of Euronav. In accordance with article 7:116 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations Euronav's auditor is of the opinion that ""on the basis of our review nothing has come to our attention that would lead us to be of the opinion that the financial and accounting information mentioned in the advice of the Committee of independent members of the Supervisory Board of 26 January 2023 and in the minutes of the Supervisory Board of 26 January 2023  which justifies the envisaged action  are not in all material aspects  true and consistent with the information in our possession in the context of our assignment"".Euronav continues to communicate and maintain a constructive dialogue with its shareholders and will update the market in accordance with applicable regulations.Contact:Contact: Brian Gallagher - Head of IR Communications & Management Board memberTel: +44 20 78 70 04 36Email: IR@euronav.com",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.38,0.11,0.51,True,English,"['Euronav', 'UPDATE', 'ARBITRATION', 'Form', 'Geveran Trading Co.

Jan 30  2023. The European Commission (EC) has expanded the marketing authorization for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in adults and adolescents 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg  who are inadequately controlled by  are intolerant to  or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy. EoE is a chronic  progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. With this approval  Dupixent is the first and only targeted medicine specifically indicated to treat EoE in Europe and the U.S.Naimish Patel  M.D.Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi‚ÄúThe impact of EoE on a patient‚Äôs daily life cannot be overstated ‚Äì the narrowing and scarring of the esophagus can make something as simple as eating a painful and distressing experience  and may lead to choking and food impaction. With this latest approval for Dupixent  adults and adolescents in the EU suffering from the chronic and often debilitating symptoms of EoE now have the first and only targeted treatment option clinically proven to reduce both esophageal inflammation and damage  as well as improve swallowing ability  pain and health-related quality of life.‚ÄùGeorge D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron‚ÄúThis latest approval establishes Dupixent as the only targeted medicine specifically indicated for eosinophilic esophagitis in the European Union. Dupixent is also the only biologic shown in pivotal trials to help patients achieve histological remission  reduce difficulty swallowing and improve health-related quality of life ‚Äì all of which are crucial to reducing the burden of this debilitating disease. Since its first approval  Dupixent has redefined the treatment of certain chronic diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation and is now indicated for five conditions in the European Union. We remain committed to investigating Dupixent‚Äôs potential in additional diseases in which IL-4 and IL-13 may play a key role.‚ÄùStory continuesThe EC decision is supported by 52-week data from a Phase 3 trial consisting of three parts (Part A  B and C). Part A and Part B investigated Dupixent 300 mg weekly (Part A n=42; Part B n=80) compared to placebo (Part A n=39; Part B n=79) for 24 weeks. Part C (n=188) observed patients who had continued on or switched to Dupixent from Parts A and B for an additional 28 weeks.Dupixent patients in Parts A and B  respectively  experienced:An approximately 10 times higher rate of histological disease remission (60% and 59%)  a co-primary endpoint  compared to placebo (5% and 6%).A 69% and 64% reduction in disease symptoms compared to 32% and 41% with placebo. Disease symptoms were measured using the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ)  on which Dupixent patients experienced a 21.9- and 23.8-point clinically meaningful improvement compared to a 9.6- and 13.9-point improvement for placebo  a co-primary endpoint. Swallowing improvement was observed as early as four weeks.A greater than seven-fold reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings from baseline (-3.2 and -4.5 points) compared to placebo (-0.3 and -0.6 points).Nominally significant improvements in swallowing-related pain and health-related quality of life  as well as less frequent non-swallowing symptoms.Histological disease remission  swallowing improvement and reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings were consistent with the overall population in patients who were uncontrolled  or not responsive to or not eligible for swallowed topical corticosteroids. Longer term efficacy in Part C was similar to results observed in Parts A and B.The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common side effects across indications include injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes and eosinophilia. Adverse events more commonly observed in EoE patients treated with Dupixent (n=122) compared to placebo (n=117) included infections (32% vs. 25%). An additional adverse reaction of injection site bruising was reported in the EoE trial. The safety profile through 52 weeks was generally consistent with the safety profile observed at 24 weeks.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic  progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and adolescents with EoE demonstrate that interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. For people with EoE  swallowing even small amounts of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. They are often left to contend with the frustration and anxiety of a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid  a poor quality of life and a higher risk of depression. In cases where EoE causes the esophagus to narrow  forced and potentially painful dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed. In severe cases  a feeding tube may be the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition. In the EU  about 50 000 adults and adolescents live with severe uncontrolled EoE.About the Dupixent Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe three-part Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE. All patients had previously not responded to proton pump inhibitors  and  across Parts A and B  74% of patients were previously treated with swallowed topical corticosteroids.At 24 weeks  the co-primary endpoints in Parts A and B assessed patient-reported measures of difficulty swallowing (change from baseline in the DSQ on a 0-84 scale) and esophageal inflammation (proportion of patients achieving histological disease remission  defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ‚â§6 eos/hpf).Additional endpoints included abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  swallowing-related pain (DSQ pain score)  health-related quality of life (EoE Impact Questionnaire [EoE-IQ]) and frequency of other non-dysphagia symptoms (EoE Symptom Questionnaire [EoE-SQ]).About DupixentDupixent is an injection administered under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In the EU for adolescents and adults with EoE  Dupixent is administered at 300 mg every week. It is available as both a pre-filled pen and pre-filled syringe at the 300 mg dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and EoE.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Commission (EC) expanded the marketing authorization for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in adults and adolescents 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg  who are inadequately controlled by  are intolerant to  or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy. EoE is a chronic  progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. With this approval  Dupixent is the first and only targeted medicine specifically indicated to treat EoE in Europe and the U.S.‚ÄúThis latest approval establishes Dupixent as the only targeted medicine specifically indicated for eosinophilic esophagitis in the European Union. Dupixent is also the only biologic shown in pivotal trials to help patients achieve histological remission  reduce difficulty swallowing and improve health-related quality of life ‚Äì all of which are crucial to reducing the burden of this debilitating disease ‚Äù said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ‚ÄúSince its first approval  Dupixent has redefined the treatment of certain chronic diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation and is now indicated for five conditions in the European Union. We remain committed to investigating Dupixent‚Äôs potential in additional diseases in which IL-4 and IL-13 may play a key role.‚ÄùStory continues‚ÄúThe impact of EoE on a patient‚Äôs daily life cannot be overstated ‚Äì the narrowing and scarring of the esophagus can make something as simple as eating a painful and distressing experience  and may lead to choking and food impaction ‚Äù said Naimish Patel  M.D.  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ‚ÄúWith this latest approval for Dupixent  adults and adolescents in the EU suffering from the chronic and often debilitating symptoms of EoE now have the first and only targeted treatment option clinically proven to reduce both esophageal inflammation and damage  as well as improve swallowing ability  pain and health-related quality of life.‚ÄùThe EC decision is supported by 52-week data from a Phase 3 trial consisting of three parts (Part A  B and C). Part A and Part B investigated Dupixent 300 mg weekly (Part A n=42; Part B n=80) compared to placebo (Part A n=39; Part B n=79) for 24 weeks. Part C (n=188) observed patients who had continued on or switched to Dupixent from Parts A and B for an additional 28 weeks.Dupixent patients in Parts A and B  respectively  experienced:An approximately 10 times higher rate of histological disease remission (60% and 59%)  a co-primary endpoint  compared to placebo (5% and 6%).A 69% and 64% reduction in disease symptoms compared to 32% and 41% with placebo. Disease symptoms were measured using the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ)  on which Dupixent patients experienced a 21.9- and 23.8-point clinically meaningful improvement compared to a 9.6- and 13.9-point improvement for placebo  a co-primary endpoint. Swallowing improvement was observed as early as four weeks.A greater than seven-fold reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings from baseline (-3.2 and -4.5 points) compared to placebo (-0.3 and -0.6 points).Nominally significant improvements in swallowing-related pain and health-related quality of life  as well as less frequent non-swallowing symptoms.Histological disease remission  swallowing improvement and reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings were consistent with the overall population in patients who were uncontrolled  or not responsive to or not eligible for swallowed topical corticosteroids. Longer term efficacy in Part C was similar to results observed in Parts A and B.The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common side effects across indications were injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes and eosinophilia. Adverse events more commonly observed in EoE patients treated with Dupixent (n=122) compared to placebo (n=117) included infections (32% vs. 25%). An additional adverse reaction of injection site bruising was reported in the EoE trial. The safety profile through 52 weeks was generally consistent with the safety profile observed at 24 weeks.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic  progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and adolescents with EoE demonstrate that interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. For people with EoE  swallowing even small amounts of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. They are often left to contend with the frustration and anxiety of a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid  a poor quality of life and a higher risk of depression. In cases where EoE causes the esophagus to narrow  forced and potentially painful dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed. In severe cases  a feeding tube may be the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition. In the EU  about 50 000 adults and adolescents live with severe uncontrolled EoE.About the Dupixent Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe three-part Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE. All patients had previously not responded to proton pump inhibitors  and  across Parts A and B  74% of patients were previously treated with swallowed topical corticosteroids.At 24 weeks  the co-primary endpoints in Parts A and B assessed patient-reported measures of difficulty swallowing (change from baseline in the DSQ on a 0-84 scale) and esophageal inflammation (proportion of patients achieving histological disease remission  defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ‚â§6 eos/hpf).Additional endpoints included abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  swallowing-related pain (DSQ pain score)  health-related quality of life (EoE Impact Questionnaire [EoE-IQ]) and frequency of other non-dysphagia symptoms (EoE Symptom Questionnaire [EoE-SQ]).About DupixentDupixent is an injection administered under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In the EU for adolescents and adults with EoE  Dupixent is administered at 300 mg every week. It is available as both a pre-filled pen and pre-filled syringe at the 300 mg dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and EoE.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb¬Æ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis  and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

NFL Biosciences plans to use the funds raised to support the development of its clinical research programs for the smoking cessation indication  its operations to develop a drug candidate for the indication to reduce alcohol consumption  and its day-to-day operations. Specifically  this round of fundraising will make it possible to supplement the financing for the CESTO II phase II/III trial  aiming to demonstrate the efficacy of its botanical drug candidate NFL-101 for smoking cessation (results expected in Q4 2023)  and the PRECESTO trial  assessing the potential of NFL-101 to be associated with nicotine replacement therapies (results expected in Q3 2023)  as well as the continued development of NFL-301  aimed at reducing alcohol consumption. For Ignacio Faus  NFL Biosciences CEO: ‚Äú2023 looks set to be a rich year from a clinical perspective  with the first results on our priority projects in the third quarter of 2023 for PRECESTO and in the fourth quarter of 2023 for CESTO II. It is important to note that the cost of the clinical trials that we are carrying out is relatively low compared with other indications  especially because patients are monitored on an outpatient basis  yet smoking cessation in particular offers a very strong level of commercial potential on account of the number of smokers and the limitations involved with current treatments. As we maintain a very low fixed cost structure  the vast majority of the funds are allocated to financing clinical trials and therefore serve to increase the potential value of NFL Biosciences‚Äô projects. With this round of fundraising  we are pushing back our cash horizon to March 2024. Alongside this  we still have two other applications for funding for a combined total to date of 1.7 million euros  which are currently being reviewed by Bpifrance. A response is expected for the first quarter of 2023‚Äù. Round of fundraising to supplement the financing for the NFL-101 clinical trials underway and continue developing NFL-301 NFL-101 is a clinically developed  nicotine-free botanical drug candidate from Institut Pasteur  comprising natural proteins extracted from tobacco leaves. It is protected by two international patent families and was subject to a third patent application in 2022. 75% of the funds raised will be allocated to financing the two clinical trials  CESTO II and PRECESTO. CESTO II ‚Ä¢ The CESTO II trial is progressing in line with the schedule set  with 75% of the 318 smokers recruited at the nine clinical investigation centers that are taking part in the study. NFL Biosciences expects to finalize recruitments at the end of the second quarter  which would enable results to be obtained for the main criteria at the end of 2023. CESTO II‚Äôs objectives are to select the best dose and assess the efficacy of NFL-101 versus placebo. The primary end-point for assessment is the subjects‚Äô continued abstinence for four weeks (US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) accepted end-point). Many other secondary end-points will also be assessed  including the subjects‚Äô continued abstinence for six months (European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted end-point)  the number of cigarettes smoked  withdrawal symptoms and level of craving. About 55% of the funds raised will be allocated to finalizing this Phase II/III clinical trial. PRECESTO ‚Ä¢ This Phase IIa clinical trial aims primarily to validate the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation treatments and particularly nicotine replacement therapies (transdermal patches  tablets  chewing gums  inhalers and nicotine sprays) with a view to developing an innovative treatment method by associating NFL-101 with other smoking cessation methods. The PRECESTO trial will compare against a placebo the capacity of NFL-101 to reduce smoking satisfaction and cravings. This is a randomized  double-blind trial that will include 34 smokers who are not looking to stop smoking and get great satisfaction from smoking with a cross-over design. This trial is expected to further strengthen the appeal of NFL-101 for pharmaceutical companies that sell smoking cessation drugs and could be interested in taking out licenses. About 20% of the funds raised will be allocated to putting in place and carrying out this Phase IIa clinical trial. The PRECESTO trial results are expected for the third quarter of 2023. NFL-301 ‚Ä¢ This natural drug candidate to reduce alcohol consumption is subject to a co-development agreement with ATHENA Pharmaceutiques  set up in February 2022. Under this partnership  ATHENA Pharmaceutiques  a market leader for the development and manufacturing of oral delivery drugs  will manage the development and manufacturing of NFL-301  while NFL Biosciences will draw up and lead the clinical program  which could be launched in the United States over the coming months. By allocating about 15% of the funds raised to this project  NFL Biosciences will be able to continue developing NFL-301 and file a pre-IND application with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to a future clinical trial application. The partnership aims to develop NFL-301 at least until its placebo-controlled efficacy has been demonstrated as a treatment for reducing alcohol consumption. NFL Biosciences and ATHENA Pharmaceutiques will make a joint investment and will share future revenues based on their respective investments. The balance of the funds raised  approximately 10%  will be allocated to the day-to-day operations of the Company. Before carrying out this round of fundraising  NFL Biosciences‚Äô cash horizon is the end of the second quarter of 2023. Considering the current level of cash and the estimated proceeds from this round of fundraising  NFL Biosciences is pushing back its cash horizon to March 2024. In addition  two other applications for subsidies for a combined total of 1.7 million euros to date  currently being reviewed by Bpifrance  with a response expected for the first quarter of 2023  would extend this cash horizon. NFL Biosciences will also continue to apply for non-dilutive financing solutions with French and European institutions. Fundraising conditions The fundraising will be carried out with two separate  but concomitant components: 1) An offer based on issuing new ordinary shares with preferential subscription rights waived for professional investors in accordance with Article L. 225-138 of the French commercial code (Code de commerce) on the one hand  and Article L. 411-2 of the French monetary and financial code (Code mon√©taire et financier) on the other hand (the ‚ÄúReserved Offer‚Äù). The Reserved Offer will be carried out in accordance with the delegations granted to the Board of Directors under the terms of the 12th and 13th resolutions from the Extraordinary General Meeting on May 25  2022. The Reserved Offer is intended for: (i) the following categories of investors based on the 12th resolution:companies  investment funds and family offices that usually invest in small and medium-sized enterprises in the health sector  and the biotech sector in particular  with the Board of Directors to set the corresponding list  while noting that the maximum number of beneficiaries has been capped at 15;holding companies  collective savings management funds or life insurance companies  specialized in investing in small and mid caps from the health sector  and the biotech sector in particular;French or foreign-law companies or groups of companies that have operational activities in the health sector  with the Board of Directors to set the corresponding list  while noting that the maximum number of beneficiaries has been capped at 20 per issue;(ii) the investors covered by Article L. 411-2-1 of the French monetary and financial code based on the 13th resolution.The subscription price for the new shares with the Reserved Offer will as a minimum be equal to the volume-weighted average price of NFL Biosciences shares for the last five trading days prior to the setting of the price  less a potential discount of up to 30% in accordance with the abovementioned delegations. In this context  the price range  set between 2.08 euros and 2.35 euros per new share  shows a discount of 33.97% to 25.40% compared to the closing price of NFL Biosciences shares on Monday  January 30  2023  which is 3.15 euros  as well as a discount of 29.92% to 20.82% compared to the volume-weighted average price of NFL Biosciences shares over the last 5 trading days (from Monday  January 23 to Friday  January 27  2023)  which is equal to 2.9680 euros. 2) A public offering of new ordinary shares with preferential subscription rights waived for retail investors through the PrimaryBid platform under the 10th resolution from the Extraordinary General Shareholders‚Äô Meeting on May 25  2022 (the ‚ÄúPrimaryBid Offer‚Äù).

The price of the shares allocated in connection with the PrimaryBid Offer will be identical to that determined for the Reserved Offer. The accelerated book-building for the Reserved Offer is starting immediately and is expected to end before the start of trading on January31  2023  subject to potentially being closed early. The PrimaryBid Offer is also starting immediately and will end today at 10pm  subject to potentially being closed early.

Specifically  this round of fundraising will make it possible to supplement the financing for the CESTO II phase II/III trial  aiming to demonstrate the efficacy of its botanical drug candidate NFL-101 for smoking cessation (results expected in Q4 2023)  and the PRECESTO trial  assessing the potential of NFL-101 to be associated with nicotine replacement therapies (results expected in Q3 2023)  as well as the continued development of NFL-301  aimed at reducing alcohol consumption.For Ignacio Faus  NFL Biosciences CEO: ‚Äú2023 looks set to be a rich year from a clinical perspective  with the first results on our priority projects in the third quarter of 2023 for PRECESTO and in the fourth quarter of 2023 for CESTO II.It is important to note that the cost of the clinical trials that we are carrying out is relatively low compared with other indications  especially because patients are monitored on an outpatient basis  yet smoking cessation in particular offers a very strong level of commercial potential on account of the number of smokers and the limitations involved with current treatments. As we maintain a very low fixed cost structure  the vast majority of the funds are allocated to financing clinical trials and therefore serve to increase the potential value of NFL Biosciences‚Äô projects.With this round of fundraising  we are pushing back our cash horizon to March 2024. Alongside this  we still have two other applications for funding for a combined total to date of 1.7 million euros  which are currently being reviewed by Bpifrance. A response is expected for the first quarter of 2023‚Äù.Round of fundraising to supplement the financing for the NFL-101 clinical trials underway and continue developing NFL-301NFL-101 is a clinically developed  nicotine-free botanical drug candidate from Institut Pasteur  comprising natural proteins extracted from tobacco leaves. It is protected by two international patent families and was subject to a third patent application in 2022. 75% of the funds raised will be allocated to financing the two clinical trials  CESTO II and PRECESTO.CESTO II ‚Ä¢ The CESTO II trial is progressing in line with the schedule set  with 75% of the 318 smokers recruited at the nine clinical investigation centers that are taking part in the study. NFL Biosciences expects to finalize recruitments at the end of the second quarter  which would enable results to be obtained for the main criteria at the end of 2023. CESTO II‚Äôs objectives are to select the best dose and assess the efficacy of NFL-101 versus placebo. The primary end-point for assessment is the subjects‚Äô continued abstinence for four weeks (US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) accepted end-point). Many other secondary end-points will also be assessed  including the subjects‚Äô continued abstinence for six months (European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted end-point)  the number of cigarettes smoked  withdrawal symptoms and level of craving. About 55% of the funds raised will be allocated to finalizing this Phase II/III clinical trial.PRECESTO ‚Ä¢ This Phase IIa clinical trial aims primarily to validate the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation treatments and particularly nicotine replacement therapies (transdermal patches  tablets  chewing gums  inhalers and nicotine sprays) with a view to developing an innovative treatment method by associating NFL-101 with other smoking cessation methods. The PRECESTO trial will compare against a placebo the capacity of NFL-101 to reduce smoking satisfaction and cravings. This is a randomized  double-blind trial that will include 34 smokers who are not looking to stop smoking and get great satisfaction from smoking with a cross-over design. This trial is expected to further strengthen the appeal of NFL-101 for pharmaceutical companies that sell smoking cessation drugs and could be interested in taking out licenses. About 20% of the funds raised will be allocated to putting in place and carrying out this Phase IIa clinical trial. The PRECESTO trial results are expected for the third quarter of 2023.NFL-301 ‚Ä¢ This natural drug candidate to reduce alcohol consumption is subject to a co-development agreement with ATHENA Pharmaceutiques  set up in February 2022. Under this partnership  ATHENA Pharmaceutiques  a market leader for the development and manufacturing of oral delivery drugs  will manage the development and manufacturing of NFL-301  while NFL Biosciences will draw up and lead the clinical program  which could be launched in the United States over the coming months. By allocating about 15% of the funds raised to this project  NFL Biosciences will be able to continue developing NFL-301 and file a pre-IND application with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to a future clinical trial application. The partnership aims to develop NFL-301 at least until its placebo-controlled efficacy has been demonstrated as a treatment for reducing alcohol consumption. NFL Biosciences and ATHENA Pharmaceutiques will make a joint investment and will share future revenues based on their respective investments.The balance of the funds raised  approximately 10%  will be allocated to the day-to-day operations of the Company.Before carrying out this round of fundraising  NFL Biosciences‚Äô cash horizon is the end of the second quarter of 2023. Considering the current level of cash and the estimated proceeds from this round of fundraising  NFL Biosciences is pushing back its cash horizon to March 2024. In addition  two other applications for subsidies for a combined total of 1.7 million euros to date  currently being reviewed by Bpifrance  with a response expected for the first quarter of 2023  would extend this cash horizon. NFL Biosciences will also continue to apply for non-dilutive financing solutions with French and European institutions.Fundraising conditionsThe fundraising will be carried out with two separate  but concomitant components:1) An offer based on issuing new ordinary shares with preferential subscription rights waived for professional investors in accordance with Article L. 225-138 of the French commercial code (Code de commerce) on the one hand  and Article L. 411-2 of the French monetary and financial code (Code mon√©taire et financier) on the other hand (the ‚ÄúReserved Offer‚Äù).

Following a good 2021 financial year  we had a challenge to maintain growth in 2022  in line with our business plan. It's done. Our ‚ÄúEco Molding‚Äù initiative is attracting exponentially potential prospects and customers. This radical change in posture  even though the economic situation remains complex  has enabled Roctool to establish itself with many industrialists and large accounts thanks to an eco-responsible and innovative approach. With the high point of the signature announced at the start of 2023  of the global industrial partnership with STANDEX Engraving  we are more than enthusiastic and confident about the prospects for our business.‚ÄùIn M‚Ç¨ - Consolidated Group 2022 2021 Turnover S1 4 11 S2 5 27 9 38 S1 2 90 S2 5 34 8 24 Sales of goods 1 96 3 92 5 88 1 80 2 38 4 18 Sales of Services 1 18 1 29 2 47 0 97 0 72 1 69 Licences and Royalties 0 97 0 07 1 04 0 13 2 24 2 37Confirming the relevance of the strategic action plan on the product mix  equipment sales amounted to 5.9‚Ç¨ million  up sharply by +41% vs 2021  with a marked increase in the number of Roctool systems delivered  accompanied by the significant sale of tooling hardware (key components of the technology and a real indicator of the use of the technology).Provision of services amounted to 2.5‚Ç¨ million  a strong increase of +46% vs 2021.Licensing and royalty concessions amounted to 1.0‚Ç¨ million  down sharply compared to 2021  the year in which a major beauty contract was signed.Growth in 2022 revenue was therefore built on a growing number of projects and new applications. To be noted  a large order portfolio for the beginning of 2023.Adoption of the ‚ÄúEco Molding‚Äù initiativeEco-Molding has proven its worth and continues to seduce major clients. Its three pillars  which are the transition to more eco-responsible materials  the mastery of the best molding technologies  and the use of mold surface treatment technologies to reduce or eliminate secondary operations  constitute major arguments for the adoption of this innovation. The many presentations at trade fairs and on different products demonstrate the obvious gains of ‚ÄúEco-Molding‚Äù. In less than two years  it marks the in-depth transformation of Roctool and places the company more than ever on a trajectory of success.The breakthrough of the automotive sectorThe automobile  Roctool's historic market  is making a comeback and represents 4.3‚Ç¨ million or 46% of turnover  followed by consumer products (20%)  industry (15%)   beauty (11%)  electronics (4%) and medical (2%).Appointment of an International Sales DirectorRecruitment in September 2022 of Remo Soligon  benefiting from an experience of more than 15 years with industrialists on an international scale  who will actively contribute to the company's strategic initiatives and strengthen commercial actions at a global level in order to accelerate the commercial momentum already established.Outlook:With the announcement  on January 16  of the signing of an international partnership with Standex Engraving  Roctool is counting on expanding its markets and multiplying new projects. Combining Standex Engraving Mold-Tech's global texturing capabilities with Roctool's heating and cooling technology provides convenient access to global expertise  support and technology  all in one step.In addition  the collaboration with the CEA continues  suggesting new opportunities in the field of solar energy.Confident in this good momentum  with cash at the end of 2022 in line with the group's expectations and following a path of profitable growth  the Group is maintaining a prudent policy of its resources to support growth. In addition to fine-tuning the cost structure  purchases and external charges  Roctool will propose to the Extraordinary General Meeting of March 6  2023 to postpone the maturity date of the 2021 ORNANs from May 31  2023 to December 31  2023.Next publicationAnnual results  14th April 2023Contact press / Investor relationsAelium AdvisorsValentine Boivin+33 1 75 77 54 65roctool@aelium.frAbout Roctool: Roctool  specializes in rapid heat and cool technologies for plastic injection and composite molding.

Jan 30  2023. The European Commission (EC) has expanded the marketing authorization for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in adults and adolescents 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg  who are inadequately controlled by  are intolerant to  or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy. EoE is a chronic  progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. With this approval  Dupixent is the first and only targeted medicine specifically indicated to treat EoE in Europe and the U.S.Naimish Patel  M.D.Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi‚ÄúThe impact of EoE on a patient‚Äôs daily life cannot be overstated ‚Äì the narrowing and scarring of the esophagus can make something as simple as eating a painful and distressing experience  and may lead to choking and food impaction. With this latest approval for Dupixent  adults and adolescents in the EU suffering from the chronic and often debilitating symptoms of EoE now have the first and only targeted treatment option clinically proven to reduce both esophageal inflammation and damage  as well as improve swallowing ability  pain and health-related quality of life.‚ÄùGeorge D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron‚ÄúThis latest approval establishes Dupixent as the only targeted medicine specifically indicated for eosinophilic esophagitis in the European Union. Dupixent is also the only biologic shown in pivotal trials to help patients achieve histological remission  reduce difficulty swallowing and improve health-related quality of life ‚Äì all of which are crucial to reducing the burden of this debilitating disease. Since its first approval  Dupixent has redefined the treatment of certain chronic diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation and is now indicated for five conditions in the European Union. We remain committed to investigating Dupixent‚Äôs potential in additional diseases in which IL-4 and IL-13 may play a key role.‚ÄùThe EC decision is supported by 52-week data from a Phase 3 trial consisting of three parts (Part A  B and C). Part A and Part B investigated Dupixent 300 mg weekly (Part A n=42; Part B n=80) compared to placebo (Part A n=39; Part B n=79) for 24 weeks. Part C (n=188) observed patients who had continued on or switched to Dupixent from Parts A and B for an additional 28 weeks.Dupixent patients in Parts A and B  respectively  experienced:An approximately 10 times higher rate of histological disease remission (60% and 59%)  a co-primary endpoint  compared to placebo (5% and 6%).A 69% and 64% reduction in disease symptoms compared to 32% and 41% with placebo. Disease symptoms were measured using the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ)  on which Dupixent patients experienced a 21.9- and 23.8-point clinically meaningful improvement compared to a 9.6- and 13.9-point improvement for placebo  a co-primary endpoint. Swallowing improvement was observed as early as four weeks.A greater than seven-fold reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings from baseline (-3.2 and -4.5 points) compared to placebo (-0.3 and -0.6 points).Nominally significant improvements in swallowing-related pain and health-related quality of life  as well as less frequent non-swallowing symptoms.Histological disease remission  swallowing improvement and reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings were consistent with the overall population in patients who were uncontrolled  or not responsive to or not eligible for swallowed topical corticosteroids. Longer term efficacy in Part C was similar to results observed in Parts A and B.The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common side effects across indications include injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes and eosinophilia. Adverse events more commonly observed in EoE patients treated with Dupixent (n=122) compared to placebo (n=117) included infections (32% vs. 25%). An additional adverse reaction of injection site bruising was reported in the EoE trial. The safety profile through 52 weeks was generally consistent with the safety profile observed at 24 weeks.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic  progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and adolescents with EoE demonstrate that interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. For people with EoE  swallowing even small amounts of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. They are often left to contend with the frustration and anxiety of a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid  a poor quality of life and a higher risk of depression. In cases where EoE causes the esophagus to narrow  forced and potentially painful dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed. In severe cases  a feeding tube may be the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition. In the EU  about 50 000 adults and adolescents live with severe uncontrolled EoE.About the Dupixent Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe three-part Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE. All patients had previously not responded to proton pump inhibitors  and  across Parts A and B  74% of patients were previously treated with swallowed topical corticosteroids.At 24 weeks  the co-primary endpoints in Parts A and B assessed patient-reported measures of difficulty swallowing (change from baseline in the DSQ on a 0-84 scale) and esophageal inflammation (proportion of patients achieving histological disease remission  defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ‚â§6 eos/hpf).Additional endpoints included abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  swallowing-related pain (DSQ pain score)  health-related quality of life (EoE Impact Questionnaire [EoE-IQ]) and frequency of other non-dysphagia symptoms (EoE Symptom Questionnaire [EoE-SQ]).About DupixentDupixent is an injection administered under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In the EU for adolescents and adults with EoE  Dupixent is administered at 300 mg every week. It is available as both a pre-filled pen and pre-filled syringe at the 300 mg dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and EoE.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

Jan 30  2023. The European Commission (EC) has expanded the marketing authorization for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in adults and adolescents 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg  who are inadequately controlled by  are intolerant to  or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy. EoE is a chronic  progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. With this approval  Dupixent is the first and only targeted medicine specifically indicated to treat EoE in Europe and the U.S.Naimish Patel  M.D.Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi‚ÄúThe impact of EoE on a patient‚Äôs daily life cannot be overstated ‚Äì the narrowing and scarring of the esophagus can make something as simple as eating a painful and distressing experience  and may lead to choking and food impaction. With this latest approval for Dupixent  adults and adolescents in the EU suffering from the chronic and often debilitating symptoms of EoE now have the first and only targeted treatment option clinically proven to reduce both esophageal inflammation and damage  as well as improve swallowing ability  pain and health-related quality of life.‚ÄùGeorge D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron‚ÄúThis latest approval establishes Dupixent as the only targeted medicine specifically indicated for eosinophilic esophagitis in the European Union. Dupixent is also the only biologic shown in pivotal trials to help patients achieve histological remission  reduce difficulty swallowing and improve health-related quality of life ‚Äì all of which are crucial to reducing the burden of this debilitating disease. Since its first approval  Dupixent has redefined the treatment of certain chronic diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation and is now indicated for five conditions in the European Union. We remain committed to investigating Dupixent‚Äôs potential in additional diseases in which IL-4 and IL-13 may play a key role.‚ÄùThe EC decision is supported by 52-week data from a Phase 3 trial consisting of three parts (Part A  B and C). Part A and Part B investigated Dupixent 300 mg weekly (Part A n=42; Part B n=80) compared to placebo (Part A n=39; Part B n=79) for 24 weeks. Part C (n=188) observed patients who had continued on or switched to Dupixent from Parts A and B for an additional 28 weeks.Dupixent patients in Parts A and B  respectively  experienced:An approximately 10 times higher rate of histological disease remission (60% and 59%)  a co-primary endpoint  compared to placebo (5% and 6%).A 69% and 64% reduction in disease symptoms compared to 32% and 41% with placebo. Disease symptoms were measured using the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ)  on which Dupixent patients experienced a 21.9- and 23.8-point clinically meaningful improvement compared to a 9.6- and 13.9-point improvement for placebo  a co-primary endpoint. Swallowing improvement was observed as early as four weeks.A greater than seven-fold reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings from baseline (-3.2 and -4.5 points) compared to placebo (-0.3 and -0.6 points).Nominally significant improvements in swallowing-related pain and health-related quality of life  as well as less frequent non-swallowing symptoms.Histological disease remission  swallowing improvement and reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings were consistent with the overall population in patients who were uncontrolled  or not responsive to or not eligible for swallowed topical corticosteroids. Longer term efficacy in Part C was similar to results observed in Parts A and B.The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common side effects across indications include injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes and eosinophilia. Adverse events more commonly observed in EoE patients treated with Dupixent (n=122) compared to placebo (n=117) included infections (32% vs. 25%). An additional adverse reaction of injection site bruising was reported in the EoE trial. The safety profile through 52 weeks was generally consistent with the safety profile observed at 24 weeks.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic  progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and adolescents with EoE demonstrate that interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. For people with EoE  swallowing even small amounts of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. They are often left to contend with the frustration and anxiety of a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid  a poor quality of life and a higher risk of depression. In cases where EoE causes the esophagus to narrow  forced and potentially painful dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed. In severe cases  a feeding tube may be the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition. In the EU  about 50 000 adults and adolescents live with severe uncontrolled EoE.About the Dupixent Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe three-part Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE. All patients had previously not responded to proton pump inhibitors  and  across Parts A and B  74% of patients were previously treated with swallowed topical corticosteroids.At 24 weeks  the co-primary endpoints in Parts A and B assessed patient-reported measures of difficulty swallowing (change from baseline in the DSQ on a 0-84 scale) and esophageal inflammation (proportion of patients achieving histological disease remission  defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ‚â§6 eos/hpf).Additional endpoints included abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  swallowing-related pain (DSQ pain score)  health-related quality of life (EoE Impact Questionnaire [EoE-IQ]) and frequency of other non-dysphagia symptoms (EoE Symptom Questionnaire [EoE-SQ]).About DupixentDupixent is an injection administered under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In the EU for adolescents and adults with EoE  Dupixent is administered at 300 mg every week. It is available as both a pre-filled pen and pre-filled syringe at the 300 mg dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and EoE.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Commission (EC) expanded the marketing authorization for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in adults and adolescents 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg  who are inadequately controlled by  are intolerant to  or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy. EoE is a chronic  progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. With this approval  Dupixent is the first and only targeted medicine specifically indicated to treat EoE in Europe and the U.S.‚ÄúThis latest approval establishes Dupixent as the only targeted medicine specifically indicated for eosinophilic esophagitis in the European Union. Dupixent is also the only biologic shown in pivotal trials to help patients achieve histological remission  reduce difficulty swallowing and improve health-related quality of life ‚Äì all of which are crucial to reducing the burden of this debilitating disease ‚Äù said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ‚ÄúSince its first approval  Dupixent has redefined the treatment of certain chronic diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation and is now indicated for five conditions in the European Union. We remain committed to investigating Dupixent‚Äôs potential in additional diseases in which IL-4 and IL-13 may play a key role.‚Äù‚ÄúThe impact of EoE on a patient‚Äôs daily life cannot be overstated ‚Äì the narrowing and scarring of the esophagus can make something as simple as eating a painful and distressing experience  and may lead to choking and food impaction ‚Äù said Naimish Patel  M.D.  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ‚ÄúWith this latest approval for Dupixent  adults and adolescents in the EU suffering from the chronic and often debilitating symptoms of EoE now have the first and only targeted treatment option clinically proven to reduce both esophageal inflammation and damage  as well as improve swallowing ability  pain and health-related quality of life.‚ÄùThe EC decision is supported by 52-week data from a Phase 3 trial consisting of three parts (Part A  B and C). Part A and Part B investigated Dupixent 300 mg weekly (Part A n=42; Part B n=80) compared to placebo (Part A n=39; Part B n=79) for 24 weeks. Part C (n=188) observed patients who had continued on or switched to Dupixent from Parts A and B for an additional 28 weeks.Dupixent patients in Parts A and B  respectively  experienced:An approximately 10 times higher rate of histological disease remission (60% and 59%)  a co-primary endpoint  compared to placebo (5% and 6%).A 69% and 64% reduction in disease symptoms compared to 32% and 41% with placebo. Disease symptoms were measured using the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ)  on which Dupixent patients experienced a 21.9- and 23.8-point clinically meaningful improvement compared to a 9.6- and 13.9-point improvement for placebo  a co-primary endpoint. Swallowing improvement was observed as early as four weeks.A greater than seven-fold reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings from baseline (-3.2 and -4.5 points) compared to placebo (-0.3 and -0.6 points).Nominally significant improvements in swallowing-related pain and health-related quality of life  as well as less frequent non-swallowing symptoms.Histological disease remission  swallowing improvement and reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings were consistent with the overall population in patients who were uncontrolled  or not responsive to or not eligible for swallowed topical corticosteroids. Longer term efficacy in Part C was similar to results observed in Parts A and B.The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common side effects across indications were injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes and eosinophilia. Adverse events more commonly observed in EoE patients treated with Dupixent (n=122) compared to placebo (n=117) included infections (32% vs. 25%). An additional adverse reaction of injection site bruising was reported in the EoE trial. The safety profile through 52 weeks was generally consistent with the safety profile observed at 24 weeks.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic  progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and adolescents with EoE demonstrate that interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. For people with EoE  swallowing even small amounts of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. They are often left to contend with the frustration and anxiety of a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid  a poor quality of life and a higher risk of depression. In cases where EoE causes the esophagus to narrow  forced and potentially painful dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed. In severe cases  a feeding tube may be the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition. In the EU  about 50 000 adults and adolescents live with severe uncontrolled EoE.About the Dupixent Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe three-part Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE. All patients had previously not responded to proton pump inhibitors  and  across Parts A and B  74% of patients were previously treated with swallowed topical corticosteroids.At 24 weeks  the co-primary endpoints in Parts A and B assessed patient-reported measures of difficulty swallowing (change from baseline in the DSQ on a 0-84 scale) and esophageal inflammation (proportion of patients achieving histological disease remission  defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ‚â§6 eos/hpf).Additional endpoints included abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  swallowing-related pain (DSQ pain score)  health-related quality of life (EoE Impact Questionnaire [EoE-IQ]) and frequency of other non-dysphagia symptoms (EoE Symptom Questionnaire [EoE-SQ]).About DupixentDupixent is an injection administered under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In the EU for adolescents and adults with EoE  Dupixent is administered at 300 mg every week. It is available as both a pre-filled pen and pre-filled syringe at the 300 mg dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and EoE.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies.

However  a U-turn proposal put forward the Czech Presidency and then approved by Member States at the end of last year signals a change of direction for EU regulation.Instead of the originally suggested clamp down on dark pools and quasi-dark systematic internalisers  the new proposal suggests a 10% double volume cap and no new limits to SIs‚Äô ability to match at midpoint.‚ÄúThe paradox behind the whole Mifir Review is that the weight of the FCA and the City of London in European regulation has never been greater. Post-Brexit the city is defining the rules of continental Europe more than ever before ‚Äù Simon Gallagher  head of cash and derivatives  told The TRADE.‚ÄúThe priority of Continental authorities now seems to be to compete with the City of London  so we don‚Äôt see an outflow of business to the City. This has been a major driver behind the current Mifir review and its approach to SIs and transparency. If regulators accept that SIs will form a material feature of the European execution landscape  then they should be regulated in a manner that reflects their scale  with reinforced transparency obligations and  above all  improved reporting on the nature of the trades that occur inside them.‚ÄúThere is the prospect that business will shift to them as flows concentrate at big banks. If you‚Äôre having 20% of the market going through SIs to regulate that you need to know trade categories etc. SIs also compete heavily around the closing auction which is a key part of price formation.‚ÄùThe draft regulation proposed by the Czechs in December is now being negotiated by the EU Parliament. Its proposals included a restriction on payment for order flow (PFOF)  leaving it at the ‚Äúdiscretion‚Äù of Member States to allow the practice in their territory should they wish. Venues such as Euronext were vocal at the time of publishing that this discretionary approach to regulation across EU Member States would not support more competition in the Bloc  which already suffers from more fragmentation than other global markets.However  according to sources familiar with the matter  the EU is now likely to mirror the approach of UK‚Äôs FCA more closely  with a blanket ban the practice all together following its being tabled in parliament.‚ÄúThe FCA has clear rules on PFOF and we‚Äôre aligned with their view of the world  whereas in Germany there is a toleration of the practice. As a pan-European operator  this lack of a joined-up  coherent vision of the markets is frustrating for us ‚Äù Gallagher told The TRADE.‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt think payment for order flow is a good thing. It disrupts markets  creates conflicts of interest etc. Economics are economics  these aren‚Äôt saints offering free trading. There‚Äôs no free lunch. A price is paid somewhere and it‚Äôs paid in the spread and the implicit trading costs.‚Äù,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.01,negative,0.04,0.07,0.89,True,English,"['Continental Europe', 'Euronext cash', 'City', 'rules', 'Brexit', 'derivatives', 'Financial Conduct Authority', 'separate regulatory regimes', 'quasi-dark systematic internalisers', '10% double volume cap', 'up, coherent vision', 'European execution landscape', 'implicit trading costs', 'current Mifir review', 'other global markets', 'EU Member States', 'dark trading', 'free trading', 'European regulation', 'divergent stances', 'U-turn proposal', 'Czech Presidency', 'last year', 'dark pools', 'new proposal', 'new limits', 'The TRADE', 'Continental authorities', 'major driver', 'material feature', 'big banks', 'trade categories', 'closing auction', 'key part', 'order flow', 'pan-European operator', 'good thing', 'free lunch', 'EU regulation', 'draft regulation', 'Simon Gallagher', 'continental Europe', 'price formation', 'EU Parliament', 'clear rules', 'transparency obligations', 'discretionary approach', 'The FCA', 'influence', 'City', 'London', 'UK', 'Euronext', 'head', 'cash', 'derivatives', 'Regulators', 'Brexit', 'end', 'change', 'direction', 'ability', 'midpoint', 'paradox', 'weight', 'priority', 'outflow', 'business', 'SIs', 'manner', 'scale', 'reporting', 'nature', 'trades', 'prospect', 'flows', 'Czechs', 'December', 'proposals', 'restriction', 'payment', 'PFOF', 'practice', 'territory', 'Venues', 'time', 'competition', 'Bloc', 'fragmentation', 'sources', 'matter', 'blanket', 'world', 'Germany', 'toleration', 'lack', 'conflicts', 'interest', 'Economics', 'saints', 'spread']",2023-01-30,2023-01-30,thetradenews.com
