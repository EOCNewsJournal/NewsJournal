Specifically  this round of fundraising will make it possible to supplement the financing for the CESTO II phase II/III trial  aiming to demonstrate the efficacy of its botanical drug candidate NFL-101 for smoking cessation (results expected in Q4 2023)  and the PRECESTO trial  assessing the potential of NFL-101 to be associated with nicotine replacement therapies (results expected in Q3 2023)  as well as the continued development of NFL-301  aimed at reducing alcohol consumption.For Ignacio Faus  NFL Biosciences CEO: ‚Äú2023 looks set to be a rich year from a clinical perspective  with the first results on our priority projects in the third quarter of 2023 for PRECESTO and in the fourth quarter of 2023 for CESTO II.Story continuesIt is important to note that the cost of the clinical trials that we are carrying out is relatively low compared with other indications  especially because patients are monitored on an outpatient basis  yet smoking cessation in particular offers a very strong level of commercial potential on account of the number of smokers and the limitations involved with current treatments. As we maintain a very low fixed cost structure  the vast majority of the funds are allocated to financing clinical trials and therefore serve to increase the potential value of NFL Biosciences‚Äô projects.With this round of fundraising  we are pushing back our cash horizon to March 2024. Alongside this  we still have two other applications for funding for a combined total to date of 1.7 million euros  which are currently being reviewed by Bpifrance. A response is expected for the first quarter of 2023‚Äù.Round of fundraising to supplement the financing for the NFL-101 clinical trials underway and continue developing NFL-301NFL-101 is a clinically developed  nicotine-free botanical drug candidate from Institut Pasteur  comprising natural proteins extracted from tobacco leaves. It is protected by two international patent families and was subject to a third patent application in 2022. 75% of the funds raised will be allocated to financing the two clinical trials  CESTO II and PRECESTO.CESTO II ‚Ä¢ The CESTO II trial is progressing in line with the schedule set  with 75% of the 318 smokers recruited at the nine clinical investigation centers that are taking part in the study. NFL Biosciences expects to finalize recruitments at the end of the second quarter  which would enable results to be obtained for the main criteria at the end of 2023. CESTO II‚Äôs objectives are to select the best dose and assess the efficacy of NFL-101 versus placebo. The primary end-point for assessment is the subjects‚Äô continued abstinence for four weeks (US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) accepted end-point). Many other secondary end-points will also be assessed  including the subjects‚Äô continued abstinence for six months (European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted end-point)  the number of cigarettes smoked  withdrawal symptoms and level of craving. About 55% of the funds raised will be allocated to finalizing this Phase II/III clinical trial.PRECESTO ‚Ä¢ This Phase IIa clinical trial aims primarily to validate the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation treatments and particularly nicotine replacement therapies (transdermal patches  tablets  chewing gums  inhalers and nicotine sprays) with a view to developing an innovative treatment method by associating NFL-101 with other smoking cessation methods. The PRECESTO trial will compare against a placebo the capacity of NFL-101 to reduce smoking satisfaction and cravings. This is a randomized  double-blind trial that will include 34 smokers who are not looking to stop smoking and get great satisfaction from smoking with a cross-over design. This trial is expected to further strengthen the appeal of NFL-101 for pharmaceutical companies that sell smoking cessation drugs and could be interested in taking out licenses. About 20% of the funds raised will be allocated to putting in place and carrying out this Phase IIa clinical trial. The PRECESTO trial results are expected for the third quarter of 2023.NFL-301 ‚Ä¢ This natural drug candidate to reduce alcohol consumption is subject to a co-development agreement with ATHENA Pharmaceutiques  set up in February 2022. Under this partnership  ATHENA Pharmaceutiques  a market leader for the development and manufacturing of oral delivery drugs  will manage the development and manufacturing of NFL-301  while NFL Biosciences will draw up and lead the clinical program  which could be launched in the United States over the coming months. By allocating about 15% of the funds raised to this project  NFL Biosciences will be able to continue developing NFL-301 and file a pre-IND application with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to a future clinical trial application. The partnership aims to develop NFL-301 at least until its placebo-controlled efficacy has been demonstrated as a treatment for reducing alcohol consumption. NFL Biosciences and ATHENA Pharmaceutiques will make a joint investment and will share future revenues based on their respective investments.The balance of the funds raised  approximately 10%  will be allocated to the day-to-day operations of the Company.Before carrying out this round of fundraising  NFL Biosciences‚Äô cash horizon is the end of the second quarter of 2023. Considering the current level of cash and the estimated proceeds from this round of fundraising  NFL Biosciences is pushing back its cash horizon to March 2024. In addition  two other applications for subsidies for a combined total of 1.7 million euros to date  currently being reviewed by Bpifrance  with a response expected for the first quarter of 2023  would extend this cash horizon. NFL Biosciences will also continue to apply for non-dilutive financing solutions with French and European institutions.Fundraising conditionsThe fundraising will be carried out with two separate  but concomitant components:1) An offer based on issuing new ordinary shares with preferential subscription rights waived for professional investors in accordance with Article L. 225-138 of the French commercial code (Code de commerce) on the one hand  and Article L. 411-2 of the French monetary and financial code (Code mon√©taire et financier) on the other hand (the ‚ÄúReserved Offer‚Äù).

A judgment in the pending emergency arbitration proceedings is expected on 7 February 2023.Following recent acquisitions of additional shares by Famatown Finance Limited (as disclosed on Euronav's website)  Frontline plc  Famatown Finance Limited  Hemen Holding Limited and Geveran Trading Co. Limited. could be qualified as a related party in the meaning of IAS24. As a precautionary measure the Supervisory Board has therefore taken the decision in relation to the filing of the request for arbitration on the merits against Frontline plc  Famatown Finance Limited  Hemen Holding Limited and Geveran Trading Co. Limited in accordance with the procedure provided for in article 7:116 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations.Euronav has assessed that Frontline's unilateral action in pursuing the termination of the combination agreement has no basis under the terms of the combination agreement and that Frontline failed to provide a satisfactory reason for its decision to pursue termination.

Click here to find out why I start coverage on the stock with a Buy.,"HJBC/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesDear readers/followers One of my ambitions for the year of 2023 is to increase your exposure - in reading  not necessarily in terms of investing (unless you choose to go this way) to European stocks  in particular not only Scandinavian or German (which is much of my coverage)  but also French and the so-called PIGS countries.One of the things I noticed in 2022 when revisiting how my articles and my investments performed  was that I had not given you enough ""pushes"" to look at these companies. And these companies  French ones included  are some of the best 2022 performers out there - and a part of the reason for my own outperformance. I will always try to be as transparent as possible  so because of this  I'm going to increase my coverage here. I also note that there  if I do not do this  is a dearth of coverage on these companies on SA. While this may not necessarily be a problem as such  it limits how potentially profitable you could be.So - here we go.Say ""Hello"" to Amundi (OTCPK:AMDUF)  the largest asset manager in all of Europe.Amundi - Asset manager with over $2T in AssetsSo  I'm not going to pretend that my position in Amundi is massive. Unfortunately  it isn't. I know Amundi because a friend of mine had a wife who worked for the company  and I've spent some time researching it. When it dipped below ‚Ç¨45 for the native stock  I pushed some money to work. And by some money  I mean less than $1 500  a watchlist position for my portfolio.However  after recent outperformance  I'm doing a full-spectrum coverage on Amundi and adding it to my list of covered businesses. It deserves it.Why?Amundi IR (Amundi IR)Amundi is the leading European asset manager. With its AUM  it's one of the 10 leading asset managers in the world. The company doesn't have that much of a history  being less than 15 years old in its current iteration. It contains the legacy assets of Cr√©dit Agricole (Cr√©dit Agricole Asset Management  CAAM) and Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale (Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale Asset Management  SGAM). It listed on Euronext in 2015  which gives it a traceable public history of around 7 years.It's also still majority-owned by Credit Agricole.What the company does is basically most things having to do with investment and asset management. It offers mutual funds both in equity and bonds as well as diversified management  structured products  and treasury management  as well as passive management. Amundi is an ETF issuer and an index fund manager  and also pushes real/alternative asset investment potentials  such as PE and real estate.The company's target customers are retail and institutional investors. In its home country of France  Amundi is more widely known for its activities in the field of French employee savings schemes (√©pargne salariale). Amundi also has a well-respect R&D unit  which provides investing publications on global economic macro  as well as stock market developments.The company isn't just France of course  but the company has offices in Asia and the US as well. It has around 100 million direct or indirect clients  and around 1 000 institutional customers.Amundi IR (Amundi IR)Amundi is A+ rated by Fitch  and it has a very solid dividend  generating more than 5-6% yield on an annual  current basis. The company has been growing organically as well as inorganically. The company acquired Pioneer investments  the asset management arm of Italian UniCredit for ‚Ç¨3.5B  financed by debt issuance and a cap raise. This transaction added a quarter of a trillion euros to the company's AUM  and enabled Italian  German and Austrian expansion. The company also M&A'ed Sabadell - a relatively small Spanish player with around ‚Ç¨22B under management  as well as Lyxor from SocGen for ‚Ç¨825M  adding over ‚Ç¨140B of assets  which also came with high expertise in ETF management and passive management.So  the company has no issues growing - and it's been growing for years  adding business to what it already has. As with any management company like this  the company's core business and income are made up of asset management fees of various kinds - subscription fees  annual management fees  and other ancillary types of income and fees.Like most asset management businesses  Amundi had a very good 2021. The tech froth of that year was simply ""made"" for fee-based businesses  with the insane amount of capital inflows we saw - and reverse again in 2022. Because of this  I tend to exclude these as non-recurring. Amundi saw a 19% EPS decline for the 2022E basis  but still respectably higher than in 2020. 3Q22 mostly confirms this trend for the ongoing fiscal  which we'll see closed fairly soon.Amundi IR (Amundi IR)Now  the company's relatively impressive trends in terms of cost flows come in spite of the market conditions  which for asset managers are extremely unfavorable compared to 2021. Interest rates that have been rising  the index evolution for the past 12 months  it's all pushing the company's trends downward - or as i like to consider it  more towards normalization.The company is currently seeing a decent amount of outflows  but an overall impressive resilience  considering the market we're in. The company's management fees continue to be solid. Net revenues are up 1.9% despite the strong comparative period. Performance fees though  are naturally in line with the market.Amundi IR (Amundi IR)What I'm looking at when I currently check asset management businesses  is how the company is handling the changed nature of expense management  or rather  the expenses themselves. Amundi is impressive here  reporting a 1.7% like-for-like expense decline due to synergies from Lyxor  and significant expense control - and all of this is in spite of a negative FX from the dollar and Euro. On a sequential basis  the company's net income is up 4.7<% thanks to good cost control - on a YoY basis  due to performance fees on net income  the company's results are obviously down on a net basis.A good summary of this business's current quarter and recent results is that the company is doing well despite high-level challenges and impacts. The company also managed to fully integrate Lyxor  and are seeing the results of this integration.The risks and advantages of asset managers are fairly general no matter which one of the companies you're looking at. What is true for one of the top 10's is true for Amundi as well. Any massive EPS growth rate is not something you're going to find here  because asset manager earnings  especially in today's world with a relatively competitive asset management sector already. Essentially  the development of these companies usually reflects the underlying development of the market. In a relatively flat market  these companies perform fairly well and tend toward a 9-12x P/E - in better markets somewhat better.What are things like today then?Amundi's Valuation - not massively attractive  not terrible eitherSo  the right time to buy any asset manager is when there is a significant discount to its overall assets  to its peers  and to the historical valuation overall. We did have that time not terribly long ago when Amundi was trading at around 6-7x P/E - a great discount for a qualitative  A+ rated asset manager such as this. That's for the ADF by the way - the native and the peers for the native trade at closer to 9-15x. Peers for the company come in the form of Schwab (SCHW)  BlackRock (BLK)  State Street (STT)  Franklin Resources (BEN)  Nomura  and others.We don't really have a discount in terms of P/E here though. While we're back to relatively normalized levels even without the massive boost we saw in EPS during 2021.The range for the peers here goes from around 10x for companies like State Street  up to over 20x for Blackrock - so there's a fairly wide spread here  dependant on individual quality  the AUM  and the position in the market. In investments  we either have an upside based on earnings and dividend growth going forward  or we have an upside based on reversion  which we can see from either historical averages  or from peer averages. Preferably  we want a combination of these qualities. We had that back around 3-4 months ago  but we now have an upside that's strictly based on earnings and dividend growth.The company is currently trading at around 10-11x P/E normalized  which is close to its historical average of 11x. The expected forecasted average growth in the next 3-4 years is around 5-6% aper year for EPS and 5-9% for the dividend. A decent growth rate  but based on today's estimates  and based on an 11-12x P/E  which is really the highest you'd want to put Amundi at  would result in an RoR of around 13.8% annually - and that's as high as I would go here.Amundi Upside (F.A.S.T graphs)Peer averages don't give us much help to consider this company higher either. For the native  we have 16 S&P Global analysts following the company. These give the company an average of ‚Ç¨66 per share  which would suggest an upside of 10% here. I don't have much against this target  except that it's perhaps a bit optimistic - I would go a few euros lower to make sure that we're being conservative. There is a degree of volatility to this stock. The analyst range is from ‚Ç¨59 to ‚Ç¨78. I would tend toward the lower end of that range.Now  the company has advantages. The yield is almost double that of a company like Blackrock or Schwab. This could suggest that the risk is significantly higher  which I consider being wrong in this case. Among its peers  it's also one of the best-rated asset managers in existence. I've invested in many of these peers  and I do own shares in Blackrock at the time of writing here.However  we have little data on Amundi's forecast accuracy - only that analysts are perhaps a bit too exuberant about the targets  as they tend to be. For those reasons  I won't allow even a high  covered yield or a credit rating to influence me here.So - my target for the company is ‚Ç¨62/share. This comes to 11x P/E for the 2025E target period  representing a decent but not too exuberant growth. Anything above that will be a positive surprise - but you shouldn't be expecting it  because we're as uncertain about where the market is going from here as we are about the company's overall performance.So  here is my thesis for this French asset manager.ThesisAmundi is a French  world-class asset manager with over ‚Ç¨2T in AUM  A+ rated with a yield of over 6% at a good valuation. The company  like any qualitative asset manager  is a play on overall market development and should be bought at a significant undervaluation.A valuation would consider to be relevant for the company here in order to increase my position is below ‚Ç¨62/share. However  this must also be put into context with other investment opportunities available on the market today.I start coverage on Amundi with a ""BUY""  albeit one with a very limited overall upside.Remember  I'm all about:Buying undervalued - even if that undervaluation is slight  and not mind-numbingly massive - companies at a discount  allowing them to normalize over time and harvesting capital gains and dividends in the meantime. If the company goes well beyond normalization and goes into overvaluation  I harvest gains and rotate my position into other undervalued stocks  repeating #1. If the company doesn't go into overvaluation  but hovers within a fair value  or goes back down to undervaluation  I buy more as time allows. I reinvest proceeds from dividends  savings from work  or other cash inflows as specified in #1.Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (italicized).This company is overall qualitative.This company is fundamentally safe/conservative & well-run.This company pays a well-covered dividend.This company is currently cheap.This company has a realistic upside based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion.The company really can't be considered cheap here  but I still give the company a ""BUY"" with a small upside.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva is currently advancing one clinical candidate  has a pipeline of two preclinical programs and continues to explore other development opportunities to add to its pipeline.Inventiva‚Äôs lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies. In 2020  Inventiva reported positive results from its Phase IIb clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor for the treatment of patients with NASH and received Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (‚ÄúFDA‚Äù) for lanifibranor in the treatment of NASH.Inventiva‚Äôs pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult MPS VI patients. As part of Inventiva‚Äôs decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended its clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is in the process of selecting an oncology development candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 80 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240 000 pharmacologically relevant molecules  approximately 60% of which are proprietary  as well as a wholly-owned research and development facility.Inventiva is a public company listed on compartment C of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA - ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA). www.inventivapharma.com.ContactsInventivaPascaline ClercVP of Global External Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 240 620 9175 Brunswick GroupTristan Roquet Montegon /Aude Lepreux /Matthieu BenoistMedia relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83 Westwicke  an ICR CompanyPatricia L.

(as absorbed company) with MEDIAFOREUROPE N.V. (as absorbing company). Madrid  30 January 2023 S.A. and MFE- by absorption of and into MFE- Mediaset Espa√±a Comunicaci√≥n  S.A. _________________________ Mr. Mario Rodr√≠guez Valderas Secretary of the Board of Directors - 1 - JOINT ANNOUNCEMENT The Boards of Directors of MFE-MEDIAFOREUROPE N.V. (1) (""MFE"") and Mediaset Espa√±a Comunicaci√≥n  S.A. (2) (""MES"" and  together with MFE  the ""Merging Companies"") on the date hereof have drawn up and signed the common cross-border merger plan (the ""Common Cross- Border Merger Plan"") for the cross-border merger by absorption of MES (as absorbed company) with and into MFE (as absorbing company) (the ""Merger""). The General Shareholders' Meeting of each Merging Company that should approve the Merger will be called in due course and are expected to be held during the month of March 2023. In addition  the Board of Directors of MES drew up and signed on the date hereof the plan concerning the segregation (segregaci√≥n)  under Spanish law  by MES of all of its assets and liabilities (except for part of MES' cash and all its shareholding in ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE and the financial transactions relating to such shareholding) to Grupo Audiovisual Mediaset Espa√±a Comunicaci√≥n  S.A. (""GA Mediaset"")  a Spanish wholly-owned direct subsidiary of MES  in exchange for the allotment to MES of all the new shares in GA Mediaset that will be issued as a consequence of its share capital increase serving the segregation (the ""Preliminary Reorganisation""). This Preliminary Reorganisation -aimed at maintaining all the operations and business activities of MES in Spain- will be carried out in parallel to the Merger and is envisaged to be completed prior to the date on which the Merger will be effective. Purpose of the Merger From a strategic  operational and industrial perspective  the Merger is aimed at strategically and operationally integrating the Merging Companies  which  until now  have been operating autonomously in their respective territorial areas  resulting in the creation of a pan-European media and entertainment group which  while maintaining its leading position in its domestic markets  will acquire a superior competitive dimension and the potential to expand into certain countries throughout Europe. Combined sustainable capital structure and strong cash flow generation profile would provide MFE with the required firepower to play a pivotal role in the context of a possible future consolidation scenario in the European video media industry. (1) MFE-MEDIAFOREUROPE N.V. is a public company (naamloze vennootschap) existing under the laws of the Netherlands  with its corporate seat in Amsterdam (the Netherlands) and its registered office and principal place of business at Viale Europa 46  20093 Cologno Monzese (Italy)  registered with the Dutch Commercial Register (Kamer van Koophandel) under number 83956859. MFE is resident for tax purposes in Italy and its legal entity identification (LEI) code is 213800DIFN7NR7B97A50. MFE is controlled by Fininvest S.p.A. (""Fininvest""). The current issued share capital of MFE amounts to EUR 800 313 280.5 and is divided into a total number of 2 707 506 599 shares  of which 1 526 279 035 are ordinary shares ""A"" (ISIN code NL0015000MZ1 nominal value EUR 0.06 each and granting 1 voting right - ""MFE Shares A"") and 1 181 227 564 ordinary shares ""B"" (ISIN code NL0015000N09  nominal value EUR 0.6 each and granting 10 voting rights - ""MFE Shares B""). MFE Shares A and MFE Shares B are both listed on the Italian regulated market Euronext Milan  managed and organised by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (""Euronext Milan""). (2) Mediaset Espa√±a Comunicaci√≥n  S.A. is a public limited company (sociedad an√≥nima) incorporated under the laws of Spain  with its registered office at Carretera de Fuencarral a Alcobendas 4  28049 Madrid (Spain)  registered with the Commercial Registry of Madrid (Registro Mercantil de Madrid) under volume 33 442  sheet 122  section 8  page M-93 306  and with Spanish tax identification number A-79075438. MES legal entity identification (LEI) code is 95980020140005021479. MES is controlled by MFE that holds 259 666 591 MES shares representing 82.92% of MES' issued share capital. The current issued share capital of MES amounts to EUR 156 583 072 and is divided into 313 166 144 ordinary shares (ISIN ES0152503035  nominal value EUR 0.50 each). MES shares are listed on the Madrid  Barcelona  Bilbao and Valencia Stock Exchanges through the Spanish Automated Quotation System (Sistema de Interconexi√≥n Burs√°til - Mercado Continuo) (the ""Spanish Stock Exchanges""). - 2 - Main terms and conditions of the Merger Based on several valuation methodologies and valuation references for both MFE and MES shares (particularly  discounted free cash flow  along with peers multiple  stock market prices  and analysts' ratings)  the share exchange ratio that has been agreed amounts to seven (7) MFE Shares A  of the same characteristics and with the same rights as the existing MFE Shares A at the time of their issuance  for each share held in MES (i.e.  one (1) share held in MES) (the ""Exchange Ratio""). The exchange of shares will be attended with newly issued MFE Shares A (the ""New MFE Shares A"")  to be issued as of the Merger effective date. According to the Exchange Ratio  all MES shareholders will be entitled to receive a whole number of MFE Shares A. Therefore  no fractions will be generated and no fractional MFE Shares A shall be allotted to any holder of shares of MES. The effectiveness of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction (or the waiver) of the following conditions precedent: The Preliminary Reorganisation shall have been completed  for which purposes  among others  the SETID (Spanish State Secretariat for Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure  part of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation) shall have authorised or  as the case may be  expressly confirmed that no authorisation is required for the transfer of (i) the audio-visual communication licenses and (ii) the radioelectric concessions inherent to such audio-visual communication licenses  currently held by MES to GA Mediaset; All the formalities required for the start of the trading of the New MFE Shares A on Euronext Milan shall have been completed; No governmental entity of a competent jurisdiction shall have enacted  issued  promulgated  enforced or executed any order which prohibits the completion of the Merger or makes it void or extremely burdensome; and There shall not have been nor occurred at any time before the date of execution of the relevant Merger deed  at a national or international level  any external extraordinary event or circumstance involving material and significant changes in the legal  political  economic  financial  currency exchange or in the capital markets conditions. MFE will not publish any prospectus for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market  and repealing Directive 2003/71/EC (the ""Prospectus Regulation"") in respect of the New MFE Shares A to be issued as part of the Merger  nor for their admission to trading (nor for the start of trading of the New MFE Shares A) on Euronext Milan  as MFE has opted to rely on the exemptions for the mergers or divisions set out in Article 1  Sections 4.g) and 5.f) of the Prospectus Regulation  and will publish separately on its website (www.mfemediaforeurope.com) an exemption document for purposes hereof  prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/528 of 16 December 2020 supplementing the Prospectus Regulation as regards the minimum information content of the document to be published for a prospectus exemption in connection with a takeover by means of an exchange offer  a merger or a division. - 3 - The Common Cross-Border Merger Plan will be submitted for approval to both the shareholders' meetings of MFE and MES  which are expected to be held during the first quarter of 2023. Once the Merger is approved and the conditions precedent to which it is subject have been fulfilled (or waived  as the case may be)  the Merger will be implemented and  as such  will become effective at 00:00 a.m. CET (Central European Time) on the day following the day on which the deed of merger is executed before a civil law notary officiating in the Netherlands. As a result of the completion and effectiveness of the Merger  MES will be merged with and into MFE and will cease to exist as a standalone entity  and MFE will acquire  by universal succession (sucesi√≥n universal)  all rights and assume all liabilities and other legal relationships of MES. Listing and trading of the New MFE Shares A on Euronext Milan is envisaged to occur on or about the Merger effective date. Additionally  MFE will apply for admission to listing of all the MFE Shares A on the Spanish Stock Exchanges  as soon as possible within a period of three months from the completion of the Merger  so that the MFE Shares A will be listed on both Euronext Milan and the Spanish Stock Exchanges. Post-Merger shareholding structure of MFE The exact amount of New MFE Shares A to be allotted as a result of the Merger will be available upon the Merger becoming effective. However  based on the current number of MES shares and the Exchange Ratio  MFE would issue 374 496 857 New MFE Shares A (and  therefore  increase its issued share capital for an amount equal to EUR 22 469 811.42) on the assumption that (i) the number of treasury shares held by MES (2 shares) and the number of MES shares held by MFE (259 666 591 shares) as of the date hereof are both maintained  and therefore such shares are cancelled upon the implementation of the Merger; (ii) no MES' shareholders exercise their withdrawal rights; and (iii) there is no other increase or decrease of the share capital of MES. The table 1 below describes the shareholding structure of MFE post-Merger based on the shareholding structure of the Merging Companies under tables 2 and 3 below and the Exchange Ratio  and on the assumption that (i) as a result of the Merger  MFE would issue 374 496 857 New MFE Shares A (and  therefore  increase its issued share capital for an amount equal to EUR 22 469 811.42); (ii) all the 88 707 693 MFE Shares A held by MFE in treasury would be cancelled (3); and (iii) the share capital of the Merging Companies (save for points (i) and (ii) in respect of MFE) and the number of shares held by the current shareholders of the Merging Companies under tables 2 and 3 below would not change: (3) On the date hereof  the Board of Directors of MFE approved the proposal to cancel all the 88 707 693 treasury MFE Shares A and  therefore  to decrease the share capital of MFE from EUR 800 313 280.5 to EUR 794 990 818.92 and resolved to submit such proposal to the General Shareholders' Meeting of MFE to be called for resolving upon the Merger. - 4 - TABLE 1 % of ownership % of voting Declarer % of no. of shares Share capital by nominal value rights (excluding (MFE A + MFE B)(4) treasury shares) % MFE A + MFE B (5) % MFE A % MFE B Mr. Silvio Berlusconi (1) 38.85% 46.91% 32.12% 49.17% 48.27% Vivendi S.E.

(""SimonFid"") directly holds no. 226 579 950 MFE Shares A and no. 226 572 000 MFE Shares B. In compliance with the Italian Media Authority Decision No. 178/17/CONS  Vivendi signed a consulting agreement with SimonFid and its sole shareholder SIM S.p.A. (""Ersel"")  relating to the exercise of voting rights over the MFE shares owned by SimonFid  according to the instructions given by Ersel  through its chairman. Vivendi has kept its right to provide SimonFid with voting instruction at the shareholders' meeting resolving on matters entitling the shareholders (not taking part in said decision) to withdraw from MFE under the applicable law. Note (3): Fininvest  on the one hand  and Vivendi (together with SimonFid and its sole shareholder Ersel)  on the other hand  entered into an agreement  on 3 May 2021 (amended on 18 November 2021 to take into account the introduction by MFE of the dual-class share structure)  regarding certain commitments in relation to MFE. Pursuant to this agreement  Vivendi undertook to sell on the market all of the MFE Shares held directly by SimonFid (representing 19.19% of the share capital of MFE) for a period of five years from 22 July 2021. In particular  Vivendi thereby committed to sell one-fifth of the MFE Shares A and MFE Shares B held indirectly through SimonFid each year at specifically agreed minimum prices for each year (unless Vivendi authorizes the sale of these shares at a lower price). In any event  Vivendi will have the right to sell the MFE Shares A and/or the MFE Shares B held indirectly through SimonFid at any time if their price reaches EUR 1.60. Fininvest is  however  entitled to purchase any such MFE Shares A and/or MFE Shares B that are not sold in each 12-month period at a price annually determined. Note (4): The percentage figures are calculated by applying the following formula: number of MFE B + MFE A Shares owned by each shareholder / total number of MFE B + MFE A Shares issued. Note (5): According to AFM (as described below) criteria  the percentage figures are calculated by applying the following formula: number of MFE B + MFE A shares owned by each shareholder * nominal value of each share / total nominal. Note (6): See footnote 3. Note (7): Former MES' shareholders other than MES itself or MFE (total MES shares: 53 499 551).

Limited in accordance with the procedure provided for in article 7:116 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations.Euronav has assessed that Frontline's unilateral action in pursuing the termination of the combination agreement has no basis under the terms of the combination agreement and that Frontline failed to provide a satisfactory reason for its decision to pursue termination. After careful consideration  the Supervisory Board  entirely composed of independent directors  has considered that this decision is in the corporate benefit of Euronav. In accordance with article 7:116 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations Euronav's auditor is of the opinion that ""on the basis of our review nothing has come to our attention that would lead us to be of the opinion that the financial and accounting information mentioned in the advice of the Committee of independent members of the Supervisory Board of 26 January 2023 and in the minutes of the Supervisory Board of 26 January 2023  which justifies the envisaged action  are not in all material aspects  true and consistent with the information in our possession in the context of our assignment"".Euronav continues to communicate and maintain a constructive dialogue with its shareholders and will update the market in accordance with applicable regulations.Contact: Contact: Brian Gallagher - Head of IR Communications & Management Board member Tel: +44 20 78 70 04 36 Email: IR@euronav.comAnnouncement Q4 2022 results: 2 February 2023About Euronav NVEuronav is an independent tanker company engaged in the ocean transportation and storage of crude oil.

The working day impact was negative over the past quarter ‚Äì standing at -1.6%.At the end of the first nine months of the fiscal year  Wavestone's consolidated revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨376.2m  an increase of +11% ‚Äì equivalent to +5% at constant scope and on a constant forex basis (working day impact -1.0%).Solid growth in sales prices and a consultant utilization rate of 74% over the nine monthsThe consultant utilization rate fell in Q3  due to the arrival of numerous employees since September. Over nine months  the rate stood at 74%  compared with 75% for the first half of the fiscal year.The average daily rate (ADR) reached ‚Ç¨886 over the nine months ‚Äì an increase of +4% compared with the average sales price for the whole of the previous fiscal year (‚Ç¨854). Sales prices have thus continued to rise  in particular due to the integration of PEN Partnership and Coeus Consulting  which contributed +‚Ç¨10 to the ADR over the period. At constant exchange rates  the ADR stood at ‚Ç¨879  up +3%.On the sales side  order intake was solid at the end of the calendar year  as is typically the case at this period. The firm's order book stood at 4.0 months of work at December 31  2022 (3.7 months at the end of September 2022).Annual recruitment plan target exceeded; staff turnover reducingWavestone has maintained a sustained pace of recruitment and now expects to significantly exceed its annual plan of 1 000 gross hires in 2022/23.Staff turnover has slowed down over the quarter. At the end of December  it stood at 17% on a rolling12-month basis  compared with 19% at the mid-point of the fiscal year. Even if this trend is positive  the firm wants to remain cautious about the evolution of turnover over the coming quarters.At December 31  2022  Wavestone had 4 198 employees  including 126 from the mergers with Nomad√©is PEN Partnership and Coeus Consulting  compared with 3 864 at September 30  and 3 732 at the end of March(the end of the 2021/22 fiscal year).Confirmation of 2022/23 annual objectives; less buoyant business environment in 2023Q3 did not see any major changes  either in operational indicators or business development dynamics.The start of 2023 is marked by a market that is less buoyant overall  with clients being more cautious in the face of deteriorating economic indicators. The environment also remains less than favorable in France's public sector. While this backdrop is impacting demand in some business sectors (manufacturing  insurance  and the public sector)  others  such as banking  energy  and the luxury sector continue to offer attractive business development opportunities.The firm remains confident about its continued pursuit of growth in the coming months  and is maintaining intense business development activity targeted at the best-placed sectors.At the end of the first nine months of the fiscal year  the firm confirms its annual objectives for 2022/23:to achieve consolidated revenue of over ‚Ç¨525m  taking into account the consolidation of PEN Partnership and Coeus Consulting  and to achieve an EBIT margin of about 15% over the fiscal year.On external growth  Wavestone intends to pursue its policy of targeted acquisitions  giving priority to the US but without ruling out tactical purchases elsewhere.Next event: publication of Q4 2022/23 revenue: Thursday  April 27  2023  after Euronext market closing.About WavestoneIn a world where knowing how to drive transformation is the key to success  Wavestone's mission is to inform and guide large organizations in their most critical transformations  with the ambition of a positive outcome for all stakeholders.

Jan 30  2023. The European Commission (EC) has expanded the marketing authorization for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in adults and adolescents 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg  who are inadequately controlled by  are intolerant to  or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy. EoE is a chronic  progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. With this approval  Dupixent is the first and only targeted medicine specifically indicated to treat EoE in Europe and the U.S.Naimish Patel  M.D.Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi‚ÄúThe impact of EoE on a patient‚Äôs daily life cannot be overstated ‚Äì the narrowing and scarring of the esophagus can make something as simple as eating a painful and distressing experience  and may lead to choking and food impaction. With this latest approval for Dupixent  adults and adolescents in the EU suffering from the chronic and often debilitating symptoms of EoE now have the first and only targeted treatment option clinically proven to reduce both esophageal inflammation and damage  as well as improve swallowing ability  pain and health-related quality of life.‚ÄùGeorge D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron‚ÄúThis latest approval establishes Dupixent as the only targeted medicine specifically indicated for eosinophilic esophagitis in the European Union. Dupixent is also the only biologic shown in pivotal trials to help patients achieve histological remission  reduce difficulty swallowing and improve health-related quality of life ‚Äì all of which are crucial to reducing the burden of this debilitating disease. Since its first approval  Dupixent has redefined the treatment of certain chronic diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation and is now indicated for five conditions in the European Union. We remain committed to investigating Dupixent‚Äôs potential in additional diseases in which IL-4 and IL-13 may play a key role.‚ÄùStory continuesThe EC decision is supported by 52-week data from a Phase 3 trial consisting of three parts (Part A  B and C). Part A and Part B investigated Dupixent 300 mg weekly (Part A n=42; Part B n=80) compared to placebo (Part A n=39; Part B n=79) for 24 weeks. Part C (n=188) observed patients who had continued on or switched to Dupixent from Parts A and B for an additional 28 weeks.Dupixent patients in Parts A and B  respectively  experienced:An approximately 10 times higher rate of histological disease remission (60% and 59%)  a co-primary endpoint  compared to placebo (5% and 6%).A 69% and 64% reduction in disease symptoms compared to 32% and 41% with placebo. Disease symptoms were measured using the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ)  on which Dupixent patients experienced a 21.9- and 23.8-point clinically meaningful improvement compared to a 9.6- and 13.9-point improvement for placebo  a co-primary endpoint. Swallowing improvement was observed as early as four weeks.A greater than seven-fold reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings from baseline (-3.2 and -4.5 points) compared to placebo (-0.3 and -0.6 points).Nominally significant improvements in swallowing-related pain and health-related quality of life  as well as less frequent non-swallowing symptoms.Histological disease remission  swallowing improvement and reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings were consistent with the overall population in patients who were uncontrolled  or not responsive to or not eligible for swallowed topical corticosteroids. Longer term efficacy in Part C was similar to results observed in Parts A and B.The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common side effects across indications include injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes and eosinophilia. Adverse events more commonly observed in EoE patients treated with Dupixent (n=122) compared to placebo (n=117) included infections (32% vs. 25%). An additional adverse reaction of injection site bruising was reported in the EoE trial. The safety profile through 52 weeks was generally consistent with the safety profile observed at 24 weeks.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic  progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and adolescents with EoE demonstrate that interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. For people with EoE  swallowing even small amounts of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. They are often left to contend with the frustration and anxiety of a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid  a poor quality of life and a higher risk of depression. In cases where EoE causes the esophagus to narrow  forced and potentially painful dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed. In severe cases  a feeding tube may be the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition. In the EU  about 50 000 adults and adolescents live with severe uncontrolled EoE.About the Dupixent Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe three-part Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE. All patients had previously not responded to proton pump inhibitors  and  across Parts A and B  74% of patients were previously treated with swallowed topical corticosteroids.At 24 weeks  the co-primary endpoints in Parts A and B assessed patient-reported measures of difficulty swallowing (change from baseline in the DSQ on a 0-84 scale) and esophageal inflammation (proportion of patients achieving histological disease remission  defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ‚â§6 eos/hpf).Additional endpoints included abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  swallowing-related pain (DSQ pain score)  health-related quality of life (EoE Impact Questionnaire [EoE-IQ]) and frequency of other non-dysphagia symptoms (EoE Symptom Questionnaire [EoE-SQ]).About DupixentDupixent is an injection administered under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In the EU for adolescents and adults with EoE  Dupixent is administered at 300 mg every week. It is available as both a pre-filled pen and pre-filled syringe at the 300 mg dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and EoE.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

Amendment of the Articles of AssociationThe Board of Directors proposes that the AGM would decide to amend the Company's Articles of Association to enable arranging a General Meeting of Shareholders as a virtual meeting without a meeting venue as an alternative for a physical meeting or a hybrid meeting. The amendment is intended to facilitate the holding of General Meetings of Shareholders virtually among others in situations like pandemics or other unforeseen or exceptional circumstances  however not limited to these situations. The Finnish Companies Act requires that shareholders can exercise their full rights in virtual meetings  with equal rights to those in customary in-person General Meetings of Shareholders. The amendments do not preclude arranging General Meetings of Shareholders as in-person or hybrid meetings.Pursuant to the proposal of the Board of Directors  9 ¬ß of the Company's Articles of Association would be amended to read as follows:""9 ¬ß Shareholders participating in a General Meeting of Shareholders or their legally qualified representatives or their legally qualified proxies shall have the right to exercise their power to decide on matters pertaining to the Company.A shareholder wishing to attend a General Meeting of Shareholders shall notify the Company by the date mentioned in the notice to the meeting  which may not be more than ten (10) days before the meeting.Since the shares of the Company are incorporated in the book-entry system  the provisions of the Finnish Companies Act regarding the right to participate in a General Meeting of Shareholders must also be taken into account.The Board of Directors may decide that the General Meeting of Shareholders is arranged without a meeting venue in a manner where shareholders exercise their full decision-making powers in real time during the General Meeting of Shareholders using telecommunications and technical means (virtual meeting).""19.

Amendment of the Articles of AssociationThe Board of Directors proposes that the AGM would decide to amend the Company's Articles of Association to enable arranging a General Meeting of Shareholders as a virtual meeting without a meeting venue as an alternative for a physical meeting or a hybrid meeting. The amendment is intended to facilitate the holding of General Meetings of Shareholders virtually among others in situations like pandemics or other unforeseen or exceptional circumstances  however not limited to these situations. The Finnish Companies Act requires that shareholders can exercise their full rights in virtual meetings  with equal rights to those in customary in-person General Meetings of Shareholders. The amendments do not preclude arranging General Meetings of Shareholders as in-person or hybrid meetings.Pursuant to the proposal of the Board of Directors  9 ¬ß of the Company's Articles of Association would be amended to read as follows:""9 ¬ß Shareholders participating in a General Meeting of Shareholders or their legally qualified representatives or their legally qualified proxies shall have the right to exercise their power to decide on matters pertaining to the Company.A shareholder wishing to attend a General Meeting of Shareholders shall notify the Company by the date mentioned in the notice to the meeting  which may not be more than ten (10) days before the meeting.Since the shares of the Company are incorporated in the book-entry system  the provisions of the Finnish Companies Act regarding the right to participate in a General Meeting of Shareholders must also be taken into account.The Board of Directors may decide that the General Meeting of Shareholders is arranged without a meeting venue in a manner where shareholders exercise their full decision-making powers in real time during the General Meeting of Shareholders using telecommunications and technical means (virtual meeting).""19.

17453,Clearstream,Bing API,https://delano.lu/article/kneip-now-exclusive-provider-o,‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not about anything but data quality ‚Äù Kneip CEO says after Clearstream move,Fund data manager Kneip announced on 25 January that has become the sole provider of fund information for Clearstream. Delano talked to Kneip CEO Enrique Sacau to find out what this means for Luxembourg.,The Deutsche B√∂rse Group  which counts Clearstream as its Luxembourg subsidiary  acquired fund data manager Kneip in March 2022. Kneip announced on 25 January that as Clearstream‚Äôs designated data provider  all fund information--including fund data and legal documents--are now supplied to Clearstream Fund Centre via Kneip. It will also simplify the collection of third-party data.‚ÄúSince Kneip was acquired by Deutsche B√∂rse Group  it was made to be part of the funds ecosystem ‚Äù Kneip CEO Enrique Sacau told Delano in an interview after the announcement. They have created a ‚Äútrue one-stop-shop‚Äù for funds that provides services to distributors and asset managers. ‚ÄúThere is the execution piece  there is the distribution piece--which is the fund centre in Zurich--and there is data  which is the Kneip part.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre doing is ensuring that the asset management community can effectively get the data to one of Europe‚Äôs largest fund platforms--Clearstream Fund Centre--with a view to distributing the products  selling the products ‚Äù continued Sacau. ‚ÄúAnd that is important that Kneip does it because of our reach and because we have a sort of unique selling point  which is that we are the data quality provider.‚ÄùData quality in Kneip‚Äôs DNACombining Kneip‚Äôs data management solution with Clearstream‚Äôs distribution capabilities will lead to better quality and increased availability of information for clients  said an announcement from the fund data manager.We‚Äôre not about anything but data quality. Enrique Sacau   CEO   Kneip‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not about anything but data quality ‚Äù Sacau highlighted. ‚ÄúWe are obsessed with making sure that what gets disseminated is right and consistent.‚Äù To ensure quality  Kneip performs ‚Äúpost publication controls‚Äù when data is disseminated.‚ÄúThat is something we‚Äôve always done in thirty years of history for two reasons ‚Äù he said. First of all  checking data is in Kneip‚Äôs DNA  Sacau explained. The company checked data publication with newspapers in the 1990s. But it‚Äôs also because ‚Äúwe have the technology for it ‚Äù said Sacau. ‚ÄúGiven the amount of data we handle  if you don‚Äôt have technology to support it  it becomes a spreadsheet nightmare.‚ÄùA year ago--in January 2022--Kneip acquired Dataglide  a technology company based in the United Kingdom that specialises in data transformation and cloud-based automation. The acquisition has given Kneip a ‚Äúcompetitive advantage that Clearstream Fund Centre has found difficult to resist ‚Äù said Sacau.So what does the move mean for Luxembourg in particular?Kneip has operations in Portugal and the UK  but the company is headquartered in Luxembourg and has its main area of work in the grand duchy  as is the case for Clearstream. ‚ÄúWe have thus renewed our commitment to jobs and investment in Luxembourg ‚Äù said Sacau  ‚Äúand of course  to contributing to the health and growth of the asset management industry  which is one of the engines of growth of the country.‚ÄùDoes that mean more jobs for the grand duchy? ‚ÄúWe are growing ‚Äù replied Sacau. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôve been hiring in all our locations.‚ÄùWhat about the world of ESG data?Challenges around ESG  from unclear regulations to the lack of reliable and comparable data  was a topic during the Kneip Insight conference  held in December 2022. How can Kneip address this issue?‚ÄúThat data consistency and data quality that Kneip supports is particularly relevant in the world of ESG for a number of reasons ‚Äù said Sacau. ‚ÄúOne is that there is a bit of confusion. And the second one is that all our clients  we believe  are very keen on supporting a transition to a green economy through investment. And for that  we need to be with them  holding their hand  working in partnership. And for that  data quality is essential.‚Äù‚ÄúThis partnership with Clearstream Fund Centre is proof of the logic of the acquisition by Deutsche B√∂rse ‚Äù Sacau concluded. ‚ÄúAnd we are simply delivering on the promises we made to the market  one by one.‚ÄùThis article was published for the Paperjam+Delano Finance newsletter  the weekly source for financial news in Luxembourg.

The move is intended to enable cross-border investments and thus improve the liquidity of the domestic capital market.‚ÄúBy expanding its presence in the market and intensifying ties with Ukrainian market players and authorities  Clearstream‚Äôs goal is to support the Ukrainian capital market and the reconstruction of the country‚Äôs infrastructure and economy ‚Äù the company said in a statement. To this end  it will open an account with the National Bank of Ukraine to connect to the National Depository of Ukraine with the support of the Ukrainian Ministry of Finance.Clearstream has been active in the Ukrainian capital market for Ukrainian debt securities since 2019 and is the only global custodian offering access to the local market for government bonds denominated in Ukrainian currency. It will now expand its services to reconstruction-related instruments.‚ÄúAs a provider of trusted  transparent and efficient infrastructure  we operate our link to Ukraine with the aim of enabling further international investment opportunities ‚Äù stated Jan Willems  head of global markets at Clearstream. ‚ÄúThis decision emphasises our commitment to the Ukrainian market and our excellent local partners and  most importantly  our aim to actively support the reconstruction of the country.‚ÄùFacilitating the financing of Ukraine's reconstruction‚ÄúAlmost 4 years of successful NBU-Clearstream link operation have proven the investors‚Äô interest in the Ukrainian market ‚Äù Andriy Pyshnyy  governor of the National Bank of Ukraine  stated in the company‚Äôs announcement. ‚ÄúIn view of anticipated Ukraine‚Äôs recovery plans  NBU is happy to provide a reliable and ready-made solution aimed at further expansion of the link and opening access to post-war financial instruments to Clearstream‚Äôs customers. Development of cooperation with Clearstream will contribute to widening the range of investors and might become one of the driving forces in facilitating Ukraine‚Äôs infrastructure rebuilding.‚ÄùYuriy Butsa  government commissioner for public debt management in Ukraine  commented: ‚ÄúWe welcome the expansion of the Clearstream link to the new assets in Ukraine and thank our partners at Clearstream for making it happen at such a challenging time for our country. The initial opening of the link to Ukrainian market back in 2019 proved to be a game changer for our local government bond market and significantly contributed to its development. We believe that the simplified access to diverse Ukrainian investment products for international asset managers will not only help bringing foreign private capital to participate in the reconstruction of Ukraine  but also boost the development of Ukrainian capital market.‚ÄùRead this article in French on the Paperjam site.,neutral,0.44,0.56,0.0,positive,0.8,0.2,0.0,True,English,"['Clearstream', 'presence', 'Ukraine', 'Deutsche B√∂rse Group', 'diverse Ukrainian investment products', 'international central securities depository', 'successful NBU-Clearstream link operation', 'local government bond market', 'international investment opportunities', 'international asset managers', 'Ukrainian debt securities', 'public debt management', 'foreign private capital', 'domestic capital market', 'new asset classes', 'post-war financial instruments', 'Ukrainian capital market', 'Ukrainian market players', 'excellent local partners', 'local market', 'National Depository', 'Ukrainian Ministry', 'government bonds', 'Ukrainian currency', 'government commissioner', 'reconstruction-related instruments', 'new assets', 'cross-border investments', 'National Bank', 'global custodian', 'trusted, transparent', 'Jan Willems', 'global markets', 'Andriy Pyshnyy', 'recovery plans', 'ready-made solution', 'driving forces', 'Yuriy Butsa', 'challenging time', 'initial opening', 'game changer', 'Paperjam site', 'existing link', 'efficient infrastructure', 'infrastructure rebuilding', 'investors‚Äô interest', 'move', 'liquidity', 'presence', 'authorities', 'goal', 'country', 'economy', 'company', 'statement', 'end', 'account', 'Ukraine', 'support', 'Finance', 'access', 'services', 'provider', 'aim', 'head', 'decision', 'commitment', 'financing', '4 years', 'governor', 'announcement', 'view', 'reliable', 'expansion', 'customers', 'Development', 'cooperation', 'range', 'article', 'French']",2023-01-31,2023-01-31,delano.lu

Delano talked to Kneip CEO Enrique Sacau to find out what this means for Luxembourg.,The Deutsche B√∂rse Group  which counts Clearstream as its Luxembourg subsidiary  acquired fund data manager Kneip in March 2022. Kneip announced on 25 January that as Clearstream‚Äôs designated data provider  all fund information--including fund data and legal documents--are now supplied to Clearstream Fund Centre via Kneip. It will also simplify the collection of third-party data.‚ÄúSince Kneip was acquired by Deutsche B√∂rse Group  it was made to be part of the funds ecosystem ‚Äù Kneip CEO Enrique Sacau told Delano in an interview after the announcement. They have created a ‚Äútrue one-stop-shop‚Äù for funds that provides services to distributors and asset managers. ‚ÄúThere is the execution piece  there is the distribution piece--which is the fund centre in Zurich--and there is data  which is the Kneip part.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre doing is ensuring that the asset management community can effectively get the data to one of Europe‚Äôs largest fund platforms--Clearstream Fund Centre--with a view to distributing the products  selling the products ‚Äù continued Sacau. ‚ÄúAnd that is important that Kneip does it because of our reach and because we have a sort of unique selling point  which is that we are the data quality provider.‚ÄùData quality in Kneip‚Äôs DNACombining Kneip‚Äôs data management solution with Clearstream‚Äôs distribution capabilities will lead to better quality and increased availability of information for clients  said an announcement from the fund data manager.We‚Äôre not about anything but data quality. Enrique Sacau   CEO   Kneip‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not about anything but data quality ‚Äù Sacau highlighted. ‚ÄúWe are obsessed with making sure that what gets disseminated is right and consistent.‚Äù To ensure quality  Kneip performs ‚Äúpost publication controls‚Äù when data is disseminated.‚ÄúThat is something we‚Äôve always done in thirty years of history for two reasons ‚Äù he said. First of all  checking data is in Kneip‚Äôs DNA  Sacau explained. The company checked data publication with newspapers in the 1990s. But it‚Äôs also because ‚Äúwe have the technology for it ‚Äù said Sacau. ‚ÄúGiven the amount of data we handle  if you don‚Äôt have technology to support it  it becomes a spreadsheet nightmare.‚ÄùA year ago--in January 2022--Kneip acquired Dataglide  a technology company based in the United Kingdom that specialises in data transformation and cloud-based automation. The acquisition has given Kneip a ‚Äúcompetitive advantage that Clearstream Fund Centre has found difficult to resist ‚Äù said Sacau.So what does the move mean for Luxembourg in particular?Kneip has operations in Portugal and the UK  but the company is headquartered in Luxembourg and has its main area of work in the grand duchy  as is the case for Clearstream. ‚ÄúWe have thus renewed our commitment to jobs and investment in Luxembourg ‚Äù said Sacau  ‚Äúand of course  to contributing to the health and growth of the asset management industry  which is one of the engines of growth of the country.‚ÄùDoes that mean more jobs for the grand duchy? ‚ÄúWe are growing ‚Äù replied Sacau. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôve been hiring in all our locations.‚ÄùWhat about the world of ESG data?Challenges around ESG  from unclear regulations to the lack of reliable and comparable data  was a topic during the Kneip Insight conference  held in December 2022. How can Kneip address this issue?‚ÄúThat data consistency and data quality that Kneip supports is particularly relevant in the world of ESG for a number of reasons ‚Äù said Sacau. ‚ÄúOne is that there is a bit of confusion. And the second one is that all our clients  we believe  are very keen on supporting a transition to a green economy through investment. And for that  we need to be with them  holding their hand  working in partnership. And for that  data quality is essential.‚Äù‚ÄúThis partnership with Clearstream Fund Centre is proof of the logic of the acquisition by Deutsche B√∂rse ‚Äù Sacau concluded. ‚ÄúAnd we are simply delivering on the promises we made to the market  one by one.‚ÄùThis article was published for the Paperjam+Delano Finance newsletter  the weekly source for financial news in Luxembourg.

Third party survey finds employee satisfaction ratings among the Company's content moderators are above the benchmarked average for 600+ companies.93% of Teleperformance content moderators say they are supported.90% feel the company provides a safe working environment.85% would recommend Teleperformance as an employer.NEW YORK  Jan. 31  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Teleperformance  the global leader in outsourced customer and citizen experience management and related digital services  today announced the results of a third-party study conducted by a leading global organizational consulting firm which shows its Trust and Safety division exceeds the benchmarked average for other companies by double-digit margins on key aspects of the employee experience. The findings are part of a review conducted between December 2022 and January 2023.According to the survey results  Teleperformance employee experience performed high against a number of third-party benchmarks including:Training to support job performance (33 percentage points above benchmark).Fairness in performance evaluation (28 percentage points above benchmark).Supervisor performance coaching (23 percentage points above benchmark).Awareness of available career paths (22 percentage points above benchmark).Availability of information (20 percentage points above benchmark).Reasonableness of workloads (20 percentage points above benchmark).Resources needed to do jobs well (18 percentage points above benchmark).The survey was conducted by Korn Ferry  a leading global organizational consulting firm. The survey gathered multidimensional insights from nearly 60% of the Company's roughly 17 500 Trust and Safety division employees across the globe. Insights were gathered through an online survey  as well as virtual focus groups reaching employees globally and in-person focus groups in locations with a high concentration of content moderators  including Lisbon  Bogota and Athens.Story continuesContent moderators said they feel favorably regarding the Company's support (93%)  training (90%)  enablement (87%) and wellbeing (85%) initiatives  indicating that many content moderators are aware of and appreciate the measures that Teleperformance has in place to address their unique needs.Teleperformance Trust and Safety content moderators also responded favorably to factors that can contribute or compromise a sense of wellbeing. The vast majority (85% of employees or more) feel supported by their team members  feel their supervisor is accessible when needed  feel adequately prepared to deal with egregious content  know how to reach wellness coaches and feel they are available when needed  and are able to take a wellness break when needed. The survey results showed Trust and Safety employees speak very highly of the support they receive from their supervisors. Performance targets are not a source of stress for most Trust and Safety employees  with 86% saying their performance targets are realistic and achievable.While responses from the Teleperformance Trust and Safety staff rated above benchmarks on 94% of employee experience questions where the consulting firm had benchmarks available  the survey also identified some further improvement opportunities including greater employee recognition  expanding certain trainings to more content moderators  allowing content moderators to use wellness breaks as discretionary time  and faster more consistent company follow-through on reported issues. The review also revealed some differences in the employee experience by region and account.More detailed findings are available on the Teleperformance website by clicking here. To learn more about the importance of the work content moderators are doing to keep the public safe from exposure to harmful online content  download the white paper ""Humans at the Center of Effective Digital Defense"" written by MIT Technology Review Insights.Further Teleperformance also confirms that it is getting its employee and workplace practices in six countries with substantial Trust and Safety Operations audited by Bureau Veritas  a world leader in Testing  Inspection and Certification.

The findings are part of a review conducted between December 2022 and January 2023.According to the survey results  Teleperformance employee experience performed high against a number of third party benchmarks including:Training to support job performance (33 percentage points above benchmark).Fairness in performance evaluation (28 percentage points above benchmark).Supervisor performance coaching (23 percentage points above benchmark).Awareness of available career paths (22 percentage points above benchmark).Availability of information (20 percentage points above benchmark).Reasonableness of workloads (20 percentage points above benchmark).Resources needed to do jobs well (18 percentage points above benchmark).The survey was conducted by Korn Ferry  a leading global organizational consulting firm. The survey gathered multidimensional insights from nearly 60% of the Company‚Äôs roughly 17 500 Trust and Safety division employees across the globe. Insights were gathered through an online survey  as well as virtual focus groups reaching employees globally and in-person focus groups in locations with a high concentration of content moderators  including Lisbon  Bogota and Athens.Content moderators said they feel favorably regarding the Company‚Äôs support (93%)  training (90%)  enablement (87%) and wellbeing (85%) initiatives  indicating that many content moderators are aware of and appreciate the measures that Teleperformance has in place to address their unique needs.Teleperformance Trust and Safety content moderators also responded favorably to factors that can contribute or compromise a sense of wellbeing. The vast majority (85% of employees or more) feel supported by their team members  feel their supervisor is accessible when needed  feel adequately prepared to deal with egregious content  know how to reach wellness coaches and feel they are available when needed  and are able to take a wellness break when needed. The survey results showed Trust and Safety employees speak very highly of the support they receive from their supervisors. Performance targets are not a source of stress for most Trust and Safety employees  with 86% saying their performance targets are realistic and achievable.While responses from the Teleperformance Trust and Safety staff rated above benchmarks on 94% of employee experience questions where the consulting firm had benchmarks available  the survey also identified some further improvement opportunities including greater employee recognition  expanding certain trainings to more content moderators  allowing content moderators to use wellness breaks as discretionary time  and faster more consistent company follow-through on reported issues. The review also revealed some differences in the employee experience by region and account.More detailed findings are available on the Teleperformance website by clicking here.

17467,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4573972-dole-an-incredibly-accretive-move-to-sell-its-vegetable-division,Dole: An Incredibly Accretive Move To Sell Its Vegetable Division (NYSE:DOLE),I think selling its Vegetable division is an incredibly accretive move by Dole plc that offers DOLE stock a 45% upside potential. Click here for more on DOLE.,loops7/E+ via Getty ImagesBackgroundDole plc (NYSE:DOLE) is a vertically integrated fresh produce powerhouse. In both North America and Europe  Dole has market-leading positions in Banana  Pineapples  Packaged Salad  and Grapes  with annual sales of ~$9Bn a year.investor presentation (3Q22 )Dole was IPOed in 2021 after a series of complex capital market operations  including Total Produce merging with Dole (C&C as a 55% Dole equity owner)  Total Produce delisting from Euronext Growth  and the new entity relisting/IPO in NYSE. For those interested in one of the most complicated IPO in 2021  contributor Value Situation has an excellent analysis with great details.Subsequently  two of my trusted investor peers  Fishtown and Kingdom Capital  wrote 2 articles laying out their bull thesis that can be found here and here  respectively.These 3 articles provide comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis of Dole plc as a company. Obviously  there is no reason to reiterate the well-established bull thesis.So  why am I here? I'm here to discuss today's breaking news and how I think it impacts Dole plc's valuation in a quite dramatic fashion.What's New?The news comes out this morning that Dole is selling its U.S. fresh vegetable division to Fresh Express  a unit of Chiquita Holdings  for a total of $293 Million.Fresh Vegetable is one of 4 Dole business segments. This segment generated around ~$35Mil Ebitda a year pre-covid. During the covid peak (i.e.  from 3Q20 to 2Q21)  due to the surging customer demands  it reined in $45Mil Ebitda.At a first glance  the current sales price values the business at 6.5x normalized and 8x covid peak Ebitda  which is within the range of Dole's current valuation multiple. Thus  one might consider that a neutral move.However when I dig deeper  it shows a quite different and bullish story. Let us dive in.Quantitative AnalysisThe table below shows Dole plc's quarterly revenue and Ebitda breakdown by business segment since 2020.data from sec filings (compiled by author)You might notice that Dole's quarterly Ebitda has changed quite significantly and has been in a sharp decline in the last 4 quarters.Fresh Fruit's peak earnings during 1Q and 2Q 2021 certainly played an important role  while the other important factor is its Fresh Vegetable segment deteriorated from making ~$40Mn/year to losing ~$30M+/year due to its multiple salad recalls in 2022 over listeria contamination concerns.While one might argue (HOPE) this is a one-off setback  a further look shows there is some systemic weakness/risk in that segment  as this isn't the first time Dole has had to recall its packaged salad mix  e.g.  see one in 2017.Now  let us understand how this transaction impacts its valuation.Its sell price is $293Mn  and as mentioned in the release  the proceeds will go to debt reduction.Taking tax into consideration  I model a $250Mn debt reduction  and Dole can pay off its highest interest rate debts at SOFR + 2.75%. SOFR is currently at 4.3%  so that debt reduction will save ~$17.5Mn/year in interest payment.The Fresh vegetable segment incurred a total of $32M loss in the last 12 months.Assuming all other business remains the same  Dole plc's next 12M Ebitda would be $374M ($32M avoided loss + $17M interest saving). Even with today's 10% surge after the news  that values its current business at 5.8x Ev/Ebitda NTM.To maintain the same Ev/Ebitda multiple today (7x)  the stock need to rise to $17/share. You can find the calculation in the table below.3 scenario valuation (Dole)Shareholder-friendly ManagementAs the napkin math above shows  Dole plc's sales of the Fresh Vegetable segment is an incredibly accretive move  as it boosts earnings and shrinks debts at the same time. But more important than that  it shows the management team has an owner mentality (to be clear  Chairman McCain has 7.8% ownership of the company  so he is an owner)  and is willing to take principled and shareholder-friendly actions  with no interest in empire building.That  together with Total Produce's past track record  shall give investors comfort and confidence in Dole's path forward.Increased Institutional Ownership3 institutional players recognized Dole plc's value and took sizeable stakes by the summer 2022  as I mentioned here:Since then  Jan Barta has increased his stake to 5.9% (from 5.2% in Aug 2022)  and Dole had its 4th 5%+ shareholder - Pale Fire Capital - with a 7.8% stake by year-end 2022. Thus  we have 4 large institutional shareholders holding ~25% of total shares.Together with 12.6% ownership from Murdock Group (via C&C)  and 7.7% ownership from the McCann family (via Balkan Investment)  Dole gets a solid shareholder base holding over 45% total equity today.It is worth noting that neither Murdock nor McCann families have unloaded a share since the IPO  despite Murdock's initial intent for the IPO was to unload its equity stakes.Banana Prices in 2023Banana distributors/producers negotiate a base wholesale price with large grocery stores once a year  usually at the beginning of a year  with relatively minor price adjustments during the year.Dole management has been hinting that they feel pretty confident going into this year's price negotiation given the overall market conditions. We shall certainly observe how it goes  just to highlight one thing  for this low-margin huge-volume (~$2B/year) banana business  a 1% price bump brings $20Mn straight to profit  roughly a 6% bump  powerful leverage.SummaryIn closing  this Fresh Vegetable division sale is an incredibly accretive move for Dole plc and makes a compelling bull case.To maintain its below-peer current Ev/Ebitda multiple of 7x  the Dole plc stock price needs to rise to $17/share (assuming all else being equal)  a 45% upside.

The offer was subscribed  on the one hand  by professional investors for 2.5 million euros  and  on the other hand  by retail investors through the PrimaryBid platform for 0.6 million euros (the ‚ÄúTransaction‚Äù).Ignacio Faus  NFL Biosciences CEO: ‚ÄúOn behalf of NFL Biosciences  I would like to warmly thank all of the professional investors and the many retail investors  through PrimaryBid  who took part in this fundraising round. We have now secured the resources needed to reach the validation milestones of our two main clinical programs on NFL-101 in 2023  and we will also be able to move forward with the development of NFL-301. As always  we will take the greatest care to effectively allocate these resources and we are confident that we will be able to demonstrate the efficacy of NFL-101 in helping people stop smoking‚Äù.Allocation of the fundsSpecifically  the funds raised in connection with the Transaction will make it possible to supplement the financing for the CESTO II phase II/III trial  aiming to demonstrate the efficacy of its botanical drug candidate NFL-101 for smoking cessation  and the PRECESTO trial  assessing the potential of NFL-101 to be associated with nicotine replacement therapies  as well as the continued development of NFL-301  aimed at reducing alcohol consumption.CESTO II ‚Ä¢ The CESTO II trial is progressing in line with the schedule set  with 75% of the 318 smokers recruited at the nine clinical investigation centers that are taking part in the study. NFL Biosciences expects to finalize recruitments at the end of the second quarter  which would enable results to be obtained for the main criteria at the end of 2023. CESTO II‚Äôs objectives are to select the best dose and assess the efficacy of NFL-101 versus placebo. The primary end-point for assessment is the subjects‚Äô continued abstinence for four weeks (US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) accepted end-point). Many other secondary end-points will also be assessed  including the subjects‚Äô continued abstinence for six months (European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted end-point)  the number of cigarettes smoked  withdrawal symptoms and level of craving. About 55% of the funds raised will be allocated to finalizing this Phase II/III clinical trial.PRECESTO ‚Ä¢ This Phase IIa clinical trial aims primarily to validate the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation treatments and particularly nicotine replacement therapies (transdermal patches  tablets  chewing gums  inhalers and nicotine sprays) with a view to developing an innovative treatment method by associating NFL-101 with other smoking cessation methods. The PRECESTO trial will compare against a placebo the capacity of NFL-101 to reduce smoking satisfaction and cravings. This is a randomized  double-blind trial that will include 34 smokers who are not looking to stop smoking and get great satisfaction from smoking with a cross-over design. This trial is expected to further strengthen the appeal of NFL-101 for pharmaceutical companies that sell smoking cessation drugs and could be interested in taking out licenses. About 20% of the funds raised will be allocated to putting in place and carrying out this Phase IIa clinical trial. The PRECESTO trial results are expected for the third quarter of 2023.NFL-301 ‚Ä¢ This natural drug candidate to reduce alcohol consumption is subject to a co-development agreement with ATHENA Pharmaceutiques  set up in February 2022. Under this partnership  ATHENA Pharmaceutiques  a market leader for the development and manufacturing of oral delivery drugs  will manage the development and manufacturing of NFL-301  while NFL Biosciences will draw up and lead the clinical program  which could be launched in the United States over the coming months. By allocating about 15% of the funds raised to this project  NFL Biosciences will be able to continue developing NFL-301 and file a pre-IND application with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to a future clinical trial application. The partnership aims to develop NFL-301 at least until its placebo-controlled efficacy has been demonstrated as a treatment for reducing alcohol consumption. NFL Biosciences and ATHENA Pharmaceutiques will make a joint investment and will share future revenues based on their respective investments.The balance of the funds raised  approximately 10%  will be allocated to the day-to-day operations of the Company.Before carrying out this round of fundraising  NFL Biosciences‚Äô cash horizon was the end of the second quarter of 2023. Considering the current level of cash and the estimated proceeds from this round of fundraising  NFL Biosciences is pushing back its cash horizon to March 2024. In addition  two other applications for subsidies for a combined total of 1.7 million euros are currently being reviewed by Bpifrance  with an outcome expected in the first quarter of 2023  thus extending the cash horizon even further. NFL Biosciences will also continue to apply for non-dilutive financing solutions with French and European institutions.Reminder of the Transaction‚Äôs key featuresThe Transaction was put in place and carried out under the 10th  12th and 13th resolutions from the Company‚Äôs Extraordinary General Shareholders‚Äô Meeting on May 25  2022 (the ‚ÄúGeneral Meeting‚Äù) at a price of 2 23 euros per share  representing a discount of 24.87% compared to the volume-weighted average price of NFL Biosciences shares over the last 5 trading sessions (i.e. from Monday  January 23 to Friday  January 27  2023) equal to 2.9680 euros and 29.21% compared to the closing price of NFL Biosciences shares on Monday  January 30  2023 which is 3.15 euros.The Transaction  for a total of 3 059 910.11 euros  including the issue premium  was carried out by issuing  with preferential subscription rights waived  1 372 157 new ordinary shares  representing 26.2% of the Company‚Äôs share capital prior to the Transaction  with:(i) 1 097 726 new shares issued for a total of 2 447 928.98 euros (including the issue premium)  representing 80% of the Transaction  for professional investors under the 10th and 12th resolutions from the General Meeting (the ‚ÄúReserved Offer‚Äù)  and(ii) 274 431 new shares issued for a total of 611 981.13 euros (including the issue premium)  representing 20% of the Transaction  for retail investors that subscribed through the PrimaryBid platform (the ‚ÄúPrimaryBid Offer‚Äù).The settlement-delivery of these new shares and their admission to Euronext Growth Paris under ISIN FR0014003XT0 will take place on February 2nd  2023.The newly issued shares will be assimilated with the existing shares and will accrue dividends immediately.It is reminded that in connection with the Transaction  NFL Biosciences has made a commitment  on the one hand  to not carry out any capital increase based on new shares for a period of 6 months from the completion of the Transaction without prior approval from Invest Securities and  on the other hand  to not issue any bonds that could be exchanged for or converted into new shares  whether or not these are combined with stock warrants  until December 31  2023.Following the Transaction  the Company‚Äôs share capital will represent 198 203 euros  split into 6 606 769 ordinary shares with a par value of 0.03 euros  all of the same category.The breakdown of the Company‚Äôs shareholding structure before the Trasaction was as follows:On a non-diluted basis On a diluted basis In quantity of shares In % of ownership In quantity of shares In % of ownership Jo√´l BESSE 1 111 253 21.2% 1 361 253 17.9% Bruno LAFONT 325 279 6.2% 1 075 279 14.1% G√©rard LEDUC 76 550 1.5% 1 076 550 14.1% Family MEREAU 544 588 10.4% 669 588 8.8% Eric MOREL D'ARLEUX 372 803 7.1% 372 803 4.9% Family NICOLAS 275 320 5.3% 275 320 3.6% Other private investors 775 246 14.8% 1 036 976 13.6% Public 1 753 573 33.5% 1 753 573 23.0% Total 5 234 612 100.0% 7 621 342 100.0%The breakdown of the Company‚Äôs shareholding structure following the Transaction is as follows:On a non-diluted basis On a diluted basis In quantity of shares In % of ownership In quantity of shares In % of ownership Jo√´l BESSE 1 111 253 16.8% 1 361 253 15.1% Bruno LAFONT 325 279 325 279 4.9% 1 075 279 G√©rard LEDUC 76 550 76 550 1.2% 1 076 550 Family MEREAU 544 588 544 588 8.2% 669 588 Eric MOREL D'ARLEUX 372 803 372 803 5.6% 372 803 Family NICOLAS 275 320 275 320 4.2% 275 320 Other private investors 775 246 775 246 11.7% 1 036 976 Public 3 125 730 47.3% 3 125 730 34.8% Total 6 606 769 100.0% 8 993 499 100.0%It is specified that subscriptions  for a cumulative amount of ‚Ç¨2.2 million  were subject to a remuneration of 5% of the amount subscribed.Transation partnersInvestment services provider and bookrunner ConsultingLegal advisory Financial communicationDisclaimerPursuant to the provisions of Article 1(4) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017  the Transaction did not give rise to the publication of a Prospectus subject to approval by the Autorit√© des March√©s Financiers (AMF).This press release does not constitute a prospectus within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017  as amended  or a public offering.In certain countries  the distribution of this press release may be subject to specific regulations.

These trends continue to reflect the wait-and-see approach observed for clients and prospects facing a deteriorating economic environment.AMA generated these 2022 revenues with more than 490 clients (as many as in 2021)  primarily major groups in diverse sectors  including Merck  Alstom  Air Liquide  Boehringer and KPMG.AMA has continued to work with its main large clients and welcomed 115 new accounts on board in 2022. 87% of the 15 largest clients in 2020 and 2021 (representing more than 50% of bookings) renewed their contracts or placed new orders in 2022. Nevertheless  AMA recorded a reduction in the average basket for its clients  which face an uncertain economic environment leading them to defer or scale back their investments in the short term  and to renew their connected equipment less frequently.Story continuesThe level of orders signed during the second half of the year was down 9% from the second half of the previous year  and therefore lower than expected  although the fourth quarter of 2022 recorded an 11% increase compared with the third quarter of 2022.Recognized and increasingly innovative technologyAMA has continued to innovate  launching versions of its assisted reality solution XpertEye each quarter with a range of new features. In 2022  the most significant developments included the ‚ÄúOn & Live‚Äù feature  making it possible to launch a connection in one click  the possibility to record calls and conferences  the higher quality video  the possibility to combine up to four different video streams and the strengthening of bandwidth management  a key area of expertise for AMA. A number of connected devices were also added  along with new languages (Arabic  Indian  Thai)  with a total of 20 languages available.AMA won the Enedis Innov‚Äô2022 award. The XpertEye solution was selected by ENEDIS  France‚Äôs leading manager of the public electricity distribution network  from among 200 innovation projects  to make day-to-day life easier for its after-sales service operators  with an environmental  technological and social focus. The XpertEye solution makes it possible to accelerate installation times for electricity meters  reducing the trips to be made by installers and increasing client satisfaction.XpertEye also continues to be widely adopted in the medical  emergency and relief sectors. It is currently used by more than 40 departmental fire and emergency services to adapt emergency facilities and improve interventions and care for victims.Continued business development and cost optimization strategyOperating in a more demanding market  AMA is adapting its strategy with agility to open up new sources of growth by:further strengthening its key partnerships with firms such as Orange Business Services  which are contributing increasingly effectively to the distribution and use of XpertEye solutions;rolling out a new Enterprise model commercial offer to ramp up use in major groups and therefore increase sales volumes. A 15-day free trial offer was also launched for XpertEye Lite at the start of the year to help make professionals and businesses more aware of the effectiveness of its solution;supporting its clients with their digital and environmental transition through targeted actions and data  including an assessment of the CO 2 emissions saved by using XpertEye solutions  thanks in particular to reduced levels of travel.Alongside this  AMA has reduced its costs and cash consumption by around ‚Ç¨400K per month compared with the monthly average from the first half of 2022 with a view to having a financial structure that is better adapted to the current situation on its market.Next financial press release2022 full-year results: April 28  2023 (before start of trading).Disclaimer: This press release contains certain non-factual elements  including but not restricted to certain statements concerning its future results and other future events.

This new concession covers the entire inventory of about 150 Bus Shelters and 150 City Information Panels (CIPs).The Group has worked in partnership with Macau for many years  beginning in 2001 as the first company to win an exclusive advertising contract to install and maintain street furniture.

This new concession covers the entire inventory of about 150 Bus Shelters and 150 City Information Panels (CIPs).The Group has worked in partnership with Macau for many years  beginning in 2001 as the first company to win an exclusive advertising contract to install and maintain street furniture. Going forward  JCDecaux Macau will gradually deploy the new furniture throughout the territory  now extending to Taipa  Cotai and Coloane.The new Bus Shelters will include a broad range of services:43‚Äô‚Äô LCD digital screens to broadcast real-time bus arrival and bus route information  to optimise the use of the public transport system;LED screens designed for the display of contextual information (time  temperature  humidity  etc.);planned accessibility with additional entry points at long bus shelters for people with reduced mobility;braille and tactile signs to enable visually impaired passengers to access bus information;USB charging ports for passengers‚Äô mobile devices.In a world first  all the CIPs will be double sided advertising and digital (one 75‚Äù side and one 43‚Äù side) and some will even be equipped with an interactive 32‚Äù screen designed for improved access to people with reduced mobility.This unprecedented digital network offers an outstanding platform to reach audiences in real-time with full-motion digital content  providing a powerful channel for municipal city communication and for commercial advertising.This digital platform will also integrate a unique emergency alert system (EMAs) to facilitate the priority dissemination of safety alerts  to strengthen the range of public safety alert tools to support disaster information (typhoons  flooding  etc.).As part of the Group‚Äôs commitment to improving the energy performance of its furniture  outlined in its ESG strategic roadmap  JCDecaux is developing ‚Äúsmart lighting‚Äù solutions such as dynamic dimming and movement sensors that detect people. In addition  digital screen brightness and ventilation are controlled by sensors that optimise and reduce power consumption depending on the environmental conditions. JCDecaux is also pursuing an ambitious renewable energy purchasing policy and covers 100% of electricity consumption since the end of 2022 at Group level.Jean-Charles Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-CEO of JCDecaux  said: ‚ÄúWe are proud to continue our long-standing partnership with the Macau Special Administrative Region Government and to contribute to the city‚Äôs transformation benefiting its people and visitors. 20 years after installing the first Bus shelters and City Information Panels in Macau  JCDecaux‚Äôs teams will focus on the provision of smart services to deliver a powerful and digitised communication platform  providing relevant local information and advertising campaigns. This new contract underlines our dual ambition: to build the future of sustainable urban living and to create the future for effective and efficient advertising.With these objectives in mind  we are

Each tranche is accompanied by the issue of warrants  the number of which is calculated in relation to a reference price of 14 euros according to the following formula : Number of warrants = Amount of the tranche / (14 x m) with m = 3.7 for tranche 2. AB Science has already announced the drawdown of the first tranche for EUR 6.0 million.The second tranche  also of EUR 6.0 million  has a maturity of five years and is therefore repayable in January 2028. It carries a capitalized annual interest rate of 7.0% and the issuance of 115 830 warrants  each giving the right to subscribe to one ordinary share of AB Science at 14.0 euros for 15 years. These warrants represent 0.22% of the current capital of the Company (if they were to be exercised in their entirety).The EIB also has a put option at intrinsic value (i.e. the difference between the stock market price and the exercise price) allowing it to require the Company to repurchase all or part of the warrants then exercisable but not yet exercised  under certain circumstances (for example in the event of a change of control or at the reimbursement date of the first tranche). In addition  the Company has a right of first refusal to redeem any warrants offered for sale to a third party  subject to certain exceptions.On the basis of 115 830 new shares of the Company that could be issued upon exercise of all of these warrants  the Company could potentially receive gross proceeds amounting to 1 621 620 euros. There is no guarantee that the EIB will exercise all or part of the warrants or that the Company will receive any proceeds from the exercise of these warrants.[1]: Press release of November 30  2020 and December 22  2022About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

His team won the Swedish championship a few months later  when he also received his first U21 international cap. He was then loaned to Mj√§llby  where he scored eight goals in 19 matches before being transferred in January 2022 to Heerenveen  in the Netherlands.A versatile centre-forward measuring 1m88  known for both his physical and technical prowess  Amin scored the first of his 11 goals for Heerenveen on 18 March 2022 against Almelo.

Third party survey finds employee satisfaction ratings among the Company's content moderators are a,"Teleperformance Trust & Safety moderators worldwide overwhelmingly say they feel safe and supported. Third party survey finds employee satisfaction ratings among the Company's content moderators are above the benchmarked average for 600+ companies.93% of Teleperformance content moderators say they are supported.90% feel the company provides a safe working environment.85% would recommend Teleperformance as an employer.Regulatory News:Teleperformance TEP  the global leader in outsourced customer and citizen experience management and related digital services  today announced the results of a third-party study conducted by a leading global organizational consulting firm which shows its Trust and Safety division exceeds the benchmarked average for other companies by double-digit margins on key aspects of the employee experience. The findings are part of a review conducted between December 2022 and January 2023.According to the survey results  Teleperformance employee experience performed high against a number of third party benchmarks including:Training to support job performance (33 percentage points above benchmark).Fairness in performance evaluation (28 percentage points above benchmark).Supervisor performance coaching (23 percentage points above benchmark).Awareness of available career paths (22 percentage points above benchmark).Availability of information (20 percentage points above benchmark).Reasonableness of workloads (20 percentage points above benchmark).Resources needed to do jobs well (18 percentage points above benchmark).The survey was conducted by Korn Ferry  a leading global organizational consulting firm. The survey gathered multidimensional insights from nearly 60% of the Company's roughly 17 500 Trust and Safety division employees across the globe. Insights were gathered through an online survey  as well as virtual focus groups reaching employees globally and in-person focus groups in locations with a high concentration of content moderators  including Lisbon  Bogota and Athens.Content moderators said they feel favorably regarding the Company's support (93%)  training (90%)  enablement (87%) and wellbeing (85%) initiatives  indicating that many content moderators are aware of and appreciate the measures that Teleperformance has in place to address their unique needs.Teleperformance Trust and Safety content moderators also responded favorably to factors that can contribute or compromise a sense of wellbeing. The vast majority (85% of employees or more) feel supported by their team members  feel their supervisor is accessible when needed  feel adequately prepared to deal with egregious content  know how to reach wellness coaches and feel they are available when needed  and are able to take a wellness break when needed. The survey results showed Trust and Safety employees speak very highly of the support they receive from their supervisors. Performance targets are not a source of stress for most Trust and Safety employees  with 86% saying their performance targets are realistic and achievable.While responses from the Teleperformance Trust and Safety staff rated above benchmarks on 94% of employee experience questions where the consulting firm had benchmarks available  the survey also identified some further improvement opportunities including greater employee recognition  expanding certain trainings to more content moderators  allowing content moderators to use wellness breaks as discretionary time  and faster more consistent company follow-through on reported issues. The review also revealed some differences in the employee experience by region and account.More detailed findings are available on the Teleperformance website by clicking here.

17508,EuroNext,Bing API,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4573634-carmila-the-7-9-percent-yield-should-be-safe,Carmila: The 7.9% Yield Should Be Safe (OTCMKTS:CRMIF),Carmila is a French REIT which owns the non-grocery store real estate assets within the building. Read more here.,"Marina113/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionCarmila (OTCPK:CRMIF) was created by Carrefour to create more shareholder value by optimizing its own real estate assets. Whereas Carrefour used to own the entire floor space of their large shopping malls  upper-level management made the decision to split these malls in two parts. One part would be the Carrefour owned and operated ""anchor store "" but the non-Carrefour space (which is usually taken up by smaller tenants which aren't competitors) was spun out into Carmila. Carrefour (OTCPK:CRERF) (OTCPK:CRRFY) still is the largest shareholder with a 36% stake in Carmila.Carmila Investor RelationsCarmila's primary listing is in France where it is trading on Euronext Paris with CARM as its ticker symbol. The average daily volume in Paris is 57 000 shares  which clearly makes it the best option to trade in the REIT's shares. There are about 144M shares outstanding  resulting in a market capitalization of approximately 2B EUR.Yahoo FinanceA closer look at the financial performance and interest rate sensitivityFrench companies rarely provide a detailed overview on a quarterly basis  and generally only publish financial statements every six months. Carmila is no exception and the Q3 update was a bit light on details. Nonetheless  it does appear to confirm my previous thesis the REIT remains on track for a very strong 2022 and has reaffirmed its guidance for a 20% recurring earnings growth for this year. Considering Carmila generated 1.24 EUR per share in recurring earnings in 2021  it's basically implying this year's result will come in pretty close to or perhaps even exceed 1.50 EUR per share. The recurring earnings in the first half of the year came in at 0.83 EUR  but I expect the second semester to be weaker.That's one year ahead of schedule as I had only expected to see the 1.5 EUR milestone in 2023. While we may come in a little bit below that the 1.5 EUR seems to be a ""given"" considering most inflation-related rent increases will happen in H1 2023. So unless a wave of bankruptcies rolls over the tenant base of Carmila  the near-term outlook for 2022 and 2023 is looking bright. This also means we can look forward to seeing a dividend hike of approximately 10%. Based on an anticipated recurring EPS of 1.47 EUR per share  the dividend will likely come in at around 1.1 EUR based on the dividend policy which includes a payout ratio of 75%.This represents a yield of 7.9% based on the current share price of 13.62 EUR per share and given this (fully-covered) yield and the fact that Carmila appears to be trading at just over 9 times this year's earnings and likely just over 8 times next year's recurring earnings  Carmila is still cheap enough to be picked up in a portfolio.Sensitivity analysesI wanted to work on some sensitivity analyses to see how the book value and the LTV ratio of REITs would come under pressure when the capitalization rates of the properties are increased. Fortunately this has been a pet peeve of mine for years and most REITs in the portfolios are in safe territory (as mentioned before  it's mainly DIC that is in the danger zone so I will be looking forward to seeing how the situation is evolving there).In Carmila's case  we know the net rental income in the first nine months of the year was just under 254M EUR  indicating a Q3 NRI of approximately 83M EUR. That's a bit lower than I had anticipated although Carmila obviously also sold some assets while the net rental income also includes real estate expenses and I expect the heating and power bills to increase). So rather than annualizing the 254M EUR  I will annualize the Q3 NRI to 332M EUR per year. Applying a portfolio-wide 5% rent hike should result in a 348M EUR NRI in 2023. The table below shows the fair value of the assets  the NAV and NAV/share using four different capitalization rates. The other parameters used below are a net financial debt of 2.27B EUR (the official net debt position as of the end of June) and a current share count of 144M shares (it should be a little bit lower but I'm erring on the side of being cautious here).Author TableAccording to my calculations  even applying a required 7.5% net rental yield would still result in a book value about 15% above the current share price while the LTV ratio remains below 50%. Meanwhile  hoarding 25% of the recurring earnings means Carmila would retain approximately 50-55M EUR per year in cash  which would further reduce the LTV ratio by 110-120 base points in the 7.5% scenario. This means that the YE 2023 LTV ratio should still come in below 48%.A second sensitivity analysis I wanted to work on is how the REIT would be impacted by higher interest rates. And there's a silver lining here. As Carmila's average cost of debt is currently approximately 2.3%  its average cost of debt should increase at a much lower rate than most of its competitors of which many have a sub-2% interest rate.The next two maturities are a 2.375% bond in both 2023 and 2024  and after that  Carmila is pretty much in the clear until 2027 when a 1.625% bond matures. A portion of the 2023 bond was already called early. Looking at the bond market  Carmila's six year bonds currently have a YTM of approximately 6.4%. Side note: Given the sensitivity analysis above  I think the Carmila debt is a strong buy here. Unfortunately the minimum size of these bonds is 100 000 EUR and that's the sole reason why I haven't dipped my toe in the bond-water yet.Carmila Investor RelationsIf the bond market remains this unreasonable  I do expect Carmila to increase its ratio of credit facilities and bank loans as that should for sure be cheaper. In the scenarios below  I will show how the recurring earnings will be impacted by an increase in interest rates across the board. Note: this is a very conservative scenario assuming all debt becomes more expensive overnight while only half of the debt is up for refinancing before 2027. So Carmila has the time working in its favor.Carmila Investor RelationsThe table above also does not take two important elements into consideration: It does not account for asset sales or cash hoarding: Should Carmila hoard the 50-55M EUR in non-distributed cash flow per year  it would hoard in excess of 400M EUR by the end of 2030 which would save the REIT about 25M EUR per year at a 6% cost of debt) Secondly  it does not take the rent hikes into consideration. If Carmila is able to hike the rent at a rate of 3% per year from 2024 on  it would add 80M EUR in additional annual net rental income by the end of this decade  which is when the last tranche of low-cost debt will be refinanced.Investment thesisThis means that if Carmila doesn't develop its pipeline and if it's able to increase the rent throughout the next decade the impact of a 400 bp increase of the average cost of debt (implying a 6.3% interest rate on all of its outstanding debt) would be completely covered. Food for thought  and the main risk if obviously keeping the occupancy high and retain the tenants.I have a long position in Carmila as I like the relationship with Carrefour and the strong footfall by owning the retail space related to a grocery-anchored superstore. As Carmila's debt repayment schedule is well spread out  I think the gradual rent hikes will be able to compensate for the increasing interest rates and the recurring earnings should continue to hover around the 1.50-1.60 EUR mark. The dividend yield of almost 8% is comfortably covered  making Carmila an interesting income-pick with exposure to European commercial real estate.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Each tranche is accompanied by the issue of warrants  the number of which is calculated in relation to a reference price of 14 euros according to the following formula : Number of warrants = Amount of the tranche / (14 x m) with m = 3.7 for tranche 2. AB Science has already announced the drawdown of the first tranche for EUR 6.0 million.The second tranche  also of EUR 6.0 million  has a maturity of five years and is therefore repayable in January 2028. It carries a capitalized annual interest rate of 7.0% and the issuance of 115 830 warrants  each giving the right to subscribe to one ordinary share of AB Science at 14.0 euros for 15 years. These warrants represent 0.22% of the current capital of the Company (if they were to be exercised in their entirety).The EIB also has a put option at intrinsic value (i.e. the difference between the stock market price and the exercise price) allowing it to require the Company to repurchase all or part of the warrants then exercisable but not yet exercised  under certain circumstances (for example in the event of a change of control or at the reimbursement date of the first tranche). In addition  the Company has a right of first refusal to redeem any warrants offered for sale to a third party  subject to certain exceptions.On the basis of 115 830 new shares of the Company that could be issued upon exercise of all of these warrants  the Company could potentially receive gross proceeds amounting to 1 621 620 euros. There is no guarantee that the EIB will exercise all or part of the warrants or that the Company will receive any proceeds from the exercise of these warrants.Story continues[1]: Press release of November 30  2020 and December 22  2022About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.
