Authorising the Board of Directors to decide on the issuance of sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the AGM authorise the Board of Directors to decide on the issuance of Stora Enso R shares as follows:The amount of R shares to be issued based on this authorisation shall not exceed a total of 2 000 000 R shares  corresponding to approximately 0.25% of all shares and 0.33% of all R shares in the Company. The authorisation covers both the issuance of new R shares as well as the transfer of own R shares held by the Company.The issuance of R shares may be carried out in deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights for the purpose of using the R shares as part of the Company's incentive and remuneration scheme.The Board of Directors shall decide on other terms and conditions of a share issue. The authorisation is effective until the beginning of the next AGM  however  no longer than until 31 July 2024 and it revokes the authorisation given by the AGM on 15 March 2022.18. Amendment of the Articles of AssociationThe Board of Directors proposes that the AGM would decide to amend the Company's Articles of Association to enable arranging a General Meeting of Shareholders as a virtual meeting without a meeting venue as an alternative for a physical meeting or a hybrid meeting. The amendment is intended to facilitate the holding of General Meetings of Shareholders virtually among others in situations like pandemics or other unforeseen or exceptional circumstances  however not limited to these situations. The Finnish Companies Act requires that shareholders can exercise their full rights in virtual meetings  with equal rights to those in customary in-person General Meetings of Shareholders. The amendments do not preclude arranging General Meetings of Shareholders as in-person or hybrid meetings.Pursuant to the proposal of the Board of Directors  9 ¬ß of the Company's Articles of Association would be amended to read as follows:""9 ¬ß Shareholders participating in a General Meeting of Shareholders or their legally qualified representatives or their legally qualified proxies shall have the right to exercise their power to decide on matters pertaining to the Company.A shareholder wishing to attend a General Meeting of Shareholders shall notify the Company by the date mentioned in the notice to the meeting  which may not be more than ten (10) days before the meeting.Since the shares of the Company are incorporated in the book-entry system  the provisions of the Finnish Companies Act regarding the right to participate in a General Meeting of Shareholders must also be taken into account.The Board of Directors may decide that the General Meeting of Shareholders is arranged without a meeting venue in a manner where shareholders exercise their full decision-making powers in real time during the General Meeting of Shareholders using telecommunications and technical means (virtual meeting).""19.

Amendment of the Articles of AssociationThe Board of Directors proposes that the AGM would decide to amend the Company's Articles of Association to enable arranging a General Meeting of Shareholders as a virtual meeting without a meeting venue as an alternative for a physical meeting or a hybrid meeting.

The Finnish Companies Act requires that shareholders can exercise their full rights in virtual meetings  with equal rights to those in customary in-person General Meetings of Shareholders. The amendments do not preclude arranging General Meetings of Shareholders as in-person or hybrid meetings.Pursuant to the proposal of the Board of Directors  9 ¬ß of the Company's Articles of Association would be amended to read as follows:""9 ¬ß Shareholders participating in a General Meeting of Shareholders or their legally qualified representatives or their legally qualified proxies shall have the right to exercise their power to decide on matters pertaining to the Company.A shareholder wishing to attend a General Meeting of Shareholders shall notify the Company by the date mentioned in the notice to the meeting  which may not be more than ten (10) days before the meeting.Since the shares of the Company are incorporated in the book-entry system  the provisions of the Finnish Companies Act regarding the right to participate in a General Meeting of Shareholders must also be taken into account.The Board of Directors may decide that the General Meeting of Shareholders is arranged without a meeting venue in a manner where shareholders exercise their full decision-making powers in real time during the General Meeting of Shareholders using telecommunications and technical means (virtual meeting).""19.

Third party survey finds employee satisfaction ratings among the Company's content moderators are above the benchmarked average for 600+ companies.93% of Teleperformance content moderators say they are supported.90% feel the company provides a safe working environment.85% would recommend Teleperformance as an employer.NEW YORK  Jan. 31  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Teleperformance  the global leader in outsourced customer and citizen experience management and related digital services  today announced the results of a third-party study conducted by a leading global organizational consulting firm which shows its Trust and Safety division exceeds the benchmarked average for other companies by double-digit margins on key aspects of the employee experience. The findings are part of a review conducted between December 2022 and January 2023.According to the survey results  Teleperformance employee experience performed high against a number of third-party benchmarks including:Training to support job performance (33 percentage points above benchmark).Fairness in performance evaluation (28 percentage points above benchmark).Supervisor performance coaching (23 percentage points above benchmark).Awareness of available career paths (22 percentage points above benchmark).Availability of information (20 percentage points above benchmark).Reasonableness of workloads (20 percentage points above benchmark).Resources needed to do jobs well (18 percentage points above benchmark).The survey was conducted by Korn Ferry  a leading global organizational consulting firm. The survey gathered multidimensional insights from nearly 60% of the Company's roughly 17 500 Trust and Safety division employees across the globe. Insights were gathered through an online survey  as well as virtual focus groups reaching employees globally and in-person focus groups in locations with a high concentration of content moderators  including Lisbon  Bogota and Athens.Story continuesContent moderators said they feel favorably regarding the Company's support (93%)  training (90%)  enablement (87%) and wellbeing (85%) initiatives  indicating that many content moderators are aware of and appreciate the measures that Teleperformance has in place to address their unique needs.Teleperformance Trust and Safety content moderators also responded favorably to factors that can contribute or compromise a sense of wellbeing. The vast majority (85% of employees or more) feel supported by their team members  feel their supervisor is accessible when needed  feel adequately prepared to deal with egregious content  know how to reach wellness coaches and feel they are available when needed  and are able to take a wellness break when needed. The survey results showed Trust and Safety employees speak very highly of the support they receive from their supervisors. Performance targets are not a source of stress for most Trust and Safety employees  with 86% saying their performance targets are realistic and achievable.While responses from the Teleperformance Trust and Safety staff rated above benchmarks on 94% of employee experience questions where the consulting firm had benchmarks available  the survey also identified some further improvement opportunities including greater employee recognition  expanding certain trainings to more content moderators  allowing content moderators to use wellness breaks as discretionary time  and faster more consistent company follow-through on reported issues. The review also revealed some differences in the employee experience by region and account.More detailed findings are available on the Teleperformance website by clicking here.

The findings are part of a review conducted between December 2022 and January 2023.According to the survey results  Teleperformance employee experience performed high against a number of third party benchmarks including:Training to support job performance (33 percentage points above benchmark).Fairness in performance evaluation (28 percentage points above benchmark).Supervisor performance coaching (23 percentage points above benchmark).Awareness of available career paths (22 percentage points above benchmark).Availability of information (20 percentage points above benchmark).Reasonableness of workloads (20 percentage points above benchmark).Resources needed to do jobs well (18 percentage points above benchmark).The survey was conducted by Korn Ferry  a leading global organizational consulting firm. The survey gathered multidimensional insights from nearly 60% of the Company‚Äôs roughly 17 500 Trust and Safety division employees across the globe. Insights were gathered through an online survey  as well as virtual focus groups reaching employees globally and in-person focus groups in locations with a high concentration of content moderators  including Lisbon  Bogota and Athens.Content moderators said they feel favorably regarding the Company‚Äôs support (93%)  training (90%)  enablement (87%) and wellbeing (85%) initiatives  indicating that many content moderators are aware of and appreciate the measures that Teleperformance has in place to address their unique needs.Teleperformance Trust and Safety content moderators also responded favorably to factors that can contribute or compromise a sense of wellbeing. The vast majority (85% of employees or more) feel supported by their team members  feel their supervisor is accessible when needed  feel adequately prepared to deal with egregious content  know how to reach wellness coaches and feel they are available when needed  and are able to take a wellness break when needed. The survey results showed Trust and Safety employees speak very highly of the support they receive from their supervisors. Performance targets are not a source of stress for most Trust and Safety employees  with 86% saying their performance targets are realistic and achievable.While responses from the Teleperformance Trust and Safety staff rated above benchmarks on 94% of employee experience questions where the consulting firm had benchmarks available  the survey also identified some further improvement opportunities including greater employee recognition  expanding certain trainings to more content moderators  allowing content moderators to use wellness breaks as discretionary time  and faster more consistent company follow-through on reported issues. The review also revealed some differences in the employee experience by region and account.More detailed findings are available on the Teleperformance website by clicking here.

17467,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4573972-dole-an-incredibly-accretive-move-to-sell-its-vegetable-division,Dole: An Incredibly Accretive Move To Sell Its Vegetable Division (NYSE:DOLE),I think selling its Vegetable division is an incredibly accretive move by Dole plc that offers DOLE stock a 45% upside potential. Click here for more on DOLE.,loops7/E+ via Getty ImagesBackgroundDole plc (NYSE:DOLE) is a vertically integrated fresh produce powerhouse. In both North America and Europe  Dole has market-leading positions in Banana  Pineapples  Packaged Salad  and Grapes  with annual sales of ~$9Bn a year.investor presentation (3Q22 )Dole was IPOed in 2021 after a series of complex capital market operations  including Total Produce merging with Dole (C&C as a 55% Dole equity owner)  Total Produce delisting from Euronext Growth  and the new entity relisting/IPO in NYSE. For those interested in one of the most complicated IPO in 2021  contributor Value Situation has an excellent analysis with great details.Subsequently  two of my trusted investor peers  Fishtown and Kingdom Capital  wrote 2 articles laying out their bull thesis that can be found here and here  respectively.These 3 articles provide comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis of Dole plc as a company. Obviously  there is no reason to reiterate the well-established bull thesis.So  why am I here? I'm here to discuss today's breaking news and how I think it impacts Dole plc's valuation in a quite dramatic fashion.What's New?The news comes out this morning that Dole is selling its U.S. fresh vegetable division to Fresh Express  a unit of Chiquita Holdings  for a total of $293 Million.Fresh Vegetable is one of 4 Dole business segments. This segment generated around ~$35Mil Ebitda a year pre-covid. During the covid peak (i.e.  from 3Q20 to 2Q21)  due to the surging customer demands  it reined in $45Mil Ebitda.At a first glance  the current sales price values the business at 6.5x normalized and 8x covid peak Ebitda  which is within the range of Dole's current valuation multiple. Thus  one might consider that a neutral move.However  when I dig deeper  it shows a quite different and bullish story. Let us dive in.Quantitative AnalysisThe table below shows Dole plc's quarterly revenue and Ebitda breakdown by business segment since 2020.data from sec filings (compiled by author)You might notice that Dole's quarterly Ebitda has changed quite significantly and has been in a sharp decline in the last 4 quarters.Fresh Fruit's peak earnings during 1Q and 2Q 2021 certainly played an important role  while the other important factor is its Fresh Vegetable segment deteriorated from making ~$40Mn/year to losing ~$30M+/year due to its multiple salad recalls in 2022 over listeria contamination concerns.While one might argue ((hope)) this is a one-off setback  a further look shows there is some systemic weakness/risk in that segment  as this isn't the first time Dole has had to recall its packaged salad mix  e.g.  see one in 2017.Now  let us understand how this transaction impacts its valuation.Its sell price is $293Mn  and as mentioned in the release  the proceeds will go to debt reduction.Taking tax into consideration  I model a $250Mn (one might say that is overly conservative) debt reduction  and Dole can pay off its highest interest rate debts at SOFR + 2.75%. SOFR is currently at 4.3%  so that debt reduction will save ~$17.5Mn/year in interest payment.The Fresh vegetable segment incurred a total of $32M loss in the last 12 months.Assuming all other business remains the same  Dole plc's next 12M Ebitda would be $357M ($32M avoided loss). Even with today's 10% surge after the news  that values its current business at 5.8x Ev/Ebitda NTM.To maintain the same Ev/Ebitda multiple today (6.8x)  the stock needs to rise to $15.6/share. You can find the calculation in the table below.* Note: $1.2Bn current net debt is based on $1.1B net debt published in the company's 3Q22 investor presentation. I added $100Mn to the net debt as an adjustment considering its $750Mn inventory and receivable on the balance sheet.data from sec filings (compiled by the author)shareholder-friendly ManagementAs the napkin math above shows  Dole plc's sales of the Fresh Vegetable segment is an incredibly accretive move  as it boosts earnings and shrinks debts at the same time. But more important than that  it shows the management team has an owner mentality (to be clear  Chairman McCain has 7.8% ownership of the company  so he is an owner)  and is willing to take principled and shareholder-friendly actions  with no interest in empire building.That  together with Total Produce's past track record  shall give investors comfort and confidence in Dole's path forward.Increased Institutional Ownership3 institutional players recognized Dole plc's value and took sizeable stakes by summer 2022  as I mentioned here:Since then  Jan Barta has increased his stake to 5.9% (from 5.2% in Aug 2022)  and Dole had its 4th 5%+ shareholder - Pale Fire Capital - with a 7.8% stake by year-end 2022. Thus  we have 4 large institutional shareholders holding ~25% of total shares.Together with 12.6% ownership from Murdock Group (via C&C)  and 7.7% ownership from the McCann family (via Balkan Investment)  Dole gets a solid shareholder base holding over 45% total equity today.It is worth noting that neither Murdock nor McCann families have unloaded a share since the IPO  despite Murdock's initial intent for the IPO was to unload its equity stakes.Banana Prices in 2023Banana distributors/producers negotiate a base wholesale price with large grocery stores once a year  usually at the beginning of a year  with relatively minor price adjustments during the year.Dole management has been hinting that they feel pretty confident going into this year's price negotiation given the overall market conditions.

The offer was subscribed  on the one hand  by professional investors for 2.5 million euros  and  on the other hand  by retail investors through the PrimaryBid platform for 0.6 million euros (the ‚ÄúTransaction‚Äù).Ignacio Faus  NFL Biosciences CEO: ‚ÄúOn behalf of NFL Biosciences  I would like to warmly thank all of the professional investors and the many retail investors  through PrimaryBid  who took part in this fundraising round. We have now secured the resources needed to reach the validation milestones of our two main clinical programs on NFL-101 in 2023  and we will also be able to move forward with the development of NFL-301. As always  we will take the greatest care to effectively allocate these resources and we are confident that we will be able to demonstrate the efficacy of NFL-101 in helping people stop smoking‚Äù.Allocation of the fundsSpecifically  the funds raised in connection with the Transaction will make it possible to supplement the financing for the CESTO II phase II/III trial  aiming to demonstrate the efficacy of its botanical drug candidate NFL-101 for smoking cessation  and the PRECESTO trial  assessing the potential of NFL-101 to be associated with nicotine replacement therapies  as well as the continued development of NFL-301  aimed at reducing alcohol consumption.CESTO II ‚Ä¢ The CESTO II trial is progressing in line with the schedule set  with 75% of the 318 smokers recruited at the nine clinical investigation centers that are taking part in the study. NFL Biosciences expects to finalize recruitments at the end of the second quarter  which would enable results to be obtained for the main criteria at the end of 2023. CESTO II‚Äôs objectives are to select the best dose and assess the efficacy of NFL-101 versus placebo. The primary end-point for assessment is the subjects‚Äô continued abstinence for four weeks (US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) accepted end-point). Many other secondary end-points will also be assessed  including the subjects‚Äô continued abstinence for six months (European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted end-point)  the number of cigarettes smoked  withdrawal symptoms and level of craving. About 55% of the funds raised will be allocated to finalizing this Phase II/III clinical trial.PRECESTO ‚Ä¢ This Phase IIa clinical trial aims primarily to validate the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation treatments and particularly nicotine replacement therapies (transdermal patches  tablets  chewing gums  inhalers and nicotine sprays) with a view to developing an innovative treatment method by associating NFL-101 with other smoking cessation methods. The PRECESTO trial will compare against a placebo the capacity of NFL-101 to reduce smoking satisfaction and cravings. This is a randomized  double-blind trial that will include 34 smokers who are not looking to stop smoking and get great satisfaction from smoking with a cross-over design. This trial is expected to further strengthen the appeal of NFL-101 for pharmaceutical companies that sell smoking cessation drugs and could be interested in taking out licenses. About 20% of the funds raised will be allocated to putting in place and carrying out this Phase IIa clinical trial. The PRECESTO trial results are expected for the third quarter of 2023.NFL-301 ‚Ä¢ This natural drug candidate to reduce alcohol consumption is subject to a co-development agreement with ATHENA Pharmaceutiques  set up in February 2022. Under this partnership  ATHENA Pharmaceutiques  a market leader for the development and manufacturing of oral delivery drugs  will manage the development and manufacturing of NFL-301  while NFL Biosciences will draw up and lead the clinical program  which could be launched in the United States over the coming months. By allocating about 15% of the funds raised to this project  NFL Biosciences will be able to continue developing NFL-301 and file a pre-IND application with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to a future clinical trial application. The partnership aims to develop NFL-301 at least until its placebo-controlled efficacy has been demonstrated as a treatment for reducing alcohol consumption. NFL Biosciences and ATHENA Pharmaceutiques will make a joint investment and will share future revenues based on their respective investments.The balance of the funds raised  approximately 10%  will be allocated to the day-to-day operations of the Company.Before carrying out this round of fundraising  NFL Biosciences‚Äô cash horizon was the end of the second quarter of 2023. Considering the current level of cash and the estimated proceeds from this round of fundraising  NFL Biosciences is pushing back its cash horizon to March 2024. In addition  two other applications for subsidies for a combined total of 1.7 million euros are currently being reviewed by Bpifrance  with an outcome expected in the first quarter of 2023  thus extending the cash horizon even further. NFL Biosciences will also continue to apply for non-dilutive financing solutions with French and European institutions.Reminder of the Transaction‚Äôs key featuresThe Transaction was put in place and carried out under the 10th  12th and 13th resolutions from the Company‚Äôs Extraordinary General Shareholders‚Äô Meeting on May 25  2022 (the ‚ÄúGeneral Meeting‚Äù) at a price of 2 23 euros per share  representing a discount of 24.87% compared to the volume-weighted average price of NFL Biosciences shares over the last 5 trading sessions (i.e. from Monday  January 23 to Friday  January 27  2023) equal to 2.9680 euros and 29.21% compared to the closing price of NFL Biosciences shares on Monday  January 30  2023 which is 3.15 euros.The Transaction  for a total of 3 059 910.11 euros  including the issue premium  was carried out by issuing  with preferential subscription rights waived  1 372 157 new ordinary shares  representing 26.2% of the Company‚Äôs share capital prior to the Transaction  with:(i) 1 097 726 new shares issued for a total of 2 447 928.98 euros (including the issue premium)  representing 80% of the Transaction  for professional investors under the 10th and 12th resolutions from the General Meeting (the ‚ÄúReserved Offer‚Äù)  and(ii) 274 431 new shares issued for a total of 611 981.13 euros (including the issue premium)  representing 20% of the Transaction  for retail investors that subscribed through the PrimaryBid platform (the ‚ÄúPrimaryBid Offer‚Äù).The settlement-delivery of these new shares and their admission to Euronext Growth Paris under ISIN FR0014003XT0 will take place on February 2nd  2023.The newly issued shares will be assimilated with the existing shares and will accrue dividends immediately.It is reminded that in connection with the Transaction  NFL Biosciences has made a commitment  on the one hand  to not carry out any capital increase based on new shares for a period of 6 months from the completion of the Transaction without prior approval from Invest Securities and  on the other hand  to not issue any bonds that could be exchanged for or converted into new shares  whether or not these are combined with stock warrants  until December 31  2023.Following the Transaction  the Company‚Äôs share capital will represent 198 203 euros  split into 6 606 769 ordinary shares with a par value of 0.03 euros  all of the same category.The breakdown of the Company‚Äôs shareholding structure before the Trasaction was as follows:On a non-diluted basis On a diluted basis In quantity of shares In % of ownership In quantity of shares In % of ownership Jo√´l BESSE 1 111 253 21.2% 1 361 253 17.9% Bruno LAFONT 325 279 6.2% 1 075 279 14.1% G√©rard LEDUC 76 550 1.5% 1 076 550 14.1% Family MEREAU 544 588 10.4% 669 588 8.8% Eric MOREL D'ARLEUX 372 803 7.1% 372 803 4.9% Family NICOLAS 275 320 5.3% 275 320 3.6% Other private investors 775 246 14.8% 1 036 976 13.6% Public 1 753 573 33.5% 1 753 573 23.0% Total 5 234 612 100.0% 7 621 342 100.0%The breakdown of the Company‚Äôs shareholding structure following the Transaction is as follows:On a non-diluted basis On a diluted basis In quantity of shares In % of ownership In quantity of shares In % of ownership Jo√´l BESSE 1 111 253 16.8% 1 361 253 15.1% Bruno LAFONT 325 279 325 279 4.9% 1 075 279 G√©rard LEDUC 76 550 76 550 1.2% 1 076 550 Family MEREAU 544 588 544 588 8.2% 669 588 Eric MOREL D'ARLEUX 372 803 372 803 5.6% 372 803 Family NICOLAS 275 320 275 320 4.2% 275 320 Other private investors 775 246 775 246 11.7% 1 036 976 Public 3 125 730 47.3% 3 125 730 34.8% Total 6 606 769 100.0% 8 993 499 100.0%It is specified that subscriptions  for a cumulative amount of ‚Ç¨2.2 million  were subject to a remuneration of 5% of the amount subscribed.Transation partnersInvestment services provider and bookrunner ConsultingLegal advisory Financial communicationDisclaimerPursuant to the provisions of Article 1(4) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017  the Transaction did not give rise to the publication of a Prospectus subject to approval by the Autorit√© des March√©s Financiers (AMF).This press release does not constitute a prospectus within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017  as amended  or a public offering.In certain countries  the distribution of this press release may be subject to specific regulations.

These trends continue to reflect the wait-and-see approach observed for clients and prospects facing a deteriorating economic environment.AMA generated these 2022 revenues with more than 490 clients (as many as in 2021)  primarily major groups in diverse sectors  including Merck  Alstom  Air Liquide  Boehringer and KPMG.AMA has continued to work with its main large clients and welcomed 115 new accounts on board in 2022. 87% of the 15 largest clients in 2020 and 2021 (representing more than 50% of bookings) renewed their contracts or placed new orders in 2022. Nevertheless  AMA recorded a reduction in the average basket for its clients  which face an uncertain economic environment leading them to defer or scale back their investments in the short term  and to renew their connected equipment less frequently.Story continuesThe level of orders signed during the second half of the year was down 9% from the second half of the previous year  and therefore lower than expected  although the fourth quarter of 2022 recorded an 11% increase compared with the third quarter of 2022.Recognized and increasingly innovative technologyAMA has continued to innovate  launching versions of its assisted reality solution XpertEye each quarter with a range of new features. In 2022  the most significant developments included the ‚ÄúOn & Live‚Äù feature  making it possible to launch a connection in one click  the possibility to record calls and conferences  the higher quality video  the possibility to combine up to four different video streams and the strengthening of bandwidth management  a key area of expertise for AMA. A number of connected devices were also added  along with new languages (Arabic  Indian  Thai)  with a total of 20 languages available.AMA won the Enedis Innov‚Äô2022 award. The XpertEye solution was selected by ENEDIS  France‚Äôs leading manager of the public electricity distribution network  from among 200 innovation projects  to make day-to-day life easier for its after-sales service operators  with an environmental  technological and social focus. The XpertEye solution makes it possible to accelerate installation times for electricity meters  reducing the trips to be made by installers and increasing client satisfaction.XpertEye also continues to be widely adopted in the medical  emergency and relief sectors. It is currently used by more than 40 departmental fire and emergency services to adapt emergency facilities and improve interventions and care for victims.Continued business development and cost optimization strategyOperating in a more demanding market  AMA is adapting its strategy with agility to open up new sources of growth by:further strengthening its key partnerships with firms such as Orange Business Services  which are contributing increasingly effectively to the distribution and use of XpertEye solutions;rolling out a new Enterprise model commercial offer to ramp up use in major groups and therefore increase sales volumes. A 15-day free trial offer was also launched for XpertEye Lite at the start of the year to help make professionals and businesses more aware of the effectiveness of its solution;supporting its clients with their digital and environmental transition through targeted actions and data  including an assessment of the CO 2 emissions saved by using XpertEye solutions  thanks in particular to reduced levels of travel.Alongside this  AMA has reduced its costs and cash consumption by around ‚Ç¨400K per month compared with the monthly average from the first half of 2022 with a view to having a financial structure that is better adapted to the current situation on its market.Next financial press release2022 full-year results: April 28  2023 (before start of trading).Disclaimer: This press release contains certain non-factual elements  including but not restricted to certain statements concerning its future results and other future events.

This new concession covers the entire inventory of about 150 Bus Shelters and 150 City Information Panels (CIPs).The Group has worked in partnership with Macau for many years  beginning in 2001 as the first company to win an exclusive advertising contract to install and maintain street furniture.

Each tranche is accompanied by the issue of warrants  the number of which is calculated in relation to a reference price of 14 euros according to the following formula : Number of warrants = Amount of the tranche / (14 x m) with m = 3.7 for tranche 2. AB Science has already announced the drawdown of the first tranche for EUR 6.0 million.The second tranche  also of EUR 6.0 million  has a maturity of five years and is therefore repayable in January 2028. It carries a capitalized annual interest rate of 7.0% and the issuance of 115 830 warrants  each giving the right to subscribe to one ordinary share of AB Science at 14.0 euros for 15 years. These warrants represent 0.22% of the current capital of the Company (if they were to be exercised in their entirety).The EIB also has a put option at intrinsic value (i.e. the difference between the stock market price and the exercise price) allowing it to require the Company to repurchase all or part of the warrants then exercisable but not yet exercised  under certain circumstances (for example in the event of a change of control or at the reimbursement date of the first tranche). In addition  the Company has a right of first refusal to redeem any warrants offered for sale to a third party  subject to certain exceptions.On the basis of 115 830 new shares of the Company that could be issued upon exercise of all of these warrants  the Company could potentially receive gross proceeds amounting to 1 621 620 euros. There is no guarantee that the EIB will exercise all or part of the warrants or that the Company will receive any proceeds from the exercise of these warrants.[1]: Press release of November 30  2020 and December 22  2022About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

His team won the Swedish championship a few months later  when he also received his first U21 international cap. He was then loaned to Mj√§llby  where he scored eight goals in 19 matches before being transferred in January 2022 to Heerenveen  in the Netherlands.A versatile centre-forward measuring 1m88  known for both his physical and technical prowess  Amin scored the first of his 11 goals for Heerenveen on 18 March 2022 against Almelo.

He is the third Swedish player in OL's history  following in the footsteps of Kim Kallstr√∂m (2006-12) and Ake Hjalmarsson (1953-55).Following the rapid departures of Karl Toko Ekambi (Rennes) and Tet√™ (Leicester) during the current winter transfer window  Olympique Lyonnais is pleased to have seized this opportunity to recruit Amin Sarr  a player with significant potential for the future.Amin Sarr: ‚ÄúI have known OL since I was a little boy.

Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic‚Äôs technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)¬∞ is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFran√ßois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors‚Äô current expectations and projections about future events.

Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic‚Äôs technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)¬∞ is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFran√ßois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors‚Äô current expectations and projections about future events.

Any proposals from the board of directors  the shareholders‚Äô committee or shareholders9.a. Proposed amendments to the articles of associationThe shareholders‚Äô committee and the board of directors propose the following amendments to the articles of association:Articles 2a-2b:It is proposed that the authorisations in Articles 2a and 2b be extended to 28 February 2028.If the proposal is approved  the wording of Art. 2a and 2b of the bank‚Äôs articles of association will be changed to the following:Art. 2a:‚ÄúThe general meeting has decided to authorise the board of directors to increase the share capital in one or more rounds by up to nom. DKK 5 675 933 with right of pre-emption for the bank‚Äôs existing shareholders. The capital increase shall be fully paid up in cash. The capital increase may be below the market price. This authorisation shall apply until 28 February 2028.‚ÄùArt. 2b:‚ÄúThe general meeting has decided to authorise the board of directors to increase the share capital in one or more rounds by up to nom. DKK 2 837 966 without right of pre-emption for the bank‚Äôs existing shareholders. The capital increase may be by cash payment or contribution of an existing company or specific asset values corresponding to the value of the shares issued. The capital increase shall be fully paid up at the market price ascertained by the board of directors. This authorisation shall apply until 28 February 2028.‚ÄùThe reason for the proposal is that the board of directors wants to ensure continued flexibility regarding the authorisations to the board of directors.Art. 5  new paragraph 2:It is proposed that the possibility of holding all or part of general meetings electronically be incorporated in the bank‚Äôs articles of association.If the proposal is approved  a paragraph 2 with the following new wording will be inserted in article 5:‚ÄúThe board of directors may decide to hold all or part of a general meeting electronically  if the board of directors considers this to be appropriate and provided that proper conduct of the meeting is thereby assured and that other legal requirements for a partly or fully electronic general meeting are fulfilled.

Details regarding registration and procedures for electronic attendance will be made available on the bank‚Äôs website and in the notice of the relevant general meeting.‚Äùand the existing paragraph 2 will be a new paragraph 3.The reason for the proposal is that the board of directors wants the articles of association to provide a possibility of holding general meetings electronically in future.

Physical attendance remains the board‚Äôs preferred form of holding general meetings.Art. 15  paragraph 1:It is proposed that the number of members of the board of directors elected by the shareholders' committee be up to 10.If the proposal is approved  the wording of Art. 15  paragraph 1 will be changed to the following:‚ÄúThe board of directors shall consist of at least six (6) and at most ten (10) members elected by the shareholders‚Äô committee.‚ÄùThe reason for the proposal is that the bank wants to strengthen the board‚Äôs competences and in this respect  the shareholders' committee has today elected Lene Weldum as a new board member with effect from 1 March 2023 subject to the general meeting‚Äôs approval of the amendment to the articles of association.The proposed amendments to the articles of association are also given in the full proposals to which we refer and which are available on the bank‚Äôs website  www.landbobanken.com9.b.

The 0% p.a. management fee offering on the CoinShares Physical Ethereum ETP reflects this commitment to trust  transparency  and fairness towards investors.Reducing the management fees to 0% positions CoinShares to capitalise on the upcoming Shanghai Hard Fork  officially planned by the Ethereum Foundation for March 2023. This update will enable ETH stakers to unlock their staked ETH and finally receive the staking rewards they have accumulated. The Shanghai Hard Fork will bring liquidity to Ethereum as the cryptocurrency units currently staking on the Beacon chain will be released for trading. As a result  CoinShares will be able to provide both liquidity and staking rewards to its investors in the CoinShares Physical Ethereum ETP. Reducing the management fees to 0% is a strategic move that allows CoinShares‚Äô investors to anticipate this significant moment for the Ethereum blockchain.Unlike most of its competitors  CoinShares already shares the revenue from the staking rewards of its staked ETPs (Polygon  Tezos  Polkadot  Cosmos  etc.) with its investors and charges no management fees. This new offering provides investors with a unique opportunity to gain exposure to Ethereum without incurring additional fees  and helps them prepare to benefit from the unlock of staking rewards in 2023.Story continues""At CoinShares  we are dedicated to offering our investors access to transparent  fair  and reliable investment opportunities in digital assets "" said Jean-Marie Mognetti  CEO of CoinShares. ""The 0% management fee offering on the CoinShares Physical Ethereum ETP is a reflection of our commitment to accessibility and transparency  key factors in achieving mass adoption of digital assets.

17548,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4573634-carmila-the-7-9-percent-yield-should-be-safe,Carmila: The 7.9% Yield Should Be Safe (OTCMKTS:CRMIF),Carmila is a French REIT which owns the non-grocery store real estate assets within the building. Read more here.,"Marina113/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionCarmila (OTCPK:CRMIF) was created by Carrefour to create more shareholder value by optimizing its own real estate assets. Whereas Carrefour used to own the entire floor space of their large shopping malls  upper-level management made the decision to split these malls in two parts. One part would be the Carrefour owned and operated ""anchor store "" but the non-Carrefour space (which is usually taken up by smaller tenants which aren't competitors) was spun out into Carmila. Carrefour (OTCPK:CRERF) (OTCPK:CRRFY) still is the largest shareholder with a 36% stake in Carmila.Carmila Investor RelationsCarmila's primary listing is in France where it is trading on Euronext Paris with CARM as its ticker symbol. The average daily volume in Paris is 57 000 shares  which clearly makes it the best option to trade in the REIT's shares. There are about 144M shares outstanding  resulting in a market capitalization of approximately 2B EUR.Yahoo FinanceA closer look at the financial performance and interest rate sensitivityFrench companies rarely provide a detailed overview on a quarterly basis  and generally only publish financial statements every six months. Carmila is no exception and the Q3 update was a bit light on details. Nonetheless  it does appear to confirm my previous thesis the REIT remains on track for a very strong 2022 and has reaffirmed its guidance for a 20% recurring earnings growth for this year. Considering Carmila generated 1.24 EUR per share in recurring earnings in 2021  it's basically implying this year's result will come in pretty close to or perhaps even exceed 1.50 EUR per share. The recurring earnings in the first half of the year came in at 0.83 EUR  but I expect the second semester to be weaker.That's one year ahead of schedule as I had only expected to see the 1.5 EUR milestone in 2023. While we may come in a little bit below that the 1.5 EUR seems to be a ""given"" considering most inflation-related rent increases will happen in H1 2023. So unless a wave of bankruptcies rolls over the tenant base of Carmila  the near-term outlook for 2022 and 2023 is looking bright. This also means we can look forward to seeing a dividend hike of approximately 10%. Based on an anticipated recurring EPS of 1.47 EUR per share  the dividend will likely come in at around 1.1 EUR based on the dividend policy which includes a payout ratio of 75%.This represents a yield of 7.9% based on the current share price of 13.62 EUR per share and given this (fully-covered) yield and the fact that Carmila appears to be trading at just over 9 times this year's earnings and likely just over 8 times next year's recurring earnings  Carmila is still cheap enough to be picked up in a portfolio.Sensitivity analysesI wanted to work on some sensitivity analyses to see how the book value and the LTV ratio of REITs would come under pressure when the capitalization rates of the properties are increased. Fortunately this has been a pet peeve of mine for years and most REITs in the portfolios are in safe territory (as mentioned before  it's mainly DIC that is in the danger zone so I will be looking forward to seeing how the situation is evolving there).In Carmila's case  we know the net rental income in the first nine months of the year was just under 254M EUR  indicating a Q3 NRI of approximately 83M EUR. That's a bit lower than I had anticipated although Carmila obviously also sold some assets while the net rental income also includes real estate expenses and I expect the heating and power bills to increase). So rather than annualizing the 254M EUR  I will annualize the Q3 NRI to 332M EUR per year. Applying a portfolio-wide 5% rent hike should result in a 348M EUR NRI in 2023. The table below shows the fair value of the assets  the NAV and NAV/share using four different capitalization rates. The other parameters used below are a net financial debt of 2.27B EUR (the official net debt position as of the end of June) and a current share count of 144M shares (it should be a little bit lower but I'm erring on the side of being cautious here).Author TableAccording to my calculations  even applying a required 7.5% net rental yield would still result in a book value about 15% above the current share price while the LTV ratio remains below 50%. Meanwhile  hoarding 25% of the recurring earnings means Carmila would retain approximately 50-55M EUR per year in cash  which would further reduce the LTV ratio by 110-120 base points in the 7.5% scenario. This means that the YE 2023 LTV ratio should still come in below 48%.A second sensitivity analysis I wanted to work on is how the REIT would be impacted by higher interest rates. And there's a silver lining here. As Carmila's average cost of debt is currently approximately 2.3%  its average cost of debt should increase at a much lower rate than most of its competitors of which many have a sub-2% interest rate.The next two maturities are a 2.375% bond in both 2023 and 2024  and after that  Carmila is pretty much in the clear until 2027 when a 1.625% bond matures. A portion of the 2023 bond was already called early. Looking at the bond market  Carmila's six year bonds currently have a YTM of approximately 6.4%. Side note: Given the sensitivity analysis above  I think the Carmila debt is a strong buy here. Unfortunately the minimum size of these bonds is 100 000 EUR and that's the sole reason why I haven't dipped my toe in the bond-water yet.Carmila Investor RelationsIf the bond market remains this unreasonable  I do expect Carmila to increase its ratio of credit facilities and bank loans as that should for sure be cheaper. In the scenarios below  I will show how the recurring earnings will be impacted by an increase in interest rates across the board. Note: this is a very conservative scenario assuming all debt becomes more expensive overnight while only half of the debt is up for refinancing before 2027. So Carmila has the time working in its favor.Carmila Investor RelationsThe table above also does not take two important elements into consideration: It does not account for asset sales or cash hoarding: Should Carmila hoard the 50-55M EUR in non-distributed cash flow per year  it would hoard in excess of 400M EUR by the end of 2030 which would save the REIT about 25M EUR per year at a 6% cost of debt) Secondly  it does not take the rent hikes into consideration. If Carmila is able to hike the rent at a rate of 3% per year from 2024 on  it would add 80M EUR in additional annual net rental income by the end of this decade  which is when the last tranche of low-cost debt will be refinanced.Investment thesisThis means that if Carmila doesn't develop its pipeline and if it's able to increase the rent throughout the next decade the impact of a 400 bp increase of the average cost of debt (implying a 6.3% interest rate on all of its outstanding debt) would be completely covered. Food for thought  and the main risk if obviously keeping the occupancy high and retain the tenants.I have a long position in Carmila as I like the relationship with Carrefour and the strong footfall by owning the retail space related to a grocery-anchored superstore. As Carmila's debt repayment schedule is well spread out  I think the gradual rent hikes will be able to compensate for the increasing interest rates and the recurring earnings should continue to hover around the 1.50-1.60 EUR mark. The dividend yield of almost 8% is comfortably covered  making Carmila an interesting income-pick with exposure to European commercial real estate.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Revenue reported in the 2021-2022 consolidated income statement therefore excludes these ""discontinued operations""  according to the IFRS standards.The Bonduelle Group's revenue for the 1st half of financial year 2022-2023 amounted to ‚Ç¨ 1 243.4 million  compared with ‚Ç¨ 1 094.6 million for the 1st half of the previous financial year which represents a growth of +13.6% at current exchange rates and +6.1% on a like for like basis* with favorable currency variations boosting sales growth by +7.5%.The growth of the 2nd quarter revenue shows an acceleration compared to the 1st quarter at +16.0% at current exchange rates and +7.6% on a like for like basis*.Activity by Geographic RegionTotal Consolidated Revenue(in ‚Ç¨ millions) 1st HY2022-2023 1st HY2021-2022 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis* 2nd Quarter2022-2023 2nd Quarter2021-2022 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis* Europe Zone 739.1 663.8 11.4% 12.3% 390.5 343.3 13.7% 14.8% Non-Europe Zone 504.2 430.8 17.0% -3.4% 281.6 236.3 19.2% -2.9% Total 1 243.4 1 094.6 13.6% 6.1% 672.1 579.6 16.0% 7.6%Activity by Operating SegmentsTotal Consolidated Revenue(in ‚Ç¨ millions) 1st HY2022-2023 1st HY2021-2022 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis* 2nd Quarter2022-2023 2nd Quarter2021-2022 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis* Canned 597.1 490.0 21.9% 14.1% 357.0 284.9 25.3% 15.9% Frozen 138.5 118.2 17.2% 16.6% 76.9 64.6 19.0% 18.2% Fresh processed 507.7 486.4 4.4% -4.4% 238.2 230.0 3.5% -5.6% Total 1 243.4 1 094.6 13.6% 6.1% 672.1 579.6 16.0% 7 6%Europe ZoneThe Europe Zone representing 59.4% of the business activity over the period  posted an overall growth of +11.4% at current exchange rates and +12.3% on a like for like basis* over the 1st half of the year  with all technologies showing growth over the period.The variations for the 2nd quarter were respectively +13.7% and +14.8%  accelerating compared to the 1st quarter.The policy of price increase intended to partially compensate for inflations in production costs continues  particularly in canned and frozen activities. A limited decline in volumes over the period was noted. This is explained by the quotas applied to certain products following a deficit harvest.The frozen activity showed positive volume growth both in food service  which is continuing its post-covid recovery  and in retail (success of recent innovations launched  in particular under the Cassegrain brand).The ready-to-use fresh segment (salad bags and processed)  where cost increases  and therefore price increases  are more limited  showed growth in value and a stability in volumes. Supply difficulties and less dynamic markets in salads were offset over the period by a particularly dynamic summer season in processed segment.Story continuesNon-Europe ZoneThe Non-Europe Zone revenue representing 40.6% of the business activity in the 1st half year  posted +17.0% at current exchange rates and -3.4% on a like for like basis*. Variations for the 2nd quarter were respectively +19.2% and -2.9%.In an uncertain geopolitical context  the Eurasia zone posted higher revenue (canned and frozen)  linked to price increases  with volumes in this area slightly down on the previous year.In North America  the ready-to-use fresh segment declined over the period  impacted on the one hand by the loss of contracts in the 2nd half of financial year 2021-2022  by a salad segment that was itself in decline  and on the other hand by an agronomic crisis affecting salad yields in the Salinas region  generating a significant shortage of products and a rise in purchase prices. In this context  the Bonduelle Group decided to adapt its manufacturing set up on the East Coast of the United States to the expected level of activity and refocused on profitable business segments (see below).Other significant informationAdaptation of the American industrial set upIn order to improve its competitiveness in the ready-to-use fresh produce market in the United States and to refocus its activity on its valued segments  the Bonduelle Group is adapting the industrial structure of its activity on the East Coast of the United States.Thus  the manufacturing activities in Florence (New Jersey) will be merged in the coming months with the Swedesboro site  also in New Jersey. This operation aims to optimize the production of all products for customers nationally  while achieving gains in efficiency and coverage of fixed costs.The current Florence site will be converted into a warehouse for the East Coast  maintaining these jobs on the site and all current Florence production workers will be offered a position in Swedesboro. The financial impact of this reorganization will be recorded in the 2022-2023 fiscal year under non-recurring items  which will be specified when the half-year results are presented.OutlookIn a particularly uncertain environment  the achievement of the group‚Äôs objectives in terms of business growth and profitability for financial year 2022-2023  which will be specified during the half year presentation  will remain dependent both on the dynamics of consumption which are difficult to predict and on price increases  once again essential to compensate changes in certain components of the cost price  in particular agricultural materials.* at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis. The revenues in foreign currency over the given period are translated into the rate of exchange for the comparable period. The impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments is restated as follows:For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period  revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded. In the specific case of the loss of control of the long life activities in North America  the IFRS 5 standard having been applied to the historical data  the revenue is already restated in the historical elements;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year  revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.Alternative performance indicators : the group presents in its financial notices performance indicators not defined by accounting standards.

17561,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://qz.com/on-brexits-third-anniversary-the-uk-has-more-reasons-t-1850058294,On Brexit's third anniversary  the UK has more reasons to regret it than ever,The last day of January 2020 was the UK‚Äôs last day as a member of the European Union. Though many people didn‚Äôt know it yet  covid-19 was around the corner. The combined effect of both the pandemic and Brexit  compounded by the wider regional and global impac‚Ä¶,The last day of January 2020 was the UK‚Äôs last day as a member of the European Union. Though many people didn‚Äôt know it yet  covid-19 was around the corner. The combined effect of both the pandemic and Brexit  compounded by the wider regional and global impacts of Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine  have led to the situation today: Frustration and regret.A UK that may have gained more independence  but has lost crucial workers and markets that supported its economy. A country with a health service  transport network  and education system experiencing coordinated strikes by employees furious with the government‚Äôs handling of everything from pay in hard times  to the very right to strike itself. A government riven by scandal  leadership change  and financial mismanagement  all of which is undermining public confidence. And a public who made a choice back in the 2016 referendum on EU membership  and increasingly wish they‚Äôd made a different one.AdvertisementJobs  strikes  and payMany of those who campaigned and voted for Brexit talked about the need to protect jobs. Unregulated migration from the EU had pushed down wages and muscled British people out of jobs in sectors like agriculture  building  and healthcare  the argument went.Seven years on from the vote and three from the ultimate severance of ties with the EU  the UK is going through something of an employment poly- crisis. On the one hand  staff who had kept the National Health Service afloat through years of underfunding have moved back to other European countries  and nurses‚Äîwho took part in unprecedented strikes last month‚Äîdoctors  and ambulance staff say hospitals are desperately understaffed to the point of endangering lives.Strikes have also affected train services for the past several months  as well as university teachers  and now school teachers  leading to the closure of hundreds of schools across the country. Many of the strikes focus on pay  which workers say hasn‚Äôt kept in line with inflation; perhaps unsurprising  given that inflation rose above 11% in the UK in October 2022  before falling slightly (but remaining over 10%). The government  meanwhile  is arguing that a shortage of workers is the problem. Labor shortages  in many countries  are pushing wages up  they say. That leads to inflation  which will only be st oked by giving public sector workers enough of a pay raise to support their current standard of living.While it‚Äôs certainly true that other economies are experiencing tighter labor markets  the reasons behind that tightening are to at least some degree local and specific. In the UK  Brexit has potentially sucked thousands of people out of the labor market in the last few years‚Äîincluding EU citizens who have left  those who might have come but didn‚Äôt  and UK or other citizens who have decided they prefer to work elsewhere.AdvertisementIn 2016  before the referendum  EU citizens made up between 59% and 77% of all migrants to the UK  according to the the Migration Observatory at Oxford University. That began to fall as soon as the UK voted to leave  and during the pandemic in 2020 led to 94 000 more EU citizens moving away from the UK than to it. This might have bounced back post-pandemic  but the enactment of Brexit at the end of that year put up barriers to prevent it. (Net migration to the UK has still risen in most years since 1991  and was in fact unusually high in 2022  but for specific factors  Migration Observatory said  including the war in Ukraine and a visa scheme for people from Hong Kong.)Immigration  refugees  and small boatsCurbing immigration was also an explicit factor in the rhetoric of the Brexiteer camp. Some of this was expressed in relation to jobs  as discussed  some to more amorphous cultural issues  and some of it was explicitly racist: Anger and fear directed at people from different countries and specifically different ethnic groups than the white British majority.Europe has been experiencing an intense refugee crisis for years  particularly fueled by conflicts in which the West has intervened militarily  including in Afghanistan  Iraq  Syria  and Somalia. Insulated by being an island  the UK has a relatively tiny number of refugees and asylum-seekers. Asylum applications peaked at just over 84 000 in 2002 before falling dramatically and staying much lower than that every year to date. In 2021 and 2022  however  the number of people crossing the channel from France in small boats‚Äîa deeply dangerous and often fatal route‚Äîhas risen dramatically. A total of 185 000 have crossed to the UK in small boats over time  most in the last three years  according to UK government figures. In 2022  at least 40 died making the attempt.Brexit has not in itself solved the perceived problem of migration to the UK  or of people seeking asylum; only flows of people have changed  and with the changes different problems have arisen both for the country and for individuals.AdvertisementHow has Brexit affected the rest of the UK economy?When it comes to a whole economy  of course it‚Äôs possible to find data points to support different theories  to interpret data in different ways. In December 2022  St√©phane Boujnah  CEO of Euronext  Europe‚Äôs largest stock exchange group  told Bloomberg that London had lost its place as Europe‚Äôs financial center because of Brexit. He cited the data point that primary listings in France  as measured by total market capitalization  had overtaken those in the UK in the previous month. That‚Äôs far from definitive proof that London is losing its financial-world status. It‚Äôs certainly possible to point to ways in which the UK economy is doing well  and also to point out that problems the country is experiencing‚Äîsuch as high inflation and soaring energy prices‚Äîare also happening elsewhere (though they are particularly bad in the UK.)But it‚Äôs certainly also true that these are tough times to be a UK citizen  whether you‚Äôre someone on low income struggling to afford food and heat  a homeowner watching mortgage payments skyrocket  or an older person dependent on a crumbling NHS or underfunded social care system. Thus far  it‚Äôs hard to see the bright spots of Brexit.What does the UK public think about Brexit now?On Tuesday  data from Transparency International pointed to one of the biggest declines in public confidence in UK institutions since the anti-corruption group began keeping records. The UK fell from 11th place in the world for perceived corruption in 2021 to 18th place in 2023  with those surveyed pointing to multiple government scandals. Brexit wasn‚Äôt mentioned in the Transparency report  and may not have featured in the score; but it‚Äôs certainly been a big feature of the last seven years for the Conservative Party  which has been in power throughout. The party‚Äôs former leader  Boris Johnson  won office on a Brexit platform‚Äîand saw it through‚Äîbefore eventually having to resign because a series of scandals undermined the trust of his own party.Johnson was followed by a short stint in power for Liz Truss  who crashed the economy with a disastrous mini-budget of unfunded tax cuts in October 2022. Then came Rishi Sunak  one of whose most recent acts has been to sack his party chairman for breaking the ministerial code.AdvertisementBrexit  in these conditions  has never been more unpopular  with data from non-profit What UK Thinks  which collated a number of polls  suggesting more people now regret the decision than ever.,negative,0.0,0.0,0.99,mixed,0.03,0.05,0.91,True,English,"['third anniversary', 'Brexit', 'UK', 'reasons', 'employment poly- crisis', 'past several months', 'amorphous cultural issues', 'intense refugee crisis', 'white British majority', 'National Health Service', 'different ethnic groups', 'tighter labor markets', 'other European countries', 'public sector workers', 'last three years', 'UK government figures', 'European Union', 'Labor shortages', 'many countries', 'other economies', 'other citizens', 'different countries', 'last day', 'combined effect', 'wider regional', 'global impacts', 'transport network', 'education system', 'hard times', 'leadership change', 'financial mismanagement', 'public confidence', 'ultimate severance', 'one hand', 'train services', 'university teachers', 'school teachers', 'current standard', 'Oxford University', 'specific factors', 'visa scheme', 'Hong Kong', 'small boats', 'explicit factor', 'Brexiteer camp', 'fatal route', 'different problems', 'data points', 'Unregulated migration', 'Migration Observatory', 'Net migration', 'crucial workers', 'British people', 'EU membership', 'EU citizens', 'most years', 'Curbing immigration', 'tiny number', 'Asylum applications', 'coordinated strikes', 'unprecedented strikes', 'many people', 'pay raise', 'UK economy', 'January', 'covid', 'corner', 'pandemic', 'Russia', 'attack', 'Ukraine', 'situation', 'Frustration', 'regret', 'independence', 'country', 'employees', 'handling', 'everything', 'right', 'scandal', 'choice', '2016 referendum', 'Advertisement', 'Jobs', 'need', 'wages', 'sectors', 'agriculture', 'building', 'healthcare', 'argument', 'vote', 'ties', 'something', 'staff', 'underfunding', 'nurses', 'part', 'doctors', 'hospitals', 'lives', 'hundreds', 'schools', 'line', 'inflation', 'October', 'living', 'reasons', 'tightening', 'thousands', 'migrants', 'enactment', 'barriers', 'war', 'refugees', 'rhetoric', 'relation', 'Anger', 'fear', 'conflicts', 'West', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'Syria', 'Somalia', 'island', 'asylum-seekers', 'date', 'channel', 'France', 'total', 'attempt', 'perceived', 'flows', 'changes', 'individuals', 'rest', '11', '94,000']",2023-02-01,2023-02-01,qz.com

As a result of the transactions carried out until the end of the Programme  considering the ordinary shares B in the capital of MFE (the ""MFE Shares B"") already held by the Company  MFE holds (i) 88 707 693 MFE Shares A and (ii) 38 627 313 MFE Shares B. It is now proposed  in accordance with the scope of the Programme  to cancel 88 707 693 MFE Shares A as repurchased by MFE under the Programme  and to reduce the issued share capital accordingly. This decision will only take effect after the relevant legal procedure for capital reduction will be completed. As a result of the execution of the above-mentioned resolutions and following completion of the aforementioned legal procedure  the MFE Shares A issued by MFE will decrease from 1 526 279 035 to 1 437 571 342 and the outstanding share capital of MFE will decrease from EUR 800 313 280.50 to EUR 794 990 818.92. The activities and procedures for the cancellation of the 88 707 693 treasury MFE Shares A (and the concurrent capital decrease) under applicable Dutch laws will be carried out simultaneously with the Merger and are envisaged to be completed prior to the date on which the Merger will be effective. The purpose of the cancellation is primarily a desire to clean up the capital structure and comply with the scope of the Programme resolved by the Board on 20 July 2022 and announced to the market; there is no (other) destination for the repurchased shares. Item 2 - Proposal to enter into a cross-border merger by absorption of Mediaset Espa√±a Comunicaci√≥n  S.A.

MFE is resident for tax purposes in Italy and its legal entity identification (LEI) code is 213800DIFN7NR7B97A50. MFE is controlled by Fininvest S.p.A. The current issued share capital of MFE amounts to EUR 800 313 280.5 and is divided into a total number of 2 707 506 599 shares  of which 1 526 279 035 MFE Shares A (ISIN code NL0015000MZ1 nominal value EUR 0.06 each and granting 1 voting right) and 1 181 227 564 MFE Shares B (ISIN code NL0015000N09  nominal value EUR 0.6 each and granting 10 voting rights). MFE Shares A and MFE Shares B are both listed on the Italian regulated market Euronext Milan  managed and organised by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (""Euronext Milan""). Absorbed company : MEDIASET ESPA√ëA COMUNICACI√ìN  S.A. a public limited company (sociedad an√≥nima) incorporated under the laws of Spain  with its registered office at Carretera de Fuencarral a Alcobendas 4  28049 Madrid (Spain)  registered with the Commercial Registry of Madrid (Registro Mercantil de Madrid) under volume 33 442  sheet 122  section 8  page M-93 306  and with Spanish tax identification number A-79075438. MES legal entity identification (LEI) code is 95980020140005021479. MES is controlled by MFE that holds 259 666 591 MES shares representing 82.92% of MES' issued share capital. The current issued share capital of MES amounts to EUR 156 583 072 and is divided into 313 166 144 ordinary shares (ISIN ES0152503035  nominal value EUR 0.50 each). MES shares are listed on the Madrid  Barcelona  Bilbao and Valencia Stock Exchanges through the Spanish Automated Quotation System (Sistema de Interconexi√≥n Burs√°til - Mercado Continuo) (the ""Spanish Stock Exchanges""). The Merger : A cross-border merger by absorption of MES (as absorbed company) with and into MFE (as absorbing company) within the meaning of the provisions of the (a) Directive (EU) 2017/1132 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 relating to certain aspects of company law  which regulations on cross-border mergers of companies are in force (i) for Dutch law purposes under Title 2.7 of the Dutch Civil Code (the ""DCC"")  and (ii) for Spanish law purposes under Chapter II of Title II of Law 3/2009 of 3 April on structural modifications of companies (the ""LME""); and (b) Directive (EU) 2019/2121 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 as regards cross-border conversions  mergers and divisions. 3 As a result of the completion and effectiveness of the Merger described herein  MES will be merged with and into MFE and will cease to exist as a standalone entity  and MFE will acquire under universal title by operation of law all assets and assume all liabilities and other legal relationships of MES. The merging companies (i.e.  MFE and MES) belong to the Mediaset group. In particular  (i) MFE is the holding company of the group  and (ii) MES is a direct subsidiary of MFE  which currently owns shares representing approximately 82.917% of MES' share capital (and 82.917% of its voting rights  taking into account the treasury shares currently held by MES (2 MES shares)). From a strategic  operational and industrial perspective  the Merger is aimed at strategically and operationally integrating the merging companies  which  until now  have been operating autonomously in their respective territorial areas  resulting in the creation of a pan-European media and entertainment group which  while maintaining its leading position in its domestic markets  will acquire a superior competitive dimension and the potential to expand into certain countries throughout Europe. Combined sustainable capital structure and strong cash flow generation profile would provide MFE with the required firepower to play a pivotal role in the context of a possible future consolidation scenario in the European video media industry. A segregation (segregaci√≥n) by MES of its assets and liabilities  including its shareholdings in other companies  except for part of MES' cash and all its shareholding in ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE and the financial transactions relating to such shareholding  to Grupo Audiovisual Mediaset Espa√±a Comunicaci√≥n  S.A. (""GA Mediaset"") - a Spanish wholly-owned direct subsidiary of MES - in exchange for the allotment to MES of all the new shares in GA Mediaset that will be issued as a consequence of its share capital increase triggered by the segregation (the ""Preliminary Reorganisation"") is envisaged to be completed prior to the effectiveness of the Merger  aimed at maintaining all the operations and business activities of MES in Spain. Listing and trading on Euronext Milan of the new MFE Shares A to be allotted in the context of the Merger to service the exchange ratio is envisaged to occur on or about the Merger effective date. MFE will not publish any prospectus for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market  and repealing Directive 2003/71/EC (the ""Prospectus Regulation"") in respect of the New MFE Shares A to be issued as part of the Merger  nor for their admission to trading on Euronext Milan which will be requested by MFE  as MFE has opted to rely on the exemptions for the mergers or divisions set out in Article 1  Sections 4.g) and 5.f) of the Prospectus Regulation  and will publish separately on its website (www.mfemediaforeurope.com) an exemption document for purposes hereof  prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/528 of 16 December 2020 supplementing the Prospectus Regulation as regards the minimum information content of the document to be published for a prospectus exemption in connection with a takeover by means of an exchange offer  a merger or a division (the ""Exemption Document""). Additionally  MFE will apply for admission to listing of all the MFE Shares A on the Spanish Stock Exchanges  as soon as possible within a period of three months from the completion of the Merger  so that the MFE Shares A will be dually listed both in Euronext Milan and the Spanish Stock Exchanges. 4 Exchange ratio : Based on several valuation methodologies and valuation references for both MFE and MES shares (as referred to in the board report to the common-cross border merger plan in relation to the Merger)  the share exchange ratio that has been agreed amounts to seven (7) MFE Shares A  of the same characteristics and with the same rights as the existing MFE Shares A at the time of their allotment  for each share held in MES (i.e.  one (1) share held in MES) (the ""Exchange Ratio""). The exchange will be attended with newly issued MFE Shares A of MFE. According to the agreed Exchange Ratio  all MES shareholders will be entitled to receive a whole number of MFE Shares A. Therefore  no fractions will be generated and no fractional MFE Shares A shall be allotted to any holder of shares of MES. Merger effective date : Subject to the completion of the pre-merger formalities and the satisfaction (or the waiver  as the case may be) of the conditions precedent  as described in item (vi) below  the Merger shall be implemented in accordance with Section 2:318 of the DCC and  as such  will become effective at 00:00 a.m. CET (Central European Time) on the day following the day on which the deed of merger (the ""Merger Deed"") is executed before a civil law notary officiating in the Netherlands. It is envisaged that the Merger will become effective during the second quarter of 2023  subject to the satisfaction -or waiver- of the conditions precedent and fulfilment of all pre-merger formalities. Conditions precedent of the Merger : The completion of the Merger by way of execution of the Merger Deed is subject to the satisfaction (or the waiver) of the following conditions precedent: The Preliminary Reorganisation shall have been completed  for which purposes  among others  the SETID (Spanish State Secretariat for Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure  part of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation) shall have authorised or  as the case may be  expressly confirmed that no authorisation is required for the transfer of (i) the audio-visual communication licenses and (ii) the radioelectric concessions inherent to such audio-visual communication licenses  currently held by MES to GA Mediaset; The completion of all the formalities (including the publication of the Exemption Document) required for the start of trading of the MFE Shares A  which are to be allotted to MES shareholders upon the effectiveness of the Merger  on Euronext Milan; No governmental entity of a competent jurisdiction shall have enacted  issued  promulgated  enforced or executed any order which prohibits the completion of the Merger or makes it void or extremely burdensome; and 5 This is an excerpt of the original content.

The Ebusco 3.0 12-meter and 18-meter will be made available as of March 2023 at the UGAP  for a contract period of 24 months  with options for extended contract time.The Union des Groupements d'Achats Publics  UGAP  is the only generalist public procurement agency in France and offers more than one million products  including electric vehicles.UGAP provides public buyers with its procurement expertise and offers a wide range of products and services selected in compliance with the Public Procurement Code. All public buyers who contact UGAP are exempt from their advertising and competitive bidding obligations. The customers of the central purchasing agency can therefore have immediate access to its entire offer with a simple order form.France is a strategically important market for Ebusco as one of the key target countries supporting the international expansion strategy. The French bus market is the largest bus market in Europe and has a relatively low current zero emission penetration. Ebusco will service the French market with locally built buses from its manufacturing facility in the Metropole Rouen which is expected to become operational by the end of 2023.To support the UGAP catalogue addition  Ebusco will further step up its marketing and sales activities in France in the coming year. Amongst the planned activities are a dedicated Ebusco 3.0 roadshow in France and attendance at multiple exhibitions. These events will allow Ebusco to showcase the innovative and low weight design of the Ebusco 3.0 which has proven to lead to significantly lower energy consumption and range while also offering superior drivability and safety features.Peter Bijvelds  CEO of Ebusco comments: ""We are proud and honoured to be selected by UGAP and it is clearly an important strategic step to expand our footprint in France. We are looking forward to presenting our innovative Ebusco 3.0 to all French municipalities that are aiming to lower the regions carbon footprint through the deployment of zero-emission public transport.""Jean Francois Chiron  Managing Director France at Ebusco comments: ""To be referenced with UGAP is really a big step forward for our implementation in France. This contract award  which complements our industrial establishment in the Rouen metropolis  is a concrete expression of Ebusco's global development strategy in which France has a special place.

These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficult breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ‚Äúdiuretic-resistant‚Äù patient population.Story continuesalfapump¬Æ and DSR¬Æ are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.
