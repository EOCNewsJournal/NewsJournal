Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)° is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)° is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

Any proposals from the board of directors  the shareholders’ committee or shareholders9.a.

DKK 5 675 933 with right of pre-emption for the bank’s existing shareholders. The capital increase shall be fully paid up in cash. The capital increase may be below the market price. This authorisation shall apply until 28 February 2028.”Art. 2b:“The general meeting has decided to authorise the board of directors to increase the share capital in one or more rounds by up to nom.

The capital increase shall be fully paid up at the market price ascertained by the board of directors.

Details regarding registration and procedures for electronic attendance will be made available on the bank’s website and in the notice of the relevant general meeting.”and the existing paragraph 2 will be a new paragraph 3.The reason for the proposal is that the board of directors wants the articles of association to provide a possibility of holding general meetings electronically in future.

The 0% p.a. management fee offering on the CoinShares Physical Ethereum ETP reflects this commitment to trust  transparency  and fairness towards investors.Reducing the management fees to 0% positions CoinShares to capitalise on the upcoming Shanghai Hard Fork  officially planned by the Ethereum Foundation for March 2023. This update will enable ETH stakers to unlock their staked ETH and finally receive the staking rewards they have accumulated. The Shanghai Hard Fork will bring liquidity to Ethereum as the cryptocurrency units currently staking on the Beacon chain will be released for trading. As a result  CoinShares will be able to provide both liquidity and staking rewards to its investors in the CoinShares Physical Ethereum ETP. Reducing the management fees to 0% is a strategic move that allows CoinShares’ investors to anticipate this significant moment for the Ethereum blockchain.Unlike most of its competitors  CoinShares already shares the revenue from the staking rewards of its staked ETPs (Polygon  Tezos  Polkadot  Cosmos  etc.) with its investors and charges no management fees. This new offering provides investors with a unique opportunity to gain exposure to Ethereum without incurring additional fees  and helps them prepare to benefit from the unlock of staking rewards in 2023.Story continues""At CoinShares  we are dedicated to offering our investors access to transparent  fair  and reliable investment opportunities in digital assets "" said Jean-Marie Mognetti  CEO of CoinShares. ""The 0% management fee offering on the CoinShares Physical Ethereum ETP is a reflection of our commitment to accessibility and transparency  key factors in achieving mass adoption of digital assets. We are pleased to provide our investors with the opportunity to gain exposure to Ethereum without incurring additional fees in anticipation of the significant Shanghai update on the Ethereum blockchain.""The affected security  CoinShares Physical Ethereum  is listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange  Xetra in Germany  and Euronext in France and the Netherlands.CoinShares Physical EthereumTickers: ETHE / CETHISIN: GB00BLD4ZM24WKN: A3GQ2NManagement Fee: Reduced to 0.0% p.a for such period of time until the Issuer  at its sole discretion  decides to end the fee holiday  which will be announced via a registered information service.ABOUT COINSHARESCoinShares is the leading European digital asset manager that delivers a broad range of financial services across investment management  trading  securities  and consumer products to a wide array of clients that includes corporations  financial institutions  and individuals.

Revenue reported in the 2021-2022 consolidated income statement therefore excludes these ""discontinued operations""  according to the IFRS standards.The Bonduelle Group's revenue for the 1st half of financial year 2022-2023 amounted to € 1 243.4 million  compared with € 1 094.6 million for the 1st half of the previous financial year which represents a growth of +13.6% at current exchange rates and +6.1% on a like for like basis* with favorable currency variations boosting sales growth by +7.5%.The growth of the 2nd quarter revenue shows an acceleration compared to the 1st quarter at +16.0% at current exchange rates and +7.6% on a like for like basis*.Activity by Geographic RegionTotal Consolidated Revenue(in € millions) 1st HY2022-2023 1st HY2021-2022 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis* 2nd Quarter2022-2023 2nd Quarter2021-2022 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis* Europe Zone 739.1 663.8 11.4% 12.3% 390.5 343.3 13.7% 14.8% Non-Europe Zone 504.2 430.8 17.0% -3.4% 281.6 236.3 19.2% -2.9% Total 1 243.4 1 094.6 13.6% 6.1% 672.1 579.6 16.0% 7.6%Activity by Operating SegmentsTotal Consolidated Revenue(in € millions) 1st HY2022-2023 1st HY2021-2022 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis* 2nd Quarter2022-2023 2nd Quarter2021-2022 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis* Canned 597.1 490.0 21.9% 14.1% 357.0 284.9 25.3% 15.9% Frozen 138.5 118.2 17.2% 16.6% 76.9 64.6 19.0% 18.2% Fresh processed 507.7 486.4 4.4% -4.4% 238.2 230.0 3.5% -5.6% Total 1 243.4 1 094.6 13.6% 6.1% 672.1 579.6 16.0% 7 6%Europe ZoneThe Europe Zone representing 59.4% of the business activity over the period  posted an overall growth of +11.4% at current exchange rates and +12.3% on a like for like basis* over the 1st half of the year  with all technologies showing growth over the period.The variations for the 2nd quarter were respectively +13.7% and +14.8%  accelerating compared to the 1st quarter.The policy of price increase intended to partially compensate for inflations in production costs continues  particularly in canned and frozen activities. A limited decline in volumes over the period was noted. This is explained by the quotas applied to certain products following a deficit harvest.The frozen activity showed positive volume growth both in food service  which is continuing its post-covid recovery  and in retail (success of recent innovations launched  in particular under the Cassegrain brand).The ready-to-use fresh segment (salad bags and processed)  where cost increases  and therefore price increases  are more limited  showed growth in value and a stability in volumes. Supply difficulties and less dynamic markets in salads were offset over the period by a particularly dynamic summer season in processed segment.Story continuesNon-Europe ZoneThe Non-Europe Zone revenue representing 40.6% of the business activity in the 1st half year  posted +17.0% at current exchange rates and -3.4% on a like for like basis*. Variations for the 2nd quarter were respectively +19.2% and -2.9%.In an uncertain geopolitical context  the Eurasia zone posted higher revenue (canned and frozen)  linked to price increases  with volumes in this area slightly down on the previous year.In North America  the ready-to-use fresh segment declined over the period  impacted on the one hand by the loss of contracts in the 2nd half of financial year 2021-2022  by a salad segment that was itself in decline  and on the other hand by an agronomic crisis affecting salad yields in the Salinas region  generating a significant shortage of products and a rise in purchase prices. In this context  the Bonduelle Group decided to adapt its manufacturing set up on the East Coast of the United States to the expected level of activity and refocused on profitable business segments (see below).Other significant informationAdaptation of the American industrial set upIn order to improve its competitiveness in the ready-to-use fresh produce market in the United States and to refocus its activity on its valued segments  the Bonduelle Group is adapting the industrial structure of its activity on the East Coast of the United States.Thus  the manufacturing activities in Florence (New Jersey) will be merged in the coming months with the Swedesboro site  also in New Jersey. This operation aims to optimize the production of all products for customers nationally  while achieving gains in efficiency and coverage of fixed costs.The current Florence site will be converted into a warehouse for the East Coast  maintaining these jobs on the site and all current Florence production workers will be offered a position in Swedesboro. The financial impact of this reorganization will be recorded in the 2022-2023 fiscal year under non-recurring items  which will be specified when the half-year results are presented.OutlookIn a particularly uncertain environment  the achievement of the group’s objectives in terms of business growth and profitability for financial year 2022-2023  which will be specified during the half year presentation  will remain dependent both on the dynamics of consumption which are difficult to predict and on price increases  once again essential to compensate changes in certain components of the cost price  in particular agricultural materials.* at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis. The revenues in foreign currency over the given period are translated into the rate of exchange for the comparable period. The impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments is restated as follows:For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period  revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded. In the specific case of the loss of control of the long life activities in North America  the IFRS 5 standard having been applied to the historical data  the revenue is already restated in the historical elements;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year  revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.Alternative performance indicators : the group presents in its financial notices performance indicators not defined by accounting standards.

17561,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://qz.com/on-brexits-third-anniversary-the-uk-has-more-reasons-t-1850058294,On Brexit's third anniversary  the UK has more reasons to regret it than ever,The last day of January 2020 was the UK’s last day as a member of the European Union. Though many people didn’t know it yet  covid-19 was around the corner. The combined effect of both the pandemic and Brexit  compounded by the wider regional and global impac…,The last day of January 2020 was the UK’s last day as a member of the European Union. Though many people didn’t know it yet  covid-19 was around the corner. The combined effect of both the pandemic and Brexit  compounded by the wider regional and global impacts of Russia’s attack on Ukraine  have led to the situation today: Frustration and regret.A UK that may have gained more independence  but has lost crucial workers and markets that supported its economy. A country with a health service  transport network  and education system experiencing coordinated strikes by employees furious with the government’s handling of everything from pay in hard times  to the very right to strike itself. A government riven by scandal  leadership change  and financial mismanagement  all of which is undermining public confidence. And a public who made a choice back in the 2016 referendum on EU membership  and increasingly wish they’d made a different one.AdvertisementJobs  strikes  and payMany of those who campaigned and voted for Brexit talked about the need to protect jobs. Unregulated migration from the EU had pushed down wages and muscled British people out of jobs in sectors like agriculture  building  and healthcare  the argument went.Seven years on from the vote and three from the ultimate severance of ties with the EU  the UK is going through something of an employment poly- crisis. On the one hand  staff who had kept the National Health Service afloat through years of underfunding have moved back to other European countries  and nurses—who took part in unprecedented strikes last month—doctors  and ambulance staff say hospitals are desperately understaffed to the point of endangering lives.Strikes have also affected train services for the past several months  as well as university teachers  and now school teachers  leading to the closure of hundreds of schools across the country. Many of the strikes focus on pay  which workers say hasn’t kept in line with inflation; perhaps unsurprising  given that inflation rose above 11% in the UK in October 2022  before falling slightly (but remaining over 10%). The government  meanwhile  is arguing that a shortage of workers is the problem. Labor shortages  in many countries  are pushing wages up  they say. That leads to inflation  which will only be st oked by giving public sector workers enough of a pay raise to support their current standard of living.While it’s certainly true that other economies are experiencing tighter labor markets  the reasons behind that tightening are to at least some degree local and specific. In the UK  Brexit has potentially sucked thousands of people out of the labor market in the last few years—including EU citizens who have left  those who might have come but didn’t  and UK or other citizens who have decided they prefer to work elsewhere.AdvertisementIn 2016  before the referendum  EU citizens made up between 59% and 77% of all migrants to the UK  according to the the Migration Observatory at Oxford University. That began to fall as soon as the UK voted to leave  and during the pandemic in 2020 led to 94 000 more EU citizens moving away from the UK than to it. This might have bounced back post-pandemic  but the enactment of Brexit at the end of that year put up barriers to prevent it. (Net migration to the UK has still risen in most years since 1991  and was in fact unusually high in 2022  but for specific factors  Migration Observatory said  including the war in Ukraine and a visa scheme for people from Hong Kong.)Immigration  refugees  and small boatsCurbing immigration was also an explicit factor in the rhetoric of the Brexiteer camp. Some of this was expressed in relation to jobs  as discussed  some to more amorphous cultural issues  and some of it was explicitly racist: Anger and fear directed at people from different countries and specifically different ethnic groups than the white British majority.Europe has been experiencing an intense refugee crisis for years  particularly fueled by conflicts in which the West has intervened militarily  including in Afghanistan  Iraq  Syria  and Somalia. Insulated by being an island  the UK has a relatively tiny number of refugees and asylum-seekers. Asylum applications peaked at just over 84 000 in 2002 before falling dramatically and staying much lower than that every year to date. In 2021 and 2022  however  the number of people crossing the channel from France in small boats—a deeply dangerous and often fatal route—has risen dramatically. A total of 185 000 have crossed to the UK in small boats over time  most in the last three years  according to UK government figures. In 2022  at least 40 died making the attempt.Brexit has not in itself solved the perceived problem of migration to the UK  or of people seeking asylum; only flows of people have changed  and with the changes different problems have arisen both for the country and for individuals.AdvertisementHow has Brexit affected the rest of the UK economy?When it comes to a whole economy  of course it’s possible to find data points to support different theories  to interpret data in different ways. In December 2022  Stéphane Boujnah  CEO of Euronext  Europe’s largest stock exchange group  told Bloomberg that London had lost its place as Europe’s financial center because of Brexit. He cited the data point that primary listings in France  as measured by total market capitalization  had overtaken those in the UK in the previous month. That’s far from definitive proof that London is losing its financial-world status. It’s certainly possible to point to ways in which the UK economy is doing well  and also to point out that problems the country is experiencing—such as high inflation and soaring energy prices—are also happening elsewhere (though they are particularly bad in the UK.)But it’s certainly also true that these are tough times to be a UK citizen  whether you’re someone on low income struggling to afford food and heat  a homeowner watching mortgage payments skyrocket  or an older person dependent on a crumbling NHS or underfunded social care system. Thus far  it’s hard to see the bright spots of Brexit.What does the UK public think about Brexit now?On Tuesday  data from Transparency International pointed to one of the biggest declines in public confidence in UK institutions since the anti-corruption group began keeping records. The UK fell from 11th place in the world for perceived corruption in 2021 to 18th place in 2023  with those surveyed pointing to multiple government scandals. Brexit wasn’t mentioned in the Transparency report  and may not have featured in the score; but it’s certainly been a big feature of the last seven years for the Conservative Party  which has been in power throughout. The party’s former leader  Boris Johnson  won office on a Brexit platform—and saw it through—before eventually having to resign because a series of scandals undermined the trust of his own party.Johnson was followed by a short stint in power for Liz Truss  who crashed the economy with a disastrous mini-budget of unfunded tax cuts in October 2022. Then came Rishi Sunak  one of whose most recent acts has been to sack his party chairman for breaking the ministerial code.AdvertisementBrexit  in these conditions  has never been more unpopular  with data from non-profit What UK Thinks  which collated a number of polls  suggesting more people now regret the decision than ever.,negative,0.0,0.0,0.99,mixed,0.03,0.05,0.91,True,English,"['third anniversary', 'Brexit', 'UK', 'reasons', 'employment poly- crisis', 'past several months', 'amorphous cultural issues', 'intense refugee crisis', 'white British majority', 'National Health Service', 'different ethnic groups', 'tighter labor markets', 'other European countries', 'public sector workers', 'last three years', 'UK government figures', 'European Union', 'Labor shortages', 'many countries', 'other economies', 'other citizens', 'different countries', 'last day', 'combined effect', 'wider regional', 'global impacts', 'transport network', 'education system', 'hard times', 'leadership change', 'financial mismanagement', 'public confidence', 'ultimate severance', 'one hand', 'train services', 'university teachers', 'school teachers', 'current standard', 'Oxford University', 'specific factors', 'visa scheme', 'Hong Kong', 'small boats', 'explicit factor', 'Brexiteer camp', 'fatal route', 'different problems', 'data points', 'Unregulated migration', 'Migration Observatory', 'Net migration', 'crucial workers', 'British people', 'EU membership', 'EU citizens', 'most years', 'Curbing immigration', 'tiny number', 'Asylum applications', 'coordinated strikes', 'unprecedented strikes', 'many people', 'pay raise', 'UK economy', 'January', 'covid', 'corner', 'pandemic', 'Russia', 'attack', 'Ukraine', 'situation', 'Frustration', 'regret', 'independence', 'country', 'employees', 'handling', 'everything', 'right', 'scandal', 'choice', '2016 referendum', 'Advertisement', 'Jobs', 'need', 'wages', 'sectors', 'agriculture', 'building', 'healthcare', 'argument', 'vote', 'ties', 'something', 'staff', 'underfunding', 'nurses', 'part', 'doctors', 'hospitals', 'lives', 'hundreds', 'schools', 'line', 'inflation', 'October', 'living', 'reasons', 'tightening', 'thousands', 'migrants', 'enactment', 'barriers', 'war', 'refugees', 'rhetoric', 'relation', 'Anger', 'fear', 'conflicts', 'West', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'Syria', 'Somalia', 'island', 'asylum-seekers', 'date', 'channel', 'France', 'total', 'attempt', 'perceived', 'flows', 'changes', 'individuals', 'rest', '11', '94,000']",2023-02-01,2023-02-02,qz.com

EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE AGENDA OF THE EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS OF MFE-MEDIAFOREUROPE N.V. Item 2 - Proposal to cancel MFE Shares A held by MFE (voting item) On 20 July 2022  the Company announced to the market  pursuant to article 2 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) no. 1052/2016 of 8 March 2016  that on 19 July 2022  the Board of Directors of MFE (the ""Board"") had resolved upon the launch of a share buyback programme under article 5 of Regulation (EU) no. 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 and aimed at reducing the share capital of MFE (the ""Programme"")  on the basis of  and in accordance with  the authorization granted to the Board by the Company's General Shareholders' Meeting held on 29 June 2022. The Programme started on 25 July 2022. On 30 November 2022  the Company announced to the market that  at the date thereof  the final term for the execution of the Programme had expired and  therefore  that the Programme was concluded. From the beginning of the Programme (i.e.  25 July 2022) to its conclusion (i.e.  30 November 2022)  88 707 693 ordinary shares A in the capital of MFE (the ""MFE Shares A"") (representing 0.66% of MFE's aggregate nominal outstanding share capital and 5.81% of all the MFE Shares A issued at the date hereof) had been purchased under the Programme for a total consideration of EUR 32 636 244.12. As a result of the transactions carried out until the end of the Programme  considering the ordinary shares B in the capital of MFE (the ""MFE Shares B"") already held by the Company  MFE holds (i) 88 707 693 MFE Shares A and (ii) 38 627 313 MFE Shares B. It is now proposed  in accordance with the scope of the Programme  to cancel 88 707 693 MFE Shares A as repurchased by MFE under the Programme  and to reduce the issued share capital accordingly. This decision will only take effect after the relevant legal procedure for capital reduction will be completed. As a result of the execution of the above-mentioned resolutions and following completion of the aforementioned legal procedure  the MFE Shares A issued by MFE will decrease from 1 526 279 035 to 1 437 571 342 and the outstanding share capital of MFE will decrease from EUR 800 313 280.50 to EUR 794 990 818.92. The activities and procedures for the cancellation of the 88 707 693 treasury MFE Shares A (and the concurrent capital decrease) under applicable Dutch laws will be carried out simultaneously with the Merger and are envisaged to be completed prior to the date on which the Merger will be effective. The purpose of the cancellation is primarily a desire to clean up the capital structure and comply with the scope of the Programme resolved by the Board on 20 July 2022 and announced to the market; there is no (other) destination for the repurchased shares.

MFE Shares A and MFE Shares B are both listed on the Italian regulated market Euronext Milan  managed and organised by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (""Euronext Milan""). Absorbed company : MEDIASET ESPAÑA COMUNICACIÓN  S.A. a public limited company (sociedad anónima) incorporated under the laws of Spain  with its registered office at Carretera de Fuencarral a Alcobendas 4  28049 Madrid (Spain)  registered with the Commercial Registry of Madrid (Registro Mercantil de Madrid) under volume 33 442  sheet 122  section 8  page M-93 306  and with Spanish tax identification number A-79075438.

MES shares are listed on the Madrid  Barcelona  Bilbao and Valencia Stock Exchanges through the Spanish Automated Quotation System (Sistema de Interconexión Bursátil - Mercado Continuo) (the ""Spanish Stock Exchanges""). The Merger : A cross-border merger by absorption of MES (as absorbed company) with and into MFE (as absorbing company) within the meaning of the provisions of the (a) Directive (EU) 2017/1132 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 relating to certain aspects of company law  which regulations on cross-border mergers of companies are in force (i) for Dutch law purposes under Title 2.7 of the Dutch Civil Code (the ""DCC"")  and (ii) for Spanish law purposes under Chapter II of Title II of Law 3/2009 of 3 April on structural modifications of companies (the ""LME""); and (b) Directive (EU) 2019/2121 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 as regards cross-border conversions  mergers and divisions. 3 As a result of the completion and effectiveness of the Merger described herein  MES will be merged with and into MFE and will cease to exist as a standalone entity  and MFE will acquire under universal title by operation of law all assets and assume all liabilities and other legal relationships of MES. The merging companies (i.e.  MFE and MES) belong to the Mediaset group. In particular  (i) MFE is the holding company of the group  and (ii) MES is a direct subsidiary of MFE  which currently owns shares representing approximately 82.917% of MES' share capital (and 82.917% of its voting rights  taking into account the treasury shares currently held by MES (2 MES shares)). From a strategic  operational and industrial perspective  the Merger is aimed at strategically and operationally integrating the merging companies  which  until now  have been operating autonomously in their respective territorial areas  resulting in the creation of a pan-European media and entertainment group which  while maintaining its leading position in its domestic markets  will acquire a superior competitive dimension and the potential to expand into certain countries throughout Europe. Combined sustainable capital structure and strong cash flow generation profile would provide MFE with the required firepower to play a pivotal role in the context of a possible future consolidation scenario in the European video media industry. A segregation (segregación) by MES of its assets and liabilities  including its shareholdings in other companies  except for part of MES' cash and all its shareholding in ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE and the financial transactions relating to such shareholding  to Grupo Audiovisual Mediaset España Comunicación  S.A. (""GA Mediaset"") - a Spanish wholly-owned direct subsidiary of MES - in exchange for the allotment to MES of all the new shares in GA Mediaset that will be issued as a consequence of its share capital increase triggered by the segregation (the ""Preliminary Reorganisation"") is envisaged to be completed prior to the effectiveness of the Merger  aimed at maintaining all the operations and business activities of MES in Spain. Listing and trading on Euronext Milan of the new MFE Shares A to be allotted in the context of the Merger to service the exchange ratio is envisaged to occur on or about the Merger effective date. MFE will not publish any prospectus for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market  and repealing Directive 2003/71/EC (the ""Prospectus Regulation"") in respect of the New MFE Shares A to be issued as part of the Merger  nor for their admission to trading on Euronext Milan which will be requested by MFE  as MFE has opted to rely on the exemptions for the mergers or divisions set out in Article 1  Sections 4.g) and 5.f) of the Prospectus Regulation  and will publish separately on its website (www.mfemediaforeurope.com) an exemption document for purposes hereof  prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/528 of 16 December 2020 supplementing the Prospectus Regulation as regards the minimum information content of the document to be published for a prospectus exemption in connection with a takeover by means of an exchange offer  a merger or a division (the ""Exemption Document""). Additionally  MFE will apply for admission to listing of all the MFE Shares A on the Spanish Stock Exchanges  as soon as possible within a period of three months from the completion of the Merger  so that the MFE Shares A will be dually listed both in Euronext Milan and the Spanish Stock Exchanges. 4 Exchange ratio : Based on several valuation methodologies and valuation references for both MFE and MES shares (as referred to in the board report to the common-cross border merger plan in relation to the Merger)  the share exchange ratio that has been agreed amounts to seven (7) MFE Shares A  of the same characteristics and with the same rights as the existing MFE Shares A at the time of their allotment  for each share held in MES (i.e.  one (1) share held in MES) (the ""Exchange Ratio""). The exchange will be attended with newly issued MFE Shares A of MFE. According to the agreed Exchange Ratio  all MES shareholders will be entitled to receive a whole number of MFE Shares A. Therefore  no fractions will be generated and no fractional MFE Shares A shall be allotted to any holder of shares of MES. Merger effective date : Subject to the completion of the pre-merger formalities and the satisfaction (or the waiver  as the case may be) of the conditions precedent  as described in item (vi) below  the Merger shall be implemented in accordance with Section 2:318 of the DCC and  as such  will become effective at 00:00 a.m. CET (Central European Time) on the day following the day on which the deed of merger (the ""Merger Deed"") is executed before a civil law notary officiating in the Netherlands. It is envisaged that the Merger will become effective during the second quarter of 2023  subject to the satisfaction -or waiver- of the conditions precedent and fulfilment of all pre-merger formalities. Conditions precedent of the Merger : The completion of the Merger by way of execution of the Merger Deed is subject to the satisfaction (or the waiver) of the following conditions precedent: The Preliminary Reorganisation shall have been completed  for which purposes  among others  the SETID (Spanish State Secretariat for Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure  part of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation) shall have authorised or  as the case may be  expressly confirmed that no authorisation is required for the transfer of (i) the audio-visual communication licenses and (ii) the radioelectric concessions inherent to such audio-visual communication licenses  currently held by MES to GA Mediaset; The completion of all the formalities (including the publication of the Exemption Document) required for the start of trading of the MFE Shares A  which are to be allotted to MES shareholders upon the effectiveness of the Merger  on Euronext Milan; No governmental entity of a competent jurisdiction shall have enacted  issued  promulgated  enforced or executed any order which prohibits the completion of the Merger or makes it void or extremely burdensome; and 5 This is an excerpt of the original content.

In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  February 2  2023. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity”  which include Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity” are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

17585,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artmarket-com-assessing-liquidity-artworks-143300770.html,Artmarket.com: Assessing the liquidity of artworks with Artprice tools (Part 1 of 2),The ease with which an artwork can be traded depends on several factors starting with the supply/demand balance for works by the artist who created it and...,"PARIS  Feb. 2  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The ease with which an artwork can be traded depends on several factors starting with the supply/demand balance for works by the artist who created it and the rarity of the individual piece in question. But  in reality  even a rare masterpiece can turn out to be difficult to sell if there are few collectors able to participate in its auction or if its value is very uncertain. The tools developed by Artprice make it possible to anticipate the different scenarios by identifying the dynamics behind each artist's market  a process that involves identifying all the genuinely similar works by each artist.The values of canvases (65 x 100cm) in Claude Monet’s “Waterloo Bridge” seriesBreakdown of artists by number of lots sold at auction in 2022France's financial markets supervisory authority (the AMF) provides a relatively broad and open definition of the notion of ""liquidity"": A financial asset (stocks  bonds  etc.) is said to be 'liquid' when it can be bought or sold quickly and without its sale having any significant impact on its price. The notion of 'liquidity' therefore reflects the ease with which an asset can be traded. By extension the notion of liquidity is also applied to markets: the more 'liquid' a market is  the easier  faster and cheaper it is to carry out transactions there.www.amf-france.org/fr/espace-epargnants/savoir-bien-investir/cadrer-son-projet/placements-que-savoir-sur-la-liquidite-0But as thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice points out  the liquidity of an artwork cannot be compared to that of a financial asset. The procedure for including a given artwork in an auction catalog can take several weeks or even months  and auction transaction costs can easily reach 20% or even 30%  while galleries may charge even more. That said  among the 803 000 artists listed by Artprice  there are very different market profiles  and these differences usually depend primarily on which way the delicate balance between supply and demand is leaning.Artprice identifies four particularly singular profiles:Story continues1. The ""Great Masters"": a very limited supply with massive demandWhen Da Vinci's Salvator Mundi resurfaced in 2016 (after leaving Geneva's freeport)  few experts were able to predict its price would reach $450 million. Even today  the bidding battle between the two billionaires  one of whom was the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia  Mohammed bin Salman  remains shrouded in mystery. But there can be no doubt that the extreme rarity of Leonardo's works played a key role in the ""uncertainty"" surrounding the work's real market value.Indeed  it is precisely for these extremely sought-after signatures that sales guarantees were initially developed with the objective of reassuring sellers. This mechanism is becoming more systematic today; in the recent sale of the Paul G. Allen collection  all of the pieces are guaranteed by the auctioneer. Among them  a unique painting by Gustave Klimt that had been offered at auction for two years finally sold for $104 million.The markets for works by Grand Masters are surrounded by clusters of works with related attributions ""school of""  ""follower of""  ""circle of""  etc. In November 2022  Christie's in Paris sold a Salvator Mundi ""after Leonardo da Vinci"" for $1.1 million (including fees)  although the work was estimated between $10 000 and $15 000.www.artprice.com/artist/17205/leonardo-da-vinci/painting/28647612/salvator-mundi2. Blue-chip Artists: a regular supply with high demandOn the other hand  works by artists like Picasso and Monet  essentially paintings  are traded in sufficient numbers each year for it to be possible to follow the general evolution of prices. Auctions can always be directly affected by particular events  passionate overspending  or even negative circumstances  but the value of works by these artists generally follows a relatively mechanical logic based on the most recent results for similar pieces.The Artprice100© index is focused on such signatures  and while their prices have generally soared over the past twenty years  fractionalization solutions make it possible to invest in their works without having to pay the full acquisition price (via financial participation).Some of these artists have also produced drawings and prints  and in some cases in large quantities  and these works allow collectors to acquire 'smaller' pieces that can also become very valuable. In March 2022 an etching by Pablo Picasso titled Le repas frugal (1904) crossed the $8 million threshold for the first time.www.artprice.com/artist/22796/pablo-picasso/print-multiple/26211054/le-repas-frugal3. Local Artists: an abundant supply with limited demandAs regards the lesser-known signatures in art history  the art auction market offers an abundant and extremely diversified range of works from almost every artistic period and movement (even if 'art history' per se is still largely dominated by white artists).For many of these signatures  more or less modest sales tend to occur in a single country or sometimes in a particular region. This may be because the demand is concentrated in one place  or because the results are generally higher there  or for simply historical reasons the works of these artists are offered for sale by auction houses that have become specialized in their works.For example  no less than 124 works by the German artist Hans Von Faber du Faur (1863-1940)  son of Otto Von Faber du Faur  were sold in 2022 for an average price of $200  to which were added 89 unsold lots. However  they were all offered in a single session hosted online on 14 July 2022 by the German auctioneer  Michael Zeller.4. Confidential Artists: a limited supply with little demandArtprice recorded a historic record number of art auction transactions in 2022: more than 1 million lots attributed to more than 170 000 artists. Of these  34 000 artists had one or more works offered at auction  but none reached the reserve price. In addition  more than two-thirds of all artists whose works were offered at auction in 2022 only appeared between one and five times. Unfortunately  this frequency is too low to calculate with any confidence the evolution of their prices.Nevertheless  it is sometimes among these signatures  a little out of fashion or forgotten  that the most amazing rediscoveries are made. This category also includes young visual artists who have not yet experienced their moment of glory.Using these four very different profiles  Artprice can begin the process of calculating the liquidity of artists on the art market. This parameter should be of interest to all collectors for whom the liquidity of works is of some importance  as well as to all users of new platforms offering solutions for financial investment solely in art.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image1-claude-monet-values-of-canvases-waterloo-bridge-series.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image2-breakdown-of-artists-lots-sold-at-auction-2022.png]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket.comArtmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Resolution on the number of members of the Board of DirectorsThe Board’s Nomination and Governance Committee proposes that the number of members of the Board be the current nine (9).13. Election of members of the Board of DirectorsThe Board of Directors’ Nomination and Governance Committee proposes to the Annual General Meeting of UPM-Kymmene Corporation that the following incumbent directors be re-elected to the Board: Henrik Ehrnrooth  Emma FitzGerald  Jari Gustafsson  Piia-Noora Kauppi  Topi Manner  Marjan Oudeman  Martin à Porta and Kim Wahl. The Nomination and Governance Committee further proposes that Pia Aaltonen-Forsell be elected as a new director to the Board. The directors will be elected for a one-year term and their term of office will end upon closure of the next Annual General Meeting. All director nominees have given their consent to the election.Björn Wahlroos has announced that he is not available for re-election.The new director nominee Pia Aaltonen-Forsell (born 1974) is a Finnish citizen and holds a Master’s degree in Social Science (Economics) from University of Helsinki and a Master’s degree in Business and Administration (MBA) from University of Reading  Henley Business School. Aaltonen-Forsell has been the Chief Financial Officer of Outokumpu Oyj and member of Outokumpu Leadership team since 2019. Previously she has worked as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Ahlström-Munksjö Oyj 2015-2019  Chief Financial Officer of Vacon Ltd 2013-2015  and in various Senior Vice President  Group Controller and other finance and managerial positions at Stora Enso Oyj 2000-2013. She has also been a member of Uponor Corporation’s Board of Directors since 2017. Ms Aaltonen-Forsell has informed the Company that she will not be available for re-election to Uponor Corporation’s Board of Directors in Uponor Corporation’s Annual General Meeting 2023.The Board of Directors has assessed the director nominees’ independence based on the Finnish Corporate Governance Code’s independence criteria and other factors and circumstances to be taken into account in the overall evaluation and concluded that all director nominees are independent of the Company’s significant shareholders  and that all director nominees are non-executive and independent of the Company. Kim Wahl and Piia-Noora Kauppi  if re-elected  would be non-executive directors for more than 10 consecutive years. However  their independence is not compromised due to their service history  and no other factors or circumstances have been identified that could impair their independence. Mr Wahl has been a member of the Company’s Board of directors since 2012 and Ms Kauppi since 2013.If the Annual General Meeting resolves to elect the Board members in accordance with this proposal  the Board is planning to resolve in its constitutive meeting that Mr Ehrnrooth be appointed as the Board Chairman. Based on the preparations of the Nomination and Governance Committee and having taken into account also the needs for continuity as well as Mr. Ehrnrooth’s time commitments  the Board considers Mr Ehrnrooth to have such ability and professional experience that together with his knowledge of UPM and its businesses form a solid standing for him to lead the Company’s Board and act as the Board Chairman. Given that Mr. Ehrnrooth is the President and CEO of KONE Corporation  the Board was aware of the need to analyse Mr. Ehrnrooth’s capacity to dedicate sufficient time to the responsibilities of the Chair. Board wants to take this opportunity to expound on the rationale of its conclusion.ContinuityThe Company’s long-standing Board Chairman  Mr Wahlroos  announced that the term that commenced on 29 March 2022 will be his last as Chairman (Stock Exchange Release on 29 March 2022). In addition  UPM’s long-standing President and CEO Jussi Pesonen announced that he will exercise his right to retire from UPM during 2024 (Stock Exchange Release on 18 October 2022).Considering the current status of the ongoing strategic projects  growth opportunities and the positive development of the Company  the incumbent Board of Directors considers it essential that the Board Chairman be a longstanding member of UPM’s Board of Directors  with extensive and versatile experience from the Company’s businesses. The Board expects that Mr. Ehrnrooth’s appointment would contribute positively to the continuous effectiveness of the Board.Time commitmentsAs regards Mr Ehrnrooth’s commitment to the Company  the Board has noted first that Mr Ehrnrooth has attended all of the Board and Committee meetings in 2022. He was first elected to the Board in 2015  and during his entire seven-year term he has only been absent from 5 out of 80 meetings (attendance rate 94%). Mr Ehrnrooth has reviewed with the Nomination and Governance Committee his detailed time commitments and his ability to dedicate sufficient time to both his role as the President and CEO of KONE Corporation as well as the anticipated role as the Chairman of UPM. His role as the President and CEO provides deep insight into development of the economic and business environment  which is critical for the role of the Chairman. Furthermore  working closely with Mr Wahlroos as Deputy Chairman at UPM  Mr Ehrnrooth has become acquainted with the workload and requirements of the Chairman. Mr Ehrnrooth has confirmed that he will not accept any new mandates as long as he would hold the role of CEO of KONE and his potential Chairmanship in UPM.Based on the information received from Mr Ehrnrooth and the assessment of the Nomination and Governance Committee  the Board of Directors has concluded that Mr Ehrnrooth has sufficient time for the Chairman role in UPM’s Board.As a conclusion  the Board of Directors has assessed that Mr Ehrnrooth is the best candidate to be appointed for the Company’s Chairman role  if elected to the Board of Directors in the Annual General Meeting 2023.The biographical details of all director nominees are available at www.upm.com/agm2023.14. Resolution on the remuneration of the auditorBased on the proposal prepared by the Audit Committee  the Board proposes that the auditor be elected for the term that will continue until the end of the financial year 2023 and for the financial year 2024  respectively  be paid against invoices approved by the Board’s Audit Committee.15. Election of the auditor for the financial year 2023Based on the proposal prepared by the Audit Committee  the Board proposes that PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy  a firm of authorised public accountants  be re-elected as the Company’s auditor for a term that will continue until the end of the financial year 2023.PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy has notified the Company that Authorised Public Accountant (KHT) Mikko Nieminen would continue as the lead audit partner. Mikko Nieminen has held this position since 4 April 2019.16. Election of the auditor for the financial year 2024The Company has an obligation to organise an audit firm selection procedure in accordance with the EU Audit Regulation (537/2014) concerning the audit for the financial year 2024 (mandatory auditor rotation). To prepare for the mandatory rotation  the Annual General Meeting held on 29 March 2022 resolved on amending the article 8 of the Articles of Association to allow the Annual General Meeting to elect the auditor also in advance for a term of one financial year. The election of an auditor for the financial year 2024 already in this Annual General Meeting would give the elected auditor time to prepare for the new audit engagement.The Board’s Audit Committee has prepared its recommendation in accordance with the EU Audit Regulation and organised a statutory audit firm selection procedure. The Committee has reviewed potential audit firm candidates and identified Ernst & Young Oy and Deloitte Oy as the best candidates for the global audit engagement of the Company. These candidates have been evaluated against a variety of selection criteria such as proposed audit plan and methodology  experience and composition of the audit team  audit quality  and price. The selection process included multiple rounds of information submissions  testing of technological capabilities  interviews and presentations by the candidates as well as external reference checks. After careful consideration based on the selection criteria  Ernst & Young Oy became the Committee's preference and recommended audit firm for the financial year 2024. The Audit Committee confirms that its recommendation is free from influence by a third party and that no clause of the kind referred to in paragraph 6 of Article 16 of the EU Audit Regulation  which would restrict the choice by the Annual General Meeting as regards the appointment of the auditor  has been imposed upon it.Based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee  the Board proposes that Ernst & Young Oy  a firm of authorised public accountants  be elected as the Company’s auditor for the financial year 2024. Ernst & Young Oy has informed the Company that in the event it is elected as the auditor  the lead audit partner will be Authorised Public Accountant (KHT) Heikki Ilkka.Provided that the Annual General Meeting resolves to elect Ernst & Young Oy as the auditor for the financial year 2024  the Board intends in forthcoming Annual General Meetings to continue to make a proposal for the election of the auditor in the same sequence  whereby each Annual General Meeting would elect the auditor for the financial year commencing next after the election.17. Authorising the Board of Directors to resolve on the issuance of shares and special rights entitling to sharesThe Board proposes that the Board be authorised to resolve on the issuance of new shares  transfer of treasury shares and issuance of special rights entitling to shares as follows:The aggregate maximum number of new shares that may be issued and treasury shares that may be transferred is 25 000 000 including also the number of shares that can be received on the basis of the special rights referred to in Chapter 10  Section 1 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act. The proposed maximum number of shares corresponds to approximately 4.7 per cent of the Company’s registered number of shares at the time of the proposal.The new shares and the special rights entitling to shares may be issued and the treasury shares transferred to the Company's shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings in the Company  or in a directed share issue  deviating from the shareholder's pre-emptive subscription right  if there is a weighty financial reason for doing so from the Company’s point of view  such as using the shares as a consideration in potential mergers or acquisitions  to finance investments or other business-related transactions  to develop the Company’s capital structure  or as a part of the Company’s incentive plans.The Board may also resolve on a share issue without payment to the Company itself. In addition  the Board may resolve to issue special rights referred to in Chapter 10  Section 1 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act  which carry the right to receive  against payment  new shares in the Company or treasury shares in such a manner that the subscription price of the shares is paid in cash or by using the subscriber's receivable to offset the subscription price.The new shares may be issued and the treasury shares transferred either against payment or without payment. The directed share issue may be without payment only if there is an especially weighty financial reason for doing so from the Company’s point of view and taking the interests of the Company’s shareholders into consideration.The subscription price of the new shares and the amount payable for the treasury shares shall be recorded in the reserve for invested non-restricted equity.The Board shall resolve on all other matters related to the issuances and transfers of shares and special rights entitling to shares. The authorisation will be valid for 18 months from the date of the resolution of the Annual General Meeting. If this authorisation is granted  it will revoke the authorisation to resolve on the issuance of shares and special rights entitling to shares which was granted to the Board by the Annual General Meeting on 29 March 2022.18. Authorising the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of the Company’s own sharesThe Board proposes that the Board be authorised to resolve on the repurchase of the Company’s own shares as follows:By virtue of the authorisation  the Board may resolve to repurchase a maximum of 50 000 000 of the Company’s own shares. The proposed maximum number of shares corresponds to approximately 9.4 per cent of the Company’s registered number of shares at the time of the proposal.

Resolution on the partial amendment of the Articles of AssociationThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting would resolve to amend article 10 (Notice of the General Meeting of Shareholders) of the Articles of Association to enable holding a general meeting completely without a meeting venue as a so-called remote meeting.The proposal is based on the legislative changes to Chapter 5 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act  which include the possibility to arrange remote general meetings. The legislative changes are based on the premise that shareholder rights shall not be compromised  and that all participating shareholders are able to exercise their full shareholder rights  including the right to vote and to ask questions in real time during the general meeting  irrespective of the chosen general meeting format. The possibility to organise remote general meetings enables the Company to be prepared for rapidly changing conditions in the Company’s operating environment and the society in general  for example due to pandemics. It is important for the Company to have means to offer its shareholders the possibility to exercise their shareholder rights and resolve on any matters presented to a general meeting under any circumstances.The current and proposed new wording of the article 10 of the Articles of Association is available on the Company’s website at www.upm.com/agm2023.20.

Resolution on the number of members of the Board of DirectorsThe Board’s Nomination and Governance Committee proposes that the number of members of the Board be the current nine (9).13. Election of members of the Board of DirectorsThe Board of Directors’ Nomination and Governance Committee proposes to the Annual General Meeting of UPM-Kymmene Corporation that the following incumbent directors be re-elected to the Board: Henrik Ehrnrooth  Emma FitzGerald  Jari Gustafsson  Piia-Noora Kauppi  Topi Manner  Marjan Oudeman  Martin à Porta and Kim Wahl. The Nomination and Governance Committee further proposes that Pia Aaltonen-Forsell be elected as a new director to the Board. The directors will be elected for a one-year term and their term of office will end upon closure of the next Annual General Meeting. All director nominees have given their consent to the election.Björn Wahlroos has announced that he is not available for re-election.The new director nominee Pia Aaltonen-Forsell (born 1974) is a Finnish citizen and holds a Master’s degree in Social Science (Economics) from University of Helsinki and a Master’s degree in Business and Administration (MBA) from University of Reading  Henley Business School. Aaltonen-Forsell has been the Chief Financial Officer of Outokumpu Oyj and member of Outokumpu Leadership team since 2019. Previously she has worked as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Ahlström-Munksjö Oyj 2015-2019  Chief Financial Officer of Vacon Ltd 2013-2015  and in various Senior Vice President  Group Controller and other finance and managerial positions at Stora Enso Oyj 2000-2013. She has also been a member of Uponor Corporation’s Board of Directors since 2017. Ms Aaltonen-Forsell has informed the Company that she will not be available for re-election to Uponor Corporation’s Board of Directors in Uponor Corporation’s Annual General Meeting 2023.The Board of Directors has assessed the director nominees’ independence based on the Finnish Corporate Governance Code’s independence criteria and other factors and circumstances to be taken into account in the overall evaluation and concluded that all director nominees are independent of the Company’s significant shareholders  and that all director nominees are non-executive and independent of the Company. Kim Wahl and Piia-Noora Kauppi  if re-elected  would be non-executive directors for more than 10 consecutive years. However  their independence is not compromised due to their service history  and no other factors or circumstances have been identified that could impair their independence. Mr Wahl has been a member of the Company’s Board of directors since 2012 and Ms Kauppi since 2013.If the Annual General Meeting resolves to elect the Board members in accordance with this proposal  the Board is planning to resolve in its constitutive meeting that Mr Ehrnrooth be appointed as the Board Chairman. Based on the preparations of the Nomination and Governance Committee and having taken into account also the needs for continuity as well as Mr. Ehrnrooth’s time commitments  the Board considers Mr Ehrnrooth to have such ability and professional experience that together with his knowledge of UPM and its businesses form a solid standing for him to lead the Company’s Board and act as the Board Chairman. Given that Mr. Ehrnrooth is the President and CEO of KONE Corporation  the Board was aware of the need to analyse Mr. Ehrnrooth’s capacity to dedicate sufficient time to the responsibilities of the Chair. Board wants to take this opportunity to expound on the rationale of its conclusion.ContinuityThe Company’s long-standing Board Chairman  Mr Wahlroos  announced that the term that commenced on 29 March 2022 will be his last as Chairman (Stock Exchange Release on 29 March 2022). In addition  UPM’s long-standing President and CEO Jussi Pesonen announced that he will exercise his right to retire from UPM during 2024 (Stock Exchange Release on 18 October 2022).Considering the current status of the ongoing strategic projects  growth opportunities and the positive development of the Company  the incumbent Board of Directors considers it essential that the Board Chairman be a longstanding member of UPM’s Board of Directors  with extensive and versatile experience from the Company’s businesses. The Board expects that Mr. Ehrnrooth’s appointment would contribute positively to the continuous effectiveness of the Board.Time commitmentsAs regards Mr Ehrnrooth’s commitment to the Company  the Board has noted first that Mr Ehrnrooth has attended all of the Board and Committee meetings in 2022. He was first elected to the Board in 2015  and during his entire seven-year term he has only been absent from 5 out of 80 meetings (attendance rate 94%). Mr Ehrnrooth has reviewed with the Nomination and Governance Committee his detailed time commitments and his ability to dedicate sufficient time to both his role as the President and CEO of KONE Corporation as well as the anticipated role as the Chairman of UPM. His role as the President and CEO provides deep insight into development of the economic and business environment  which is critical for the role of the Chairman. Furthermore  working closely with Mr Wahlroos as Deputy Chairman at UPM  Mr Ehrnrooth has become acquainted with the workload and requirements of the Chairman. Mr Ehrnrooth has confirmed that he will not accept any new mandates as long as he would hold the role of CEO of KONE and his potential Chairmanship in UPM.Based on the information received from Mr Ehrnrooth and the assessment of the Nomination and Governance Committee  the Board of Directors has concluded that Mr Ehrnrooth has sufficient time for the Chairman role in UPM’s Board.As a conclusion  the Board of Directors has assessed that Mr Ehrnrooth is the best candidate to be appointed for the Company’s Chairman role  if elected to the Board of Directors in the Annual General Meeting 2023.The biographical details of all director nominees are available at www.upm.com/agm2023.14. Resolution on the remuneration of the auditorBased on the proposal prepared by the Audit Committee  the Board proposes that the auditor be elected for the term that will continue until the end of the financial year 2023 and for the financial year 2024  respectively  be paid against invoices approved by the Board’s Audit Committee.15. Election of the auditor for the financial year 2023Based on the proposal prepared by the Audit Committee  the Board proposes that PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy  a firm of authorised public accountants  be re-elected as the Company’s auditor for a term that will continue until the end of the financial year 2023.PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy has notified the Company that Authorised Public Accountant (KHT) Mikko Nieminen would continue as the lead audit partner. Mikko Nieminen has held this position since 4 April 2019.16. Election of the auditor for the financial year 2024The Company has an obligation to organise an audit firm selection procedure in accordance with the EU Audit Regulation (537/2014) concerning the audit for the financial year 2024 (mandatory auditor rotation). To prepare for the mandatory rotation  the Annual General Meeting held on 29 March 2022 resolved on amending the article 8 of the Articles of Association to allow the Annual General Meeting to elect the auditor also in advance for a term of one financial year. The election of an auditor for the financial year 2024 already in this Annual General Meeting would give the elected auditor time to prepare for the new audit engagement.The Board’s Audit Committee has prepared its recommendation in accordance with the EU Audit Regulation and organised a statutory audit firm selection procedure. The Committee has reviewed potential audit firm candidates and identified Ernst & Young Oy and Deloitte Oy as the best candidates for the global audit engagement of the Company. These candidates have been evaluated against a variety of selection criteria such as proposed audit plan and methodology  experience and composition of the audit team  audit quality  and price. The selection process included multiple rounds of information submissions  testing of technological capabilities  interviews and presentations by the candidates as well as external reference checks. After careful consideration based on the selection criteria  Ernst & Young Oy became the Committee's preference and recommended audit firm for the financial year 2024. The Audit Committee confirms that its recommendation is free from influence by a third party and that no clause of the kind referred to in paragraph 6 of Article 16 of the EU Audit Regulation  which would restrict the choice by the Annual General Meeting as regards the appointment of the auditor  has been imposed upon it.Based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee  the Board proposes that Ernst & Young Oy  a firm of authorised public accountants  be elected as the Company’s auditor for the financial year 2024. Ernst & Young Oy has informed the Company that in the event it is elected as the auditor  the lead audit partner will be Authorised Public Accountant (KHT) Heikki Ilkka.Provided that the Annual General Meeting resolves to elect Ernst & Young Oy as the auditor for the financial year 2024  the Board intends in forthcoming Annual General Meetings to continue to make a proposal for the election of the auditor in the same sequence  whereby each Annual General Meeting would elect the auditor for the financial year commencing next after the election.17.

The proposed maximum number of shares corresponds to approximately 4.7 per cent of the Company’s registered number of shares at the time of the proposal.The new shares and the special rights entitling to shares may be issued and the treasury shares transferred to the Company's shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings in the Company  or in a directed share issue  deviating from the shareholder's pre-emptive subscription right  if there is a weighty financial reason for doing so from the Company’s point of view  such as using the shares as a consideration in potential mergers or acquisitions  to finance investments or other business-related transactions  to develop the Company’s capital structure  or as a part of the Company’s incentive plans.The Board may also resolve on a share issue without payment to the Company itself. In addition  the Board may resolve to issue special rights referred to in Chapter 10  Section 1 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act  which carry the right to receive  against payment  new shares in the Company or treasury shares in such a manner that the subscription price of the shares is paid in cash or by using the subscriber's receivable to offset the subscription price.The new shares may be issued and the treasury shares transferred either against payment or without payment. The directed share issue may be without payment only if there is an especially weighty financial reason for doing so from the Company’s point of view and taking the interests of the Company’s shareholders into consideration.The subscription price of the new shares and the amount payable for the treasury shares shall be recorded in the reserve for invested non-restricted equity.The Board shall resolve on all other matters related to the issuances and transfers of shares and special rights entitling to shares.

The proposed maximum number of shares corresponds to approximately 9.4 per cent of the Company’s registered number of shares at the time of the proposal. The authorisation includes also the right to accept the Company’s own shares as a pledge.The Company’s own shares will be repurchased in public trading otherwise than in proportion to the existing shareholdings of the Company’s shareholders  at the market price quoted at the time of purchase  on the trading places where the Company’s shares or certificates entitling to its shares are traded  using the Company’s non-restricted shareholders’ equity. The purchase price for the shares will be paid according to the applicable rules of the trading places where the shares have been repurchased.The shares will be repurchased to be used as a consideration in potential mergers or acquisitions  to finance investments or other business-related transactions  to develop the Company’s capital structure  or as a part of the Company’s incentive plans  or to be retained by the Company as treasury shares  transferred or cancelled.The Board shall resolve on all other matters related to the repurchase of the Company’s own shares. The authorisation will be valid for 18 months from the date of the resolution of the Annual General Meeting. If this authorisation is granted  it will revoke the repurchase authorisation granted to the Board by the Annual General Meeting on 29 March 2022.19. Resolution on the partial amendment of the Articles of AssociationThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting would resolve to amend article 10 (Notice of the General Meeting of Shareholders) of the Articles of Association to enable holding a general meeting completely without a meeting venue as a so-called remote meeting.The proposal is based on the legislative changes to Chapter 5 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act  which include the possibility to arrange remote general meetings. The legislative changes are based on the premise that shareholder rights shall not be compromised  and that all participating shareholders are able to exercise their full shareholder rights  including the right to vote and to ask questions in real time during the general meeting  irrespective of the chosen general meeting format. The possibility to organise remote general meetings enables the Company to be prepared for rapidly changing conditions in the Company’s operating environment and the society in general  for example due to pandemics. It is important for the Company to have means to offer its shareholders the possibility to exercise their shareholder rights and resolve on any matters presented to a general meeting under any circumstances.The current and proposed new wording of the article 10 of the Articles of Association is available on the Company’s website at www.upm.com/agm2023.20.

In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  February 2  2023. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity”  which include Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity” are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

But  in reality  even a rare masterpiece can turn out to be difficult to sell if there are few collectors able to participate in its auction or if its value is very uncertain. The tools developed by Artprice make it possible to anticipate the different scenarios by identifying the dynamics behind each artist's market  a process that involves identifying all the genuinely similar works by each artist.The values of canvases (65 x 100cm) in Claude Monet's “Waterloo Bridge” series[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image1-claude-monet-values-of-canvases-waterloo-bridge-series.png ]Breakdown of artists by number of lots sold at auction in 2022[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image2-breakdown-of-artists-lots-sold-at-auction-2022.png ]France's financial markets supervisory authority (the AMF) provides a relatively broad and open definition of the notion of “liquidity”: A financial asset (stocks  bonds  etc.) is said to be ‘liquid' when it can be bought or sold quickly and without its sale having any significant impact on its price. The notion of ‘liquidity' therefore reflects the ease with which an asset can be traded. By extension the notion of liquidity is also applied to markets: the more ‘liquid' a market is  the easier  faster and cheaper it is to carry out transactions there.www.amf-france.org/fr/espace-epargnants/savoir-bien-investir/cadrer-son-projet/placements-que-savoir-sur-la-liquidite-0But as thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice points out  the liquidity of an artwork cannot be compared to that of a financial asset. The procedure for including a given artwork in an auction catalog can take several weeks or even months  and auction transaction costs can easily reach 20% or even 30%  while galleries may charge even more. That said  among the 803 000 artists listed by Artprice  there are very different market profiles  and these differences usually depend primarily on which way the delicate balance between supply and demand is leaning.Artprice identifies four particularly singular profiles:1. The “Great Masters”: a very limited supply with massive demandWhen Da Vinci's Salvator Mundi resurfaced in 2016 (after leaving Geneva's freeport)  few experts were able to predict its price would reach $450 million. Even today  the bidding battle between the two billionaires  one of whom was the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia  Mohammed bin Salman  remains shrouded in mystery. But there can be no doubt that the extreme rarity of Leonardo's works played a key role in the “uncertainty” surrounding the work's real market value.Indeed  it is precisely for these extremely sought-after signatures that sales guarantees were initially developed with the objective of reassuring sellers. This mechanism is becoming more systematic today; in the recent sale of the Paul G. Allen collection  all of the pieces are guaranteed by the auctioneer. Among them  a unique painting by Gustave Klimt that had been offered at auction for two years finally sold for $104 million.The markets for works by Grand Masters are surrounded by clusters of works with related attributions “school of”  “follower of”  “circle of”  etc. In November 2022  Christie's in Paris sold a Salvator Mundi “after Leonardo da Vinci” for $1.1 million (including fees)  although the work was estimated between $10 000 and $15 000.www.artprice.com/artist/17205/leonardo-da-vinci/painting/28647612/salvator-mundi2. Blue-chip Artists: a regular supply with high demandOn the other hand  works by artists like Picasso and Monet  essentially paintings  are traded in sufficient numbers each year for it to be possible to follow the general evolution of prices. Auctions can always be directly affected by particular events  passionate overspending  or even negative circumstances  but the value of works by these artists generally follows a relatively mechanical logic based on the most recent results for similar pieces.The Artprice100© index is focused on such signatures  and while their prices have generally soared over the past twenty years  fractionalization solutions make it possible to invest in their works without having to pay the full acquisition price (via financial participation).Some of these artists have also produced drawings and prints  and in some cases in large quantities  and these works allow collectors to acquire ‘smaller' pieces that can also become very valuable. In March 2022 an etching by Pablo Picasso titled Le repas frugal (1904) crossed the $8 million threshold for the first time.www.artprice.com/artist/22796/pablo-picasso/print-multiple/26211054/le-repas-frugal3. Local Artists: an abundant supply with limited demandAs regards the lesser-known signatures in art history  the art auction market offers an abundant and extremely diversified range of works from almost every artistic period and movement (even if ‘art history' per se is still largely dominated by white artists).For many of these signatures  more or less modest sales tend to occur in a single country or sometimes in a particular region. This may be because the demand is concentrated in one place  or because the results are generally higher there  or for simply historical reasons the works of these artists are offered for sale by auction houses that have become specialized in their works.For example  no less than 124 works by the German artist Hans Von Faber du Faur (1863-1940)  son of Otto Von Faber du Faur  were sold in 2022 for an average price of $200  to which were added 89 unsold lots. However  they were all offered in a single session hosted online on 14 July 2022 by the German auctioneer  Michael Zeller.4. Confidential Artists: a limited supply with little demandArtprice recorded a historic record number of art auction transactions in 2022: more than 1 million lots attributed to more than 170 000 artists. Of these  34 000 artists had one or more works offered at auction  but none reached the reserve price. In addition  more than two-thirds of all artists whose works were offered at auction in 2022 only appeared between one and five times. Unfortunately  this frequency is too low to calculate with any confidence the evolution of their prices.Nevertheless  it is sometimes among these signatures  a little out of fashion or forgotten  that the most amazing rediscoveries are made. This category also includes young visual artists who have not yet experienced their moment of glory.Using these four very different profiles  Artprice can begin the process of calculating the liquidity of artists on the art market. This parameter should be of interest to all collectors for whom the liquidity of works is of some importance  as well as to all users of new platforms offering solutions for financial investment solely in art.Images:[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image1-claude-monet-values-of-canvases-waterloo-bridge-series.png ][ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image2-breakdown-of-artists-lots-sold-at-auction-2022.png ]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

But  in reality  even a rare masterpiece can turn out to be difficult to sell if there are few collectors able to participate in its auction or if its value is very uncertain. The tools developed by Artprice make it possible to anticipate the different scenarios by identifying the dynamics behind each artist's market  a process that involves identifying all the genuinely similar works by each artist.The values of canvases (65 x 100cm) in Claude Monet’s “Waterloo Bridge” series Breakdown of artists by number of lots sold at auction in 2022France's financial markets supervisory authority (the AMF) provides a relatively broad and open definition of the notion of ""liquidity"": A financial asset (stocks  bonds  etc.) is said to be 'liquid' when it can be bought or sold quickly and without its sale having any significant impact on its price. The notion of 'liquidity' therefore reflects the ease with which an asset can be traded. By extension the notion of liquidity is also applied to markets: the more 'liquid' a market is  the easier  faster and cheaper it is to carry out transactions there.www.amf-france.org/fr/espace-epargnants/savoir-bien-investir/cadrer-son-projet/placements-que-savoir-sur-la-liquidite-0But as thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice points out  the liquidity of an artwork cannot be compared to that of a financial asset. The procedure for including a given artwork in an auction catalog can take several weeks or even months  and auction transaction costs can easily reach 20% or even 30%  while galleries may charge even more. That said  among the 803 000 artists listed by Artprice  there are very different market profiles  and these differences usually depend primarily on which way the delicate balance between supply and demand is leaning.Artprice identifies four particularly singular profiles:1. The ""Great Masters"": a very limited supply with massive demandWhen Da Vinci's Salvator Mundi resurfaced in 2016 (after leaving Geneva's freeport)  few experts were able to predict its price would reach $450 million. Even today  the bidding battle between the two billionaires  one of whom was the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia  Mohammed bin Salman  remains shrouded in mystery. But there can be no doubt that the extreme rarity of Leonardo's works played a key role in the ""uncertainty"" surrounding the work's real market value.Indeed  it is precisely for these extremely sought-after signatures that sales guarantees were initially developed with the objective of reassuring sellers. This mechanism is becoming more systematic today; in the recent sale of the Paul G. Allen collection  all of the pieces are guaranteed by the auctioneer. Among them  a unique painting by Gustave Klimt that had been offered at auction for two years finally sold for $104 million.The markets for works by Grand Masters are surrounded by clusters of works with related attributions ""school of""  ""follower of""  ""circle of""  etc. In November 2022  Christie's in Paris sold a Salvator Mundi ""after Leonardo da Vinci"" for $1.1 million (including fees)  although the work was estimated between $10 000 and $15 000.www.artprice.com/artist/17205/leonardo-da-vinci/painting/28647612/salvator-mundi2. Blue-chip Artists: a regular supply with high demandOn the other hand  works by artists like Picasso and Monet  essentially paintings  are traded in sufficient numbers each year for it to be possible to follow the general evolution of prices. Auctions can always be directly affected by particular events  passionate overspending  or even negative circumstances  but the value of works by these artists generally follows a relatively mechanical logic based on the most recent results for similar pieces.The Artprice100© index is focused on such signatures  and while their prices have generally soared over the past twenty years  fractionalization solutions make it possible to invest in their works without having to pay the full acquisition price (via financial participation).Some of these artists have also produced drawings and prints  and in some cases in large quantities  and these works allow collectors to acquire 'smaller' pieces that can also become very valuable. In March 2022 an etching by Pablo Picasso titled Le repas frugal (1904) crossed the $8 million threshold for the first time.www.artprice.com/artist/22796/pablo-picasso/print-multiple/26211054/le-repas-frugal3. Local Artists: an abundant supply with limited demandAs regards the lesser-known signatures in art history  the art auction market offers an abundant and extremely diversified range of works from almost every artistic period and movement (even if 'art history' per se is still largely dominated by white artists).For many of these signatures  more or less modest sales tend to occur in a single country or sometimes in a particular region. This may be because the demand is concentrated in one place  or because the results are generally higher there  or for simply historical reasons the works of these artists are offered for sale by auction houses that have become specialized in their works.For example  no less than 124 works by the German artist Hans Von Faber du Faur (1863-1940)  son of Otto Von Faber du Faur  were sold in 2022 for an average price of $200  to which were added 89 unsold lots. However  they were all offered in a single session hosted online on 14 July 2022 by the German auctioneer  Michael Zeller.4. Confidential Artists: a limited supply with little demandArtprice recorded a historic record number of art auction transactions in 2022: more than 1 million lots attributed to more than 170 000 artists. Of these  34 000 artists had one or more works offered at auction  but none reached the reserve price. In addition  more than two-thirds of all artists whose works were offered at auction in 2022 only appeared between one and five times. Unfortunately  this frequency is too low to calculate with any confidence the evolution of their prices.Nevertheless  it is sometimes among these signatures  a little out of fashion or forgotten  that the most amazing rediscoveries are made. This category also includes young visual artists who have not yet experienced their moment of glory.Using these four very different profiles  Artprice can begin the process of calculating the liquidity of artists on the art market. This parameter should be of interest to all collectors for whom the liquidity of works is of some importance  as well as to all users of new platforms offering solutions for financial investment solely in art.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image1-claude-monet-values-of-canvases-waterloo-bridge-series.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image2-breakdown-of-artists-lots-sold-at-auction-2022.png]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket.comArtmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

17601,Clearstream,Bing API,https://delano.lu/article/eib-digital-bond-issue-is-mome,EIB digital bond issue is ‘moment for Luxembourg to position itself as blockchain hub’,The European Investment Bank’s latest bond issue via blockchain is a major opportunity for Luxembourg  according to the law firm of Allen & Overy  which advised on the structuring of the transaction.,The European Investment Bank announced on 31 January a fully digital bond issue denominated in sterling. The transaction involves a total of £50 million of securities in denominations of £100 000 with a maturity of two years. The EIB has appointed BNP Paribas Securities Services  HSBC and RBC Capital Markets as joint lead managers.In this architecture  the bonds will be held in digital securities accounts on HSBC’s Orion platform. This platform has two blockchains: a private blockchain that will serve as legal evidence of who holds the securities and a public blockchain to anonymously trace the chain of custody. BNP Paribas Securities Services  RBC Capital Markets and HSBC will act as custodians for investors. All three institutions helped structure the transaction for placement with their clients. While the EIB was advised by Clifford Chance throughout the transaction  the three joint lead managers received legal support from Allen & Overy.One of the objectives was to reach the UK market. Philippe Noeltner   senior associate   Allen & Overy“The particularity of this instrument is that it is denominated in sterling ” commented Philippe Noeltner  senior associate at Allen & Overy  in an interview. “One of the objectives was to reach the UK market.” But while the commercial aspects are British  the security is governed by Luxembourg law and is listed on a Luxembourg platform  the Luxembourg Stock Exchange Securities Official List.A favourable legislative frameworkFrank Mausen  partner at Allen & Overy  described the operation as a “real precedent” in the history of securities issues  in which the country has a role to play. “Luxembourg has two blockchain laws  which create a very favourable framework for such operations. A third blockchain law is still waiting to be passed ” he explained. The two existing laws allow Luxembourg issuers to issue securities directly via a blockchain and to settle them there.This is the moment for the country to position itself as a blockchain hub  just as it became a fund hub in the 1990s. Frank Mausen   partner   Allen & OveryThe third law will make it possible to take security over the securities registered in the blockchain  which can then be used as collateral for other financing operations  for example. “Luxembourg will be one of the only countries on the planet to have such legislation ” Mausen pointed out. “This is the moment for the country to position itself as a blockchain hub  just as it became a fund hub in the 1990s.” It is an opportunity  but France and Germany also have a blockchain regime and other countries such as the UK and Spain are strongly considering it. The Luxembourg authorities have grasped the issue  according to Mausen. Luxembourg’s financial regulator  the CSSF  “has published a position paper which demonstrates the interest of the authorities in creating a favourable ecosystem.”Philipe Noeltner  senior associate at Allen & Overy  and Frank Mausen  partner at Allen & Overy  explain the challenges of the emergence of blockchain-based securities platforms. Photo: Romain GambaThe future will be interoperable or notSpecialising in post-trade activities  Luxembourg has a card to play  observed Noeltner. “It is about the internal plumbing of the capital markets. Blockchain is a technology that can revolutionise this plumbing ” he pointed out  noting that around 40% of the world’s securities are held in the country via Clearstream. “What the players are doing is a bit different today ” he explained. “They are establishing platforms that will compete with Cleastream in other market segments.”Just as there are bridges between the big legacy platforms such as Euroclear  Cleastream and DTCC  the same thing needs to be achieved with blockchain platforms. They need to start communicating with each other so that securities can be transferred between them. Frank Mausen   partner   Allen & OveryNevertheless  the emergence of new platforms based on blockchain technology should not overshadow the importance of interoperability. And this despite the competition issues? “Just as there are bridges between the large historical platforms such as Euroclear  Cleastream and DTCC  the same thing must be achieved with blockchain platforms. They need to start communicating with each other so that securities can be transferred between them ” said Mausen. “You don’t buy a security if your liquidity is reduced  because you can’t sell only on one platform. To attract large investors  securities must be freely transferable between the different systems.” In other words  this is a challenge for the long-term viability and competitiveness of blockchain platforms.Read the original French version of this article on the Paperjam site,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.6,0.12,0.27,True,English,"['EIB digital bond issue', 'blockchain hub', 'moment', 'Luxembourg', 'Luxembourg Stock Exchange Securities Official List', 'The European Investment Bank', 'BNP Paribas Securities Services', 'three joint lead managers', 'original French version', 'two existing laws', 'RBC Capital Markets', 'big legacy platforms', 'digital securities accounts', 'digital bond issue', 'favourable legislative framework', 'other market segments', 'large historical platforms', 'other financing operations', 'two blockchain laws', 'blockchain-based securities platforms', 'third blockchain law', 'three institutions', 'favourable framework', 'third law', 'two years', 'two blockchains', 'other words', 'Luxembourg law', 'favourable ecosystem', 'new platforms', 'blockchain platforms', 'securities issues', 'legal evidence', 'Clifford Chance', 'legal support', 'UK market', 'senior associate', 'commercial aspects', 'real precedent', 'Luxembourg issuers', 'fund hub', 'other countries', 'financial regulator', 'position paper', 'Romain Gamba', 'post-trade activities', 'same thing', 'competition issues', 'large investors', 'different systems', 'long-term viability', 'Paperjam site', 'private blockchain', 'public blockchain', 'blockchain hub', 'blockchain regime', 'The EIB', 'Orion platform', 'Philippe Noeltner', 'Luxembourg platform', 'Philipe Noeltner', 'one platform', 'Frank Mausen', 'Luxembourg authorities', 'internal plumbing', 'blockchain technology', '31 January', 'sterling', 'transaction', 'total', 'denominations', 'maturity', 'HSBC', 'architecture', 'bonds', 'custody', 'custodians', 'placement', 'clients', 'Allen', 'Overy', 'objectives', 'particularity', 'instrument', 'interview', 'security', 'partner', 'history', 'country', 'role', 'moment', '1990s', 'collateral', 'example', 'planet', 'legislation', 'opportunity', 'France', 'Germany', 'Spain', 'CSSF', 'interest', 'emergence', 'Photo', 'future', 'card', 'world', 'Clearstream', 'players', 'Cleastream', 'bridges', 'Euroclear', 'DTCC', 'importance', 'interoperability', 'liquidity', 'competitiveness', 'article']",2023-02-01,2023-02-02,delano.lu

Biophytis announces today final results following the reintegration of data from 54 patients  among 233 patients treated  that were missing in the Top Line analysis released on September 7  2022. The final analysis demonstrates that COVA study met the primary endpoint  with a 44% statistically significant reduction (p = 0.043) in the risk of respiratory failure or early death in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19  in line with positive Post-Hoc analysis released on November 3  2022.Stanislas Veillet  CEO of Biophytis  said: "" The COVA study is positive  with a statistically significant reduction of 44% in the risk of respiratory failure or early death  demonstrating the therapeutic potential of Sarconeos (BIO101) in the treatment of severe COVID-19. This huge success is the result of Biophytis scientific excellence and hard work of the clinical and medical teams involved in the COVA clinical study in France  Belgium  the USA and in Brazil. This is tremendous news for patients worldwide  especially for the elderly with co-morbidities  who are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19  despite the great progress made in vaccination and anti-viral treatments now available. While there is a resurgence of COVID-19 patients in China and still unacceptable levels of patients dying from COVID-19 in Europe  the USA and Brazil  Sarconeos (BIO101) may offer an effective therapeutic option to reduce further the threat of COVID-19 pandemic. We are now accelerating the start of our Early Access Program  with the target to give access to Sarconeos (BIO101) in Brazil and France in the second half of 2023  while preparing for filing conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) in Europe and Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the USA. ""Story continuesBiophytis is nowinitiating key regulatory activities to give access to Sarconeos (BIO101) to hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 at risk of respiratory failure and death in 2023.The strategy to give access to Sarconeos (BIO101) as quickly as possible is to file for Early Access Programs (EAP) in France and Brazil  while filing for conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) in Europe and Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the USA. An EAP has already been approved in 2022 in Brazil to treat COVID-19 patients at critical stage in Intensice Care Units (ICU) and the request to lift the hold given completion of the study and positive results is pending. The filing of the request for starting the EAP program in France is being prepared and will be made in Q1 2023 with the objective to be granted approval in Q2 2023. Requests for pre-submission meetings regarding conditional Marketing Authorisation in Europe and Emergency Use Authorization in the USA are under preparation and will be sent in Q1 2023  targeting an approval later in 2023  depending on feedback from authorities.Biophytis will present the results in detail at the American Thoracic Society conference in Washington  DC  USA in May 2023 and at the European Respiratory Society Lung Science meeting in Estoril  Portugal  in March 2023.Final COVA study resultsThe objective of the study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of Sarconeos (BIO101)  350 mg BID in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypoxemia  at risk of respiratory failure requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation  and death. The proportion of patients and time to respiratory failure or early death were studied at 28 days in the primary analysis  corresponding to the maximum treatment period  with follow-up of mortality and safety for at least 90 days.The 233 treated patients (Intent To Treat  ITT population) were 63 years old on average  64% of the patients were male  recruited in 37 centers in Europe  the US and Brazil between Q3 2020 and Q1 2022  infected with the main SARS-Cov-2 variants.The trial ended early before reaching the 310 patients originally planned  due to stalled recruitment. The sub-population of patients without major protocol deviations (Per Protocol  PP sub-population) included 180 patients with similar baseline demographics and disease characteristics as the ITT population.The study met its pre-defined primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant difference between Sarconeos (BIO101) and placebo in the proportion of patients with respiratory failure or early death at day 28  representing a relative reduction of risk of 44% (p=0.043  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test). Moreover  the analysis of time to respiratory failure or early death had shown significant differences over 28 days in the Kaplan Meier curves for Sarconeos (BIO101) versus placebo (p=0.022). The pre-specified analysis of time to death over the complete follow-up period over 90 days showed that mortality rate with Sarconeos (BIO101) was reduced compared to placebo in the ITT population (p=0.083) and in the PP population (p=0.038). Post hoc Kaplan-Meier analysis released on November 3  2022 confirmed the effect of Sarconeos (BIO101) on the primary endpoint and on mortality at day 90.Sarconeos (BIO101) has a very good safety profile  with a lower proportion of patients with adverse events compared to placebo (57% vs. 64%)  in particular a lower frequency of serious  mostly respiratory  adverse events (25% vs. 31%).About the COVA studyAs a reminder  the COVA clinical study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04472728) is an international  multi-centre  double-blind  placebo-controlled  group-sequential and adaptive two-part study. It is a phase 2-3 study evaluating Sarconeos (BIO101) in patients aged 45 years and older  hospitalised with severe respiratory manifestations of COVID-19. Part 1 of the COVA study is an exploratory Phase 2 proof-of-concept study designed to provide preliminary data on the safety  tolerability and efficacy of Sarconeos (BIO101) in 50 hospitalised patients with severe respiratory failure in patients suffering from COVID-19. Part 2 of the COVA study is a randomised phase 3 study investigating the safety and efficacy of Sarconeos (BIO101) on respiratory function in patients. Due to the evolution of the pandemic  the company decidedin April 2022 to stop enrolment at 238 enrolled patients  below the originally planned number of 310.About BIOPHYTISBiophytis SA is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specialized in the development of therapeutics that are aimed at slowing the degenerative processes associated with aging and improving functional outcomes for patients suffering from age-related diseases  including severe respiratory failure in patients suffering from COVID-19.

Access to data-driven  actionable insights that are projected on the virtual twin of a vehicle offers them innovative ways to balance vehicle design with business.Competitive automotive manufacturers must balance sustainability with regulatory requirements as well as inflation. Highly volatile raw material prices due to armed conflicts  health crises  climate change  consumer demands and other global factors make it difficult to ensure a return on investment when aligning the price of a vehicle with the cost of its parts.In this challenging economic context  the 3DEXPERIENCE platform provides Renault Group with a unique combination of artificial intelligence  machine learning  collaborative business processes and an enriched single 3D data model of the vehicle to better manage the business impacts of market volatility. Renault Group can aggregate equipment designs  configurations  historical data and forecasts  and test different design scenarios in a virtual twin to understand  anticipate  quantify and optimize vehicle price and cost  as well as improve equipment purchasing negotiations by sharing these insights with other stakeholders.“In a previous announcement  we talked about the virtual twin of the car and the entreprise to support the ‘Renaulution’ plan ” said Laurence Montanari  Vice President  Transportation & Mobility Industry  Dassault Systèmes. “Our cost intelligence solution with NETVIBES artificial intelligence has allowed Renault to connect its data across the entreprise in less than six months. Now  we are extending the virtual twin from the vehicle to the supply chain. During this uncertain time  our solutions have given companies the ability to simulate and anticipate impacts due to supply chain shortages or raw material price increases. This project extends the platform’s usage to new business audiences at Renault Group to tackle the new challenges of our decade such as inflation  volatility and regulatory requirements.”Renault Group is using the “Global Modular Architecture” industry solution experience based on the 3DEXPERIENCE platform  which integrates the cost intelligence solution. The cost intelligence solution is also available to companies in other industries that Dassault Systèmes serves.FOR MORE INFORMATIONDassault Systèmes’ 3DEXPERIENCE platform  3D design software  3D Digital Mock Up and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions: http://www.3ds.comConnect with Dassault Systèmes on Twitter  Facebook  LinkedIn  YouTubeABOUT DASSAULT SYSTÈMESDassault Systèmes  the 3DEXPERIENCE Company  is a catalyst for human progress.

(Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today announced its intention to invest around US$100 million in its manufacturing and innovation center in Dongtan  South Korea  by 2025  following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between ASM and the Ministry of Trade  Industry and Energy of the Republic of Korea (‘MOTIE’).This investment will expand ASM’s R&D and product-development infrastructure to meet the needs of technology advances  as well as adding more manufacturing capacity. Korea is a key site for ASM  where some of its most advanced applications are developed – ASM’s ALD gap-fill applications are a recent and successful example. These applications enable next-generation advanced logic and memory devices  which are expected to see increased usage in coming years.“Rapid growth is expected until the end of the decade for semiconductors  and – despite the recent slowing down in the industry – ASM continues to invest for growth ” says Benjamin Loh  CEO of ASM. “This expansion will not only serve our key Korean customers  but all our customers worldwide will benefit from the enabling technologies we develop in Korea.”Lee Chang-yang  Korea's Minister of Trade  Industry and Energy  says: “The intended investment by ASM is expected to contribute greatly to increasing high-tech development in our country  securing a stable semiconductor supply chain  and increasing exports.”Prior to signing the MoU  Minister Lee said that with semiconductor devices getting smaller and smaller  the increased investment in Korea by ASM – with its world-leading ALD technology – would present good cause for the country to ‘exert synergy’ with domestic semiconductor companies. Minister Lee also expressed his willingness to cooperate closely with ASM as part of the Korean government’s policy to foster and support the semiconductor industry.Story continuesDongtan has been instrumental in ASM’s growth  with the facility delivering advanced R&D and technology for customers in Korea and for global customers. Korea is also the global center for ASM’s PEALD business. Technologies developed by ASM’s local R&D team have been at the heart of breakthrough innovations in the semiconductor industry  such as the ALD quad chamber module (QCM) architecture  the TENZATM ALD for ultra-high aspect ratio (>100:1) gap-fill  and high-quality PEALD oxides and nitrides for spacers  liners  and other patterning applications.The expansion of ASM’s Dongtan facility is also required to create more space for the company’s fast-growing number of employees in Korea  and reflects the increasing revenue contribution from the Korean market expected over the next few years.The intended investment will deliver multiple benefits to the local market.

NFL-101 is derived from a subcutaneous desensitization treatment that was developed by the Pasteur Institute against tobacco allergies in tobacco factory workers. Used over the counter by a French doctor on more than 10 000 smokers  the repositioned extract showed promising results in smoking cessation that were supported by a retrospective study. NFL-101 is a standardized version for pharmaceutical use.The study will be conducted by the Pharmacological Neuroimaging team of the CEA. It will focus on following  by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging  the modifications in the cerebral function associated with the development of tobacco addiction in mice  in order to highlight the central effects of NFL-101 treatment in this context. The expected duration of this study is 9 months.Bruno Lafont  Chief Operating Officer and co-founder of NFL Biosciences: ""This research is intended to better understand how NFL-101 can act on tobacco dependence. In the clinical setting  NFL-101 is only administered once or twice  yet current treatments must be administered daily for 3 months. In the case of varenicline (Champix®  Chantix®) treatment starts for three times a day and continues twice a day for many weeks.”For Nicolas Tournier  pharmacologist  radiopharmacist and head of the Pharmacological Neuroimaging team at the CEA: ""This project takes full advantage of the potential of molecular imaging to highlight the effects of drugs on the brain  particularly in the context of the treatment of tobacco addiction. The non-invasive and translational nature of the imaging techniques used could reveal an activity based on communication between the immune system and the central nervous system  different from the modes of action of current smoking cessation drugs that target nicotine receptors.”The results  which may be the subject of a joint scientific publication  will complement the CESTO II and PRECESTO clinical studies with a view to increase the overall attractiveness of NFL-101 to pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in licensing it.About NFL BiosciencesNFL Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company based in the Montpellier area which develops botanical drug candidates for the treatment of addictions. NFL Biosciences' ambition is to bring new  natural  safer and more effective therapeutic solutions to the entire world population  including low- and middle-income countries. Its most advanced product  called NFL-101  is a standardized  nicotine free tobacco leaf extract protected by two patent families.

(NYSE: CLB) (""Core""  ""Core Lab""  or the ""Company"") reported fourth quarter 2022 revenue of $127 600 000. Core's operating income was $15 600 000  with diluted earnings per share (""EPS"") of $0.14  all in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). The financial results for the fourth quarter of 2022 include a non-cash adjustment of $1 900 000  decreasing stock compensation expense associated with performance share awards that vested during the quarter. Operating income  ex-items  a non-GAAP financial measure  was $14 700 000  yielding operating margins of 12%  and EPS  ex-items  of $0.20. A full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures is included in the attached financial tables.For 2022  Core's revenue of $489 700 000 increased 4% from the prior year. Core's full-year revenue was adversely impacted by the devaluation of the Euro and British Pound when translated into U.S. dollars. Using a constant U.S. dollar exchange rate  2022 revenue would have been approximately $12 800 000 higher. In addition  Core's 2022 revenue was also adversely impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Across Core's European  Russian and Ukrainian operations  activity declined due to disruptions in crude-oil trading patterns  causing the Company's crude-oil assay and derived product testing revenue and product sales to decline in excess of $10 000 000 year-over-year. The combined impact of these currency fluctuations and geopolitical factors adversely impacted 2022 revenue by approximately $22 800 000 year-over-year  substantially offsetting international growth in other regions.Story continuesCore's CEO  Larry Bruno stated  ""First  our thoughts remain with our Ukrainian employees and their families during the on-going conflict. Despite the challenges posed by currency and geopolitical conflict  Core's results during the fourth quarter of 2022 displayed continued positive momentum  as we achieved sequential improvement in revenue  operating income  operating margins and EPS  with strong incremental margins. These improvements translated into higher free cash flow (""FCF"")  which enabled the Company to decrease net debt by $11 700 000 or 7%  sequentially. Core remains intently focused on executing against its key financial and operational strategies  including 1) reducing debt and strengthening our balance sheet  as well as 2) consistently pursuing efficiencies and the introduction of new technologies. For 2023  Core sees the continuation of a multi-year recovery cycle for the oil and gas industry led by improvement in both onshore and offshore client activity across our global operations  although the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues to create volatility and uncertainties to growth prospects in Europe  Russia and Ukraine.""Voluntary Delisting from Euronext and Redomestication to the United StatesOn 4 November 2022  Core Lab announced its decision to voluntarily delist its shares from Euronext Amsterdam  and the last trading day for the Company's shares on the Euronext was 2 December 2022. The Company's shares continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""CLB"".Following the delisting of the shares  on 17 January 2023  Core Lab announced plans to reorganize the Company's corporate structure  resulting in the redomestication of the parent company from the Netherlands to the United States (the ""Redomestication""). The Company and its Board believes that the Redomestication will enhance shareholder value over the long-term through simplifying the corporate structure  improving operational efficiencies and reducing administrative costs. The Redomestication  if approved by the Company's shareholders  will change the Company's jurisdiction of organization from the Netherlands to the State of Delaware.Benefits of the Redomestication include: (i) a reduction in the corporate footprint and regulatory requirements associated with preparing duplicative audited financial statements and other reporting obligations  (ii) improved efficiencies and opportunities in the Company's corporate treasury  cash management  risk management and tax functions  and (iii) a simplified and more efficient tax structure.Reservoir DescriptionReservoir Description operations are closely correlated with trends in international and offshore activity levels  with approximately 80% of revenue sourced from projects originating outside the U.S. Reservoir Description revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $78 100 000  down slightly sequentially and year-over-year. Geopolitical sanctions that became effective during the fourth quarter of 2022  further disrupted trading patterns of crude oil and derived products in Europe  Russia and Ukraine. As a result  the demand for laboratory services in the fourth quarter of 2022 was adversely impacted  offsetting revenue growth in other international regions. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2022 on a GAAP basis was $6 800 000  while operating income  ex-items  was $6 000 000  yielding operating margins of 8%.Reservoir Description revenue for 2022 was adversely impacted by the devaluation of the Euro and British Pound when translated into U.S. dollars. Using a constant U.S. dollar exchange rate  Reservoir Description 2022 revenue would have been approximately $12 000 000 higher. For 2022  revenue was also adversely impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict  declining over $9 000 000 compared to 2021. Combined  these two factors adversely impacted Reservoir Description 2022 revenue by approximately $21 000 000  substantially offsetting international growth in other regions.During the fourth quarter of 2022  under the direction of a South American National Oil Company  Core Lab conducted a series of Enhanced Oil Recovery (""EOR"") and flow assurance studies for a multi-well onshore program using CO 2 -rich injection gases. The studies determined the impact of blending these CO 2 -rich gases with reservoir fluids and provided the basis for advanced equation-of-state modelling. While defining the gas injection parameters for a successful field application are critical to improving crude oil recoveries  operators must simultaneously mitigate the flocculation of asphaltenes that result from CO 2 injection  and which  can erase such gains. CO 2 injection projects reflect a globally expanding interest in EOR and Carbon Capture and Storage technologies. When properly evaluated with rigorous laboratory testing  injecting CO 2 into hydrocarbon-bearing subsurface formations can simultaneously improve oil recovery and reduce CO 2 emissions.Also  during the fourth quarter of 2022  Core received both reservoir fluid and reservoir rock samples from Talos Energy Inc.'s Deepwater Gulf of Mexico Lime Rock and Venice prospects. Leveraging Core's experience with prior successful Gulf of Mexico drilling campaigns  the Company was able to quickly implement laboratory analytical protocols to fast-track results and evaluate reservoir potential within days of receiving the samples. The analytical results provided key reservoir parameters including: 1) an assessment of the pore system and fluid flow properties of these high-quality sandstone strata  2) measurement of the crude oil and natural gas saturations in the recovered rocks  and 3) determination of key reservoir fluid properties such as the gas-oil ratio  and with the composition of the hydrocarbons. Talos' experts incorporated these parameters into their assessment of the commercial viability of these prospects. Core's proprietary high pressure  high temperature  full visualization Pressure-Volume-Temperature technologies  along with the Company's extensive database of producing reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico  helped Talos in this successful drilling program.Production EnhancementProduction Enhancement operations  which are focused on complex completions in unconventional  tight-oil reservoirs in the U.S.  as well as conventional projects across the globe  posted fourth quarter 2022 revenue of $49 400 000  increasing over 5% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. Operating income on a GAAP basis was $7 900 000  while operating income  ex-items  was $7 700 000  yielding operating margins of 16% and sequential incremental margins  ex-items  in excess of 100%. In addition  Core's proprietary diagnostic services grew over 22% sequentially and 17% year-over-year.During the fourth quarter of 2022  a U.S.-based operating company expressed the need to overcome injectivity challenges in their saltwater disposal wells. Cost-effective disposal of produced frac fluid is critical to the financial success of unconventional resources. Reservoir modeling determined that to optimize injection efficiencies  14 zones dispersed across a 1 700 ft lateral wellbore needed to be perforated simultaneously in an over-balanced pressure configuration. Core Lab provided a customized solution for this challenging technical problem by combining its proprietary Pulse Wave™ Tubular Conveyed System with its proprietary HERO® Hard Rock energetics. Pulse Wave™ uses a unique energy transfer technology that can trigger multiple  unevenly-spaced perforating guns in a single downhole trip  eliminating the need for inert spacer guns between live guns to create a continuous communication string. Eliminating the need for spacer guns reduces material cost and significantly reduces the rig time required to deploy the system. The HERO® Hard Rock energetic technology uses an advanced  patented  liner material technology that yields debris-free perforations  while also providing deep penetration and more effective flow efficiencies in hard rock formations. By employing Pulse Wave™ technology  the client saved over 30% on the cost of consumables  in addition to reduced rig time. The HERO® Hard Rock energetics created communication across each perforating interval  enabling the operator to establish the desired injection rate  which was double that of similar wells completed using conventional wireline perforating technologies.Liquidity  Free Cash Flow and DividendCore continues to focus on maximizing FCF  a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures. For the fourth quarter of 2022  cash from operations was $13 200 000 and capital expenditures were $2 000 000  yielding FCF of $11 200 000. Core's free cash will continue to be returned to its shareholders through the Company's regular quarterly dividend as well as being focused towards reducing long-term debt.During the fourth quarter of 2022  Core's net debt was reduced by $11 700 000  which also reduced the Company's leverage ratio to 2.29 as of 31 December 2022  down from 2.42 at the end of third quarter of 2022. The Company will continue applying free cash towards reducing debt until the Company reaches its target leverage ratio (calculated as total net debt divided by trailing twelve months adjusted EBITDA) of 1.5 times or lower.On 26 October 2022  Core's Board of Supervisory Directors (""Board"") announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock  which was paid on 28 November 2022 to shareholders of record on 7 November 2022. Dutch withholding tax was deducted from the dividend at a rate of 15%.On 1 February 2023  the Board approved a cash dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock payable on 6 March 2023 to shareholders of record on 13 February 2023. Dutch withholding tax will be deducted from the dividend at a rate of 15%.Return On Invested CapitalThe Board and the Company's Executive Management continue to focus on strategies that maximize return on invested capital (""ROIC"") and FCF  factors that have high correlation to total shareholder return. Core's commitment to an asset-light business model and disciplined capital stewardship promotes capital efficiency and is designed to produce more predictable and superior long-term ROIC.The Board has established an internal performance metric of demonstrating superior ROIC performance relative to the oilfield service companies listed as Core's Comp Group by Bloomberg  as the Company continues to believe superior ROIC will result in higher total return to shareholders. Bloomberg's calculations using the latest comparable data available indicate Core Lab's ROIC improved to 7.2%.Industry and Core Lab Outlook and GuidanceLooking forward into 2023  Core sees crude-oil macro fundamentals continuing to support a multi-year recovery cycle for the oil and gas industry. Crude-oil demand for 2023  as forecast by the International Energy Agency in January 2023  is projected to increase by 1.9 million barrels per day (""mbpd"") to a record 101.7 mbpd as consumption in China grows along with the reopening of its economy. As crude-oil demand is projected to exceed pre-COVID levels  crude-oil supply is projected to tighten. Production growth continues to face constraints due to prolonged underinvestment in many regions around the globe and the natural decline of production from existing fields. As a result  Core Lab expects operators to expand their upstream spending plans for 2023 by mid-teens compared to 2022. This supports Core's outlook for continued improvement in international onshore and offshore activity  with projects emerging and underway  most notably across the Middle East  Latin America and West Africa regions.Turning to the U.S.  Core sees similar challenges with crude-oil supply which should require increased spending by operators to grow and replace production. While operators remain focused on capital discipline  2023 forecasts indicate their U.S. upstream spending will increase approximately 15% year-over-year.As customary  Core expects typical sequential seasonal industry patterns will cause activity in the first quarter of 2023 to decline in some regions. As such  Core anticipates Reservoir Description first quarter 2023 revenue to be down low to mid-single digits  sequentially. Continued volatility with crude-oil trading patterns may impact Core's Reservoir Description segment's international growth within its Russian  Ukrainian and European operations. Production Enhancement segment revenue is estimated to be up mid-single digits as U.S. land activity is projected to recover from normal seasonal declines experienced at year-end.Core projects first quarter 2023 revenue to range from $125 000 000 to $129 000 000 and operating income of $11 500 000 to $14 500 000  yielding operating margins of approximately 10%. EPS for the first quarter of 2023 is expected to be $0.14 to $0.19.The Company's first quarter 2023 guidance is based on projections for underlying operations and excludes gains and losses in foreign exchange. First quarter 2023 guidance also assumes an effective tax rate of 20%.Earnings Call ScheduledThe Company has scheduled a conference call to discuss Core's fourth quarter 2022 earnings announcement.

The partnership fits in with Robeco’s strategic focus on its core business in the Dutch and global wholesale and institutional markets. Previously Robeco discontinued its fiduciary management and private equity activities. The transfer of the direct retail activities is a next step in this process. For Van Lanschot Kempen  the acquisition provides a strong vantage point for further growth in line with its strategic objectives and respond to the growing demand for online investment solutions among others as the Dutch pensions market moves towards more individualised pensions.The online distribution platform for investment services of Robeco Retail will merge with Evi van Lanschot. The combination had €6.0 billion in AuM for circa 150 000 clients at the end of 2022. The combined platform will continue to offer Robeco’s investment funds and the impact on Robeco’s AuM will therefore be limited. Robeco’s clients will retain their current investments under the same conditions.Story continuesBringing together two investment houses’ deep-seated knowledgeThe transaction sees Robeco and Van Lanschot Kempen bring together the deep-seated knowledge and expertise of two investment houses with a long Dutch history.

But  in reality  even a rare masterpiece can turn out to be difficult to sell if there are few collectors able to participate in its auction or if its value is very uncertain. The tools developed by Artprice make it possible to anticipate the different scenarios by identifying the dynamics behind each artist's market  a process that involves identifying all the genuinely similar works by each artist.The values of canvases (65 x 100cm) in Claude Monet’s “Waterloo Bridge” seriesBreakdown of artists by number of lots sold at auction in 2022France's financial markets supervisory authority (the AMF) provides a relatively broad and open definition of the notion of ""liquidity"": A financial asset (stocks  bonds  etc.) is said to be 'liquid' when it can be bought or sold quickly and without its sale having any significant impact on its price. The notion of 'liquidity' therefore reflects the ease with which an asset can be traded. By extension the notion of liquidity is also applied to markets: the more 'liquid' a market is  the easier  faster and cheaper it is to carry out transactions there.www.amf-france.org/fr/espace-epargnants/savoir-bien-investir/cadrer-son-projet/placements-que-savoir-sur-la-liquidite-0But as thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice points out  the liquidity of an artwork cannot be compared to that of a financial asset. The procedure for including a given artwork in an auction catalog can take several weeks or even months  and auction transaction costs can easily reach 20% or even 30%  while galleries may charge even more. That said  among the 803 000 artists listed by Artprice  there are very different market profiles  and these differences usually depend primarily on which way the delicate balance between supply and demand is leaning.Artprice identifies four particularly singular profiles:Story continues1. The ""Great Masters"": a very limited supply with massive demandWhen Da Vinci's Salvator Mundi resurfaced in 2016 (after leaving Geneva's freeport)  few experts were able to predict its price would reach $450 million. Even today  the bidding battle between the two billionaires  one of whom was the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia  Mohammed bin Salman  remains shrouded in mystery. But there can be no doubt that the extreme rarity of Leonardo's works played a key role in the ""uncertainty"" surrounding the work's real market value.Indeed  it is precisely for these extremely sought-after signatures that sales guarantees were initially developed with the objective of reassuring sellers. This mechanism is becoming more systematic today; in the recent sale of the Paul G. Allen collection  all of the pieces are guaranteed by the auctioneer. Among them  a unique painting by Gustave Klimt that had been offered at auction for two years finally sold for $104 million.The markets for works by Grand Masters are surrounded by clusters of works with related attributions ""school of""  ""follower of""  ""circle of""  etc. In November 2022  Christie's in Paris sold a Salvator Mundi ""after Leonardo da Vinci"" for $1.1 million (including fees)  although the work was estimated between $10 000 and $15 000.www.artprice.com/artist/17205/leonardo-da-vinci/painting/28647612/salvator-mundi2. Blue-chip Artists: a regular supply with high demandOn the other hand  works by artists like Picasso and Monet  essentially paintings  are traded in sufficient numbers each year for it to be possible to follow the general evolution of prices. Auctions can always be directly affected by particular events  passionate overspending  or even negative circumstances  but the value of works by these artists generally follows a relatively mechanical logic based on the most recent results for similar pieces.The Artprice100© index is focused on such signatures  and while their prices have generally soared over the past twenty years  fractionalization solutions make it possible to invest in their works without having to pay the full acquisition price (via financial participation).Some of these artists have also produced drawings and prints  and in some cases in large quantities  and these works allow collectors to acquire 'smaller' pieces that can also become very valuable. In March 2022 an etching by Pablo Picasso titled Le repas frugal (1904) crossed the $8 million threshold for the first time.www.artprice.com/artist/22796/pablo-picasso/print-multiple/26211054/le-repas-frugal3. Local Artists: an abundant supply with limited demandAs regards the lesser-known signatures in art history  the art auction market offers an abundant and extremely diversified range of works from almost every artistic period and movement (even if 'art history' per se is still largely dominated by white artists).For many of these signatures  more or less modest sales tend to occur in a single country or sometimes in a particular region. This may be because the demand is concentrated in one place  or because the results are generally higher there  or for simply historical reasons the works of these artists are offered for sale by auction houses that have become specialized in their works.For example  no less than 124 works by the German artist Hans Von Faber du Faur (1863-1940)  son of Otto Von Faber du Faur  were sold in 2022 for an average price of $200  to which were added 89 unsold lots. However  they were all offered in a single session hosted online on 14 July 2022 by the German auctioneer  Michael Zeller.4. Confidential Artists: a limited supply with little demandArtprice recorded a historic record number of art auction transactions in 2022: more than 1 million lots attributed to more than 170 000 artists. Of these  34 000 artists had one or more works offered at auction  but none reached the reserve price. In addition  more than two-thirds of all artists whose works were offered at auction in 2022 only appeared between one and five times. Unfortunately  this frequency is too low to calculate with any confidence the evolution of their prices.Nevertheless  it is sometimes among these signatures  a little out of fashion or forgotten  that the most amazing rediscoveries are made. This category also includes young visual artists who have not yet experienced their moment of glory.Using these four very different profiles  Artprice can begin the process of calculating the liquidity of artists on the art market. This parameter should be of interest to all collectors for whom the liquidity of works is of some importance  as well as to all users of new platforms offering solutions for financial investment solely in art.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image1-claude-monet-values-of-canvases-waterloo-bridge-series.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image2-breakdown-of-artists-lots-sold-at-auction-2022.png]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket.comArtmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov ). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  February 2  2023. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity”  which include Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity” are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

For the fourth quarter of 2022  Core Lab achieved sequential improvement in revenue  operating income  operating margins  and EPS with strong incremental margins. These improvements translated into higher free cash flow  which enabled the company to reduce net debt by $11.7 million or 7%. We remain focused on executing our key financial strategies  including reducing debt and strengthening our balance sheet.For the full year 2022  revenue was $490 million  increasing by more than 4% compared to 2021. However  for 2022  revenue for the full year was adversely impacted by currency devaluation of the euro and British pound. Using a constant dollar exchange rate  2022 revenue would have been nearly $13 million higher. For the full company  operating margins for the fourth quarter grew to 12%  up from 11% in Q3.Full company sequential incremental margins ex items exceeded 80%  driven by a strong quarter in production enhancement. Reservoir description margins lagged after two successive quarters with very high incrementals  reflecting adverse impacts from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The Russia-Ukraine conflict posed a headwind to revenue in the fourth quarter and throughout most of 2022 as trading patterns for crude oil and derived products were disrupted in Europe  Russia  and Ukraine. For 2022  demand for laboratory services tied to the assay of crude oil and derived products in these regions declined in excess of $9 million year-over-year  offsetting growth in other international regions.Lastly  for the full company  quarter-over-quarter  EPS grew sequentially by 11% to $0.20 per share ex items. As we look ahead  Core will continue to execute on its key strategic objectives by: one  introducing new product and service offerings in key geographic markets; two  maintaining a lean and focused organization; and three  maintaining our commitment to delevering the company. Now to review Core Lab's strategies and the financial tenets that Core has used to build shareholder value over our 27-plus year history as a publicly traded company. The interest of our shareholders  clients  and employees will always be well-served by Core Lab's resilient culture  which relies on innovation  leveraging technology to solve problems  and dedicated customer service.I'll talk more about some of our latest innovations in the operational review section of this call. While we navigate through the current challenges and pursue growth opportunities  the company will remain focused on its three long-standing  long-term financial tenets  those being to maximize free cash flow  maximize return on invested capital  and returning excess free cash to our shareholders. Before moving on  I want to thank our employees for their dedication  loyalty  and adaptability in meeting all of our clients' needs  and for the commitment that many have shown as we navigate the moment and prepare for a more active market. I'll now turn it over to Chris for the detailed financial review.Chris Hill -- Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Larry. I would like to begin by highlighting a couple of announcements we made since our last call. As you may be aware  the company's shares were previously dual-listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Euronext Amsterdam Exchange. However  as we rationalize benefits versus the cost of maintaining the dual listing  we decided to delist the shares from the Amsterdam Exchange  which became effective in early December of last year.And following the delisting of the shares on January 17 of this year  we announced our plan to reorganize the company's corporate structure  which includes redomesticating the parent company from the Netherlands to the United States. The company and its board believes the redomestication will enhance long-term shareholder value by reducing administrative costs  simplifying the corporate structure  as well as gaining some operational efficiencies. The company filed a preliminary prospectus and proxy statement associated with the redomestication  which will require shareholder approval. We anticipate the redomestication transaction will be completed sometime in the first half of this year.Before we review the financial performance for the quarter  the guidance we gave on our last call and past calls specifically excluded the impact of any FX gains or losses and assumed an effective tax rate of 20%. So accordingly  our discussion today excludes any foreign exchange gain or loss for current and prior periods. Additionally  the GAAP financial results for the fourth quarter include a noncash adjustment of $1.9 million  which decreased stock compensation expense associated with performance share awards  which vested during the quarter. This adjustment has also been excluded from the discussion of our fourth quarter and full-year results.Now looking at the income statement. Revenue from continuing operations was $127.6 million in the fourth quarter  up slightly from $126 million in the prior quarter. The sequential increase in revenue was driven by growth in both the U.S. and international markets.However  nice growth in multiple international regions has been partially offset by continued disruptions caused by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict  which adversely impacted service revenue in the affected regions. Of this revenue  service revenue  which is more international  was $88.9 million for the quarter  up from $87.9 million last quarter. During the quarter  we saw nice sequential growth of 11% in the U.S.  which was led by our laboratory services and well diagnostic services. We also see nice sequential improvement in multiple international regions outside the areas impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.However  the Russia-Ukraine conflict has continued to disrupt the trading patterns and flow of oil in the affected regions. The realignment of these trading patterns still continues  and the realignment of these trading patterns has not been consistent or linear. For example  in Europe  our crude assay -- crude oil assay activity increased during the third quarter  but activity decreased again in the fourth quarter. The company believes these trading patterns will become more stable throughout 2023  and we will continue to monitor the changes to the trading patterns and appropriately adapt our operations accordingly.For the full year of 2022  service revenue of $347 million was relatively flat  compared to $344.3 million in 2021. As Larry mentioned  two main factors have adversely impacted our international revenue by over $20 million in 2022. The devaluation of certain currencies  primarily the euro and British pound  and disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict as we just discussed. Product sales  which is equally tied to North America and international activity  were $38.6 million for the quarter  up slightly compared to $38.1 million last quarter.International product sales for the quarter were up 15% sequentially  and our energetic sales to the U.S. market were also up sequentially. However  this growth was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $2 million in other product sales. For the full year of 2022  product sales revenue was -- of $142.8 million was up 13% from $125.9 million in 2021.Moving on to the cost of services ex items for the quarter are 78% of service revenue  which is comparable to last quarter. The service side of our business has been more impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Although we see improvements in absorption of costs and nice incremental margins in regions where activity is expanding  these gains are being offset by disruption to the business in other regions more directly impacted by the conflict. Cost of sales ex items in the fourth quarter was 79% of revenue and improved from 82% last quarter.The improvement this quarter was primarily driven by gains in manufacturing efficiencies and higher international sales. Manufacturing costs continue to increase due to inflation on materials and other operating costs. However  some of the impact has been mitigated through gains in manufacturing efficiencies and some improvement in pricing. G&A ex items for the quarter was $10.4 million  relatively flat compared to last quarter.For the full year of 2022  G&A ex items was $39.3 million  up from $37 million in 2021 due to restoration of employee compensation and benefits. For 2023  we expect G&A to be approximately $40 million to $42 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $4.1 million and comparable to last quarter. For the full year  depreciation and amortization expense was $17.2 million  down from $18.5 million in 2021.EBIT ex items for the quarter was $14.7 million  up 10% from $13.3 million last quarter and representing an EBIT margin of approximately 12%  which is also up from 11% last quarter. Operating income for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis was $15.6 million. And for the full year of 2022  EBIT ex items was $44.8 million  down from $52.3 million in the prior year. And on a GAAP basis  EBIT was $41.5 million for 2022 and $45.3 million in 2021.Interest expense was $3.1 million and comparable to last quarter. And interest expense ex items for the full year was $11.4 million  up slightly from $11 million in 2021. Although interest rates have significantly increased throughout 2022  the company has substantially offset the impact of this increase by reducing our outstanding debt. On a GAAP basis  interest expense for the full year of 2022 was $11.6 million  up from $9.2 million in 2021 as 2021 interest expense included a $1.4 million gain associated with settling some of our interest rate hedges last year.Income tax expense ex items and using an effective tax rate of 20% for the quarter was $2.3 million. On a GAAP basis  the company recorded income tax expense of $5.8 million for the quarter. And for the full year  income tax expense was $10.3 million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 34% for 2022. However  income tax expense was significantly increased in 2022 due to the devaluation of foreign currencies  primarily Turkey and the United Kingdom  which we discussed in prior quarters.Excluding the impact associated with the devaluation of the Turkish lira and British pound  the company's effective tax rate would have been approximately 18%. The effective tax rate will continue to be somewhat sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings across the globe and the impact of items discrete to each quarter. However  we continue to project the company's effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. Income from continuing operations ex items for the quarter was $9.3 million  up 11% sequentially from $8.3 million last quarter.For the full year 2022 ex items  it was $26.8 million  down from $33 million in 2021. GAAP income from continuing operations for the quarter was $6.7 million and for the full-year 2022 was $19.7 million. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations ex items was $0.20 for the quarter  up from $0.18 last quarter and was $0.57 for the full year of 2022. GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $0.14 for the quarter and $0.42 for the full year.Now moving on to the balance sheet. Receivables were $106.9 million at December 31  up $6.7 million from last quarter end. Our DSOs for the fourth quarter were at 70 days  also up when compared to 67 days last quarter. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of billings during the quarter and a slightly higher mix of international revenue  which generally has a longer collection period.Inventory finished the year at $60.4 million  up approximately $5.6 million from last quarter end. Inventory turns for the quarter were at 2.1  down from 2.3 in the last quarter  and primarily down due to shipping delays postponing some larger international sales into 2023. As previously highlighted  the company continues to experience an increase in cost of raw materials  labor  packaging and transportation costs  which are increasing the cost of inventory. Additionally  challenges in the supply chain persists  which will continue to require carrying a larger amount of inventory to help mitigate disruptions.We anticipate inventory turns will remain at similar levels  but we have a focused effort for improvement as we progress into 2023. On the liability side of the balance sheet  our long-term debt was $175 million at December 31 and was reduced by $10 million this quarter. Our debt is currently comprised of our senior notes at $135 million as well as $40 million outstanding under our bank revolving credit facilities. As Larry mentioned earlier  our free cash flow has also improved as the company's financial performance has improved the last couple of quarters.Our free cash flow continues to be focused on reducing outstanding debt. Considering cash of $15.4 million  our net debt was $159.6 million at year end  a reduction of $11.7 million this quarter  which also improved our leverage ratio to 2.29 from 2.42 at last quarter end. Since announcing the company's commitment and focus on reducing debt in the fourth quarter of 2019  we have reduced net debt by 46%. The company will continue applying free cash toward reducing debt so the company reaches its target leverage ratio of 1.5 or lower.Looking at cash flow. For the fourth quarter of 2022  cash flow from operating activities was $13.2 million. And after paying for $2 million of capex  our free cash flow was $11.2 million for the quarter. Our free cash flow generated this quarter is the highest we have achieved since the third quarter of 2020.Looking forward to 2023  we expect capex to modestly expand and will continue to remain in line with historical levels  but also be aligned with activity levels. For the full year of 2023  we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $12 million to $15 million which is an increase from $10.2 million in 2022. Core will continue our strict capital discipline and asset-light business model with capital expenditures primarily targeted at growth opportunities and initiatives. Core Lab's operational leverage continues to provide for the ability to grow revenue and profitability with minimal capital requirements.Capital expenditures have historically ranged from 2.5% to 4% of revenue even during periods of significant growth. That same level of laboratory infrastructure  intellectual property  and leverage exists in the business today. We believe evaluating a company's ability to generate free cash flow and free cash flow yield is an important metric for shareholders when comparing and projecting company's financial results. particularly for those shareholders who utilize discounted cash flow models to assess valuations.I will now turn it over to Gwen for an update on our guidance and outlook.Gwen Gresham -- Senior Vice President and Head of Investor RelationsThank you  Chris. Looking forward into 2023  we see crude oil macro fundamentals continuing to support a multiyear recovery cycle for the oil and gas industry. Crude oil demand for 2023 as forecasted by the International Energy Agency in January of this year is projected to increase by 1.9 million barrels per day to a record 101.7 million barrels per day as consumption in China grows  along with the reopening of its economy. As crude oil demand is projected to exceed pre-COVID levels  crude oil supply is projected to tighten.Production growth continues to face constraints due to prolonged underinvestment in many regions around the globe  as well as natural decline of production from existing fields. As a result  we expect operators to expand their upstream spending plans for 2023 by mid-teens compared to 2022. This supports our continued improvement in international onshore and offshore activity with projects emerging and underway  most notably across the Middle East  Latin America  and West Africa regions. Moving on to the U.S.We see similar challenges with crude oil supply  which should require increased spending by operators to grow and replace production. While operators remain focused on capital discipline  2023 forecast indicate their U.S. upstream spending will increase by approximately 15% year-over-year. Turning to the first quarter of 2023.We anticipate reservoir description to be down low to mid-single digits sequentially. There are two factors causing the sequential decline in revenue. First  the typical seasonal industry pattern  which will cause activity in the first quarter to decline in some regions; and second  continued volatility with crude oil trading patterns  which may impact reservoir description's international growth within its Russian  Ukrainian  and European operations. Helping to offset these revenue headwinds  we will see an increase in international upstream project activity  which is currently underway.For production enhancement  revenue is estimated to be up mid-single digits as U.S. land activity is projected to recover from normal seasonal declines experienced at year-end. We project first-quarter 2023 revenue to range from $125 million to $129 million and operating income of $11.5 million to $14.5 million  yielding operating margins of approximately 10%. EPS for the first quarter is expected to range from $0.14 to $0.19.The company's first-quarter guidance is based on projections for underlying operations and excludes gains and losses in foreign exchange. First-quarter guidance also assumes an effective tax rate of 20%. Now I'll pass the discussion back to Larry.Larry Bruno -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Gwen. First  I'd like to thank our global team of employees for providing innovative solutions  integrity  and superior service to our clients. The team's collective dedication to servicing our clients is the foundation of Core Lab's success. Turning first to reservoir description.For the fourth quarter of 2022  revenue came in at just over $78 million  down slightly compared to Q3. When looking at revenue growth for reservoir description  it is important to consider the sharp devaluation of the euro and the British pound. These currency devaluations lowered reservoir description revenue for the full year of more than $12 million using 2021 exchange rates. Operating income for reservoir description ex items was $6 million  and operating margins were 8%.Growth across most regions was offset by impacts from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Demand for crude oil and derived product assay work across Europe  Russia  and Ukraine  which rebounded somewhat during Q3  subsequently slowed in Q4 as sanctions became formalized. As previously discussed  we expect continued volatility in demand for these laboratory services as global trading patterns realign. However  as Gwen mentioned  the International Energy Agency recently forecast crude oil demand for 2023 to average a record high 101.7 million barrels per day  up by 1.9 million barrels per day from 2022 even after assessing global financial forecasts.This bodes well for growing demand for reservoir description's assay work. As we look ahead  while still well below pre-COVID levels  we see the growing international rig count as a harbinger of an improving landscape for reservoir description  a trend that we project will play out for the next several years  particularly in the Middle East  North and South America  and most other regions. Early movers in the oilfield service sector that are more exposed to well construction have already felt the impact of the cycle shift. As projects progress into field appraisal  field development  and eventually production  demand for Core Lab's reservoir description services will rise accordingly.Now for some operational highlights from the fourth quarter. Core Lab's reservoir description services were employed on both U.S. and international projects to help our clients evaluate their assets and develop programs to optimize production. Under the direction of a South American national oil company  Core Lab conducted a series of enhanced oil recovery and flow assurance studies for a multi-well onshore program that is evaluating the use of CO2 rich injection gases.This laboratory work is determining the impact of blending the CO2-rich gases with existing reservoir fluids and are providing the basis for advanced equation of state modeling. While defining the gas injection  parameters for successful field application are critical to improving crude oil recoveries. Operators must also assess the potential for the injected CO2 to unintendedly cause flocculation of asphalt teams. These long-chain asphaltene molecules can clog cores in the rock and impair permeability  thus reducing the effectiveness of CO2 injection programs.Broadly  CO2 injection projects like this reflect a globally expanding interest in enhanced oil recovery and carbon capture and storage technologies. When properly evaluated with rigorous laboratory testing  injecting CO2 into hydrocarbon-bearing subsurface formations can simultaneously improve oil recovery and reduce CO2 emissions. Also during the fourth quarter of 2022  Core completed an integrated study on conventional core from a lower Barnett Shale pilot well in the Permian Basin. Key objectives of the study were to evaluate the resource potential of the strata and identify landing zone targets that will optimize stimulation and hydrocarbon production.Core analysis data acquired from the pilot well was benchmarked against key performance indicators from 21 wells in Core Lab's proprietary Woodford-Barnett joint industry project to provide insights into future production potential of the play. Core applied its new proprietary prism mudstone laboratory workflow  which combines advanced petrophysical and geochemical technologies  including measurements from high-frequency nuclear magnetic resonance and multi-rate pyrolysis to also provide rapid assessment of mobile versus nonmobile hydrocarbons in the rocks. The prism workflow also refined petrophysical models and allow for refined calibration of downhole logs  which in turn resulted in an increase in both calculated reserves and estimated ultimate recovery. Moving now to production enhancement  where Core Lab technologies continue to help our clients optimize their well completions.Revenue for production enhancement came in at $49 million  up 5% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year. Operating income ex items was $7.7 million  while operating margins were 16% for the fourth quarter of 2022  and sequential margins were more than 100%. During the fourth quarter of 2022  Core Lab continued to build on the success of its X-SPAN casing and tubing patch technology. The industry-leading versatility and reliability of the X-SPAN system yield significant savings in the remediation of all types of wells with casing damage  ranging from oil and gas producers through the disposal and geothermal wells.Recently  an operator in Alaska had casing leaks in a horizontal water disposal well at 4 different depths over a 5 000-foot interval. As the disposal well were to become unavailable  hydrocarbon production from nearby oil and gas wells would need to be severely curtailed. Remedial steps that would have otherwise required a workover rig would have been both costly and time-consuming. Instead  Core Lab experts recommended placing four separate expand patches via wireline with a configuration that would enable operations in this highly deviated wellbore.All four patches were successfully deployed  set on depth  and the well passed the mandatory mechanical integrity tests required by state authorities. This allows the disposal operation to continue Rigless intervention to repair the well with X-SPAN resulted in significant cost savings and enable the nearby producing wells to maintain hydrocarbon output. To date  Core Lab has run over 100 000 feet of proprietary casing and tubing patches. The X-SPAN system has a proven track record of reliability and is one of the most effective solutions of its type.That concludes our operational review. We appreciate your participation  and Drew will now open the call for questions.Questions & Answers:Operator[Operator instructions] The first question comes from Samantha Hoh with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.Gwen Gresham -- Senior Vice President and Head of Investor RelationsGood morning  Samantha.Samantha Hoh -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystHey  guys. How's it going? Thanks for taking my call. I wanted to maybe dig in a little bit in just the contrast of the two projects that you highlighted in RD. It's kind of interesting that in Latin America  you guys are doing all this work on EOR and coassurance.But then in the U.S.  you're kind of evaluating resource potential of the partner shale  which I haven't really thought of in a while. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about that. Just could we be seeing just like a switch at some point  where the U.S. shale players  I think  a little bit more about just EOR? I mean you guys spent so much time to talk about permissible floods in the past.So I'm just kind of curious if there's any sort of pickup in interest in trying to get a little bit more production out of existing wells in the U.S.Larry Bruno -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. So let's unravel a little bit. The project I talked about on the Barnett  I think most people  perhaps mistakenly  assume that everything is known about the variability in reservoir quality across the U.S. unconventional plays. That's not the case.We have a good perspective on that because we've done work for -- in all the basins  multi-company studies where we've gotten to see everybody's results. And so there are areas of higher quality and lower quality reservoir rock. Over time  technology has helped to bring forward the productive potential of lower-quality rock. But people are always aware that  hey  they've done -- they've cherry-picked  in many cases  some of the better quality areas that they had.They did exactly what you and I would have done during tough times. They focused their efforts on their best opportunities. And now as people move into  call it  peripheral or second-tier opportunities  they've got to assess what's the quality of the rock and how much movable oil there is. On the -- particularly on the question of EOR and unconventionals  we've been on the forefront of that for quite some time.We have a joint industry project that has assessed the viability of doing gas injection to strip additional hydrocarbons out of the rock. We won't give you the results of that because  quite frankly  we sell the results of that to our clients. But we have demonstrated in the lab that with the right combination of injection gases and the right existing oil in place in the ground that recovery can be substantially improved  and there are a number of companies that are doing that right now. The EOR project in South America that I talked about today  I think we wanted to highlight that one a bit because there is a growing worldwide  I'll call it  reaction to  hey  there's going to be a lot of CO2 that's going to be captured and available for EOR projects.I think if you look back historically  there would have been more CO2 injection for enhanced oil recovery if large  long-term reliable sources of CO2 were available. Well  regulations are now creating that environment where CO2 is going to be captured in lot quantities and available for long periods of time. And so we're seeing it across the globe. There is an increased attention to  hey  I can take some of that CO2 that's coming from an emission point.And if I put that into my reservoir  what can I get in terms of additional oil recovery? And that's going on in North America. It's going on all over the globe.Samantha Hoh -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystJust one real quick follow-up on that. Can you take associated gas and treat it and do whatever  and then use it for injection for -- to boost production?Larry Bruno -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  absolutely. And in fact  that was the focus of our -- or one of the primary focuses of our EOR study on unconventional reservoirs  was to take available gases associated either with nearby production or simultaneous from the well  and then look at what chemical changes  what composition you would need to achieve  maybe adding some propane or dialing in some ethane  getting the right chemistry of the associated gases or available gases and going back into the same wellbores that you've been producing. And that goes through a soaking process. The physics involved in that are different than a traditional gas flood where the main driver was to push  drive oil from injections to producers.Rather  in this case  the injected gas vaporizes some of that oil. And then as it's withdrawn and the pressures dropped  that oil drops out of the injection gases. And so this is a multi-cycle process that goes on where we keep adjusting the chemistry of the gas for injection to get the most oil out  and there are companies that are doing that today.Samantha Hoh -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystOK. Great. Maybe for my next question  just a little bit on the PE side. What are you anticipating in terms of the energetic sales? Obviously  a rebound here in the frac activity.I'm just kind of curious what you're expecting throughout the year in terms of demand for your energetic products  the type of seasonal trends  I guess  we should be thinking about for PE beyond the current quarter.Gwen Gresham -- Senior Vice President and Head of Investor RelationsYeah. Samantha  we think that for PE and our energetic product sales will continue to have market penetration with that as well as benefit from activity that will go on throughout 2023. We have seen  as we've started the year that we're on a bit of a climb-out  let's say  from Q4 from the holidays. So we're not quite back to pre-holiday  let's say  frac spread levels.But we can see that we're starting to move in that direction  so we think it's gonna be another nice year of healthy activity.Samantha Hoh -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystAre you guys anticipating like much of an increase in frac activity this year? This year  I think  there's a bit of debate in terms of what the demand is and the movement across the basins.Chris Hill -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So this is Chris. I think what we're seeing is at least we exited. If you look at where we were in Q4  it was at a pretty high level  I think the frac spread either approached to reach 300.And like Gwen was saying  we're kind of dipped off as the holidays were in  which is very typical. And then it sort of rebounds as we begin the new year  and we're seeing that as well. So we think it's gonna come back to that 300 level  but we think there are some headwinds to growth there. The rigs are kind of full up  and the frac spreads are also kind of full up.But as companies start to bring new equipment online  we do think that that will be put to work  and maybe there's more opportunity for some growth from where we kind of exited the year as we get a little deeper into 2023.Larry Bruno -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think I'd sum it up by saying we think in total  2023 will be a better year for energetic sales in 2022  yeah  year over year. Yeah  in the U.S. and globally year over year.Gwen Gresham -- Senior Vice President and Head of Investor RelationsThank you  Samantha.Samantha Hoh -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystThanks  guys.OperatorThe next question comes from Simon Galligani with Awilco AS. Please go ahead.Gwen Gresham -- Senior Vice President and Head of Investor RelationsHi  Simon.Simon Galligani -- Awilco AS -- AnalystGood morning  guys. Thanks for taking my question. I saw that you acquired own shares for about 1.6 million in the fourth quarter  which  I guess  is the first buyback since the innovation. I know that you guys are focused on bringing the leverage ratio down to 1.5%.But should we read into this that you'll gradually resume buybacks simultaneously as you continue to reduce the leverage ratio?Chris Hill -- Chief Financial OfficerHey  Simon  this is Chris. So when you think about the share buybacks  think about that in maybe two buckets. One is where we go into the open market and buy back shares. The other bucket is when employees have share awards that vest.They have the opportunity  or they generally will sell those shares that are for tax  their tax burden associated with that to the company. So we will buy those shares from the employee to settle their tax burden associated with the vesting awards. And that's what you saw in the fourth quarter. We did not go out to the open market and buy any shares.Having said that  once we get our leverage ratio down to where at least we're getting toward the target  we've got more clear sight on what the forecast looks like  absolutely  we could see ourselves getting more active in the share buyback program off the open market.Simon Galligani -- Awilco AS -- AnalystOK. Thank you for the clarity  and yeah  the comment there.Gwen Gresham -- Senior Vice President and Head of Investor RelationsThank you  Simon.Larry Bruno -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think we've got a little bit of a crowded earnings release date. So since we're not seeing any other questions  we'll end right there. In summary  Core's operational leadership continues to position the company for improving client activity levels in both the U.S. and international markets for 2023 and beyond.We have never been better operationally or technologically positioned to help our global client base  optimize their reservoirs  and to address their evolving needs. We remain uniquely focused and are the most technologically advanced  client-focused reservoir optimization company in the oilfield service sector. The company will remain focused on maximizing free cash and returns on invested capital. In addition to our quarterly dividends  we'll bring value to our shareholders via growth opportunities  driven by both the introduction of problem-solving technologies and new market penetration.In the near term  Core will continue to use free cash to strengthen this balance sheet and while always investing in growth opportunities. So in closing  we thank and appreciate all of our shareholders and the analysts that cover Core Lab. The executive management team and the board of Core Laboratories give a special thanks to our worldwide employees that have made these results possible. We're proud to be associated with their continuing achievements.So thanks for spending time with us  and we look forward to our next update.

NFL-101 is derived from a subcutaneous desensitization treatment that was developed by the Pasteur Institute against tobacco allergies in tobacco factory workers. Used over the counter by a French doctor on more than 10 000 smokers  the repositioned extract showed promising results in smoking cessation that were supported by a retrospective study. NFL-101 is a standardized version for pharmaceutical use.The study will be conducted by the Pharmacological Neuroimaging team of the CEA. It will focus on following  by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging  the modifications in the cerebral function associated with the development of tobacco addiction in mice  in order to highlight the central effects of NFL-101 treatment in this context. The expected duration of this study is 9 months.Bruno Lafont  Chief Operating Officer and co-founder of NFL Biosciences: ""This research is intended to better understand how NFL-101 can act on tobacco dependence. In the clinical setting  NFL-101 is only administered once or twice  yet current treatments must be administered daily for 3 months. In the case of varenicline (Champix®  Chantix®) treatment starts for three times a day and continues twice a day for many weeks.”For Nicolas Tournier  pharmacologist  radiopharmacist and head of the Pharmacological Neuroimaging team at the CEA: ""This project takes full advantage of the potential of molecular imaging to highlight the effects of drugs on the brain  particularly in the context of the treatment of tobacco addiction. The non-invasive and translational nature of the imaging techniques used could reveal an activity based on communication between the immune system and the central nervous system  different from the modes of action of current smoking cessation drugs that target nicotine receptors.”Story continuesThe results  which may be the subject of a joint scientific publication  will complement the CESTO II and PRECESTO clinical studies with a view to increase the overall attractiveness of NFL-101 to pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in licensing it.About NFL BiosciencesNFL Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company based in the Montpellier area which develops botanical drug candidates for the treatment of addictions. NFL Biosciences' ambition is to bring new  natural  safer and more effective therapeutic solutions to the entire world population  including low- and middle-income countries. Its most advanced product  called NFL-101  is a standardized  nicotine free tobacco leaf extract protected by two patent families.

While the company has confirmed the hack  it has offered few details about the incident.The hack took place Tuesday  and was first reported late Tuesday night New York time by Twitter account PriapusIQ. In a message to MarketWatch  the owner of the account identified himself as Ryan Paisey  the CEO of PiQ Global  a news aggregation service.In the tweet  Paisey said that “[b]asically  trading desks will be flying blind as no trades for today are going in on the overnight process.”His tweet cited a communication from one of ION’s customers warning clients that “overnight processing” of trades would be impacted and that communications from ION should be “quarantined.”Others confirmed that a hack had occurred  and that it appeared to mostly impact operations in Europe.Euronext  a major European exchange operator  acknowledged that ION had been hacked  and that the hack had impacted some of its clients. However  the exchange operator said it hadn’t been impacted directly  and that it was taking precautions. ION “provides connectivity for a number of Euronext clients.”“This incident did not impact Euronext. Euronext teams continue to closely monitor the situation and as usual will take any appropriate action to secure fair and orderly markets ” a representative said in a statement emailed to MarketWatch.On Wednesday  the TradeNews reported that that attack was likely carried out by Lockbit  a Russian-speaking ransomware gang  citing a communication from an affiliate of ION.LockBit has gained substantial notoriety in recent months following “a multi-year rampage that has impacted hundreds of organizations around the world ” according to a Wired report published in late January.ION responded to reports of the hack in a statement on its website entitled “Cleared Derivatives Cyber Event” where it confirmed that it had experienced what it described as a “cybersecurity event ” and that this “event” had impacted its business. The company added that it had managed to contain the damage.“ION Cleared Derivatives  a division of ION Markets  experienced a cybersecurity event commencing on 31 January 2023 that has affected some of its services. The incident is contained to a specific environment  all the affected servers are disconnected  and remediation of services is ongoing. Further updates will be posted when available.”A comment request sent to ION’s media line wasn’t returned.The scope of the attack  and the fallout in terms of financial impact and market disruption  remains to be seen. However  a representative for the U.S. Treasury Department said the fallout from the attack was isolated to a “small number of smaller and mid-size firms.” Treasury said it’s actively working with others to address the fallout from the hack.“Treasury and the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC) are aware of the ransomware attack targeting ION. Today  Treasury convened a common operating picture level set with FBIIC  Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC)  Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council (FSSCC)  and Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA). The issue is currently isolated to a small number of smaller and mid-size firms and does not pose a systemic risk to the financial sector. We remain connected with key financial sector partners  and will advise of any changes to this assessment.”Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that the hack impacted 42 clients of ION Trading UK. But the fallout wasn’t just limitedsolely to ION customers: rival trade-processing systems had also been impacted due to complications matching off trades routed via ION  according to Bloomberg.One week ago  a glitch on the New York Stock Exchange caused a handful of stocks to be halted for volatility shortly after the open. The exchange later blamed the incident on a malfunction of its disaster-recovery system  eventually linking it back to a mistake made by an employee with the exchange’s Chicago data center  according to Bloomberg.,negative,0.0,0.01,0.99,mixed,0.03,0.12,0.85,True,English,"['Options trading desks', 'derivatives platform', 'ransomware attack', 'Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council', 'Banking Information Infrastructure Committee', 'common operating picture level', 'key financial sector partners', 'The Dublin-based ION Markets', 'U.S. Treasury Department', 'major European exchange operator', 'Financial Services Information Sharing', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'popular derivatives trading platform', 'Cleared Derivatives Cyber Event', 'New York time', 'ION Cleared Derivatives', 'rival trade-processing systems', 'news aggregation service', 'Russian-speaking ransomware gang', 'Financial Markets Association', 'Chicago data center', 'financial impact', 'orderly markets', 'Analysis Center', 'cyber attack', 'trading desks', 'cybersecurity event', 'Trading UK', 'MARKET EXTRA', 'options dealers', 'investment banks', 'PiQ Global', 'overnight process', 'appropriate action', 'substantial notoriety', 'recent months', 'multi-year rampage', 'Wired report', 'specific environment', 'Further updates', 'comment request', 'media line', 'market disruption', 'mid-size firms', 'Securities Industry', 'systemic risk', 'disaster-recovery system', 'ransomware attack', 'Bloomberg News', 'small number', 'media reports', 'Twitter account', 'Ryan Paisey', 'Euronext teams', 'late January', 'customers’ ability', 'Euronext clients', '31 January', '42 clients', 'Tuesday', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'currencies', 'target', 'decision', 'trades', 'company', 'hack', 'details', 'incident', 'place', 'PriapusIQ', 'message', 'MarketWatch', 'owner', 'CEO', 'tweet', 'today', 'communication', 'Others', 'operations', 'precautions', 'connectivity', 'situation', 'fair', 'representative', 'statement', 'Wednesday', 'TradeNews', 'Lockbit', 'affiliate', 'hundreds', 'organizations', 'world', 'website', 'business', 'damage', 'division', 'servers', 'remediation', 'scope', 'fallout', 'terms', 'smaller', 'FBIIC', 'FS-ISAC', 'FSSCC', 'SIFMA', 'issue', 'changes', 'assessment', 'complications', 'glitch', 'handful', 'volatility', 'open', 'malfunction', 'mistake', 'employee']",2023-02-02,2023-02-02,msn.com

Today  the Company has a dual listing  with shares traded in both New York and Milan.The dual listing was adopted in 2013  when US-listed CNH Global N.V. merged with Milan-listed Fiat Industrial SpA to form CNH Industrial N.V.

Today  the Company has a dual listing  with shares traded in both New York and Milan.The dual listing was adopted in 2013  when US-listed CNH Global N.V. merged with Milan-listed Fiat Industrial SpA to form CNH Industrial N.V. In January 2022  CNH Industrial N.V. spun off its On-Highway activities creating Iveco Group  a company that is listed solely in Milan. Since the spin-off  the majority of CNH Industrial stock trading has progressively shifted to the NYSE  revealing that the Company's new business profile and investor base fit better with a single US listing. Concentrating trading in one market will allow for increased liquidity and investor focus  while further simplifying the company profile and compliance requirements.CNH Industrial has informed Borsa Italiana Euronext about its intention to leave the European listing.CNH Industrial is monitoring the ongoing initiatives of harmonization and simplification of the legal and regulatory framework of the Italian financial system that could allow a smooth transition to a single listing on the NYSE in the near future.The Company intends to achieve single listing by early 2024. While our primary path is a plain delisting from Milan  alternatives involving a corporate reorganization are available to achieve the same goal. CNH Industrial's Board of Directors and Management Team are grateful to Euronext Milan for having been our listing venue for 10 years and are excited about the Company's continued presence on the NYSE.Goldman Sachs & Co.
