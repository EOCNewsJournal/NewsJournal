Biophytis announces today final results following the reintegration of data from 54 patients  among 233 patients treated  that were missing in the Top Line analysis released on September 7  2022. The final analysis demonstrates that COVA study met the primary endpoint  with a 44% statistically significant reduction (p = 0.043) in the risk of respiratory failure or early death in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19  in line with positive Post-Hoc analysis released on November 3  2022.Stanislas Veillet  CEO of Biophytis  said: "" The COVA study is positive  with a statistically significant reduction of 44% in the risk of respiratory failure or early death  demonstrating the therapeutic potential of Sarconeos (BIO101) in the treatment of severe COVID-19. This huge success is the result of Biophytis scientific excellence and hard work of the clinical and medical teams involved in the COVA clinical study in France  Belgium  the USA and in Brazil. This is tremendous news for patients worldwide  especially for the elderly with co-morbidities  who are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19  despite the great progress made in vaccination and anti-viral treatments now available. While there is a resurgence of COVID-19 patients in China and still unacceptable levels of patients dying from COVID-19 in Europe  the USA and Brazil  Sarconeos (BIO101) may offer an effective therapeutic option to reduce further the threat of COVID-19 pandemic. We are now accelerating the start of our Early Access Program  with the target to give access to Sarconeos (BIO101) in Brazil and France in the second half of 2023  while preparing for filing conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) in Europe and Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the USA. ""Story continuesBiophytis is nowinitiating key regulatory activities to give access to Sarconeos (BIO101) to hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 at risk of respiratory failure and death in 2023.The strategy to give access to Sarconeos (BIO101) as quickly as possible is to file for Early Access Programs (EAP) in France and Brazil  while filing for conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) in Europe and Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the USA. An EAP has already been approved in 2022 in Brazil to treat COVID-19 patients at critical stage in Intensice Care Units (ICU) and the request to lift the hold given completion of the study and positive results is pending. The filing of the request for starting the EAP program in France is being prepared and will be made in Q1 2023 with the objective to be granted approval in Q2 2023. Requests for pre-submission meetings regarding conditional Marketing Authorisation in Europe and Emergency Use Authorization in the USA are under preparation and will be sent in Q1 2023  targeting an approval later in 2023  depending on feedback from authorities.Biophytis will present the results in detail at the American Thoracic Society conference in Washington  DC  USA in May 2023 and at the European Respiratory Society Lung Science meeting in Estoril  Portugal  in March 2023.Final COVA study resultsThe objective of the study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of Sarconeos (BIO101)  350 mg BID in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypoxemia  at risk of respiratory failure requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation  and death. The proportion of patients and time to respiratory failure or early death were studied at 28 days in the primary analysis  corresponding to the maximum treatment period  with follow-up of mortality and safety for at least 90 days.The 233 treated patients (Intent To Treat  ITT population) were 63 years old on average  64% of the patients were male  recruited in 37 centers in Europe  the US and Brazil between Q3 2020 and Q1 2022  infected with the main SARS-Cov-2 variants.The trial ended early before reaching the 310 patients originally planned  due to stalled recruitment. The sub-population of patients without major protocol deviations (Per Protocol  PP sub-population) included 180 patients with similar baseline demographics and disease characteristics as the ITT population.The study met its pre-defined primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant difference between Sarconeos (BIO101) and placebo in the proportion of patients with respiratory failure or early death at day 28  representing a relative reduction of risk of 44% (p=0.043  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test). Moreover  the analysis of time to respiratory failure or early death had shown significant differences over 28 days in the Kaplan Meier curves for Sarconeos (BIO101) versus placebo (p=0.022). The pre-specified analysis of time to death over the complete follow-up period over 90 days showed that mortality rate with Sarconeos (BIO101) was reduced compared to placebo in the ITT population (p=0.083) and in the PP population (p=0.038). Post hoc Kaplan-Meier analysis released on November 3  2022 confirmed the effect of Sarconeos (BIO101) on the primary endpoint and on mortality at day 90.Sarconeos (BIO101) has a very good safety profile  with a lower proportion of patients with adverse events compared to placebo (57% vs. 64%)  in particular a lower frequency of serious  mostly respiratory  adverse events (25% vs. 31%).About the COVA studyAs a reminder  the COVA clinical study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04472728) is an international  multi-centre  double-blind  placebo-controlled  group-sequential and adaptive two-part study. It is a phase 2-3 study evaluating Sarconeos (BIO101) in patients aged 45 years and older  hospitalised with severe respiratory manifestations of COVID-19. Part 1 of the COVA study is an exploratory Phase 2 proof-of-concept study designed to provide preliminary data on the safety  tolerability and efficacy of Sarconeos (BIO101) in 50 hospitalised patients with severe respiratory failure in patients suffering from COVID-19. Part 2 of the COVA study is a randomised phase 3 study investigating the safety and efficacy of Sarconeos (BIO101) on respiratory function in patients. Due to the evolution of the pandemic  the company decidedin April 2022 to stop enrolment at 238 enrolled patients  below the originally planned number of 310.About BIOPHYTISBiophytis SA is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specialized in the development of therapeutics that are aimed at slowing the degenerative processes associated with aging and improving functional outcomes for patients suffering from age-related diseases  including severe respiratory failure in patients suffering from COVID-19.

Access to data-driven  actionable insights that are projected on the virtual twin of a vehicle offers them innovative ways to balance vehicle design with business.Competitive automotive manufacturers must balance sustainability with regulatory requirements as well as inflation. Highly volatile raw material prices due to armed conflicts  health crises  climate change  consumer demands and other global factors make it difficult to ensure a return on investment when aligning the price of a vehicle with the cost of its parts.In this challenging economic context  the 3DEXPERIENCE platform provides Renault Group with a unique combination of artificial intelligence  machine learning  collaborative business processes and an enriched single 3D data model of the vehicle to better manage the business impacts of market volatility. Renault Group can aggregate equipment designs  configurations  historical data and forecasts  and test different design scenarios in a virtual twin to understand  anticipate  quantify and optimize vehicle price and cost  as well as improve equipment purchasing negotiations by sharing these insights with other stakeholders.“In a previous announcement  we talked about the virtual twin of the car and the entreprise to support the ‘Renaulution’ plan ” said Laurence Montanari  Vice President  Transportation & Mobility Industry  Dassault Systèmes. “Our cost intelligence solution with NETVIBES artificial intelligence has allowed Renault to connect its data across the entreprise in less than six months. Now  we are extending the virtual twin from the vehicle to the supply chain. During this uncertain time  our solutions have given companies the ability to simulate and anticipate impacts due to supply chain shortages or raw material price increases. This project extends the platform’s usage to new business audiences at Renault Group to tackle the new challenges of our decade such as inflation  volatility and regulatory requirements.”Renault Group is using the “Global Modular Architecture” industry solution experience based on the 3DEXPERIENCE platform  which integrates the cost intelligence solution. The cost intelligence solution is also available to companies in other industries that Dassault Systèmes serves.FOR MORE INFORMATIONDassault Systèmes’ 3DEXPERIENCE platform  3D design software  3D Digital Mock Up and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions: http://www.3ds.comConnect with Dassault Systèmes on Twitter  Facebook  LinkedIn  YouTubeABOUT DASSAULT SYSTÈMESDassault Systèmes  the 3DEXPERIENCE Company  is a catalyst for human progress.

(Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today announced its intention to invest around US$100 million in its manufacturing and innovation center in Dongtan  South Korea  by 2025  following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between ASM and the Ministry of Trade  Industry and Energy of the Republic of Korea (‘MOTIE’).This investment will expand ASM’s R&D and product-development infrastructure to meet the needs of technology advances  as well as adding more manufacturing capacity. Korea is a key site for ASM  where some of its most advanced applications are developed – ASM’s ALD gap-fill applications are a recent and successful example. These applications enable next-generation advanced logic and memory devices  which are expected to see increased usage in coming years.“Rapid growth is expected until the end of the decade for semiconductors  and – despite the recent slowing down in the industry – ASM continues to invest for growth ” says Benjamin Loh  CEO of ASM. “This expansion will not only serve our key Korean customers  but all our customers worldwide will benefit from the enabling technologies we develop in Korea.”Lee Chang-yang  Korea's Minister of Trade  Industry and Energy  says: “The intended investment by ASM is expected to contribute greatly to increasing high-tech development in our country  securing a stable semiconductor supply chain  and increasing exports.”Prior to signing the MoU  Minister Lee said that with semiconductor devices getting smaller and smaller  the increased investment in Korea by ASM – with its world-leading ALD technology – would present good cause for the country to ‘exert synergy’ with domestic semiconductor companies. Minister Lee also expressed his willingness to cooperate closely with ASM as part of the Korean government’s policy to foster and support the semiconductor industry.Story continuesDongtan has been instrumental in ASM’s growth  with the facility delivering advanced R&D and technology for customers in Korea and for global customers. Korea is also the global center for ASM’s PEALD business. Technologies developed by ASM’s local R&D team have been at the heart of breakthrough innovations in the semiconductor industry  such as the ALD quad chamber module (QCM) architecture  the TENZATM ALD for ultra-high aspect ratio (>100:1) gap-fill  and high-quality PEALD oxides and nitrides for spacers  liners  and other patterning applications.The expansion of ASM’s Dongtan facility is also required to create more space for the company’s fast-growing number of employees in Korea  and reflects the increasing revenue contribution from the Korean market expected over the next few years.The intended investment will deliver multiple benefits to the local market. Of course  the expansion will create new job opportunities  for the direct and indirect employment of skilled personnel in engineering  R&D and manufacturing. In addition to contributing to training and workforce development in Korea  the investment will also benefit local supplier partnerships.ASM has been operating in Korea since 1989 and established ASM Korea Limited in 1995. Since then  Korea has grown into one of ASM’s key global technology development and manufacturing sites with more than 450 employees.The MoU has been signed but is conditional on support and assistance from the Korean government  in terms of grants and the speedy approval of all necessary permits.This intended expansion follows the unveiling last year of ASM’s state-of-the-art Singapore manufacturing facility and operations hub  another step in the company’s growth as it prepares to meet growing global customer demand for advanced semiconductors.About ASM InternationalASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficult breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic-resistant” patient population.alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company has reported positive primary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  enabling the filing of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA  planned for H2 2023. Having delivered clinical proof-of-concept for DSR as a disease-modifying drug program for the treatment of heart failure  the Company is planning to commence MOJAVE  a US multi-centered randomized controlled Phase 1/2a clinical study of DSR 2.0  in Q2 2023.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

NFL-101 is derived from a subcutaneous desensitization treatment that was developed by the Pasteur Institute against tobacco allergies in tobacco factory workers. Used over the counter by a French doctor on more than 10 000 smokers  the repositioned extract showed promising results in smoking cessation that were supported by a retrospective study. NFL-101 is a standardized version for pharmaceutical use.The study will be conducted by the Pharmacological Neuroimaging team of the CEA. It will focus on following  by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging  the modifications in the cerebral function associated with the development of tobacco addiction in mice  in order to highlight the central effects of NFL-101 treatment in this context. The expected duration of this study is 9 months.Bruno Lafont  Chief Operating Officer and co-founder of NFL Biosciences: ""This research is intended to better understand how NFL-101 can act on tobacco dependence. In the clinical setting  NFL-101 is only administered once or twice  yet current treatments must be administered daily for 3 months. In the case of varenicline (Champix®  Chantix®) treatment starts for three times a day and continues twice a day for many weeks.”For Nicolas Tournier  pharmacologist  radiopharmacist and head of the Pharmacological Neuroimaging team at the CEA: ""This project takes full advantage of the potential of molecular imaging to highlight the effects of drugs on the brain  particularly in the context of the treatment of tobacco addiction. The non-invasive and translational nature of the imaging techniques used could reveal an activity based on communication between the immune system and the central nervous system  different from the modes of action of current smoking cessation drugs that target nicotine receptors.”The results  which may be the subject of a joint scientific publication  will complement the CESTO II and PRECESTO clinical studies with a view to increase the overall attractiveness of NFL-101 to pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in licensing it.About NFL BiosciencesNFL Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company based in the Montpellier area which develops botanical drug candidates for the treatment of addictions. NFL Biosciences' ambition is to bring new  natural  safer and more effective therapeutic solutions to the entire world population  including low- and middle-income countries. Its most advanced product  called NFL-101  is a standardized  nicotine free tobacco leaf extract protected by two patent families. NFL Biosciences intends to offer smokers who want to quit a natural  safe  easy-to-administer and personalized alternative.NFL Biosciences is also developing NFL-301  a natural drug candidate for the reduction of alcohol consumption and has a drug development project for the treatment of cannabis use disorders.The shares of NFL Biosciences are listed on Euronext Growth Paris (FR0014003XT0 – ALNFL).

Today  the Company has a dual listing  with shares traded in both New York and Milan.The dual listing was adopted in 2013  when US-listed CNH Global N.V. merged with Milan-listed Fiat Industrial SpA to form CNH Industrial N.V. In January 2022  CNH Industrial N.V. spun off its On-Highway activities creating Iveco Group  a company that is listed solely in Milan. Since the spin-off  the majority of CNH Industrial stock trading has progressively shifted to the NYSE  revealing that the Company’s new business profile and investor base fit better with a single US listing.

Today  the Company has a dual listing  with shares traded in both New York and Milan.The dual listing was adopted in 2013  when US-listed CNH Global N.V. merged with Milan-listed Fiat Industrial SpA to form CNH Industrial N.V. In January 2022  CNH Industrial N.V. spun off its On-Highway activities creating Iveco Group  a company that is listed solely in Milan. Since the spin-off  the majority of CNH Industrial stock trading has progressively shifted to the NYSE  revealing that the Company’s new business profile and investor base fit better with a single US listing.

The partnership fits in with Robeco’s strategic focus on its core business in the Dutch and global wholesale and institutional markets. Previously Robeco discontinued its fiduciary management and private equity activities. The transfer of the direct retail activities is a next step in this process. For Van Lanschot Kempen  the acquisition provides a strong vantage point for further growth in line with its strategic objectives and respond to the growing demand for online investment solutions among others as the Dutch pensions market moves towards more individualised pensions.The online distribution platform for investment services of Robeco Retail will merge with Evi van Lanschot. The combination had €6.0 billion in AuM for circa 150 000 clients at the end of 2022. The combined platform will continue to offer Robeco’s investment funds and the impact on Robeco’s AuM will therefore be limited. Robeco’s clients will retain their current investments under the same conditions.Story continuesBringing together two investment houses’ deep-seated knowledgeThe transaction sees Robeco and Van Lanschot Kempen bring together the deep-seated knowledge and expertise of two investment houses with a long Dutch history. As part of the transaction  both parties commit to stepping up collaboration on behalf of Van Lanschot Kempen’s private banking clients.Together  Robeco and Evi van Lanschot will work on a smooth transfer of the Robeco Retail activities. Robeco’s investment funds will remain available to clients post-transfer under the Evi van Lanschot name. Robeco Retail’s staff will join Van Lanschot Kempen and  together with the colleagues at Evi van Lanschot  will work towards the further growth of online investment services.Karin van Baardwijk  Robeco’s CEO  said: “Since its inception nearly 95 years ago  Robeco has evolved from a Netherlands-based investment consortium into an international asset manager that serves institutional investors and distributes its investment funds through platforms such as banks  insurers and other intermediaries. This new partnership fits in with our strategic focus on further enhancing this position  with the Dutch market remaining a key priority. We’ve took extreme caution and care in our search to find a partner that would offer a new home  sufficient growth and future-oriented perspective to both our online distribution platform clients and our colleagues. We look forward to expanding and enhancing this partnership and offering our combined proposition to clients.”Maarten Edixhoven  Chair of the Van Lanschot Kempen Management Board  added: “This acquisition provides an opportunity for us to fuel our growth aspirations for Evi van Lanschot. The partnership will turn Evi van Lanschot into the leading platform for online investment services in the Netherlands. We’re seeing a strong demand from clients for an independent Dutch player. I’m delighted to welcome the Robeco Retail employees into our organisation and look forward to combining Evi’s and Robeco’s investment proposition to create the country’s best personal and online investment services provider for our clients.”About Robeco and Evi van LanschotCurrently  around €4.7 billion in AuM is invested in Robeco One and Robeco Plus  while Evi van Lanschot has some €1.3 billion in AuM and provides online wealth management  pension solutions and Evi4Kids.The transactionThe transaction will have a negative impact on Van Lanschot Kempen’s CET 1 ratio of 0.4 percentage points.

But  in reality  even a rare masterpiece can turn out to be difficult to sell if there are few collectors able to participate in its auction or if its value is very uncertain. The tools developed by Artprice make it possible to anticipate the different scenarios by identifying the dynamics behind each artist's market  a process that involves identifying all the genuinely similar works by each artist.The values of canvases (65 x 100cm) in Claude Monet’s “Waterloo Bridge” seriesBreakdown of artists by number of lots sold at auction in 2022France's financial markets supervisory authority (the AMF) provides a relatively broad and open definition of the notion of ""liquidity"": A financial asset (stocks  bonds  etc.) is said to be 'liquid' when it can be bought or sold quickly and without its sale having any significant impact on its price. The notion of 'liquidity' therefore reflects the ease with which an asset can be traded. By extension the notion of liquidity is also applied to markets: the more 'liquid' a market is  the easier  faster and cheaper it is to carry out transactions there.www.amf-france.org/fr/espace-epargnants/savoir-bien-investir/cadrer-son-projet/placements-que-savoir-sur-la-liquidite-0But as thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice points out  the liquidity of an artwork cannot be compared to that of a financial asset. The procedure for including a given artwork in an auction catalog can take several weeks or even months  and auction transaction costs can easily reach 20% or even 30%  while galleries may charge even more. That said  among the 803 000 artists listed by Artprice  there are very different market profiles  and these differences usually depend primarily on which way the delicate balance between supply and demand is leaning.Artprice identifies four particularly singular profiles:Story continues1. The ""Great Masters"": a very limited supply with massive demandWhen Da Vinci's Salvator Mundi resurfaced in 2016 (after leaving Geneva's freeport)  few experts were able to predict its price would reach $450 million. Even today  the bidding battle between the two billionaires  one of whom was the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia  Mohammed bin Salman  remains shrouded in mystery. But there can be no doubt that the extreme rarity of Leonardo's works played a key role in the ""uncertainty"" surrounding the work's real market value.Indeed  it is precisely for these extremely sought-after signatures that sales guarantees were initially developed with the objective of reassuring sellers. This mechanism is becoming more systematic today; in the recent sale of the Paul G. Allen collection  all of the pieces are guaranteed by the auctioneer. Among them  a unique painting by Gustave Klimt that had been offered at auction for two years finally sold for $104 million.The markets for works by Grand Masters are surrounded by clusters of works with related attributions ""school of""  ""follower of""  ""circle of""  etc. In November 2022  Christie's in Paris sold a Salvator Mundi ""after Leonardo da Vinci"" for $1.1 million (including fees)  although the work was estimated between $10 000 and $15 000.www.artprice.com/artist/17205/leonardo-da-vinci/painting/28647612/salvator-mundi2. Blue-chip Artists: a regular supply with high demandOn the other hand  works by artists like Picasso and Monet  essentially paintings  are traded in sufficient numbers each year for it to be possible to follow the general evolution of prices. Auctions can always be directly affected by particular events  passionate overspending  or even negative circumstances  but the value of works by these artists generally follows a relatively mechanical logic based on the most recent results for similar pieces.The Artprice100© index is focused on such signatures  and while their prices have generally soared over the past twenty years  fractionalization solutions make it possible to invest in their works without having to pay the full acquisition price (via financial participation).Some of these artists have also produced drawings and prints  and in some cases in large quantities  and these works allow collectors to acquire 'smaller' pieces that can also become very valuable. In March 2022 an etching by Pablo Picasso titled Le repas frugal (1904) crossed the $8 million threshold for the first time.www.artprice.com/artist/22796/pablo-picasso/print-multiple/26211054/le-repas-frugal3. Local Artists: an abundant supply with limited demandAs regards the lesser-known signatures in art history  the art auction market offers an abundant and extremely diversified range of works from almost every artistic period and movement (even if 'art history' per se is still largely dominated by white artists).For many of these signatures  more or less modest sales tend to occur in a single country or sometimes in a particular region. This may be because the demand is concentrated in one place  or because the results are generally higher there  or for simply historical reasons the works of these artists are offered for sale by auction houses that have become specialized in their works.For example  no less than 124 works by the German artist Hans Von Faber du Faur (1863-1940)  son of Otto Von Faber du Faur  were sold in 2022 for an average price of $200  to which were added 89 unsold lots. However  they were all offered in a single session hosted online on 14 July 2022 by the German auctioneer  Michael Zeller.4. Confidential Artists: a limited supply with little demandArtprice recorded a historic record number of art auction transactions in 2022: more than 1 million lots attributed to more than 170 000 artists. Of these  34 000 artists had one or more works offered at auction  but none reached the reserve price. In addition  more than two-thirds of all artists whose works were offered at auction in 2022 only appeared between one and five times. Unfortunately  this frequency is too low to calculate with any confidence the evolution of their prices.Nevertheless  it is sometimes among these signatures  a little out of fashion or forgotten  that the most amazing rediscoveries are made. This category also includes young visual artists who have not yet experienced their moment of glory.Using these four very different profiles  Artprice can begin the process of calculating the liquidity of artists on the art market. This parameter should be of interest to all collectors for whom the liquidity of works is of some importance  as well as to all users of new platforms offering solutions for financial investment solely in art.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image1-claude-monet-values-of-canvases-waterloo-bridge-series.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image2-breakdown-of-artists-lots-sold-at-auction-2022.png]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket.comArtmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov ). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  February 2  2023. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity”  which include Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity” are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Following Chris  Gwen will provide some comments on the company's outlook and guidance.I'll then review Core's two operating segments  detailing our progress and discussing the continued successful introduction and deployment of Core Lab technologies  as well as highlighting some of Core's operations and major projects worldwide. Then we'll open the phones for a Q&A session. I'll now turn the call over to Gwen for remarks on forward-looking statements.Gwen Gresham -- Senior Vice President and Head of Investor RelationsBefore we start the conference this morning  I'll mention that some of the statements we make during this call may include projections  estimates  and other forward-looking information. This would include any discussion of the company's business outlook. These types of forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K  as well as other reports and registration statements filed by us with the SEC and the AFM.We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise. Our comments also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release announcing our fourth quarter results. Those non-GAAP measures can also be found on our website.With that said  I'll pass the discussion back to Larry.Larry Bruno -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Gwen. For the fourth quarter of 2022  Core Lab achieved sequential improvement in revenue  operating income  operating margins  and EPS with strong incremental margins. These improvements translated into higher free cash flow  which enabled the company to reduce net debt by $11.7 million or 7%. We remain focused on executing our key financial strategies  including reducing debt and strengthening our balance sheet.For the full year 2022  revenue was $490 million  increasing by more than 4% compared to 2021. However  for 2022  revenue for the full year was adversely impacted by currency devaluation of the euro and British pound. Using a constant dollar exchange rate  2022 revenue would have been nearly $13 million higher. For the full company  operating margins for the fourth quarter grew to 12%  up from 11% in Q3.Full company sequential incremental margins ex items exceeded 80%  driven by a strong quarter in production enhancement. Reservoir description margins lagged after two successive quarters with very high incrementals  reflecting adverse impacts from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The Russia-Ukraine conflict posed a headwind to revenue in the fourth quarter and throughout most of 2022 as trading patterns for crude oil and derived products were disrupted in Europe  Russia  and Ukraine. For 2022  demand for laboratory services tied to the assay of crude oil and derived products in these regions declined in excess of $9 million year-over-year  offsetting growth in other international regions.Lastly  for the full company  quarter-over-quarter  EPS grew sequentially by 11% to $0.20 per share ex items. As we look ahead  Core will continue to execute on its key strategic objectives by: one  introducing new product and service offerings in key geographic markets; two  maintaining a lean and focused organization; and three  maintaining our commitment to delevering the company. Now to review Core Lab's strategies and the financial tenets that Core has used to build shareholder value over our 27-plus year history as a publicly traded company. The interest of our shareholders  clients  and employees will always be well-served by Core Lab's resilient culture  which relies on innovation  leveraging technology to solve problems  and dedicated customer service.I'll talk more about some of our latest innovations in the operational review section of this call. While we navigate through the current challenges and pursue growth opportunities  the company will remain focused on its three long-standing  long-term financial tenets  those being to maximize free cash flow  maximize return on invested capital  and returning excess free cash to our shareholders. Before moving on  I want to thank our employees for their dedication  loyalty  and adaptability in meeting all of our clients' needs  and for the commitment that many have shown as we navigate the moment and prepare for a more active market. I'll now turn it over to Chris for the detailed financial review.Chris Hill -- Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Larry. I would like to begin by highlighting a couple of announcements we made since our last call. As you may be aware  the company's shares were previously dual-listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Euronext Amsterdam Exchange. However  as we rationalize benefits versus the cost of maintaining the dual listing  we decided to delist the shares from the Amsterdam Exchange  which became effective in early December of last year.And following the delisting of the shares on January 17 of this year  we announced our plan to reorganize the company's corporate structure  which includes redomesticating the parent company from the Netherlands to the United States. The company and its board believes the redomestication will enhance long-term shareholder value by reducing administrative costs  simplifying the corporate structure  as well as gaining some operational efficiencies. The company filed a preliminary prospectus and proxy statement associated with the redomestication  which will require shareholder approval. We anticipate the redomestication transaction will be completed sometime in the first half of this year.Before we review the financial performance for the quarter  the guidance we gave on our last call and past calls specifically excluded the impact of any FX gains or losses and assumed an effective tax rate of 20%. So accordingly  our discussion today excludes any foreign exchange gain or loss for current and prior periods. Additionally  the GAAP financial results for the fourth quarter include a noncash adjustment of $1.9 million  which decreased stock compensation expense associated with performance share awards  which vested during the quarter. This adjustment has also been excluded from the discussion of our fourth quarter and full-year results.Now looking at the income statement. Revenue from continuing operations was $127.6 million in the fourth quarter  up slightly from $126 million in the prior quarter. The sequential increase in revenue was driven by growth in both the U.S. and international markets.However  nice growth in multiple international regions has been partially offset by continued disruptions caused by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict  which adversely impacted service revenue in the affected regions. Of this revenue  service revenue  which is more international  was $88.9 million for the quarter  up from $87.9 million last quarter. During the quarter  we saw nice sequential growth of 11% in the U.S.  which was led by our laboratory services and well diagnostic services. We also see nice sequential improvement in multiple international regions outside the areas impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.However  the Russia-Ukraine conflict has continued to disrupt the trading patterns and flow of oil in the affected regions. The realignment of these trading patterns still continues  and the realignment of these trading patterns has not been consistent or linear. For example  in Europe  our crude assay -- crude oil assay activity increased during the third quarter  but activity decreased again in the fourth quarter. The company believes these trading patterns will become more stable throughout 2023  and we will continue to monitor the changes to the trading patterns and appropriately adapt our operations accordingly.For the full year of 2022  service revenue of $347 million was relatively flat  compared to $344.3 million in 2021. As Larry mentioned  two main factors have adversely impacted our international revenue by over $20 million in 2022. The devaluation of certain currencies  primarily the euro and British pound  and disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict as we just discussed. Product sales  which is equally tied to North America and international activity  were $38.6 million for the quarter  up slightly compared to $38.1 million last quarter.International product sales for the quarter were up 15% sequentially  and our energetic sales to the U.S. market were also up sequentially. However  this growth was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $2 million in other product sales. For the full year of 2022  product sales revenue was -- of $142.8 million was up 13% from $125.9 million in 2021.Moving on to the cost of services ex items for the quarter are 78% of service revenue  which is comparable to last quarter. The service side of our business has been more impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Although we see improvements in absorption of costs and nice incremental margins in regions where activity is expanding  these gains are being offset by disruption to the business in other regions more directly impacted by the conflict. Cost of sales ex items in the fourth quarter was 79% of revenue and improved from 82% last quarter.The improvement this quarter was primarily driven by gains in manufacturing efficiencies and higher international sales. Manufacturing costs continue to increase due to inflation on materials and other operating costs. However  some of the impact has been mitigated through gains in manufacturing efficiencies and some improvement in pricing. G&A ex items for the quarter was $10.4 million  relatively flat compared to last quarter.For the full year of 2022  G&A ex items was $39.3 million  up from $37 million in 2021 due to restoration of employee compensation and benefits. For 2023  we expect G&A to be approximately $40 million to $42 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $4.1 million and comparable to last quarter. For the full year  depreciation and amortization expense was $17.2 million  down from $18.5 million in 2021.EBIT ex items for the quarter was $14.7 million  up 10% from $13.3 million last quarter and representing an EBIT margin of approximately 12%  which is also up from 11% last quarter. Operating income for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis was $15.6 million. And for the full year of 2022  EBIT ex items was $44.8 million  down from $52.3 million in the prior year. And on a GAAP basis  EBIT was $41.5 million for 2022 and $45.3 million in 2021.Interest expense was $3.1 million and comparable to last quarter. And interest expense ex items for the full year was $11.4 million  up slightly from $11 million in 2021. Although interest rates have significantly increased throughout 2022  the company has substantially offset the impact of this increase by reducing our outstanding debt. On a GAAP basis  interest expense for the full year of 2022 was $11.6 million  up from $9.2 million in 2021 as 2021 interest expense included a $1.4 million gain associated with settling some of our interest rate hedges last year.Income tax expense ex items and using an effective tax rate of 20% for the quarter was $2.3 million. On a GAAP basis  the company recorded income tax expense of $5.8 million for the quarter. And for the full year  income tax expense was $10.3 million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 34% for 2022. However  income tax expense was significantly increased in 2022 due to the devaluation of foreign currencies  primarily Turkey and the United Kingdom  which we discussed in prior quarters.Excluding the impact associated with the devaluation of the Turkish lira and British pound  the company's effective tax rate would have been approximately 18%. The effective tax rate will continue to be somewhat sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings across the globe and the impact of items discrete to each quarter. However  we continue to project the company's effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. Income from continuing operations ex items for the quarter was $9.3 million  up 11% sequentially from $8.3 million last quarter.For the full year 2022 ex items  it was $26.8 million  down from $33 million in 2021. GAAP income from continuing operations for the quarter was $6.7 million and for the full-year 2022 was $19.7 million. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations ex items was $0.20 for the quarter  up from $0.18 last quarter and was $0.57 for the full year of 2022. GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $0.14 for the quarter and $0.42 for the full year.Now moving on to the balance sheet. Receivables were $106.9 million at December 31  up $6.7 million from last quarter end. Our DSOs for the fourth quarter were at 70 days  also up when compared to 67 days last quarter. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of billings during the quarter and a slightly higher mix of international revenue  which generally has a longer collection period.Inventory finished the year at $60.4 million  up approximately $5.6 million from last quarter end. Inventory turns for the quarter were at 2.1  down from 2.3 in the last quarter  and primarily down due to shipping delays postponing some larger international sales into 2023. As previously highlighted  the company continues to experience an increase in cost of raw materials  labor  packaging and transportation costs  which are increasing the cost of inventory. Additionally  challenges in the supply chain persists  which will continue to require carrying a larger amount of inventory to help mitigate disruptions.We anticipate inventory turns will remain at similar levels  but we have a focused effort for improvement as we progress into 2023. On the liability side of the balance sheet  our long-term debt was $175 million at December 31 and was reduced by $10 million this quarter. Our debt is currently comprised of our senior notes at $135 million as well as $40 million outstanding under our bank revolving credit facilities. As Larry mentioned earlier  our free cash flow has also improved as the company's financial performance has improved the last couple of quarters.Our free cash flow continues to be focused on reducing outstanding debt. Considering cash of $15.4 million  our net debt was $159.6 million at year end  a reduction of $11.7 million this quarter  which also improved our leverage ratio to 2.29 from 2.42 at last quarter end. Since announcing the company's commitment and focus on reducing debt in the fourth quarter of 2019  we have reduced net debt by 46%. The company will continue applying free cash toward reducing debt so the company reaches its target leverage ratio of 1.5 or lower.Looking at cash flow. For the fourth quarter of 2022  cash flow from operating activities was $13.2 million. And after paying for $2 million of capex  our free cash flow was $11.2 million for the quarter. Our free cash flow generated this quarter is the highest we have achieved since the third quarter of 2020.Looking forward to 2023  we expect capex to modestly expand and will continue to remain in line with historical levels  but also be aligned with activity levels. For the full year of 2023  we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $12 million to $15 million which is an increase from $10.2 million in 2022. Core will continue our strict capital discipline and asset-light business model with capital expenditures primarily targeted at growth opportunities and initiatives. Core Lab's operational leverage continues to provide for the ability to grow revenue and profitability with minimal capital requirements.Capital expenditures have historically ranged from 2.5% to 4% of revenue even during periods of significant growth. That same level of laboratory infrastructure  intellectual property  and leverage exists in the business today. We believe evaluating a company's ability to generate free cash flow and free cash flow yield is an important metric for shareholders when comparing and projecting company's financial results. particularly for those shareholders who utilize discounted cash flow models to assess valuations.I will now turn it over to Gwen for an update on our guidance and outlook.Gwen Gresham -- Senior Vice President and Head of Investor RelationsThank you  Chris. Looking forward into 2023  we see crude oil macro fundamentals continuing to support a multiyear recovery cycle for the oil and gas industry. Crude oil demand for 2023 as forecasted by the International Energy Agency in January of this year is projected to increase by 1.9 million barrels per day to a record 101.7 million barrels per day as consumption in China grows  along with the reopening of its economy. As crude oil demand is projected to exceed pre-COVID levels  crude oil supply is projected to tighten.Production growth continues to face constraints due to prolonged underinvestment in many regions around the globe  as well as natural decline of production from existing fields. As a result  we expect operators to expand their upstream spending plans for 2023 by mid-teens compared to 2022. This supports our continued improvement in international onshore and offshore activity with projects emerging and underway  most notably across the Middle East  Latin America  and West Africa regions. Moving on to the U.S.We see similar challenges with crude oil supply  which should require increased spending by operators to grow and replace production. While operators remain focused on capital discipline  2023 forecast indicate their U.S. upstream spending will increase by approximately 15% year-over-year. Turning to the first quarter of 2023.We anticipate reservoir description to be down low to mid-single digits sequentially. There are two factors causing the sequential decline in revenue. First  the typical seasonal industry pattern  which will cause activity in the first quarter to decline in some regions; and second  continued volatility with crude oil trading patterns  which may impact reservoir description's international growth within its Russian  Ukrainian  and European operations. Helping to offset these revenue headwinds  we will see an increase in international upstream project activity  which is currently underway.For production enhancement  revenue is estimated to be up mid-single digits as U.S. land activity is projected to recover from normal seasonal declines experienced at year-end. We project first-quarter 2023 revenue to range from $125 million to $129 million and operating income of $11.5 million to $14.5 million  yielding operating margins of approximately 10%. EPS for the first quarter is expected to range from $0.14 to $0.19.The company's first-quarter guidance is based on projections for underlying operations and excludes gains and losses in foreign exchange. First-quarter guidance also assumes an effective tax rate of 20%. Now I'll pass the discussion back to Larry.Larry Bruno -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Gwen. First  I'd like to thank our global team of employees for providing innovative solutions  integrity  and superior service to our clients. The team's collective dedication to servicing our clients is the foundation of Core Lab's success. Turning first to reservoir description.For the fourth quarter of 2022  revenue came in at just over $78 million  down slightly compared to Q3. When looking at revenue growth for reservoir description  it is important to consider the sharp devaluation of the euro and the British pound. These currency devaluations lowered reservoir description revenue for the full year of more than $12 million using 2021 exchange rates. Operating income for reservoir description ex items was $6 million  and operating margins were 8%.Growth across most regions was offset by impacts from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Demand for crude oil and derived product assay work across Europe  Russia  and Ukraine  which rebounded somewhat during Q3  subsequently slowed in Q4 as sanctions became formalized. As previously discussed  we expect continued volatility in demand for these laboratory services as global trading patterns realign. However  as Gwen mentioned  the International Energy Agency recently forecast crude oil demand for 2023 to average a record high 101.7 million barrels per day  up by 1.9 million barrels per day from 2022 even after assessing global financial forecasts.This bodes well for growing demand for reservoir description's assay work. As we look ahead  while still well below pre-COVID levels  we see the growing international rig count as a harbinger of an improving landscape for reservoir description  a trend that we project will play out for the next several years  particularly in the Middle East  North and South America  and most other regions. Early movers in the oilfield service sector that are more exposed to well construction have already felt the impact of the cycle shift. As projects progress into field appraisal  field development  and eventually production  demand for Core Lab's reservoir description services will rise accordingly.Now for some operational highlights from the fourth quarter. Core Lab's reservoir description services were employed on both U.S. and international projects to help our clients evaluate their assets and develop programs to optimize production. Under the direction of a South American national oil company  Core Lab conducted a series of enhanced oil recovery and flow assurance studies for a multi-well onshore program that is evaluating the use of CO2 rich injection gases.This laboratory work is determining the impact of blending the CO2-rich gases with existing reservoir fluids and are providing the basis for advanced equation of state modeling. While defining the gas injection  parameters for successful field application are critical to improving crude oil recoveries. Operators must also assess the potential for the injected CO2 to unintendedly cause flocculation of asphalt teams. These long-chain asphaltene molecules can clog cores in the rock and impair permeability  thus reducing the effectiveness of CO2 injection programs.Broadly  CO2 injection projects like this reflect a globally expanding interest in enhanced oil recovery and carbon capture and storage technologies. When properly evaluated with rigorous laboratory testing  injecting CO2 into hydrocarbon-bearing subsurface formations can simultaneously improve oil recovery and reduce CO2 emissions. Also during the fourth quarter of 2022  Core completed an integrated study on conventional core from a lower Barnett Shale pilot well in the Permian Basin. Key objectives of the study were to evaluate the resource potential of the strata and identify landing zone targets that will optimize stimulation and hydrocarbon production.Core analysis data acquired from the pilot well was benchmarked against key performance indicators from 21 wells in Core Lab's proprietary Woodford-Barnett joint industry project to provide insights into future production potential of the play. Core applied its new proprietary prism mudstone laboratory workflow  which combines advanced petrophysical and geochemical technologies  including measurements from high-frequency nuclear magnetic resonance and multi-rate pyrolysis to also provide rapid assessment of mobile versus nonmobile hydrocarbons in the rocks. The prism workflow also refined petrophysical models and allow for refined calibration of downhole logs  which in turn resulted in an increase in both calculated reserves and estimated ultimate recovery. Moving now to production enhancement  where Core Lab technologies continue to help our clients optimize their well completions.Revenue for production enhancement came in at $49 million  up 5% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year. Operating income ex items was $7.7 million  while operating margins were 16% for the fourth quarter of 2022  and sequential margins were more than 100%. During the fourth quarter of 2022  Core Lab continued to build on the success of its X-SPAN casing and tubing patch technology. The industry-leading versatility and reliability of the X-SPAN system yield significant savings in the remediation of all types of wells with casing damage  ranging from oil and gas producers through the disposal and geothermal wells.Recently  an operator in Alaska had casing leaks in a horizontal water disposal well at 4 different depths over a 5 000-foot interval. As the disposal well were to become unavailable  hydrocarbon production from nearby oil and gas wells would need to be severely curtailed. Remedial steps that would have otherwise required a workover rig would have been both costly and time-consuming. Instead  Core Lab experts recommended placing four separate expand patches via wireline with a configuration that would enable operations in this highly deviated wellbore.All four patches were successfully deployed  set on depth  and the well passed the mandatory mechanical integrity tests required by state authorities. This allows the disposal operation to continue Rigless intervention to repair the well with X-SPAN resulted in significant cost savings and enable the nearby producing wells to maintain hydrocarbon output. To date  Core Lab has run over 100 000 feet of proprietary casing and tubing patches. The X-SPAN system has a proven track record of reliability and is one of the most effective solutions of its type.That concludes our operational review. We appreciate your participation  and Drew will now open the call for questions.Questions & Answers:Operator[Operator instructions] The first question comes from Samantha Hoh with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.Gwen Gresham -- Senior Vice President and Head of Investor RelationsGood morning  Samantha.Samantha Hoh -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystHey  guys. How's it going? Thanks for taking my call. I wanted to maybe dig in a little bit in just the contrast of the two projects that you highlighted in RD. It's kind of interesting that in Latin America  you guys are doing all this work on EOR and coassurance.But then in the U.S.  you're kind of evaluating resource potential of the partner shale  which I haven't really thought of in a while. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about that. Just could we be seeing just like a switch at some point  where the U.S. shale players  I think  a little bit more about just EOR? I mean you guys spent so much time to talk about permissible floods in the past.So I'm just kind of curious if there's any sort of pickup in interest in trying to get a little bit more production out of existing wells in the U.S.Larry Bruno -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. So let's unravel a little bit. The project I talked about on the Barnett  I think most people  perhaps mistakenly  assume that everything is known about the variability in reservoir quality across the U.S. unconventional plays. That's not the case.We have a good perspective on that because we've done work for -- in all the basins  multi-company studies where we've gotten to see everybody's results. And so there are areas of higher quality and lower quality reservoir rock. Over time  technology has helped to bring forward the productive potential of lower-quality rock. But people are always aware that  hey  they've done -- they've cherry-picked  in many cases  some of the better quality areas that they had.They did exactly what you and I would have done during tough times. They focused their efforts on their best opportunities. And now as people move into  call it  peripheral or second-tier opportunities  they've got to assess what's the quality of the rock and how much movable oil there is. On the -- particularly on the question of EOR and unconventionals  we've been on the forefront of that for quite some time.We have a joint industry project that has assessed the viability of doing gas injection to strip additional hydrocarbons out of the rock. We won't give you the results of that because  quite frankly  we sell the results of that to our clients. But we have demonstrated in the lab that with the right combination of injection gases and the right existing oil in place in the ground that recovery can be substantially improved  and there are a number of companies that are doing that right now. The EOR project in South America that I talked about today  I think we wanted to highlight that one a bit because there is a growing worldwide  I'll call it  reaction to  hey  there's going to be a lot of CO2 that's going to be captured and available for EOR projects.I think if you look back historically  there would have been more CO2 injection for enhanced oil recovery if large  long-term reliable sources of CO2 were available. Well  regulations are now creating that environment where CO2 is going to be captured in lot quantities and available for long periods of time. And so we're seeing it across the globe. There is an increased attention to  hey  I can take some of that CO2 that's coming from an emission point.And if I put that into my reservoir  what can I get in terms of additional oil recovery? And that's going on in North America. It's going on all over the globe.Samantha Hoh -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystJust one real quick follow-up on that. Can you take associated gas and treat it and do whatever  and then use it for injection for -- to boost production?Larry Bruno -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  absolutely. And in fact  that was the focus of our -- or one of the primary focuses of our EOR study on unconventional reservoirs  was to take available gases associated either with nearby production or simultaneous from the well  and then look at what chemical changes  what composition you would need to achieve  maybe adding some propane or dialing in some ethane  getting the right chemistry of the associated gases or available gases and going back into the same wellbores that you've been producing. And that goes through a soaking process. The physics involved in that are different than a traditional gas flood where the main driver was to push  drive oil from injections to producers.Rather  in this case  the injected gas vaporizes some of that oil. And then as it's withdrawn and the pressures dropped  that oil drops out of the injection gases. And so this is a multi-cycle process that goes on where we keep adjusting the chemistry of the gas for injection to get the most oil out  and there are companies that are doing that today.Samantha Hoh -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystOK. Great. Maybe for my next question  just a little bit on the PE side. What are you anticipating in terms of the energetic sales? Obviously  a rebound here in the frac activity.I'm just kind of curious what you're expecting throughout the year in terms of demand for your energetic products  the type of seasonal trends  I guess  we should be thinking about for PE beyond the current quarter.Gwen Gresham -- Senior Vice President and Head of Investor RelationsYeah. Samantha  we think that for PE and our energetic product sales will continue to have market penetration with that as well as benefit from activity that will go on throughout 2023. We have seen  as we've started the year that we're on a bit of a climb-out  let's say  from Q4 from the holidays. So we're not quite back to pre-holiday  let's say  frac spread levels.But we can see that we're starting to move in that direction  so we think it's gonna be another nice year of healthy activity.Samantha Hoh -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystAre you guys anticipating like much of an increase in frac activity this year? This year  I think  there's a bit of debate in terms of what the demand is and the movement across the basins.Chris Hill -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So this is Chris. I think what we're seeing is at least we exited. If you look at where we were in Q4  it was at a pretty high level  I think the frac spread either approached to reach 300.And like Gwen was saying  we're kind of dipped off as the holidays were in  which is very typical. And then it sort of rebounds as we begin the new year  and we're seeing that as well. So we think it's gonna come back to that 300 level  but we think there are some headwinds to growth there. The rigs are kind of full up  and the frac spreads are also kind of full up.But as companies start to bring new equipment online  we do think that that will be put to work  and maybe there's more opportunity for some growth from where we kind of exited the year as we get a little deeper into 2023.Larry Bruno -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think I'd sum it up by saying we think in total  2023 will be a better year for energetic sales in 2022  yeah  year over year. Yeah  in the U.S. and globally year over year.Gwen Gresham -- Senior Vice President and Head of Investor RelationsThank you  Samantha.Samantha Hoh -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystThanks  guys.OperatorThe next question comes from Simon Galligani with Awilco AS. Please go ahead.Gwen Gresham -- Senior Vice President and Head of Investor RelationsHi  Simon.Simon Galligani -- Awilco AS -- AnalystGood morning  guys. Thanks for taking my question. I saw that you acquired own shares for about 1.6 million in the fourth quarter  which  I guess  is the first buyback since the innovation. I know that you guys are focused on bringing the leverage ratio down to 1.5%.But should we read into this that you'll gradually resume buybacks simultaneously as you continue to reduce the leverage ratio?Chris Hill -- Chief Financial OfficerHey  Simon  this is Chris. So when you think about the share buybacks  think about that in maybe two buckets. One is where we go into the open market and buy back shares. The other bucket is when employees have share awards that vest.They have the opportunity  or they generally will sell those shares that are for tax  their tax burden associated with that to the company. So we will buy those shares from the employee to settle their tax burden associated with the vesting awards. And that's what you saw in the fourth quarter. We did not go out to the open market and buy any shares.Having said that  once we get our leverage ratio down to where at least we're getting toward the target  we've got more clear sight on what the forecast looks like  absolutely  we could see ourselves getting more active in the share buyback program off the open market.Simon Galligani -- Awilco AS -- AnalystOK. Thank you for the clarity  and yeah  the comment there.Gwen Gresham -- Senior Vice President and Head of Investor RelationsThank you  Simon.Larry Bruno -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think we've got a little bit of a crowded earnings release date. So since we're not seeing any other questions  we'll end right there. In summary  Core's operational leadership continues to position the company for improving client activity levels in both the U.S. and international markets for 2023 and beyond.We have never been better operationally or technologically positioned to help our global client base  optimize their reservoirs  and to address their evolving needs. We remain uniquely focused and are the most technologically advanced  client-focused reservoir optimization company in the oilfield service sector. The company will remain focused on maximizing free cash and returns on invested capital. In addition to our quarterly dividends  we'll bring value to our shareholders via growth opportunities  driven by both the introduction of problem-solving technologies and new market penetration.In the near term  Core will continue to use free cash to strengthen this balance sheet and while always investing in growth opportunities. So in closing  we thank and appreciate all of our shareholders and the analysts that cover Core Lab. The executive management team and the board of Core Laboratories give a special thanks to our worldwide employees that have made these results possible. We're proud to be associated with their continuing achievements.So thanks for spending time with us  and we look forward to our next update.

NFL-101 is derived from a subcutaneous desensitization treatment that was developed by the Pasteur Institute against tobacco allergies in tobacco factory workers. Used over the counter by a French doctor on more than 10 000 smokers  the repositioned extract showed promising results in smoking cessation that were supported by a retrospective study. NFL-101 is a standardized version for pharmaceutical use.The study will be conducted by the Pharmacological Neuroimaging team of the CEA. It will focus on following  by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging  the modifications in the cerebral function associated with the development of tobacco addiction in mice  in order to highlight the central effects of NFL-101 treatment in this context. The expected duration of this study is 9 months.Bruno Lafont  Chief Operating Officer and co-founder of NFL Biosciences: ""This research is intended to better understand how NFL-101 can act on tobacco dependence. In the clinical setting  NFL-101 is only administered once or twice  yet current treatments must be administered daily for 3 months. In the case of varenicline (Champix®  Chantix®) treatment starts for three times a day and continues twice a day for many weeks.”For Nicolas Tournier  pharmacologist  radiopharmacist and head of the Pharmacological Neuroimaging team at the CEA: ""This project takes full advantage of the potential of molecular imaging to highlight the effects of drugs on the brain  particularly in the context of the treatment of tobacco addiction. The non-invasive and translational nature of the imaging techniques used could reveal an activity based on communication between the immune system and the central nervous system  different from the modes of action of current smoking cessation drugs that target nicotine receptors.”The results  which may be the subject of a joint scientific publication  will complement the CESTO II and PRECESTO clinical studies with a view to increase the overall attractiveness of NFL-101 to pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in licensing it.About NFL BiosciencesNFL Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company based in the Montpellier area which develops botanical drug candidates for the treatment of addictions.

Today  the Company has a dual listing  with shares traded in both New York and Milan.The dual listing was adopted in 2013  when US-listed CNH Global N.V. merged with Milan-listed Fiat Industrial SpA to form CNH Industrial N.V.

The FDA letter indicates that the Agency agrees to a defined list of conditions that could enable clinical evaluation of MaaT013 in the U.S. These measures will be included  by the Company  in the IND filing. The communication therefore provides a path forward regarding MaaT Pharma’s “pooling” technology for this IND. The Company will promptly prepare a complete response letter and in the interim  the clinical hold remains.“ We appreciate the FDA’s continued commitment and are satisfied that the Agency has provided a clear and  we believe  achievable roadmap for the MaaT013 IND ” said Hervé Affagard  CEO and co-founder of MaaT Pharma. “ The dialogue with the FDA remains constructive and positive as it lays the groundwork for the clinical evaluation of our pipeline in the U.S. We are confident about implementing the next steps and we will update investors in due course.”As announced in August 2022  the FDA had requested further clinical and manufacturing-related information including data on the safety and efficacy of the Company’s “pooling” technology approach (i.e.  mixing donations from multiple donors to achieve higher richness  diversity  and better standardization of the product). The Company submitted to the FDA detailed responses to these requests as announced in the press release dated January 24  2023. In parallel  and as a reminder  the Company continues the development of MaaT013 in Europe with its ongoing international multicenter open-label  single arm  pivotal Phase 3 trial “ARES” evaluating MaaT013  which is progressing as planned. A review by an independent data safety and monitoring board (DSMB)  is expected in the first half of 2023 after enrollment of half of the patients in the study.Separately from the information above  MaaT Pharma reported its cash position as of December 31  2022  and its revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022.Cash position1As of December 31  2022  total cash and cash equivalents were EUR 35.2 million  as compared to EUR 40.3 million as of September 30  2022 and EUR 43.3 million as of December 31  2021. The net decrease in cash over the fourth quarter 2022 was EUR 5.1 million reflecting financing of operations and the ongoing development programs fully in line with the plans. As announced in a press release on January 24  2023  the Company has extended its cash runway to end of Q4 2023  as compared to end of Q3 2023 as previously announced.Revenues in Q4 20231MaaT Pharma reported gross revenues of EUR 0.6 million for the quarter ended December 31  2022  compared with EUR 0.4 million for the same period of 2021.

To achieve its development goals  the Group implemented an investment plan: strengthening sales and customer service teams (technicians and instructors)  opening new branches to be closer to its customers.Annual revenue in Belgium was down 4.08% to €2.49m (this Business Unit represents 1.17% of total Group revenue in 2022).The Belgian pharmacy sector is continuing its transition to a business model with a greater focus on the profitability of its structures. While the situation has stabilized with pharmacy groups through the joint efforts of the Customer Service and R&D departments  this Business Unit is continuing to strengthen its position with the independent companies. With the new id. version and the launch of electronic labels  the sales team has considerable strengths.Annual revenue of the Digital Communication Business Unit rose 12.64% to €2.63m.In addition to the well-known pharmaceutical companies  the Group has also expanded its portfolio with the addition of smaller companies. This business mix (catalogue management  communication and/or notification services  statistics) has enabled the Business Unit to maintain a steady revenue stream. In 2022  it completed 165 communication campaigns for nearly 80 partners.The AXIGATE LINK Division had revenue of €32.61m at 31 December 2022  a 15.00% increase from one year earlier.

This Division accounted for 7.91% of total Equasens Group's revenue for 2022. e -Connect Business Unit: +5.10% to €13.45m.Adopting a second life CSR strategy enabled this Business Unit to grow despite constraints imposed by supply chain difficulties for electronic components that were correctly anticipated. To limit its effects  the Business Unit thus decided to accelerate its strategy of increasing the diversification of its manufacturing subcontracting.The Frailty Management sector (NOVIAcare solutions) declined 49.55% to €0.03m (this Business Unit accounted for 0.01% of total Group revenue in 2022).The business development action plan is starting to produce results and has boosted the marketing of the LIVIAHOME by NOVIAcare offering by increasing its access to the general public thanks to its integration into the BOULANGER Marketplace in particular. In Europe  qualified partners and manufacturers (including Netherlands  Belgium  Germany) have approved the first orders of units to be delivered in the first months of 2023.The Compliance Business Unit (which in 2022 combined the activities of CAREMEDS  MULTIMEDS and I-MEDS): +11.98% to €3.45m.The Business Unit maintained its level of growth. The acquisition of 100% control of these activities will accelerate the Group's development of these offerings for the European customers of the Group's Divisions and strengthen its position in the European markets (particularly in the UK and Germany).The MEDICAL SOFT Division (which includes the activity of PROKOV EDITIONS integrated in Q4 2021) had annual revenue of €6.22m (+106.90% in Q4 2022 from the same period in 2021).

My name is Alex and I'll be coordinating the call today. I'll now hand over to your host  Katia Gonzalez  Investor Relations and Senior Analyst. Katia  please go ahead.Katia Gonzalez: Good morning.

With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher  Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner  Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson  President; and Lynn Martin  President of the NYSE. I'll now turn the call over to Warren.Warren Gardiner: Thanks  Katya. Good morning  everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide four with some of the key highlights from our fourth quarter results. Net revenues of $1.8 billion were driven by transaction revenues of $828 million and recurring revenues of $940 million  up 4% year-over-year. For the full year revenues totaled $7.3 billion  also up 4% versus last year. Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $740 million  and we're within our guidance range  including approximately $5 million of additional severance. This strong performance helped to drive fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share $1.25 and full year adjusted EPS of $5.30  an increase of 5% versus 2021. 2022  free cash flow totaled a record $2.9 billion  which enabled us to return nearly $1.5 billion to shareholders while also continuing to make strategic investments across our business.In addition  we have received Board authorization to increase our quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.42 per share  beginning in the first quarter of 2023  extending our 10-year track record of double digit dividend growth. Now let's move to Slide five  where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Fourth quarter net revenues totaled $982 million. Transaction revenues of over $600 million were driven in part by 11% growth in agricultural commodities  and 13% growth in our equity derivatives business. Importantly  open interest trends remain strong across our futures and options in January  including 14% growth in global natural gas and 24% growth in LIBOR. Recurring revenues  which include our exchange data services  and our NYSC listings business increased by 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.Customer growth  particularly within our energy exchange data was partially offset by slower growth in our listings business. While industry wide capital markets activity was relatively muted. It's worth noting that despite a slower year for IPOs  across the globe  we had a record year for listing transfers was 34  including more operating companies in the last three years combined. For the full year exchange segment  revenues increased by 8%  including a 33% increase in our interest rate business  a 20% increase in equity derivatives  and an 8% increase in our global natural gas revenues. Turning now to Slide six  I'll discuss our fixed income and data services segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled a record $537 million up 13% versus a year ago.Transaction revenues increased by 89%  including 182% growth in ICE bonds  and 66% growth in our CDS Clearing business. Similar to last quarter  this strong growth was driven by market volatility  higher interest rates and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bond platforms. Recurring revenue growth of 3% was driven by demand for additional capacity on ICE global network  as well as strong growth across our desktop  feeds and analytics offerings. We're beginning to see a return on the investments we've made in both enhance content and functionality. This performance is a key driver of our other data and network services business which increased by 8% in the fourth quarter  and 10%  excluding the impact of the Euronext migration.Somewhat offsetting with slower growth in our end-of-day pricing business  we're experiencing a slower sales cycle and pressure from asset base revenues in our index business  which declined double digits year-over-year  as investors shifted out of higher fee risk assets  such as equities and corporate bonds  and communities and treasury ETFs. For the full year  total segment  revenues totaled a record $2.1 billion up 13%. While adjusted operating margins expanded by 500 basis points  as anticipated recurring revenue grew 4% for the year and it was up 5% after adjusting for Euronext. Let's go next to Slide seven  where I'll discuss our Mortgage Technology Segment. Fourth quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $249 million. Recurring revenues which accounted for two-thirds of segment revenues totaled $164 million and grew 10% year-over-year.These strong recurring revenues continue to drive out performance versus an industry that experienced a nearly 60% decline in origination volumes. Importantly  they've now less revenues increased by over 30% year-over-year. For the full year  Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $1.1 billion  including a 16% increase in our recurring revenues  and a 24% increase in our data analytics revenues. And while industry volumes were actually below those seen three years ago in 2020 -- in 2019  pro forma 2022 Mortgage Technology revenues are higher by nearly 50%  representing a CAGR of roughly 14%. I'll conclude my remarks on Slide eight with some additional guidance. Recurring revenues in 2023 were once again be led by our Mortgage Technology segment  where we are expecting mid to high single digit growth  a testament to the continued adoption of automation across the mortgage workflow.Office  Work  CollegePhoto by Damir Kopezhanov on UnsplashIn our fixed income and data services segment  we expect recurring revenue growth  excluding headwinds of approximately $15 million related to FX and the Euronext data center migration to once again be in the mid-single digits. And lastly  in our Exchange segment  we expect recurring revenue growth excluding a $20 million headwind from the cessation of LIBOR to be in the low single digits. As continued growth in our energy exchange data services is offset by fewer IPOs and the tapering of 2021 initial listing fees. Moving to expenses  we expect 2023 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $3.04 to $3.09 billion. Consistent with prior years  we will reward our employees for their contributions to our strong results  and therefore expect cash compensation expense to increase by approximately $20 to $40 million.Strategic investments in technology operations and revenue related initiatives are expected to increase by $40 to $50 million  driven by higher licensees as well as investments across all three of our segments. In addition  we expect roughly $45 million to $55 million of incremental noncash expense  including $25 million of D&A related to the rebuild of Ellie Mae CapEx. And lastly  we expect an FX benefit to our adjusted expenses by approximately $5 million to $15 million when compared to 2022. In summary  we delivered another record year of revenues  operating income  free cash flow and earnings per share. Across our business  we made strategic investments in future growth and as we enter 2023  we are well positioned to meet the evolving needs of our customers  once again  deliver profitable growth and create value for our shareholders.I'll be happy to take questions during Q&A. But for now  I'll hand it over to Ben.Benjamin Jackson: Thank you  Warren  and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. 2022 was a year marked by rising inflation  rising interest rates and continued geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Amidst this dynamic macroeconomic environment  we once again grew revenues  operating income and earnings per share  record results that are a testament to the resiliency and durability of our strategically diversified business model. In our financial futures markets  rising inflation and central bank activity across the globe presented an interest rate environment that has not been seen in generation  helping us drive 20% volume growth in our interest rate complex and 15% growth in our equity derivatives business.Across our global energy markets  the events unfolding across North America  Europe  Russia and Asia have triggered a reshaping of the global energy supply chain  creating new risks and uncertainties for market participants to navigate. In our global natural gas markets  an evolving energy supply chain in Europe has led to increased demand for global liquefied natural gas  or LNG  and has helped us drive a 17% increase in global gas volumes in 2022. This includes 24% growth in our North American gas business  which has benefited not only from increased commercial engagement with our Henry Hub contract but also our North American basis markets. These trends have continued into January with global natural gas open interest up 14% year-over-year  including 21% growth in North America.Although our European carbon markets experienced headwinds in 2022 due to the aforementioned factors  the secular trend towards cleaner energy continues and is a growth trend we are uniquely positioned to capture  as evidenced by the record year in our North American environmental markets with volumes up 5% year-over-year in 2022. As we look out over the longer term  corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. This is an evolution that we've long envisioned and is one of the largest providers of environmental products  including renewable fuel contracts  carbon allowances  nature-based solutions  renewable energy certificates as well as the wealth of climate data and related into season analytics.We are excited about the many future growth opportunities that lie ahead. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business. Our comprehensive platform continues to generate compounding revenue growth and delivered another year of record revenues in 2022. This strong growth was underpinned by both recurring and transaction revenue growth  again a testament to the strategic diversification of our business and our ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environments. Rising market uncertainty and interest rates are driving an increase in demand for credit protection  and we have seen this lead to increasing trading activity in our bonds business. These factors  coupled with our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bonds platforms  continued to record full year revenues -- to record revenues in our ICE Bonds business in 2022 up nearly 100% year-over-year.Turning now to our Mortgage business  increased workflow efficiency through continued electronification is a secular trend we believe will continue through a variety of mortgage origination environments. Our ability to capture this secular trend is evidenced by the strength and resiliency of our recurring revenues  which increased 16% in 2022. This continued strength is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate this analog to digital conversion. As mortgage origination volumes have normalized  customer conversations have increasingly centered on efficiencies and automation. In the fourth quarter  we had our strongest quarter of last year in terms of sales to new customers of our loan origination system with wins across each major segment we service.In addition  there continues to be increased interest in our data and analytics products  which increased 31% in the quarter and 24% for the full year in 2022. Through our AIQ solution and analyzer tools customers can save thousands of dollars per loan by leveraging our data and analytics tools to drive automation in the loan manufacturing process. We are pleased that the value of our offerings continues to resonate with lenders  and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to accelerate the analog to digital conversion. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.Jeff Sprecher: Thank you  Ben. Good morning  everyone  and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 10. I want to begin by touching on our pending acquisition of Black Knight. As communicated  when making the announcement  we continued to believe that this transaction will close during the first half of this year. Our respect for the Federal Trade Commission's work on this matter  and as we cooperate with them to gain regulatory approval  we do not intend to comment further on the transaction. But importantly  we remain excited about the efficiencies that the combined entities will bring to the end consumer and to other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem. In that vein  and shifting to what was yet another successful year  2022 marked our 17th consecutive year of record revenues  record operating income and record adjusted earnings per share.This track record of growth reflects on the quality of our strategy and  more importantly  on the execution of that strategy. We've intentionally diversified across asset classes and geographies  so that we're not tied to any one cyclical trend or macroeconomic environment. We've deliberately positioned the company to have a mix of transaction and compounding subscription revenues to provide upside exposure while hedging our downside risk. We've placed the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog to digital conversion. The combination of these factors is what has made ICE an all-weather name and a business model that provides upside to volatility with less downside risk and  importantly  a business model that generates growth on top of growth.For example  in 2022  inflationary concerns and market speculation of central bank activity benefited our European and U.K. interest rate business  driving a 33% increase in revenues for the full year. These conditions also contributed to record full year revenues in our credit default swap clearing business  up 61% year-over-year  as rate volatility drove increased demand for risk management and credit protection. Across our mortgage business  even against this backdrop of rising interest rates  our business outperformed the broader market driven by strong recurring revenue growth  up 16% for the full year. Again  this is a reflection of the all-weather nature of our business model. As we look to 2023 and beyond  we're positioned to capitalize on the secular and cyclical trends occurring across asset classes  and we remain focused on executing on the many growth opportunities that are in front of us  extending our track record of growth.I'd like to conclude by thanking our customers for their business and for their trust in 2022  and I want to thank my colleagues for their contributions to the best year in our company's history. And with that  I'll turn the call back over to our operator  Alex  who will conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time.See also 21 Best Dating Apps of 2023 and 10 Hot EV Stocks To Buy .To continue reading the Q&A session  please click here.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.43,0.21,0.36,True,English,"['Earnings Call Transcript', 'Intercontinental Exchange', 'ICE', 'industry wide capital markets activity', 'ICE Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call', 'Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses', 'fourth quarter 2022 earnings release', 'global natural gas revenues', 'double digit dividend growth', 'Fourth quarter net revenues', 'full year exchange segment', 'Fourth quarter revenues', 'customary regulatory approval', 'constant currency basis', 'Chief Financial Officer', 'open interest trends', 'data services segment', 'fourth quarter results', 'exchange data services', 'energy exchange data', 'interest rate business', 'CDS Clearing business', 'free cash flow', 'Form S-4 filing', 'equivalent GAAP terms', 'last three years', 'NYSC listings business', 'ICE common stock', '10-year track record', 'full year revenues', 'core business performance', 'equity derivatives business', '2022 Earnings Call Transcript', 'adjusted earnings', 'last quarter', 'transaction-based expenses', 'operating companies', 'first quarter', 'quarterly dividend', 'Intercontinental Exchange', 'earnings supplement', 'earnings materials', 'diluted earnings', 'last year', 'cash operations', 'recurring revenues', '2022 Form 10-K', 'GAAP measures', 'slower year', 'record year', 'Investor Relations', 'Senior Analyst', 'Investors section', 'current judgment', 'other filings', 'Black Knight', 'first half', 'registration statement', 'proxy statement', 'additional information', 'explanatory notes', 'second page', 'additional details', 'Jeff Sprecher', 'Ben Jackson', 'Lynn Martin', 'key highlights', 'guidance range', 'additional severance', 'strong performance', 'strategic investments', 'Board authorization', 'agricultural commodities', 'listing transfers', 'fixed income', 'ICE bonds', 'transaction revenues', 'Katia Gonzalez', 'forward-looking statements', 'Warren Gardiner', 'Customer growth', 'slower growth', 'Good morning', 'revenue growth', '11% growth', '13% growth', '14% growth', '24% growth', '182% growth', '66% growth', 'February', 'Operator', 'Webcast', 'name', 'Alex', 'host', 'presentation', 'items', 'replay', 'obligation', 'risks', 'assumptions', 'uncertainties', 'description', 'connection', 'shares', 'prospectus', 'reconciliation', 'references', 'definition', 'Chair', 'CEO', 'President', 'NYSE', 'Katya', 'everyone', 'Slide', 'EPS', 'increase', 'shareholders', 'overview', 'part', 'futures', 'options', 'January', 'LIBOR', 'IPOs', 'globe']",2023-02-03,2023-02-03,finance.yahoo.com

London-based ION Trading UK had succumbed to a cyberattack.Suddenly  in offices across the globe  traders and brokers turned to spreadsheets to keep track of their deals  firms resorted to inputting individual trades on websites provided by exchanges  and employees explained to their families why they were going into work at night  according to people with a view of the scene.It was like being back in the 1980s  before electronic trading took off  or in the 1990s  when the web was just starting to change the world. But there was a key difference — the banks and brokers handling client trades on bourses including Intercontinental Exchange Inc.  CME Group Inc. and Cboe Global Markets no longer have hordes of employees ensuring deals are confirmed  processed and settled.“The cyberattack on ION reminds us all that despite best efforts by any organization to protect itself  these issues will occur  and market participants need to be continuously vigilant and prepared for such instances ” said Joseph Schifano  head of regulatory affairs at Eventus  a trade surveillance software firm.For the derivatives market  it was a slap in the face. Not only did companies lack adequate staff to meet the crisis  but many of the workers were too young to know how to keep operations afloat. It was also the second time in just one week that a major market had been humbled. A human error at the New York Stock Exchange set off violent price swings at the start of trading on Jan. 24.Story continuesBanks and other financial firms frequently label cyber risk as among those they fear most — as the interconnectedness of the financial system has the potential to amplify the ramifications from any attack. Both incidents also underscored how vital the plumbing underpinning trading processes can be  and that however sophisticated they may be  vulnerabilities lurk.Attack ConfirmedION first noticed an issue was preventing access to some of its systems at 2:30 a.m. London time. It took the Dublin-based firm — founded by Italian tycoon Andrea Pignataro — more than five hours to confirm the attack by Russian ransomware gang LockBit  according to correspondence from ION seen by Bloomberg.It wasn’t long before the 42 ION clients affected started reporting difficulties. The US clearing arm of Dutch lender ABN Amro Bank NV sent out a note to clients saying the attack would delay overnight processing  and that it was being forced to deal with transactions manually. StoneX Financial said it was taking “alternative measures” to clear trades and prioritizing expiring contracts. Marex Group resorted to providing clients “indicative” values of transactions in their accounts.On the London Metal Exchange — one of the last venues in the world where trading still takes place face to face — the return to manual processing was familiar for many veteran brokers  but it also provided an opportunity for younger staff to prove their technological prowess.When ION’s systems went down  a team of coders at one London brokerage scrambled to build their own ad-hoc system to match off clients’ trades  and they had it up and running within hours  according to one person familiar with the matter.Liquidity ThreatBut while those types of creative efforts have helped to mitigate the fallout so far  the challenges are growing as the crisis rolls on. Informally  the London brokerage has warned the LME that it expects dealers to reduce activity because of friction in processing trades  reducing liquidity  the person said.Fear of contagion prompted the Futures Industry Association to hold over half a dozen calls over multiple days to give members a chance to talk through the situation and share relevant information. More than 600 people dialed in to one of these calls. Some were clients of ION  directly impacted by the attack. Others discussed potential ripple effects.A spokesman for ION declined to comment on whether it had taken part in the FIA calls.By the end of the day on Tuesday  neither the FIA nor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission — the top US derivatives regulator — disclosed or could confirm how many firms had been affected and how much money was locked up in trades handled by ION  said people who took part in the calls and asked not to be identified  citing confidentiality.The software company never joined the discussion  the people said.The outage  which is still ongoing  affected vital processes including the matching of trades  the calculation of margin calls and regulatory reporting on large market positions. That left many clients in the dark about whether they were making or losing money  and prompted calls for more collateral  the people said.It was only then that customers found out there was a problem  with many more only discovering it when Bloomberg News reported the event on Wednesday morning  one of the people said.‘Isolated’ ProblemOn Wednesday  CME  Intercontinental Exchange and Cboe said that their members had experienced issues with a third-party software vendor. Those issues could affect the timing of publishing exchange reports by the end of the day  the firms said. The London Metal Exchange and Euronext also acknowledged that some of its clients had been affected.“The LME has been closely monitoring liquidity across all venues since the incident occurred  and has not yet seen any evidence of liquidity being affected ” the exchange said in an emailed statement. “We continue to work closely with affected members to help them continue their business as normally as possible  and reduce any wider impact.”The issue is “currently isolated to a small number of smaller and midsize firms  and does not pose a systemic risk to the financial sector ” according to a statement from Todd Conklin  deputy assistant secretary of the US Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection.Regulators in the UK  including the Financial Conduct Authority  started looking into the incident  according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The National Cyber Security Centre  part of intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters  is also involved  the people said.The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also seeking information on the cyberattack and reached out to ION executives  people familiar with the matter said. The agency is aware of the situation  it said in a statement.On Thursday evening  the CFTC said the incident was impacting the ability of some clearing members to provide it with accurate data and that it would delay its weekly trading report for the derivatives market until all trades can be reported.ION told clients on Thursday that its systems won’t be fully operational until Feb. 5  and the firm still hasn’t been able to start several crucial recovery steps  according to email correspondence seen by Bloomberg. The firm also told broker StoneX that it has brought in “multiple industry leading security firms to assist in their investigations and remediation plans ” according to a copy of the memo sent to clients.LockBiton  the group behind the attack  threatened on Thursday to publish “all available data” that it claimed to have stolen from ION on their website on the dark web unless the derivatives trading platform paid an unspecified ransom by February 4.It’s unclear if ION paid or plans to pay the ransom  and the industry is still just getting to grips with the ripple effects the incident may have. Beyond clients who are directly affected  banks and brokers that are trading with them aren’t able to match off trades.The result for now is that derivative shops are turning the clock back by years in an impromptu test of their middle and back offices.--With assistance from Natasha Doff  Lydia Beyoud  Jenny Surane  Yvonne Yue Li  Marvin G.

We’ve stretched our cash runway by divesting our manufacturing business unit  and discontinued our clinical programs to focus on selected  critical R&D efforts to mitigate the current limitations of CAR T-cell therapy. We believe we are now well-positioned to unleash the power of our IP estate and to help making the cell therapy approach a success.”Operational highlightsThe Company announced a strategic shift in October 2022 to prioritize discovery research in areas of expertise where it can leverage the differentiated nature of its platforms. The Company has implemented a differentiated and innovative strategy  which it believes has the potential to tackle the major current limitations of CAR T-cell therapies. This strategy includes a multiplexing approach of the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) platform  a dual CAR development of a next-generation NKG2D-based CAR  and the development of B7-H6-targeting immunotherapies.In October 2022  the Company decided to discontinue the development of CYAD-101  the allogeneic TIM-based  NKG2D-based CAR T-cell candidate for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)  based on a strategic  financial and medical review  taking into account the costs associated with the pursuit of the program. There were no new safety concerns leading to this decision. The clinical hold announced in March 2022 on the CYAD-101-002 Phase 1b trial had been lifted in July 2022 by the FDA.Data collected in the IMMUNICY-1 trial of the clinical program CYAD-211  the allogeneic shRNA-based  anti-BCMA CAR T candidate for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM)  which was developed to validate shRNA technology in the clinic  have shown a favorable safety profile for CYAD-211 across all dose-levels and cohorts  with 19 patients treated in total. The lack of observed graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) despite engraftment of CYAD-211 provided proof-of-concept for the use of shRNA as a technology to control GvHD of allogeneic CAR T-cells.In December 2022  the Company decided to discontinue the development of its remaining clinical program CYAD-211 based on a strategic and financial review. There were no safety concerns leading to this decision and all patients previously treated with CYAD-211 still continue to receive their protocol-defined follow-up.Story continuesCorporate highlightsIn September 2022  the Company entered into a €6 million asset purchase agreement with Cellistic  the cell therapy development and manufacturing business of Ncardia BV  whereby Cellistic acquired Celyad Oncology’s Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade cell therapy manufacturing business unit.Since October 2022  the Company has implemented a strategic shift from an organization focused on clinical development to one prioritizing R&D discovery and leveraging its IP estate through partnerships  collaborations and license agreements. The Company has compiled a foundational and broad IP estate that controls key aspects of developing therapies in the allogeneic cell therapy space. The patents around allogeneic CAR T-cell therapies and NKG2D-based therapies provide an avenue to develop intellectual property programs and to partner with outside parties around the licensing of these patents.Financial highlightsAs of December 31  2022  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €12.4 million ($13.3 million). Net cash burn during the fourth quarter of 2022 amounted to €1.0 million  in line with expectations. The Company projects that its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the fourth quarter of 2023.After due consideration of detailed budgets and estimated cash flow forecasts for the year 2023  which reflect the new strategy of the Company and include expenses and cash outflows estimations in relation to the development of its proprietary technology platforms and intellectual property  the Company continues to project that its existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund its estimated operating and capital expenditures over at least the next 12 months from the date that this release is issued.Outlook for 2023Celyad Oncology is increasing its R&D efforts on areas of expertise where it believes it can leverage the differentiated nature of its platform technology and continue to bolster its IP estate. The Company will continue to leverage the dynamic potential of the shRNA platform  and to explore options to tackle the major current limitations of CAR T-cell therapies through its dual targeting CARs with NKG2D capabilities and B7-H6 targeting cell therapies.The Company will provide updates on the potential proof-of-concept of the dual CAR and multiplexing research programs and on business development in the course of 2023 and will take part in several conferences to share these data.Financial Calendar 2023• March 23rd  2023 Full Year 2022 Financial Results • May 5th  2023 First Quarter 2023 Business Update • May 5th  2023 Annual shareholders meeting • August 3rd  2023 First Half 2023 Interim Results • November 9th  2023 Third Quarter 2023 Business UpdateThe financial calendar is communicated on an indicative basis and may be subject to change.About Celyad OncologyCelyad Oncology is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of innovative technologies chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies.

(“Cellectis” or the “Company”) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies  announces the pricing of its previously announced underwritten global offering by way of a capital increase of 8 800 000 American Depositary Shares (“ADS”)  each representing the right to receive one ordinary share of Cellectis  nominal value €0.05 per share (the “Global Offering”)  comprised of a public offering of ADS in the United States of America only and a private placement in other countries including in European Union member States exclusively to “qualified investors” within the meaning of Article 2(e) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129  as amended (the “Prospectus Regulation”)  which launched on February 2  2023  at a price to the public of $2.50 per ADS. The aggregate net proceeds to be received by Cellectis from the sale of ADSs in the Global Offering are expected to be approximately $20.2 million  equivalent to approximately €18.5 million  after deducting the estimated expenses related to the Global Offering and the underwriting commissions payable by Cellectis. The closing of the Global Offering is expected to occur on or about February 7  2023  subject to customary closing conditions.Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. are acting as joint book-running managers for the Global Offering.Cellectis plans to use (i) approximately $17.0 million (€15.6 million) of the net proceeds of the Global Offering to fund the continued clinical development of UCART 123  UCART22  UCART20x22  and UCARTCS1  and (ii) any remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.Based on the planned use of proceeds from the Global Offering  Cellectis believes that its cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations (including payments it expects to receive pursuant to collaboration agreements and anticipated government funding of research programs  but excluding any potential borrowings under the Company’s finance contract with European Investment Bank) will be sufficient to fund Cellectis’ operations into Q2 2024.The listing of Cellectis’ ordinary shares on Euronext Growth in Paris will be suspended on February 3  2023 until the opening of trading of Cellectis’ ADSs on the Nasdaq Global Market at 3:30 pm (Paris time)/ 9:30 a.m. (New York time)  prior to which Cellectis will publish the allocation of share capital to be effective following settlement and delivery of the ADSs sold in the Global Offering. The 8 800 000 ADSs to be issued in the Global Offering will result in a dilution of approximately 16.2% of Cellectis’ outstanding share capital as of September 30  2022 on a non-diluted basis excluding the exercise of the option granted to the Underwriters to purchase additional ADSs and approximately 18.2% of Cellectis’ outstanding share capital as of September 30  2022 on a non-diluted basis in the case of a full exercise of the option granted to the Underwriters to purchase additional ADSs. On an illustrative basis  a shareholder holding 1% of Cellectis’s capital before the Global Offering will now hold a stake of 0.84% excluding the exercise of the option granted to the Underwriters to purchase additional ADSs.The ordinary shares underlying the ADS offered in the Global Offering will be subject to an application for admission to trading on Euronext Growth in Paris on the same trading line as the existing ordinary shares under the same ISIN code FR0010425595 and under the ticker “ALCLS” and are expected to start trading on or about February 7  2023.The offering price of $2.50 per ADS  corresponding to an offering price of €2.29 per ordinary share (based on an exchange rate of €1.00 = $1.0914 as published by Bloomberg on February 2  2023)  is equal to the volume weighted average price of Cellectis’ ordinary shares on Euronext Growth in Paris over the last three trading sessions preceding the pricing of the Global Offering (i.e.  January 31 and February 1 and 2  2023)  minus a discount of 20%  and has been determined by Cellectis pursuant to the 17th resolution of Cellectis  which was approved at the combined meeting of the Company's shareholders held on June 28  2022.In connection with the Global Offering  Cellectis granted Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Underwriters”) a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1 320 000 ADSs representing 15% of the Global Offering size and on the same terms and conditions.In connection with the Global Offering  Jefferies LLC  acting as stabilization agent  may effect transactions with a view to supporting  stabilizing  or maintaining the market price of the ADSs at a level higher than which might otherwise prevail in the open market for Cellectis’ ADSs. However  there is no assurance that the stabilization agent will take any stabilization action and  if begun  such action may be ended at any time without prior notice. Any stabilization action or over-allotment shall be carried out in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations and may be undertaken on the Nasdaq Global Market.The ADSs are being offered pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form F-3 (Registration No. 333-265826)  which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 24  2022 and subsequently declared effective on July 7  2022. The Global Offering is being made only by means of a prospectus and prospectus supplement that form a part of the registration statement. A preliminary prospectus supplement relating to and describing the terms of the Global Offering has been filed with the SEC on February 2  2023 and is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. The final prospectus supplement relating to the Global Offering will be filed with the SEC. When available  copies of the final prospectus supplement (and accompanying prospectus) relating to the Global Offering may be obtained from Jefferies LLC  Attention: Equity Syndicate Prospectus Department  520 Madison Avenue  2nd Floor  New York  NY 10022 or by telephone at (877) 821-7388 or by email at Prospectus_Department@Jefferies.com; or Barclays Capital Inc.  c/o Broadridge Financial Solutions  1155 Long Island Avenue  Edgewood  NY 11717  or by telephone (888) 603-5847 or by email at Barclaysprospectus@broadridge.com The preliminary prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus  together with the documents incorporated by reference therein do not include any inside information (as defined under Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 16  2014 on market abuse as amended (MAR)).This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities  nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

We're working hard to make the switch to renewable power across our entire portfolio and support the development of renewable energy projects like this new solar power plant as our business continues to expand. This project will further improve the quality and impact of our renewable portfolio by reducing our reliance on existing renewable resources and supplanting them with Guarantees of Origin (GoOs) from this new solar park.""Digital Realty has achieved 100% renewable energy coverage for its entire European portfolio and its U.S. colocation portfolio  and is carbon neutral in France (Scopes 1 and 2)  resulting in 64% renewable energy coverage across its global portfolio in 2021  representing an increase of 14% from 2020. In 2022  Digital Realty further expanded its renewable portfolio and added green assets to the energy grid  contracting for 490 MW of solar and wind to support its global data center portfolio.As the interface between CEE and Digital Realty  ENGIE worked to match the supply with the demand for renewable energy  as well as design a flexible PPA tailored to the needs of Digital Realty.""We are pleased to support Digital Realty's efforts to add new renewables in markets where the company operates. As a major player in renewable PPAs  we have the opportunity to match suppliers and buyers of green power  even in a highly volatile market environment.

(Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today announced its intention to invest around US$100 million in its manufacturing and innovation center in Dongtan  South Korea  by 2025  following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between ASM and the Ministry of Trade  Industry and Energy of the Republic of Korea (‘MOTIE’).This investment will expand ASM’s R&D and product-development infrastructure to meet the needs of technology advances  as well as adding more manufacturing capacity. Korea is a key site for ASM  where some of its most advanced applications are developed – ASM’s ALD gap-fill applications are a recent and successful example. These applications enable next-generation advanced logic and memory devices  which are expected to see increased usage in coming years.“Rapid growth is expected until the end of the decade for semiconductors  and – despite the recent slowing down in the industry – ASM continues to invest for growth ” says Benjamin Loh  CEO of ASM. “This expansion will not only serve our key Korean customers  but all our customers worldwide will benefit from the enabling technologies we develop in Korea.”Lee Chang-yang  Korea's Minister of Trade  Industry and Energy  says: “The intended investment by ASM is expected to contribute greatly to increasing high-tech development in our country  securing a stable semiconductor supply chain  and increasing exports.”Prior to signing the MoU  Minister Lee said that with semiconductor devices getting smaller and smaller  the increased investment in Korea by ASM – with its world-leading ALD technology – would present good cause for the country to ‘exert synergy’ with domestic semiconductor companies. Minister Lee also expressed his willingness to cooperate closely with ASM as part of the Korean government’s policy to foster and support the semiconductor industry.Dongtan has been instrumental in ASM’s growth  with the facility delivering advanced R&D and technology for customers in Korea and for global customers. Korea is also the global center for ASM’s PEALD business. Technologies developed by ASM’s local R&D team have been at the heart of breakthrough innovations in the semiconductor industry  such as the ALD quad chamber module (QCM) architecture  the TENZATM ALD for ultra-high aspect ratio (>100:1) gap-fill  and high-quality PEALD oxides and nitrides for spacers  liners  and other patterning applications.The expansion of ASM’s Dongtan facility is also required to create more space for the company’s fast-growing number of employees in Korea  and reflects the increasing revenue contribution from the Korean market expected over the next few years.The intended investment will deliver multiple benefits to the local market. Of course  the expansion will create new job opportunities  for the direct and indirect employment of skilled personnel in engineering  R&D and manufacturing. In addition to contributing to training and workforce development in Korea  the investment will also benefit local supplier partnerships.ASM has been operating in Korea since 1989 and established ASM Korea Limited in 1995. Since then  Korea has grown into one of ASM’s key global technology development and manufacturing sites with more than 450 employees.The MoU has been signed but is conditional on support and assistance from the Korean government  in terms of grants and the speedy approval of all necessary permits.This intended expansion follows the unveiling last year of ASM’s state-of-the-art Singapore manufacturing facility and operations hub  another step in the company’s growth as it prepares to meet growing global customer demand for advanced semiconductors.About ASM InternationalASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

It is a key marker that something has happened in terms of depth of market  liquidity  and relevance of offering. The fact that you have major companies like Universal Music Group deciding to list in Amsterdam  Spanish companies and German companies deciding to list in Paris or in Oslo – that’s a benchmark change.But listings are only one set of metrics for us. The second set of metrics comes around trading. A quarter of the shares traded in Europe are traded on Euronext markets. Our average daily volumes of shares traded are around €11-12 billion changing hands – that’s twice the size of the London market and of the Frankfurt market.A second metric  when it comes to aggregate market capitalisation  is that companies listed on Euronext account represent around €6.3 trillion  again twice the size of the London market  and three times Frankfurt. We’re also the global leaders of bond listings  through our Dublin platform  and sovereign bond trading as well as leading in specific sectors such as ESG bonds and bond indices.How big a share of Euronext is the exchange business  and where else are you looking to diversify?The group is much more than just our equities business  which represents just 20% of our top line. Eighty percent of the group is made up of other activities  demonstrating how diversified the group has become after the recent acquisitions by Euronext of The Irish Stock Exchange in 2018  Oslo Bors in 2019  and the Borsa Italiana Group in 2021. This part of the group is very profitable and growing and we are keen to keep our equity business focus.We believe that in the new interest rate environment  where zero-cost money is no longer available  the balance sheet debate is back. That means debt AND equity. Now  if you want to fund growth  you require partners  and equity funding. People will now need to raise equity for these projects  whereas in the past they would have used debt. So we are confident for the equity market outlook.The other part of our diversified global business– everyone focuses on the expansion of our exchange business but the reality is that when we bought these new businesses  we didn’t just plant flags on the map  we didn’t just buy exchanges  we significantly expanded our business range. For example  when Euronext acquired Oslo Bors  around half of the top line was came from a CSD platform. When we bought acquired Borsa Italiana we integrated to the Euronext Group not only the exchange but a clearing house  a CSD  and the leading European fixed income trading platform. This explains why Borsa Italiana is the most important contribution to our Group revenue  a third of Euronext revenues. So alongside the expansion to a new core business  we captured new assets. Euronext’s CSD activity  composed of four CSDs in Europe  has significantly grown. And we have done something no other European player has managed – a consolidation of CSDs  with Portugal  Norway  Denmark and Italy all operating under the Euronext name with an integrated management. We’ve done a Euronext of CSDs just as we have done a Euronext of trading. We’re also expanding in corporate services  since we’ve made significant investment in acquisitions since 2017 – webinars  webcasting  digital governance  regtechs of various natures  and these businesses have been performing very well – from nothing to a family of businesses of around €40 million top line.We’re also trying to develop trading platforms in other asset classes  especially in the FX world. We’re diversifying into energy. That commitment to diversify our top line is fundamental to our 2024 strategic plan.Another key pillar of this plan depends on the Borsa Italiana acquisition. By the end of 2023  a large part of the €100 million cost synergies we have committed to deliver by the end of 2024 will be delivered. Clearing flows will migrate in-house during the course of 2023 and 2024  for example.There is also at the heart of Euronext’s “Growth for Impact 2024” strategic plan a strong commitment to ESG: both in terms of what we can do as a marketplace in progressing new products and developing new solutions for our clients  and as a company in progressing in this new environment.Where next for Euronext  what future plans do you have  and do you have any new markets in your sights?What we need to do now is to prepare further steps for diversification  and we’re looking and potential new avenues in post-trade  in FX  in energy  in corporate services  in data  to take the company to the next level.When it comes to the external development of our trading and listing business – our stock exchange business – our focus is Europe. We know how to manage a culturally diversified group in a very effective manner. We know how to manage a central orderbook and platform. And we know all the effective synergies to create an efficient equity market. Any single country exchange platform in Europe is welcome to join the Euronext federal project  if that meets our acquisition criteria. We can’t control when assets come up for sale  but we can control how competitive we are – we want to be as competitive as possible so that we are the best choice.We’ve for example laid a first foot in the Nordic region. Our acquisition of Oslo Bourse was extremely successful  and that has been identified by all the Nordic players. But when it comes to non-exchange and global business  such as data  platforms  post-trade – we are country-agnostic.Why did Euronext not buy BME  and do you regret it?Spain is a very important component of the European financial sector. I spent six years of my life running a European business for Santander and have been exposed to the sophisticated  experienced  global-minded Spanish financial community. There is no fundamental  completed European success without a Spanish dimension. That’s for sure. However  after a long analysis of the situation we did not acquire BME. It was a perfect natural fit  but we decided not to bid as we could not top the offer price paid by SIX. Besides  we have a clear M&A discipline – we do deals when we can deliver a return on capital employed above our cost of capital after three to five years. So far  we have always been in a position to achieve this return. In terms of the price of the SIX bid  we could not meet our target returns at that price.One of the elements that makes integration possible is that for the past 20 years we have developed a united and diversified federal model. We have a harmonised system run by federal governance with a supervisory board where every exchange has representation. Euronext has a managing board with nine nationalities  a supervisory board with eight nationalities. We have a system where the process of integration has been rigorously tested under multiple situations: it works  and it is scalable  because we are united in diversity.In May 2021  we raised €1.8 billion of debt in a day and €1.8 billion of equity in five days  because the market believed what we told them about our M&A discipline  and they could see our past successes. They trusted us  because we have a track record of discipline when it comes to capital employment  and that is how we were able to finance the acquisition of Borsa Italiana Group.LSEG has made a strong play within the data and technology space – is this a natural next step for you?Most of the players that have diversified before us did so because they reached the conclusion that cash equity trading and listing is less profitable or scalable or has less organic growth than other activities. For all sorts of reasons  I think we have on our side demonstrated that cash equity trading can be a very profitable business and can bring a decent strong return. So they diversified because they decided to dilute their exposure to the equity segment. While we are now the leader for equities in Europe  and it is very profitable. But we need to diversify into other asset classes now. Some other players have made some early moves and have decided to reposition themselves. The London Stock Exchange is not just in London anymore – it is a global business. Their actual exchange element is now minimal  especially post-Brexit. They have done something that is very impressive  and I have huge respect for what David Schwimmer has accomplished as a business leader. Deutsche Borse is also not really a Borse anymore – the cash equity trading and listing business is a very small part of it and their focus of expansion is in post-trade  data  indices  and so on  and they have built a fantastic group which is very successful.We are  that being said  looking. For a while it was very difficult to buy assets at reasonable prices. I think the world is changing. When the cost of money is rising and the availability of debt is decreasing  then maybe the real pricing of assets will slowly return and may start to reach our strict return on capital criteria.,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.66,0.12,0.22,True,English,"['Stephane Boujnah', 'Fireside', 'Euronext', 'leading European fixed income trading platform', 'leading pan-European market infrastructure', 'The Irish Stock Exchange', 'new interest rate environment', 'other European player', 'average daily volumes', '€100 million cost synergies', 'other asset classes', 'potential new avenues', 'aggregate market capitalisation', 'balance sheet debate', 'Borsa Italiana acquisition', 'diversified global business', 'new core business', 'sovereign bond trading', 'Universal Music Group', 'equity business focus', 'equity market outlook', 'Borsa Italiana Group', 'new environment', 'Dublin platform', 'CSD platform', 'exchange business', 'equity trading', 'global leaders', 'other activities', 'trading platforms', 'new assets', 'new products', 'new solutions', 'new markets', 'business range', 'bond indices', 'other part', 'London market', 'vast majority', 'international involvement', 'key marker', 'benchmark change', 'one set', 'second set', 'second metric', 'specific sectors', 'top line', 'Eighty percent', 'zero-cost money', 'equity funding', 'important contribution', 'integrated management', 'corporate services', 'significant investment', 'digital governance', 'various natures', 'key pillar', 'Clearing flows', 'future plans', 'Frankfurt market', 'equities business', 'non-European companies', 'major companies', 'Spanish companies', 'German companies', 'new businesses', 'Group revenue', 'bond listings', 'Oslo Bors', 'CSD activity', '2024 strategic plan', 'large part', 'past year', 'ESG bonds', 'recent acquisitions', 'clearing house', 'FX world', 'strong commitment', 'Euronext platforms', 'Euronext markets', 'Euronext account', 'Euronext revenues', 'Euronext name', 'four CSDs', 'Euronext Group', 'competitors', 'progress', 'leadership', 'place', 'drivers', 'momentum', 'something', 'terms', 'depth', 'liquidity', 'relevance', 'offering', 'fact', 'Amsterdam', 'Paris', 'quarter', 'shares', 'hands', 'size', 'big', 'debt', 'growth', 'partners', 'People', 'projects', 'everyone', 'expansion', 'reality', 'flags', 'map', 'exchanges', 'example', 'half', 'third', 'consolidation', 'Portugal', 'Norway', 'Denmark', 'Italy', 'webinars', 'webcasting', 'regtechs', 'family', 'energy', 'end', 'course', 'heart', 'Impact', 'clients', 'company', 'sights', 'steps', 'diversification', 'post-trade', 'data']",2023-02-03,2023-02-03,thetradenews.com

(“Cellectis” or the “Company”) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies ,Cellectis Inc.NEW YORK  Feb. 02  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cellectis S.A. (“Cellectis” or the “Company”) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies  announces the pricing of its previously announced underwritten global offering by way of a capital increase of 8 800 000 American Depositary Shares (“ADS”)  each representing the right to receive one ordinary share of Cellectis  nominal value €0.05 per share (the “Global Offering”)  comprised of a public offering of ADS in the United States of America only and a private placement in other countries including in European Union member States exclusively to “qualified investors” within the meaning of Article 2(e) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129  as amended (the “Prospectus Regulation”)  which launched on February 2  2023  at a price to the public of $2.50 per ADS. The aggregate net proceeds to be received by Cellectis from the sale of ADSs in the Global Offering are expected to be approximately $20.2 million  equivalent to approximately €18.5 million  after deducting the estimated expenses related to the Global Offering and the underwriting commissions payable by Cellectis. The closing of the Global Offering is expected to occur on or about February 7  2023  subject to customary closing conditions.Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. are acting as joint book-running managers for the Global Offering.Cellectis plans to use (i) approximately $17.0 million (€15.6 million) of the net proceeds of the Global Offering to fund the continued clinical development of UCART 123  UCART22  UCART20x22  and UCARTCS1  and (ii) any remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.Based on the planned use of proceeds from the Global Offering  Cellectis believes that its cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations (including payments it expects to receive pursuant to collaboration agreements and anticipated government funding of research programs  but excluding any potential borrowings under the Company’s finance contract with European Investment Bank) will be sufficient to fund Cellectis’ operations into Q2 2024.Story continuesThe listing of Cellectis’ ordinary shares on Euronext Growth in Paris will be suspended on February 3  2023 until the opening of trading of Cellectis’ ADSs on the Nasdaq Global Market at 3:30 pm (Paris time)/ 9:30 a.m. (New York time)  prior to which Cellectis will publish the allocation of share capital to be effective following settlement and delivery of the ADSs sold in the Global Offering. The 8 800 000 ADSs to be issued in the Global Offering will result in a dilution of approximately 16.2% of Cellectis’ outstanding share capital as of September 30  2022 on a non-diluted basis excluding the exercise of the option granted to the Underwriters to purchase additional ADSs and approximately 18.2% of Cellectis’ outstanding share capital as of September 30  2022 on a non-diluted basis in the case of a full exercise of the option granted to the Underwriters to purchase additional ADSs. On an illustrative basis  a shareholder holding 1% of Cellectis’s capital before the Global Offering will now hold a stake of 0.84% excluding the exercise of the option granted to the Underwriters to purchase additional ADSs.The ordinary shares underlying the ADS offered in the Global Offering will be subject to an application for admission to trading on Euronext Growth in Paris on the same trading line as the existing ordinary shares under the same ISIN code FR0010425595 and under the ticker “ALCLS” and are expected to start trading on or about February 7  2023.The offering price of $2.50 per ADS  corresponding to an offering price of €2.29 per ordinary share (based on an exchange rate of €1.00 = $1.0914 as published by Bloomberg on February 2  2023)  is equal to the volume weighted average price of Cellectis’ ordinary shares on Euronext Growth in Paris over the last three trading sessions preceding the pricing of the Global Offering (i.e.  January 31 and February 1 and 2  2023)  minus a discount of 20%  and has been determined by Cellectis pursuant to the 17th resolution of Cellectis  which was approved at the combined meeting of the Company's shareholders held on June 28  2022.In connection with the Global Offering  Cellectis granted Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Underwriters”) a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1 320 000 ADSs representing 15% of the Global Offering size and on the same terms and conditions.In connection with the Global Offering  Jefferies LLC  acting as stabilization agent  may effect transactions with a view to supporting  stabilizing  or maintaining the market price of the ADSs at a level higher than which might otherwise prevail in the open market for Cellectis’ ADSs. However  there is no assurance that the stabilization agent will take any stabilization action and  if begun  such action may be ended at any time without prior notice. Any stabilization action or over-allotment shall be carried out in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations and may be undertaken on the Nasdaq Global Market.The ADSs are being offered pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form F-3 (Registration No. 333-265826)  which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 24  2022 and subsequently declared effective on July 7  2022. The Global Offering is being made only by means of a prospectus and prospectus supplement that form a part of the registration statement.
