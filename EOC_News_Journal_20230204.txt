The FDA letter indicates that the Agency agrees to a defined list of conditions that could enable clinical evaluation of MaaT013 in the U.S. These measures will be included  by the Company  in the IND filing. The communication therefore provides a path forward regarding MaaT Pharma’s “pooling” technology for this IND. The Company will promptly prepare a complete response letter and in the interim  the clinical hold remains.“ We appreciate the FDA’s continued commitment and are satisfied that the Agency has provided a clear and  we believe  achievable roadmap for the MaaT013 IND ” said Hervé Affagard  CEO and co-founder of MaaT Pharma. “ The dialogue with the FDA remains constructive and positive as it lays the groundwork for the clinical evaluation of our pipeline in the U.S. We are confident about implementing the next steps and we will update investors in due course.”As announced in August 2022  the FDA had requested further clinical and manufacturing-related information including data on the safety and efficacy of the Company’s “pooling” technology approach (i.e.  mixing donations from multiple donors to achieve higher richness  diversity  and better standardization of the product). The Company submitted to the FDA detailed responses to these requests as announced in the press release dated January 24  2023. In parallel  and as a reminder  the Company continues the development of MaaT013 in Europe with its ongoing international multicenter open-label  single arm  pivotal Phase 3 trial “ARES” evaluating MaaT013  which is progressing as planned. A review by an independent data safety and monitoring board (DSMB)  is expected in the first half of 2023 after enrollment of half of the patients in the study.Separately from the information above  MaaT Pharma reported its cash position as of December 31  2022  and its revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022.Cash position1As of December 31  2022  total cash and cash equivalents were EUR 35.2 million  as compared to EUR 40.3 million as of September 30  2022 and EUR 43.3 million as of December 31  2021. The net decrease in cash over the fourth quarter 2022 was EUR 5.1 million reflecting financing of operations and the ongoing development programs fully in line with the plans.

PROKOV EDITIONS in Q4)  FY 2022 revenue rose 8.82% to €210.09m. The Group confirms the efficiency of its strategy of promoting interoperability between healthcare professionals and establishments  with the priorities of structuring the healthcare offer  improving coordination between healthcare professionals and exchanging patient data.The Group strengthens its expertise and leadership position as a healthcare technology solution provider with the qualification of 7 software products under 4 categories of the Ségur programme . i d. by Pharmagest for pharmacies  DOMILINK HAD and DOMILINK SSIAD for home care healthcare professionals  HOSPILINK for hospitals and specialised structures  TITAN for nursing homes  MédiStory 4 for primary care practitioners and multidisciplinary group practices   and MEDILINK for multidisciplinary group practices.The French Digital Healthcare investment programme (Ségur du Numérique en Santé) contributed €7.10m to 2022 revenue.Continuing expansion in Europe in 2023  after successfully strengthening its positions in the UK (CAREMEDS) and Germany (I-MEDS)  and developing in other healthcare segments.In €m 2021 2022 Change Q1 45.27 49.36 9.03 % Q2 48.63 54.21 11.48 % Q3 44.21 50.13 13.39 % Q4 54.95 * 60.40 9.90 % Annual revenue 193.07 214.07 ** 10.88 %* Consolidation of PROKOV EDITIONS in Q4 2021** unaudited****2022 highlightsAs a reminder  as of January 1  2022:the Digital Communications Business Unit was integrated into the PHARMAGEST Division;the Telemedicine business is attached to the AXIGATE LINK Division.These changes are taken into account for N-1 to facilitate comparison on an identical basis.The PHARMAGEST Division had revenue of €156.30m at 31 December 2022  a 7.62% increase from one year earlier. This Division accounted for 73.01% of total Equasens Group's revenue for 2022. In France   annual revenue rose 7.65% to €140.77m.Story continuesApart from the Ségur programme qualification obtained on 14 November 2022 boosting sales of the id. by Pharmagest solution (a new  profoundly revamped version of the LGPI suite) in the final weeks of the year (revenue of €2.02m)  this Business Unit’s growth momentum of the first nine months (+7.24%) remained on track with notable performances from both its software activities (launch of new offerings such as id.Mobility and OffiSecure Fibre  the continued rollout of interoperability solutions) and hardware (support for the deployment of electronic labels with the Group's equipment financing offering proposed by its subsidiary HEALTHLEASE  strengthening of technical and training teams for installations).In Italy  annual revenue rose 9.19% to €10.40m.This Business Unit continued to roll out its offering  with both software solutions for pharmacies (new version of the id. software) and wholesaler-distributors (deployment of the new version of the Farmaclick ordering platform)  and equipment (sales of hardware and MULTIMEDS manual pill dispensers). To achieve its development goals  the Group implemented an investment plan: strengthening sales and customer service teams (technicians and instructors)  opening new branches to be closer to its customers.Annual revenue in Belgium was down 4.08% to €2.49m (this Business Unit represents 1.17% of total Group revenue in 2022).The Belgian pharmacy sector is continuing its transition to a business model with a greater focus on the profitability of its structures. While the situation has stabilized with pharmacy groups through the joint efforts of the Customer Service and R&D departments  this Business Unit is continuing to strengthen its position with the independent companies. With the new id. version and the launch of electronic labels  the sales team has considerable strengths.Annual revenue of the Digital Communication Business Unit rose 12.64% to €2.63m.In addition to the well-known pharmaceutical companies  the Group has also expanded its portfolio with the addition of smaller companies. This business mix (catalogue management  communication and/or notification services  statistics) has enabled the Business Unit to maintain a steady revenue stream. In 2022  it completed 165 communication campaigns for nearly 80 partners.The AXIGATE LINK Division had revenue of €32.61m at 31 December 2022  a 15.00% increase from one year earlier. This Division accounted for 15.23 % of total Equasens Group's revenue for 2022.All the Division's activities are growing in their respective markets  boosted by the rollout of the Ségur programme offerings:The Nursing Home activity (TITAN solution): +17.72% to €16.58m (including €1.83m from the Ségur programme).After a pre marketing phase of TITANLINK (a multilingual  multicountry cloud version of TITAN)  the first deployments were in France (MALTA INFORMATIQUE) and Belgium (MALTA BELGIUM).For the Hospital-at-Home care sector (DOMILINK HAD and DOMILINK SSIAD): +6.23% to €5.90m (including €1.08m from the Ségur programme).For hospitals (HOSPILINK): +2.87% to €4.37m (including €0.27m from the Ségur programme).For the Healthcare Establishment and Private Practice sector (MEDILINK): +22.96% to €5.04m (including €0.64m from the Ségur programme).Revenue from pandaLAB Pro grew significantly (+36% to €1.14m). Bolstered by PANDALAB's dual ISO 27001 and HDS certification  guaranteeing a high level of confidentiality and security for health data  pandaLAB Pro will intensify its marketing efforts  with a particular focus on private establishments.The Telemedicine sector: +94.09% to €0.72m (this Business Unit accounted for 0.33% of total Group revenue in 2022).Placing this activity within the AXIGATE LINK Division dedicated to health and social care facilities and services will help promote and develop the ETPLINK / HDJLINK solutions (management of therapeutic programmes and day hospitalisation / outpatient care for these establishments) as well as CARELIB EHPAD (resident call services  falls detection and geolocation solutions for nursing homes) within these healthcare structures.The E-CONNECT Division had revenue of €16.94m at 31 December 2022  up 6.22% from one year earlier. This Division accounted for 7.91% of total Equasens Group's revenue for 2022. e -Connect Business Unit: +5.10% to €13.45m.Adopting a second life CSR strategy enabled this Business Unit to grow despite constraints imposed by supply chain difficulties for electronic components that were correctly anticipated. To limit its effects  the Business Unit thus decided to accelerate its strategy of increasing the diversification of its manufacturing subcontracting.The Frailty Management sector (NOVIAcare solutions) declined 49.55% to €0.03m (this Business Unit accounted for 0.01% of total Group revenue in 2022).The business development action plan is starting to produce results and has boosted the marketing of the LIVIAHOME by NOVIAcare offering by increasing its access to the general public thanks to its integration into the BOULANGER Marketplace in particular. In Europe  qualified partners and manufacturers (including Netherlands  Belgium  Germany) have approved the first orders of units to be delivered in the first months of 2023.The Compliance Business Unit (which in 2022 combined the activities of CAREMEDS  MULTIMEDS and I-MEDS): +11.98% to €3.45m.The Business Unit maintained its level of growth. The acquisition of 100% control of these activities will accelerate the Group's development of these offerings for the European customers of the Group's Divisions and strengthen its position in the European markets (particularly in the UK and Germany).The MEDICAL SOFT Division (which includes the activity of PROKOV EDITIONS integrated in Q4 2021) had annual revenue of €6.22m (+106.90% in Q4 2022 from the same period in 2021). This Division accounted for 2.90 % of total Equasens Group's revenue for 2022.As the first company in the market to obtain Ségur certification for its MédiStory 4 medical software on 05/30/2022  PROKOV EDITIONS once again demonstrated its commercial agility by immediately deploying its certified offering while maintaining significant R&D efforts to develop new innovative modules for specialised physicians in particular.The FINTECH Division had revenue of €2.01m at 31 December 2022  down 18.03% from one year earlier. This Division accounted for 0.94 % of total Equasens Group's revenue for 2022.Despite a mature offering and high quality lending partners  this activity continues to be impacted by unfavourable conditions in the financing market caused by significant interest rate increases in 2022.OutlookIn 2022  Equasens Group validated its growth strategy (organic and external) while the acceptance of its software solutions for the Ségur programme provided a confirmation of its technological know-how and expertise. On that basis  the Group is expecting annual results to be in line with previous years.For 2023  after successfully strengthening its positions in the UK (CAREMEDS) and Germany(I-MEDS)  the Group maintains its goals for expansion in Europe and development in other areas of healthcare.Financial calendar2022 annual results: 24 March 2023 after the close of trading.Analysts meeting on the 2022 annual results: 27 March 2023  11:30 a.m. - Paris.About Equasens GroupWith more than 1 200 employees fulfilling a vital role as “Citizens in the Service of Health and Well-Being”  Equasens Group is today a key player in the European healthcare sector  providing software solutions to all healthcare professionals (pharmacists  primary care practitioners  hospitals  Hospital-at-Home structures  retirement homes  health centres) in both primary and secondary care sectors.With operations in in France  Germany  Great Britain  Belgium  Ireland  Italy  and Luxembourg  Equasens Group is currently bringing together healthcare professionals within a unique ecosystem in France and Europe benefiting people by making available the very best of technology.Listed on Euronext Paris™ - Compartment AIncluded in the Euronext Tech Leaders segment and the European Rising Tech labelIndexes: MSCI GLOBAL SMALL CAP - GAÏA Index 2020 - CAC® SMALL and CAC® All-TradableEligible for the Deferred Settlement Service (“Service à Réglement Différé” - SRD) and equity savings accounts invested in small and mid caps (PEA-PME).ISIN: FR0012882389 - Ticker Code: EQSFor all the latest news on Equasens Group go to www.equasens.comCONTACTSAnalyst and Investor Relations:Chief Administrative and Financial Officer: Frédérique SCHMIDTTel. +33 (0)3 83 15 90 67 - frederique.schmidt@equasens.comMedia Relations:FIN’EXTENSO - Isabelle APRILETel. +33 (0)6 19 38 61 78 - i.aprile@finextenso.frAttachment,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.09,0.2,0.71,True,English,"['FY\xa02022 revenue', 'EQUASENS', 'The French Digital Healthcare investment programme', 'Ségur du Numérique', 'MULTIMEDS manual pill dispensers', 'The Belgian pharmacy sector', 'Ségur programme offerings', 'multilingual, multicountry cloud version', 'The Nursing Home activity', 'Ségur programme qualification', 'healthcare technology solution provider', 'Digital Communications Business Unit', 'home care healthcare professionals', 'The AXIGATE LINK Division', 'Digital Communication Business Unit', 'Home care sector', 'primary care practitioners', 'other healthcare segments', 'Farmaclick ordering platform', 'R&D departments', 'pre marketing phase', 'first nine months', 'multidisciplinary group practices', 'steady revenue stream', 'The PHARMAGEST Division', 'total Equasens Group', 'customer service teams', 'equipment financing offering', 'total Group revenue', 'new id. version', 'investment plan', 'The Group', 'healthcare offer', 'nursing homes', 'new offerings', 'Pharmagest solution', 'training teams', 'first deployments', 'Telemedicine business', 'new version', 'business model', 'business mix', '165 communication campaigns', 'Villers-lès-Nancy', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'PROKOV EDITIONS', 'patient data', '7 software products', 'DOMILINK HAD', 'DOMILINK SSIAD', 'MédiStory', 'identical basis', 'LGPI suite', 'final weeks', 'growth momentum', 'notable performances', 'id.Mobility', 'OffiSecure Fibre', 'electronic labels', 'software solutions', 'id. software', 'development goals', 'new branches', 'greater focus', 'joint efforts', 'independent companies', 'considerable strengths', 'pharmaceutical companies', 'smaller companies', 'catalogue management', 'notification services', 'respective markets', 'TITAN solution', 'MALTA INFORMATIQUE', 'FY 2022 revenue', 'Annual revenue', 'leadership position', 'specialised structures', 'software activities', 'interoperability solutions', 'MALTA BELGIUM', 'sales team', '3 February', 'CET', 'efficiency', 'strategy', 'establishments', 'priorities', 'coordination', 'expertise', '4 categories', 'pharmacies', 'HOSPILINK', 'hospitals', 'MEDILINK', 'Santé', 'expansion', 'Europe', 'positions', 'UK', 'CAREMEDS', 'Germany', 'Change', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4', 'Consolidation', '2022 highlights', 'reminder', 'January', 'account', 'N-1', 'comparison', '31 December', '7.62% increase', 'France', '14 November', 'year', 'track', 'launch', 'continued', 'rollout', 'hardware', 'support', 'subsidiary', 'HEALTHLEASE', 'technical', 'installations', 'Italy', 'wholesaler-distributors', 'technicians', 'instructors', 'customers', 'transition', 'profitability', 'situation', 'groups', 'addition', 'portfolio', 'statistics', '80 partners', '15.00% increase', 'TITANLINK', '6:00', '€', '88']",2023-02-03,2023-02-04,finance.yahoo.com

The registration statement includes a proxy statement of Black Knight that also constitutes a prospectus of ICE. Please see the Form S-4 filing for additional information regarding the transaction. In our earnings supplement  we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials. When used on this call  net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share.Throughout this presentation  unless otherwise indicated  references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of our earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher  Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner  Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson  President; and Lynn Martin  President of the NYSE. I'll now turn the call over to Warren.Warren Gardiner: Thanks  Katya. Good morning  everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide four with some of the key highlights from our fourth quarter results. Net revenues of $1.8 billion were driven by transaction revenues of $828 million and recurring revenues of $940 million  up 4% year-over-year. For the full year revenues totaled $7.3 billion  also up 4% versus last year. Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $740 million  and we're within our guidance range  including approximately $5 million of additional severance. This strong performance helped to drive fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share $1.25 and full year adjusted EPS of $5.30  an increase of 5% versus 2021. 2022  free cash flow totaled a record $2.9 billion  which enabled us to return nearly $1.5 billion to shareholders while also continuing to make strategic investments across our business.In addition  we have received Board authorization to increase our quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.42 per share  beginning in the first quarter of 2023  extending our 10-year track record of double digit dividend growth. Now let's move to Slide five  where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Fourth quarter net revenues totaled $982 million. Transaction revenues of over $600 million were driven in part by 11% growth in agricultural commodities  and 13% growth in our equity derivatives business. Importantly  open interest trends remain strong across our futures and options in January  including 14% growth in global natural gas and 24% growth in LIBOR. Recurring revenues  which include our exchange data services  and our NYSC listings business increased by 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.Customer growth  particularly within our energy exchange data was partially offset by slower growth in our listings business. While industry wide capital markets activity was relatively muted. It's worth noting that despite a slower year for IPOs  across the globe  we had a record year for listing transfers was 34  including more operating companies in the last three years combined. For the full year exchange segment  revenues increased by 8%  including a 33% increase in our interest rate business  a 20% increase in equity derivatives  and an 8% increase in our global natural gas revenues. Turning now to Slide six  I'll discuss our fixed income and data services segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled a record $537 million up 13% versus a year ago.Transaction revenues increased by 89%  including 182% growth in ICE bonds  and 66% growth in our CDS Clearing business. Similar to last quarter  this strong growth was driven by market volatility  higher interest rates and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bond platforms. Recurring revenue growth of 3% was driven by demand for additional capacity on ICE global network  as well as strong growth across our desktop  feeds and analytics offerings. We're beginning to see a return on the investments we've made in both enhance content and functionality. This performance is a key driver of our other data and network services business which increased by 8% in the fourth quarter  and 10%  excluding the impact of the Euronext migration.Somewhat offsetting with slower growth in our end-of-day pricing business  we're experiencing a slower sales cycle and pressure from asset base revenues in our index business  which declined double digits year-over-year  as investors shifted out of higher fee risk assets  such as equities and corporate bonds  and communities and treasury ETFs. For the full year  total segment  revenues totaled a record $2.1 billion up 13%. While adjusted operating margins expanded by 500 basis points  as anticipated recurring revenue grew 4% for the year and it was up 5% after adjusting for Euronext. Let's go next to Slide seven  where I'll discuss our Mortgage Technology Segment. Fourth quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $249 million. Recurring revenues which accounted for two-thirds of segment revenues totaled $164 million and grew 10% year-over-year.These strong recurring revenues continue to drive out performance versus an industry that experienced a nearly 60% decline in origination volumes. Importantly  they've now less revenues increased by over 30% year-over-year. For the full year  Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $1.1 billion  including a 16% increase in our recurring revenues  and a 24% increase in our data analytics revenues. And while industry volumes were actually below those seen three years ago in 2020 -- in 2019  pro forma 2022 Mortgage Technology revenues are higher by nearly 50%  representing a CAGR of roughly 14%. I'll conclude my remarks on Slide eight with some additional guidance. Recurring revenues in 2023 were once again be led by our Mortgage Technology segment  where we are expecting mid to high single digit growth  a testament to the continued adoption of automation across the mortgage workflow.Office  Work  CollegePhoto by Damir Kopezhanov on UnsplashIn our fixed income and data services segment  we expect recurring revenue growth  excluding headwinds of approximately $15 million related to FX and the Euronext data center migration to once again be in the mid-single digits. And lastly  in our Exchange segment  we expect recurring revenue growth excluding a $20 million headwind from the cessation of LIBOR to be in the low single digits. As continued growth in our energy exchange data services is offset by fewer IPOs and the tapering of 2021 initial listing fees. Moving to expenses  we expect 2023 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $3.04 to $3.09 billion. Consistent with prior years  we will reward our employees for their contributions to our strong results  and therefore expect cash compensation expense to increase by approximately $20 to $40 million.Strategic investments in technology operations and revenue related initiatives are expected to increase by $40 to $50 million  driven by higher licensees as well as investments across all three of our segments. In addition  we expect roughly $45 million to $55 million of incremental noncash expense  including $25 million of D&A related to the rebuild of Ellie Mae CapEx. And lastly  we expect an FX benefit to our adjusted expenses by approximately $5 million to $15 million when compared to 2022. In summary  we delivered another record year of revenues  operating income  free cash flow and earnings per share. Across our business  we made strategic investments in future growth and as we enter 2023  we are well positioned to meet the evolving needs of our customers  once again  deliver profitable growth and create value for our shareholders.I'll be happy to take questions during Q&A. But for now  I'll hand it over to Ben.Benjamin Jackson: Thank you  Warren  and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. 2022 was a year marked by rising inflation  rising interest rates and continued geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Amidst this dynamic macroeconomic environment  we once again grew revenues  operating income and earnings per share  record results that are a testament to the resiliency and durability of our strategically diversified business model. In our financial futures markets  rising inflation and central bank activity across the globe presented an interest rate environment that has not been seen in generation  helping us drive 20% volume growth in our interest rate complex and 15% growth in our equity derivatives business.Across our global energy markets  the events unfolding across North America  Europe  Russia and Asia have triggered a reshaping of the global energy supply chain  creating new risks and uncertainties for market participants to navigate. In our global natural gas markets  an evolving energy supply chain in Europe has led to increased demand for global liquefied natural gas  or LNG  and has helped us drive a 17% increase in global gas volumes in 2022. This includes 24% growth in our North American gas business  which has benefited not only from increased commercial engagement with our Henry Hub contract but also our North American basis markets. These trends have continued into January with global natural gas open interest up 14% year-over-year  including 21% growth in North America.Although our European carbon markets experienced headwinds in 2022 due to the aforementioned factors  the secular trend towards cleaner energy continues and is a growth trend we are uniquely positioned to capture  as evidenced by the record year in our North American environmental markets with volumes up 5% year-over-year in 2022. As we look out over the longer term  corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. This is an evolution that we've long envisioned and is one of the largest providers of environmental products  including renewable fuel contracts  carbon allowances  nature-based solutions  renewable energy certificates as well as the wealth of climate data and related into season analytics.We are excited about the many future growth opportunities that lie ahead. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business. Our comprehensive platform continues to generate compounding revenue growth and delivered another year of record revenues in 2022. This strong growth was underpinned by both recurring and transaction revenue growth  again a testament to the strategic diversification of our business and our ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environments. Rising market uncertainty and interest rates are driving an increase in demand for credit protection  and we have seen this lead to increasing trading activity in our bonds business. These factors  coupled with our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bonds platforms  continued to record full year revenues -- to record revenues in our ICE Bonds business in 2022 up nearly 100% year-over-year.Turning now to our Mortgage business  increased workflow efficiency through continued electronification is a secular trend we believe will continue through a variety of mortgage origination environments. Our ability to capture this secular trend is evidenced by the strength and resiliency of our recurring revenues  which increased 16% in 2022. This continued strength is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate this analog to digital conversion. As mortgage origination volumes have normalized  customer conversations have increasingly centered on efficiencies and automation. In the fourth quarter  we had our strongest quarter of last year in terms of sales to new customers of our loan origination system with wins across each major segment we service.In addition  there continues to be increased interest in our data and analytics products  which increased 31% in the quarter and 24% for the full year in 2022. Through our AIQ solution and analyzer tools customers can save thousands of dollars per loan by leveraging our data and analytics tools to drive automation in the loan manufacturing process. We are pleased that the value of our offerings continues to resonate with lenders  and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to accelerate the analog to digital conversion. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.Jeff Sprecher: Thank you  Ben. Good morning  everyone  and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 10. I want to begin by touching on our pending acquisition of Black Knight. As communicated  when making the announcement  we continued to believe that this transaction will close during the first half of this year. Our respect for the Federal Trade Commission's work on this matter  and as we cooperate with them to gain regulatory approval  we do not intend to comment further on the transaction. But importantly  we remain excited about the efficiencies that the combined entities will bring to the end consumer and to other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem. In that vein  and shifting to what was yet another successful year  2022 marked our 17th consecutive year of record revenues  record operating income and record adjusted earnings per share.This track record of growth reflects on the quality of our strategy and  more importantly  on the execution of that strategy. We've intentionally diversified across asset classes and geographies  so that we're not tied to any one cyclical trend or macroeconomic environment. We've deliberately positioned the company to have a mix of transaction and compounding subscription revenues to provide upside exposure while hedging our downside risk. We've placed the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog to digital conversion. The combination of these factors is what has made ICE an all-weather name and a business model that provides upside to volatility with less downside risk and  importantly  a business model that generates growth on top of growth.For example  in 2022  inflationary concerns and market speculation of central bank activity benefited our European and U.K. interest rate business  driving a 33% increase in revenues for the full year. These conditions also contributed to record full year revenues in our credit default swap clearing business  up 61% year-over-year  as rate volatility drove increased demand for risk management and credit protection. Across our mortgage business  even against this backdrop of rising interest rates  our business outperformed the broader market driven by strong recurring revenue growth  up 16% for the full year. Again  this is a reflection of the all-weather nature of our business model. As we look to 2023 and beyond  we're positioned to capitalize on the secular and cyclical trends occurring across asset classes  and we remain focused on executing on the many growth opportunities that are in front of us  extending our track record of growth.I'd like to conclude by thanking our customers for their business and for their trust in 2022  and I want to thank my colleagues for their contributions to the best year in our company's history. And with that  I'll turn the call back over to our operator  Alex  who will conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time.See also 21 Best Dating Apps of 2023 and 10 Hot EV Stocks To Buy .To continue reading the Q&A session  please click here.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.43,0.21,0.36,True,English,"['Earnings Call Transcript', 'Intercontinental Exchange', 'ICE', 'industry wide capital markets activity', 'ICE Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call', 'Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses', 'fourth quarter 2022 earnings release', 'global natural gas revenues', 'double digit dividend growth', 'Fourth quarter net revenues', 'full year exchange segment', 'Fourth quarter revenues', 'customary regulatory approval', 'constant currency basis', 'Chief Financial Officer', 'open interest trends', 'data services segment', 'fourth quarter results', 'exchange data services', 'energy exchange data', 'interest rate business', 'CDS Clearing business', 'free cash flow', 'Form S-4 filing', 'equivalent GAAP terms', 'last three years', 'NYSC listings business', 'ICE common stock', '10-year track record', 'full year revenues', 'core business performance', 'equity derivatives business', '2022 Earnings Call Transcript', 'adjusted earnings', 'last quarter', 'transaction-based expenses', 'operating companies', 'first quarter', 'quarterly dividend', 'Intercontinental Exchange', 'earnings supplement', 'earnings materials', 'diluted earnings', 'last year', 'cash operations', 'recurring revenues', '2022 Form 10-K', 'GAAP measures', 'slower year', 'record year', 'Investor Relations', 'Senior Analyst', 'Investors section', 'current judgment', 'other filings', 'Black Knight', 'first half', 'registration statement', 'proxy statement', 'additional information', 'explanatory notes', 'second page', 'additional details', 'Jeff Sprecher', 'Ben Jackson', 'Lynn Martin', 'key highlights', 'guidance range', 'additional severance', 'strong performance', 'strategic investments', 'Board authorization', 'agricultural commodities', 'listing transfers', 'fixed income', 'ICE bonds', 'transaction revenues', 'Katia Gonzalez', 'forward-looking statements', 'Warren Gardiner', 'Customer growth', 'slower growth', 'Good morning', 'revenue growth', '11% growth', '13% growth', '14% growth', '24% growth', '182% growth', '66% growth', 'February', 'Operator', 'Webcast', 'name', 'Alex', 'host', 'presentation', 'items', 'replay', 'obligation', 'risks', 'assumptions', 'uncertainties', 'description', 'connection', 'shares', 'prospectus', 'reconciliation', 'references', 'definition', 'Chair', 'CEO', 'President', 'NYSE', 'Katya', 'everyone', 'Slide', 'EPS', 'increase', 'shareholders', 'overview', 'part', 'futures', 'options', 'January', 'LIBOR', 'IPOs', 'globe']",2023-02-03,2023-02-04,finance.yahoo.com

We’ve stretched our cash runway by divesting our manufacturing business unit  and discontinued our clinical programs to focus on selected  critical R&D efforts to mitigate the current limitations of CAR T-cell therapy. We believe we are now well-positioned to unleash the power of our IP estate and to help making the cell therapy approach a success.”Operational highlightsThe Company announced a strategic shift in October 2022 to prioritize discovery research in areas of expertise where it can leverage the differentiated nature of its platforms. The Company has implemented a differentiated and innovative strategy  which it believes has the potential to tackle the major current limitations of CAR T-cell therapies. This strategy includes a multiplexing approach of the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) platform  a dual CAR development of a next-generation NKG2D-based CAR  and the development of B7-H6-targeting immunotherapies.In October 2022  the Company decided to discontinue the development of CYAD-101  the allogeneic TIM-based  NKG2D-based CAR T-cell candidate for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)  based on a strategic  financial and medical review  taking into account the costs associated with the pursuit of the program. There were no new safety concerns leading to this decision. The clinical hold announced in March 2022 on the CYAD-101-002 Phase 1b trial had been lifted in July 2022 by the FDA.Data collected in the IMMUNICY-1 trial of the clinical program CYAD-211  the allogeneic shRNA-based  anti-BCMA CAR T candidate for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM)  which was developed to validate shRNA technology in the clinic  have shown a favorable safety profile for CYAD-211 across all dose-levels and cohorts  with 19 patients treated in total. The lack of observed graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) despite engraftment of CYAD-211 provided proof-of-concept for the use of shRNA as a technology to control GvHD of allogeneic CAR T-cells.In December 2022  the Company decided to discontinue the development of its remaining clinical program CYAD-211 based on a strategic and financial review. There were no safety concerns leading to this decision and all patients previously treated with CYAD-211 still continue to receive their protocol-defined follow-up.Story continuesCorporate highlightsIn September 2022  the Company entered into a €6 million asset purchase agreement with Cellistic  the cell therapy development and manufacturing business of Ncardia BV  whereby Cellistic acquired Celyad Oncology’s Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade cell therapy manufacturing business unit.Since October 2022  the Company has implemented a strategic shift from an organization focused on clinical development to one prioritizing R&D discovery and leveraging its IP estate through partnerships  collaborations and license agreements. The Company has compiled a foundational and broad IP estate that controls key aspects of developing therapies in the allogeneic cell therapy space. The patents around allogeneic CAR T-cell therapies and NKG2D-based therapies provide an avenue to develop intellectual property programs and to partner with outside parties around the licensing of these patents.Financial highlightsAs of December 31  2022  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €12.4 million ($13.3 million). Net cash burn during the fourth quarter of 2022 amounted to €1.0 million  in line with expectations. The Company projects that its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the fourth quarter of 2023.After due consideration of detailed budgets and estimated cash flow forecasts for the year 2023  which reflect the new strategy of the Company and include expenses and cash outflows estimations in relation to the development of its proprietary technology platforms and intellectual property  the Company continues to project that its existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund its estimated operating and capital expenditures over at least the next 12 months from the date that this release is issued.Outlook for 2023Celyad Oncology is increasing its R&D efforts on areas of expertise where it believes it can leverage the differentiated nature of its platform technology and continue to bolster its IP estate. The Company will continue to leverage the dynamic potential of the shRNA platform  and to explore options to tackle the major current limitations of CAR T-cell therapies through its dual targeting CARs with NKG2D capabilities and B7-H6 targeting cell therapies.The Company will provide updates on the potential proof-of-concept of the dual CAR and multiplexing research programs and on business development in the course of 2023 and will take part in several conferences to share these data.Financial Calendar 2023• March 23rd  2023 Full Year 2022 Financial Results • May 5th  2023 First Quarter 2023 Business Update • May 5th  2023 Annual shareholders meeting • August 3rd  2023 First Half 2023 Interim Results • November 9th  2023 Third Quarter 2023 Business UpdateThe financial calendar is communicated on an indicative basis and may be subject to change.About Celyad OncologyCelyad Oncology is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of innovative technologies chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies.

(“Cellectis” or the “Company”) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies  announces the pricing of its previously announced underwritten global offering by way of a capital increase of 8 800 000 American Depositary Shares (“ADS”)  each representing the right to receive one ordinary share of Cellectis  nominal value €0.05 per share (the “Global Offering”)  comprised of a public offering of ADS in the United States of America only and a private placement in other countries including in European Union member States exclusively to “qualified investors” within the meaning of Article 2(e) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129  as amended (the “Prospectus Regulation”)  which launched on February 2  2023  at a price to the public of $2.50 per ADS. The aggregate net proceeds to be received by Cellectis from the sale of ADSs in the Global Offering are expected to be approximately $20.2 million  equivalent to approximately €18.5 million  after deducting the estimated expenses related to the Global Offering and the underwriting commissions payable by Cellectis. The closing of the Global Offering is expected to occur on or about February 7  2023  subject to customary closing conditions.Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. are acting as joint book-running managers for the Global Offering.Cellectis plans to use (i) approximately $17.0 million (€15.6 million) of the net proceeds of the Global Offering to fund the continued clinical development of UCART 123  UCART22  UCART20x22  and UCARTCS1  and (ii) any remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.Based on the planned use of proceeds from the Global Offering  Cellectis believes that its cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations (including payments it expects to receive pursuant to collaboration agreements and anticipated government funding of research programs  but excluding any potential borrowings under the Company’s finance contract with European Investment Bank) will be sufficient to fund Cellectis’ operations into Q2 2024.The listing of Cellectis’ ordinary shares on Euronext Growth in Paris will be suspended on February 3  2023 until the opening of trading of Cellectis’ ADSs on the Nasdaq Global Market at 3:30 pm (Paris time)/ 9:30 a.m. (New York time)  prior to which Cellectis will publish the allocation of share capital to be effective following settlement and delivery of the ADSs sold in the Global Offering. The 8 800 000 ADSs to be issued in the Global Offering will result in a dilution of approximately 16.2% of Cellectis’ outstanding share capital as of September 30  2022 on a non-diluted basis excluding the exercise of the option granted to the Underwriters to purchase additional ADSs and approximately 18.2% of Cellectis’ outstanding share capital as of September 30  2022 on a non-diluted basis in the case of a full exercise of the option granted to the Underwriters to purchase additional ADSs. On an illustrative basis  a shareholder holding 1% of Cellectis’s capital before the Global Offering will now hold a stake of 0.84% excluding the exercise of the option granted to the Underwriters to purchase additional ADSs.The ordinary shares underlying the ADS offered in the Global Offering will be subject to an application for admission to trading on Euronext Growth in Paris on the same trading line as the existing ordinary shares under the same ISIN code FR0010425595 and under the ticker “ALCLS” and are expected to start trading on or about February 7  2023.The offering price of $2.50 per ADS  corresponding to an offering price of €2.29 per ordinary share (based on an exchange rate of €1.00 = $1.0914 as published by Bloomberg on February 2  2023)  is equal to the volume weighted average price of Cellectis’ ordinary shares on Euronext Growth in Paris over the last three trading sessions preceding the pricing of the Global Offering (i.e.  January 31 and February 1 and 2  2023)  minus a discount of 20%  and has been determined by Cellectis pursuant to the 17th resolution of Cellectis  which was approved at the combined meeting of the Company's shareholders held on June 28  2022.In connection with the Global Offering  Cellectis granted Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Underwriters”) a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1 320 000 ADSs representing 15% of the Global Offering size and on the same terms and conditions.In connection with the Global Offering  Jefferies LLC  acting as stabilization agent  may effect transactions with a view to supporting  stabilizing  or maintaining the market price of the ADSs at a level higher than which might otherwise prevail in the open market for Cellectis’ ADSs. However  there is no assurance that the stabilization agent will take any stabilization action and  if begun  such action may be ended at any time without prior notice. Any stabilization action or over-allotment shall be carried out in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations and may be undertaken on the Nasdaq Global Market.The ADSs are being offered pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form F-3 (Registration No. 333-265826)  which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 24  2022 and subsequently declared effective on July 7  2022. The Global Offering is being made only by means of a prospectus and prospectus supplement that form a part of the registration statement. A preliminary prospectus supplement relating to and describing the terms of the Global Offering has been filed with the SEC on February 2  2023 and is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. The final prospectus supplement relating to the Global Offering will be filed with the SEC. When available  copies of the final prospectus supplement (and accompanying prospectus) relating to the Global Offering may be obtained from Jefferies LLC  Attention: Equity Syndicate Prospectus Department  520 Madison Avenue  2nd Floor  New York  NY 10022 or by telephone at (877) 821-7388 or by email at Prospectus_Department@Jefferies.com; or Barclays Capital Inc.  c/o Broadridge Financial Solutions  1155 Long Island Avenue  Edgewood  NY 11717  or by telephone (888) 603-5847 or by email at Barclaysprospectus@broadridge.com The preliminary prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus  together with the documents incorporated by reference therein do not include any inside information (as defined under Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 16  2014 on market abuse as amended (MAR)).This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities  nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

With this number of shares  the total amount of dividends to be distributed would be EUR 5 748 072.70.Klaus Korhonen  interim President and CEO:”2022 was a difficult year for Suominen. The unprecedented raw material inflation which impacted us significantly already in 2021 persisted  and additionally also energy costs surged in 2022 after Russia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine in February. Suominen’s US business specifically continued to suffer from the high inventory levels in the whole supply chain  where imbalance started to normalize only during the second half of the year.Our net sales in 2022 reached EUR 493.3 million (443.2). Although sales volumes decreased from 2021  net sales were high driven by higher sales prices and also tailwind from currencies which amounted to EUR 32.9 million. Our comparable EBITDA decreased clearly from the previous year and was EUR 15.3 million (47.0). The higher sales prices could not fully compensate for the volume loss and for the higher raw material and energy costs. To improve our profitability  we took several actions during the year such as implementing energy surcharges in Europe in March and September and a general cost surcharge in North America in August as well as widening our product portfolio in the US.We announced in June 2022 an investment to enhance and upgrade one of our lines in Nakkila  Finland. The investment strengthens our capabilities in sustainable products and is made in line with our strategy and vision to be the frontrunner in sustainable nonwovens. The investment project is proceeding according to plan and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023.We are continuously developing our sustainable product offering and our target is to increase the sales of sustainable products by 50% compared to the base year of 2019 and launch over 10 sustainable products per year. In 2022  the sales of sustainable products were 99% higher than in the baseline year 2019 and during the year we launched 12 sustainable products. One example of new products launched in 2022 is our first carbon neutral product BIOLACE® Zero. We also opened our own compostability test center Green Lab in Nakkila  Finland to support our product development.In 2022 we completed the EcoVadis sustainability assessment for the first time and received a silver level rating. This result places us in the top 8% of companies in the manufacture of other textiles industry rated by EcoVadis.Tommi Björnman was appointed Suominen’s new President and CEO in November 2022. He currently works as President and CEO of Avgol Nonwovens and will join Suominen in May 2023 at the latest.In January 2023 we started a consultation procedure regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at our Mozzate plant in Italy. The decision was made with a heavy heart but we see it as unavoidable given the market situation in Europe and the ongoing transition to more sustainable nonwovens for wipes. The plan has no impact to Suominen’s operations at the Cressa plant in Italy.Looking at the year ahead we see several market drivers with a positive impact to Suominen. The raw material cost inflation finally turned in Q4/2022  the energy markets show signs of price decline and in the US market the inventory levels have now receded to their normal levels. However  it remains to be seen how the current high consumer price inflation impacts the end consumer demand of wipes. Usually the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation.To conclude  I want to thank all our employees for their contribution and hard work and our business partners for excellent cooperation in 2022.”NET SALESOctober–December 2022In the fourth quarter  Suominen’s net sales increased by 15.1% from the comparison period to EUR 133.1 million (115.6). Sales volumes were in line with the comparison period and Q3/2022 while sales prices increased. Currencies impacted net sales positively by EUR 9.3 million.Net sales of the Americas business area amounted to EUR 81.7 million (68.9) and net sales of the Europe business area EUR 51.4 million (46.7).Financial year 2022In 2022  Suominen’s net sales increased by 11.3% from the comparison period to EUR 493.3 million (443.2). The increase in sales was driven by higher sales prices and tailwind from currencies; sales volumes decreased from 2021. Currencies impacted net sales positively by EUR 32.9 million.Net sales of Americas business area were EUR 288.0 million (265.2) and net sales of Europe business area EUR 205.5 million (178.1).EBITDA  OPERATING PROFIT AND RESULTOctober–December 2022Comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) was EUR 5.0 million (9.0). EBITDA was EUR 4.0 million (9.0). The main reasons for the result decline were higher raw material and energy costs versus sales prices and costs related to the CEO change.

Income taxes for the financial year were EUR -2.0 million (-5.8). The income taxes of the year were impacted by derecognition of deferred tax assets in certain countries where Suominen operates as the possibility to utilize assets had decreased.The profit for the period was EUR -13.9 million (20.7).FINANCINGThe Group’s net interest-bearing liabilities  calculated with the nominal value of the interest-bearing liabilities at the end of the review period  December 31  2022  amounted to EUR 54.6 million (49.6). Gearing was 37.4% (30.4%) and equity ratio 42.5% (42.2%).In 2022  net financial expenses were EUR -2.9 million (-0.4)  or 0.6% (0.1%) of net sales. Net effect of changes in foreign exchange rates in financial items were EUR +2.8 million (+1.7).Suominen sold its minority share in Amerplast (Bright Maze Oy) in March 2021.

The change in the net working capital in 2022 was EUR 7.8 million positive (EUR 25.2 million negative) due to higher payables.In June 2022  Suominen announced that it has extended by one year the maturity of the EUR 100 million syndicated revolving credit facility agreement signed in July 2020.

Interruptions at the plants caused for example by machinery breakdown can cause production losses and delivery problems. Ongoing maintenance and investments aiming to extend the lifetime of the assets are an essential part of ensuring the operational efficiency of the existing production lines.Suominen’s operations could be disrupted due to abrupt and unforeseen events beyond the company's control  such as power outages or fire and water damage. Suominen may not be able to control such events through predictive actions  which could lead to interruptions in business. Risks of this type are insured in order to guarantee the continuity of operations. As Suominen has a valid damage and business interruption insurance  it is expected that the damage would be compensated  and the financial losses caused by the interruption of business would be covered.Suominen uses certain technologies in its production. In the management’s view  the chosen technologies are competitive and there is no need to make major investments in new technologies. However  it cannot be excluded that the company’s technology choices could prove wrong  and the development of new or substitute technologies would then require investments.CompetitionSuominen has numerous regional  national and global competitors in its different product groups. Products based on new technologies and imports from countries of lower production costs may reduce Suominen’s competitive edge. If Suominen is not able to compete with an attractive product offering  it may lose some of its market share. Competition may lead to increased pricing pressure on the company’s products.Price and availability of raw materialsSuominen purchases significant amounts of pulp- and oil-based raw materials. Raw materials are the largest cost item for operations. Changes in the global market prices of raw materials can have an impact on the company’s profitability. Suominen’s stocks equal two to four weeks’ consumption and it generally takes two to five months for raw material price changes to be reflected in Suominen’s customer pricing either through automatic pricing mechanisms or negotiated price changes.Extended interruptions in the supply of Suominen’s main raw materials could disrupt production and have a negative impact on the Group’s overall business operations. As Suominen sources most of its raw materials from a number of major international suppliers  significant interruptions in the production of the majority of Suominen’s products are unlikely.Price and availability of energyEnergy costs represent a significant portion of Suominen's production costs. Suominen consumes mainly electricity and gas. Higher prices as well as reduced availability of energy could have an impact on Suominen's profitability through increased production costs.Market and customer risksSuominen’s customer base is fairly concentrated  which increases the potential impact of changes in customer specific sales volumes. In 2022  the Group’s ten largest customers accounted for 64% (66%) of the Group net sales. Long-term contracts are preferred with the largest customers. In practice  the customer relationships are long-term and last for several years. Customer-related credit risks are managed in accordance with a credit policy approved by the Board of Directors. Credit limits are confirmed for customers on the basis of credit ratings and customer history.The demand for Suominen’s products depends on possible changes in consumer preferences. Historically  such changes have had mainly a positive impact on Suominen  as they have resulted in the growing demand for products made of nonwovens. For example  the COVID-19 pandemic increased the demand for nonwovens for cleaning and disinfecting wipes. However  certain factors  including consumers’ attitude towards the use of products made even partially of oil-based raw materials  or their perception on the sustainability of disposable products in general  might change the consumers’ buying habits. Suominen monitors the consumer trends proactively and develops its product offering accordingly. The company has had biodegradable  100% plant-based nonwovens in its portfolio for over 15 years and hence is well positioned to respond to changes in customer preferences related to sustainability and climate change.Generally the demand for nonwovens for wipes has been resilient to changing economic conditions. However  it is conceivable that high consumer price inflation could lead to decline in end consumer demand for wiping products as the consumers’ available income effectively decreases.Regarding the war in Ukraine  the direct impact to Suominen’s business is minor as we have no customers nor suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. Suominen is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war which contribute to the cost inflation.Changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditionsSuominen’s business and products can be affected directly or indirectly by political decisions and changes in government regulations for example in areas such as environmental policy or waste legislation. An example of such legislation is the EU's Single-Use Plastics Directive that focuses on reducing marine litter. The potential exists for similar regulations to expand worldwide. This creates demand for more sustainable products  and Suominen is well placed to respond to this increasing demand.Global political developments could have an adverse effect on Suominen. For instance  a political decision that constrains the global free trade may significantly impact the availability and price of certain raw materials  which would in turn affect Suominen’s business and profitability. Suominen’s geographical and customer-industry diversity provide partial protection against this risk.The relevance of the United States in Suominen’s business operations increases the significance of the exchange rate risk related to USD in the Group’s total foreign exchange position. Suominen hedges this foreign exchange position in accordance with its hedging policy.The risks that are characteristic to South American region  including significant changes in political environment or exchange rates  could have an impact on Suominen’s operations in Brazil.InvestmentsSuominen continuously invests in its manufacturing facilities. The deployment of the investments may delay from what was planned  the costs of the investments may increase from what has been expected or the investments may create less business benefits than anticipated. The deployment phase of investments may cause temporary interruptions in operations.Cyber and information securitySuominen’s operations are dependent on the integrity  security and stable operation of its information and communication systems and software as well as on the successful management of cyber attack risks. If Suominen’s information and communication systems and software were to become unusable or significantly impaired for an extended period of time  or the cyber attack risks are realized  Suominen’s reputation as well as ability to deliver products at the appointed time  order raw materials and handle inventory could be adversely impacted.Financial risksThe Group is exposed to several financial risks  such as foreign exchange  interest rate  counterparty  liquidity and credit risks. The Group’s financial risks are managed in line with a policy confirmed by the Board of Directors. The financial risks are described in the Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements.Suominen is subject to corporate income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine the total amount of corporate income tax at Group level. There are many transactions and calculations that leave room for uncertainty as to the final amount of the income taxes. Tax risks relate also to changes in tax rates or tax legislation or misinterpretations  and materialization of the risks could result in increased payments or sanctions by the tax authorities  which in turn could lead to financial loss. Deferred tax assets included in the statement of financial position require that the deferred tax assets can be recovered against the future taxable income.Suominen performs goodwill impairment testing annually. In impairment testing the recoverable amounts are determined as the value in use  which comprises of the discounted projected future cash flows. Actual cash flows can differ from the discounted projected future cash flows. Uncertainties related to the projected future cash flows include  among others  the long economic useful life of the assets and changes in the forecast sales prices of Suominen’s products  production costs as well as discount rates used in testing. Due to the uncertainty inherent in the future  it is possible that Suominen’s recoverable amounts will be insufficient to cover the carrying amounts of assets  particularly goodwill. If this happens  it will be necessary to recognize an impairment loss  which  when implemented  will weaken the result and equity. Goodwill impairment testing has been described in the consolidated financial statements.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTSuominen’s nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods such as wet wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points.The market expectation is that in the long run the end user demand for wipes will remain above pre-COVID levels. However  towards the end of the second quarter in 2021  especially our North American customers started to experience a sudden deceleration of demand  which in combination with extraordinary stockpiling throughout the entire supply chain created an imbalance of inventories. This impacted also Suominen’s orders  although in several cases we were able to benefit from our position as the preferred supplier of our customers. The demand started to recover in H2/2022 with full recovery expected from 2023 onwards.Looking at the year ahead there are several market drivers with a positive impact to Suominen. The raw material cost inflation finally turned in Q4/2022  and the energy markets show signs of price decline and in the US market the inventory levels have now receded to their normal levels. However  it remains to be seen how the current high consumer price inflation impacts the end consumer demand of wipes. Usually the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation.OUTLOOKSuominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2023 will increase from 2022. In 2022  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 15.3 million.PROPOSAL ON DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDSThe profit of the financial year 2022 of Suominen Corporation  the parent company of Suominen Group  was EUR 7 988 424.28. The funds distributable as dividends  including the profit for the period  were EUR 16 088 436 and total distributable funds were EUR 91 780 772.The Board of Directors proposes that a dividend of EUR 0.10 per share shall be distributed for the financial year 2022 and that the profit shall be transferred to retained earnings.On February 2  2023  the company had 57 480 727 issued shares  excluding treasury shares. With this number of shares  the total amount of dividends to be distributed would be EUR 5 748 072.70.There have been no significant changes in the company’s financial position after the end of the review period.The record date is April 5  2023 and the dividend will be paid on April 14  2023.DISCLOSURE OF THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT  REMUNERATION REPORT  THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  THE REPORT BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND NON-FINANCIAL REPORTSuominen will publish its Financial Statements  Report by the Board of Directors  Auditor’s Report  Corporate Governance Statement  Remuneration Report and Non-Financial Report including EU Taxonomy report  concerning the financial year 2022  as part of the Annual Report during the week commencing March 6  2023. The above documents will be published as a Stock Exchange Release and they will be available also at www.suominen.fi.ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 2023The Annual General Meeting of Suominen Corporation is planned to be held on April 3  2023. The Board of Directors will convene the Annual General Meeting by issuing a Notice to the Annual General Meeting as a Stock Exchange Release. The notice to the Annual General Meeting will also be published at www.suominen.fi.EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIODSuominen initiates consultation procedure concerning a plan to permanently close manufacturing at its Mozzate plant in Italy (January 10  2023)Suominen will start consultation with local trade unions regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at its Mozzate plant. According to the plan  the production would end during the second quarter of 2023. The consultation will be conducted in accordance with the Italian legislation and applicable National Collective Agreement and is aimed to be completed within 90 days. The Mozzate site currently employs 92 people  working both in production and in office roles.“Since the normalization of the COVID-induced demand surge  the competition in the European wipes nonwovens market has increased significantly driven mainly by imports from Turkey and China. This is the case especially in the traditional blended fiber products. At the same time energy costs in Italy have increased to record high levels. These two factors combined have created huge challenges for the cost competitiveness of our plant in Mozzate ” says Klaus Korhonen  interim President & CEO.The wipes nonwovens market is rapidly transitioning towards more sustainable alternatives. In line with its strategy  Suominen has set targets to increase the sales of sustainable products and to continuously innovate new environmentally friendly nonwovens.“The demand for traditional blended fiber products in Europe is declining. Manufacturing sustainable nonwovens competitively requires production assets and processes optimized specifically for these products. Our lines at the Mozzate plant are not best suited for sustainable fibers  and this combined with high operating costs means that the plant is not competitive and its competitiveness is not expected to improve materially going forward. We are constantly evaluating the performance and profitability of our assets  and in the current situation we have unfortunately come to the conclusion that we need to consider closing the production at Mozzate to improve the competitiveness of our European business ” Klaus Korhonen concludes.The expected financial impacts of the potential closure are approx. EUR 9 million in one-time cash costs in 2023‒24 consisting mainly of severance costs  dismantling the production lines and restoration of leased buildings. One-time net non-cash costs are expected to be approx. EUR 3 million of which approx. EUR 4.5 million will be posted in Q4/2022 and approx. EUR -1.5 million in 2023‒24 corresponding to releases of certain provisions. If implemented  the plan is expected to yield a positive EBITDA impact of approx. EUR 3 million on an annualized basis.Proposals by the Nomination Board to the Annual General Meeting 2023 of Suominen (January 13  2023)Proposal on the number of the members  on the composition  and on the Chair of the Board of DirectorsThe Nomination Board of Suominen Corporation’s shareholders proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the number of Board members remains unchanged and would be six (6).The Nomination Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that Andreas Ahlström  Aaron Barsness  Björn Borgman  Jaakko Eskola and Nina Linander would be re-elected as members of the Board of Directors and that Laura Remes would be elected as a new member of the Board of Directors.Out of the current Board members  Laura Raitio has informed that she is no longer available as a candidate for the Board of Directors.Laura Remes (born 1980  M.Sc.

The Auditor’s report has been signed on February 2  2023. Quarterly information  half-year report and interim reports have not been audited.As result of rounding differences  the figures presented in the tables do not necessarily add up to total.ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLESThe consolidated financial statements of Suominen Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  including International Accounting Standards (IAS) and Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (SIC and IFRIC). International Financial Reporting Standards are standards and their interpretations adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The Notes to the Financial Statements are also in accordance with the Finnish Accounting Act and Ordinance and the Finnish Companies' Act.This financial statement release has been prepared in accordance with the principles defined in IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as approved by the European Union. Financial statement release does not include all information required for full financial statements.The principles for preparing consolidated financial statements are mainly the same as those used for preparing the consolidated financial statements for 2021. The new or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022 are presented below.New or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022:- Improvements to IFRS (2018–2020 cycle): Improvement to IFRS 9 – Fees in the ""10 percent"" Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities  applicable from January 1  2022. The amendment clarifies the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. The fees include only fees paid or received between the borrower and the lender.- Amendments to IAS 16 – Property  Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use  applicable from January 1  2022. The amendment prohibits companies deducting from the acquisition cost of an item of property  plant and equipment any proceeds of the sale of items produced while bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The sales proceeds of producing such items as well as the expenses of producing the items are to be recognized in profit or loss. The amendment was to be applied retrospectively. For Suominen  the amendment did not result in any restatement of previously published figures.Other new or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022 were not material for Suominen Group.New and amended IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations published but mandatory from January 1  2023 or later:- Amendments to IAS 1 – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current  applicable from January 1  2024. The amendment specifies the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current  by clarifying for example what is meant by a right to defer settlement  that a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period and that classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right. The amendment will be applied retrospectively. The amendment has no effect on the consolidated financial statements of Suominen.- Disclosure of Accounting Policies – Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendment replaces the requirement to disclose ""significant"" accounting policies with a requirement to disclose ""material"" accounting policies. The amendment aims to help companies to disclose accounting policies  which are material for users to understand the information in the company's financial statements. The amendments require judgement in determining whether accounting policies are material or not. The amendment may have some effect on the disclosure of accounting policies in Suominen's consolidated financial statements  as the accounting principles presented in the consolidated financial statements will concentrate on presenting the accounting principles which are material for Suominen.- Definition of Accounting Estimates – Amendments to IAS 8  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendments clarify the distinction between the changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. The amendment clarifies that the effects on an accounting estimate of a change in an input or a change in a measurement technique are changes in accounting estimates if they do not result from the correction of prior period errors. The amendment does not have any material impact on Suominen's consolidated financial statements.- Amendments to IAS 12 – Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendments are to be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.The amendment narrowed the scope of the initial recognition exception under IAS 12  so that it no longer applies to taxable and deductible temporary differences. The amendment clarifies deferred tax accounting for transactions and events  such as leases and decommissioning obligations that lead to the initial recognition of both an asset and a liability. The amendments require companies to recognize a separate deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability when the temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of an asset and a liability are equal.As in the most cases the deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from recognition of leases can be offset with each other  the amendment has not material effect on the consolidated statement of financial position of Suominen. The amendment will  however  change the disclosure information in the consolidated financial statements related to the deferred taxes.Other new or amended standards  improvements or annual improvements applicable from January 1  2023 or later are not material for Suominen Group.STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITIONEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Assets Non-current assets Goodwill 15 496 15

performance measures (cash flow from operations per share).Earnings per shareBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net result attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted share-issue adjusted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period  excluding shares acquired by the Group and held as treasury shares.When calculating diluted earnings per share the number of shares is adjusted with the effects of the share-based incentive plans.EUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Profit for the period -13 863 20 734 Average share-issue adjusted number of

30.8Alternative performance measuresSome of Suominen's key ratios are alternative performance measures. An alternative performance measure is a key ratio which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparison between the reporting periods.Operating profit and comparable operating profitOperating profit  or earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is an important measure of profitability as by ignoring income taxes and financial items it focuses solely on the company's ability to generate profit from operations. Operating profit is presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.In order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods  Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods. These items include  among others  impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses  gains or losses from the sales of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets or other assets and restructuring costs. Suominen did not have any items affecting comparability in 2021. In 2022  items affecting comparability of result were impairment losses of property  plant and equipment  right-of-use assets and inventory  arising from the planned closure of the production lines in Italy.Operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Operating profit -8 958 26 941 + Impairment losses of property  plant and equipment  affecting comparability of result 2 288 − + Impairment losses of right-of-use assets  affecting comparability of result 1 536 − + Impairment losses of inventories  affecting comparability of result 971 − Comparable operating profit -4 163 26 941EBITDA and comparable EBITDAEBITDA is an important measure that focuses on the operating performance excluding the effect of depreciation and amortization  financial items and income taxes  in other words what is the margin on net sales after deducting operating expenses.EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment lossesComparable EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment losses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Operating profit -8 958 26 941 + Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 23 245 20 092 EBITDA 14 287 47 033 EBITDA 14 287 47 033 + Impairment losses of inventories  affecting comparability of result 971 − Comparable EBITDA 15 257 47 033Gross capital expenditureSuominen considers gross capital expenditure as a relevant measure in order to understand for example how the Group maintains and renews its production machinery and facilities. Gross capital expenditure includes also capitalized borrowing costs and capitalized cash flow hedges. Gross capital expenditure (gross investments) does not include increases in right-of-use assets.EUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Increases in intangible assets 438 162 Increases in property  plant and equipment 9 275 17 609 Gross capital expenditure 9 713 17 771Interest-bearing net debtSuominen considers interest-bearing net debt to be an important measure for investors to be able to understand the Group’s indebtedness. It is the opinion of Suominen that presenting interest-bearing liabilities not only at amortized cost but also at nominal value gives relevant additional information to the investors.Interest-bearing net debt = Interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value - interest-bearing receivables - cash and cash equivalentsEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Interest-bearing liabilities 103 365 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 705 1 794 Cash and cash equivalents -49 508 -101 357 Interest-bearing net debt 54 562 49 570 Interest-bearing liabilities 103 365 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 705 1 794 Nominal value of interest-bearing liabilities 104 069 150 927Return on equity (ROE)  %The return on equity is one of the most important profitability ratios used by owners and investors.

With this number of shares  the total amount of dividends to be distributed would be EUR 5 748 072.70.Klaus Korhonen  interim President and CEO:”2022 was a difficult year for Suominen. The unprecedented raw material inflation which impacted us significantly already in 2021 persisted  and additionally also energy costs surged in 2022 after Russia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine in February. Suominen’s US business specifically continued to suffer from the high inventory levels in the whole supply chain  where imbalance started to normalize only during the second half of the year.Our net sales in 2022 reached EUR 493.3 million (443.2). Although sales volumes decreased from 2021  net sales were high driven by higher sales prices and also tailwind from currencies which amounted to EUR 32.9 million. Our comparable EBITDA decreased clearly from the previous year and was EUR 15.3 million (47.0). The higher sales prices could not fully compensate for the volume loss and for the higher raw material and energy costs. To improve our profitability  we took several actions during the year such as implementing energy surcharges in Europe in March and September and a general cost surcharge in North America in August as well as widening our product portfolio in the US.We announced in June 2022 an investment to enhance and upgrade one of our lines in Nakkila  Finland. The investment strengthens our capabilities in sustainable products and is made in line with our strategy and vision to be the frontrunner in sustainable nonwovens. The investment project is proceeding according to plan and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023.We are continuously developing our sustainable product offering and our target is to increase the sales of sustainable products by 50% compared to the base year of 2019 and launch over 10 sustainable products per year. In 2022  the sales of sustainable products were 99% higher than in the baseline year 2019 and during the year we launched 12 sustainable products. One example of new products launched in 2022 is our first carbon neutral product BIOLACE® Zero. We also opened our own compostability test center Green Lab in Nakkila  Finland to support our product development.In 2022 we completed the EcoVadis sustainability assessment for the first time and received a silver level rating. This result places us in the top 8% of companies in the manufacture of other textiles industry rated by EcoVadis.Tommi Björnman was appointed Suominen’s new President and CEO in November 2022. He currently works as President and CEO of Avgol Nonwovens and will join Suominen in May 2023 at the latest.In January 2023 we started a consultation procedure regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at our Mozzate plant in Italy. The decision was made with a heavy heart but we see it as unavoidable given the market situation in Europe and the ongoing transition to more sustainable nonwovens for wipes. The plan has no impact to Suominen’s operations at the Cressa plant in Italy.Looking at the year ahead we see several market drivers with a positive impact to Suominen. The raw material cost inflation finally turned in Q4/2022  the energy markets show signs of price decline and in the US market the inventory levels have now receded to their normal levels. However  it remains to be seen how the current high consumer price inflation impacts the end consumer demand of wipes. Usually the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation.To conclude  I want to thank all our employees for their contribution and hard work and our business partners for excellent cooperation in 2022.”NET SALESOctober–December 2022In the fourth quarter  Suominen’s net sales increased by 15.1% from the comparison period to EUR 133.1 million (115.6).

The income taxes of the year were impacted by derecognition of deferred tax assets in certain countries where Suominen operates as the possibility to utilize assets had decreased.The profit for the period was EUR -13.9 million (20.7).FINANCINGThe Group’s net interest-bearing liabilities  calculated with the nominal value of the interest-bearing liabilities at the end of the review period  December 31  2022  amounted to EUR 54.6 million (49.6).

Net effect of changes in foreign exchange rates in financial items were EUR +2.8 million (+1.7).Suominen sold its minority share in Amerplast (Bright Maze Oy) in March 2021.

Interruptions at the plants caused for example by machinery breakdown can cause production losses and delivery problems. Ongoing maintenance and investments aiming to extend the lifetime of the assets are an essential part of ensuring the operational efficiency of the existing production lines.Suominen’s operations could be disrupted due to abrupt and unforeseen events beyond the company's control  such as power outages or fire and water damage. Suominen may not be able to control such events through predictive actions  which could lead to interruptions in business. Risks of this type are insured in order to guarantee the continuity of operations. As Suominen has a valid damage and business interruption insurance  it is expected that the damage would be compensated  and the financial losses caused by the interruption of business would be covered.Suominen uses certain technologies in its production. In the management’s view  the chosen technologies are competitive and there is no need to make major investments in new technologies. However  it cannot be excluded that the company’s technology choices could prove wrong  and the development of new or substitute technologies would then require investments.CompetitionSuominen has numerous regional  national and global competitors in its different product groups. Products based on new technologies and imports from countries of lower production costs may reduce Suominen’s competitive edge. If Suominen is not able to compete with an attractive product offering  it may lose some of its market share. Competition may lead to increased pricing pressure on the company’s products.Price and availability of raw materialsSuominen purchases significant amounts of pulp- and oil-based raw materials. Raw materials are the largest cost item for operations. Changes in the global market prices of raw materials can have an impact on the company’s profitability. Suominen’s stocks equal two to four weeks’ consumption and it generally takes two to five months for raw material price changes to be reflected in Suominen’s customer pricing either through automatic pricing mechanisms or negotiated price changes.Extended interruptions in the supply of Suominen’s main raw materials could disrupt production and have a negative impact on the Group’s overall business operations. As Suominen sources most of its raw materials from a number of major international suppliers  significant interruptions in the production of the majority of Suominen’s products are unlikely.Price and availability of energyEnergy costs represent a significant portion of Suominen's production costs. Suominen consumes mainly electricity and gas. Higher prices as well as reduced availability of energy could have an impact on Suominen's profitability through increased production costs.Market and customer risksSuominen’s customer base is fairly concentrated  which increases the potential impact of changes in customer specific sales volumes. In 2022  the Group’s ten largest customers accounted for 64% (66%) of the Group net sales. Long-term contracts are preferred with the largest customers. In practice  the customer relationships are long-term and last for several years. Customer-related credit risks are managed in accordance with a credit policy approved by the Board of Directors. Credit limits are confirmed for customers on the basis of credit ratings and customer history.The demand for Suominen’s products depends on possible changes in consumer preferences. Historically  such changes have had mainly a positive impact on Suominen  as they have resulted in the growing demand for products made of nonwovens. For example  the COVID-19 pandemic increased the demand for nonwovens for cleaning and disinfecting wipes. However  certain factors  including consumers’ attitude towards the use of products made even partially of oil-based raw materials  or their perception on the sustainability of disposable products in general  might change the consumers’ buying habits. Suominen monitors the consumer trends proactively and develops its product offering accordingly. The company has had biodegradable  100% plant-based nonwovens in its portfolio for over 15 years and hence is well positioned to respond to changes in customer preferences related to sustainability and climate change.Generally the demand for nonwovens for wipes has been resilient to changing economic conditions. However  it is conceivable that high consumer price inflation could lead to decline in end consumer demand for wiping products as the consumers’ available income effectively decreases.Regarding the war in Ukraine  the direct impact to Suominen’s business is minor as we have no customers nor suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. Suominen is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war which contribute to the cost inflation.Changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditionsSuominen’s business and products can be affected directly or indirectly by political decisions and changes in government regulations for example in areas such as environmental policy or waste legislation. An example of such legislation is the EU's Single-Use Plastics Directive that focuses on reducing marine litter. The potential exists for similar regulations to expand worldwide. This creates demand for more sustainable products  and Suominen is well placed to respond to this increasing demand.Global political developments could have an adverse effect on Suominen. For instance  a political decision that constrains the global free trade may significantly impact the availability and price of certain raw materials  which would in turn affect Suominen’s business and profitability. Suominen’s geographical and customer-industry diversity provide partial protection against this risk.The relevance of the United States in Suominen’s business operations increases the significance of the exchange rate risk related to USD in the Group’s total foreign exchange position. Suominen hedges this foreign exchange position in accordance with its hedging policy.The risks that are characteristic to South American region  including significant changes in political environment or exchange rates  could have an impact on Suominen’s operations in Brazil.InvestmentsSuominen continuously invests in its manufacturing facilities. The deployment of the investments may delay from what was planned  the costs of the investments may increase from what has been expected or the investments may create less business benefits than anticipated. The deployment phase of investments may cause temporary interruptions in operations.Cyber and information securitySuominen’s operations are dependent on the integrity  security and stable operation of its information and communication systems and software as well as on the successful management of cyber attack risks. If Suominen’s information and communication systems and software were to become unusable or significantly impaired for an extended period of time  or the cyber attack risks are realized  Suominen’s reputation as well as ability to deliver products at the appointed time  order raw materials and handle inventory could be adversely impacted.Financial risksThe Group is exposed to several financial risks  such as foreign exchange  interest rate  counterparty  liquidity and credit risks. The Group’s financial risks are managed in line with a policy confirmed by the Board of Directors. The financial risks are described in the Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements.Suominen is subject to corporate income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine the total amount of corporate income tax at Group level. There are many transactions and calculations that leave room for uncertainty as to the final amount of the income taxes. Tax risks relate also to changes in tax rates or tax legislation or misinterpretations  and materialization of the risks could result in increased payments or sanctions by the tax authorities  which in turn could lead to financial loss. Deferred tax assets included in the statement of financial position require that the deferred tax assets can be recovered against the future taxable income.Suominen performs goodwill impairment testing annually. In impairment testing the recoverable amounts are determined as the value in use  which comprises of the discounted projected future cash flows. Actual cash flows can differ from the discounted projected future cash flows. Uncertainties related to the projected future cash flows include  among others  the long economic useful life of the assets and changes in the forecast sales prices of Suominen’s products  production costs as well as discount rates used in testing. Due to the uncertainty inherent in the future  it is possible that Suominen’s recoverable amounts will be insufficient to cover the carrying amounts of assets  particularly goodwill. If this happens  it will be necessary to recognize an impairment loss  which  when implemented  will weaken the result and equity. Goodwill impairment testing has been described in the consolidated financial statements.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTSuominen’s nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods such as wet wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points.The market expectation is that in the long run the end user demand for wipes will remain above pre-COVID levels. However  towards the end of the second quarter in 2021  especially our North American customers started to experience a sudden deceleration of demand  which in combination with extraordinary stockpiling throughout the entire supply chain created an imbalance of inventories. This impacted also Suominen’s orders  although in several cases we were able to benefit from our position as the preferred supplier of our customers. The demand started to recover in H2/2022 with full recovery expected from 2023 onwards.Looking at the year ahead there are several market drivers with a positive impact to Suominen. The raw material cost inflation finally turned in Q4/2022  and the energy markets show signs of price decline and in the US market the inventory levels have now receded to their normal levels. However  it remains to be seen how the current high consumer price inflation impacts the end consumer demand of wipes. Usually the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation.OUTLOOKSuominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2023 will increase from 2022. In 2022  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 15.3 million.PROPOSAL ON DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDSThe profit of the financial year 2022 of Suominen Corporation  the parent company of Suominen Group  was EUR 7 988 424.28. The funds distributable as dividends  including the profit for the period  were EUR 16 088 436 and total distributable funds were EUR 91 780 772.The Board of Directors proposes that a dividend of EUR 0.10 per share shall be distributed for the financial year 2022 and that the profit shall be transferred to retained earnings.On February 2  2023  the company had 57 480 727 issued shares  excluding treasury shares. With this number of shares  the total amount of dividends to be distributed would be EUR 5 748 072.70.There have been no significant changes in the company’s financial position after the end of the review period.The record date is April 5  2023 and the dividend will be paid on April 12  2023.DISCLOSURE OF THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT  REMUNERATION REPORT  THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  THE REPORT BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND NON-FINANCIAL REPORTSuominen will publish its Financial Statements  Report by the Board of Directors  Auditor’s Report  Corporate Governance Statement  Remuneration Report and Non-Financial Report including EU Taxonomy report  concerning the financial year 2022  as part of the Annual Report during the week commencing March 6  2023. The above documents will be published as a Stock Exchange Release and they will be available also at www.suominen.fi.ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 2023The Annual General Meeting of Suominen Corporation is planned to be held on April 3  2023. The Board of Directors will convene the Annual General Meeting by issuing a Notice to the Annual General Meeting as a Stock Exchange Release. The notice to the Annual General Meeting will also be published at www.suominen.fi.EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIODSuominen initiates consultation procedure concerning a plan to permanently close manufacturing at its Mozzate plant in Italy (January 10  2023)Suominen will start consultation with local trade unions regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at its Mozzate plant. According to the plan  the production would end during the second quarter of 2023. The consultation will be conducted in accordance with the Italian legislation and applicable National Collective Agreement and is aimed to be completed within 90 days. The Mozzate site currently employs 92 people  working both in production and in office roles.“Since the normalization of the COVID-induced demand surge  the competition in the European wipes nonwovens market has increased significantly driven mainly by imports from Turkey and China. This is the case especially in the traditional blended fiber products. At the same time energy costs in Italy have increased to record high levels. These two factors combined have created huge challenges for the cost competitiveness of our plant in Mozzate ” says Klaus Korhonen  interim President & CEO.The wipes nonwovens market is rapidly transitioning towards more sustainable alternatives. In line with its strategy  Suominen has set targets to increase the sales of sustainable products and to continuously innovate new environmentally friendly nonwovens.“The demand for traditional blended fiber products in Europe is declining. Manufacturing sustainable nonwovens competitively requires production assets and processes optimized specifically for these products. Our lines at the Mozzate plant are not best suited for sustainable fibers  and this combined with high operating costs means that the plant is not competitive and its competitiveness is not expected to improve materially going forward. We are constantly evaluating the performance and profitability of our assets  and in the current situation we have unfortunately come to the conclusion that we need to consider closing the production at Mozzate to improve the competitiveness of our European business ” Klaus Korhonen concludes.The expected financial impacts of the potential closure are approx. EUR 9 million in one-time cash costs in 2023‒24 consisting mainly of severance costs  dismantling the production lines and restoration of leased buildings. One-time net non-cash costs are expected to be approx. EUR 3 million of which approx. EUR 4.5 million will be posted in Q4/2022 and approx. EUR -1.5 million in 2023‒24 corresponding to releases of certain provisions. If implemented  the plan is expected to yield a positive EBITDA impact of approx. EUR 3 million on an annualized basis.Proposals by the Nomination Board to the Annual General Meeting 2023 of Suominen (January 13  2023)Proposal on the number of the members  on the composition  and on the Chair of the Board of DirectorsThe Nomination Board of Suominen Corporation’s shareholders proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the number of Board members remains unchanged and would be six (6).The Nomination Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that Andreas Ahlström  Aaron Barsness  Björn Borgman  Jaakko Eskola and Nina Linander would be re-elected as members of the Board of Directors and that Laura Remes would be elected as a new member of the Board of Directors.Out of the current Board members  Laura Raitio has informed that she is no longer available as a candidate for the Board of Directors.Laura Remes (born 1980  M.Sc.

The Auditor’s report has been signed on February 2  2023. Quarterly information  half-year report and interim reports have not been audited.As result of rounding differences  the figures presented in the tables do not necessarily add up to total.ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLESThe consolidated financial statements of Suominen Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  including International Accounting Standards (IAS) and Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (SIC and IFRIC). International Financial Reporting Standards are standards and their interpretations adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The Notes to the Financial Statements are also in accordance with the Finnish Accounting Act and Ordinance and the Finnish Companies' Act.This financial statement release has been prepared in accordance with the principles defined in IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as approved by the European Union. Financial statement release does not include all information required for full financial statements.The principles for preparing consolidated financial statements are mainly the same as those used for preparing the consolidated financial statements for 2021. The new or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022 are presented below.New or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022:- Improvements to IFRS (2018–2020 cycle): Improvement to IFRS 9 – Fees in the ""10 percent"" Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities  applicable from January 1  2022. The amendment clarifies the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. The fees include only fees paid or received between the borrower and the lender.- Amendments to IAS 16 – Property  Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use  applicable from January 1  2022. The amendment prohibits companies deducting from the acquisition cost of an item of property  plant and equipment any proceeds of the sale of items produced while bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The sales proceeds of producing such items as well as the expenses of producing the items are to be recognized in profit or loss. The amendment was to be applied retrospectively. For Suominen  the amendment did not result in any restatement of previously published figures.Other new or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022 were not material for Suominen Group.New and amended IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations published but mandatory from January 1  2023 or later:- Amendments to IAS 1 – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current  applicable from January 1  2024. The amendment specifies the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current  by clarifying for example what is meant by a right to defer settlement  that a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period and that classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right. The amendment will be applied retrospectively. The amendment has no effect on the consolidated financial statements of Suominen.- Disclosure of Accounting Policies – Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendment replaces the requirement to disclose ""significant"" accounting policies with a requirement to disclose ""material"" accounting policies. The amendment aims to help companies to disclose accounting policies  which are material for users to understand the information in the company's financial statements. The amendments require judgement in determining whether accounting policies are material or not. The amendment may have some effect on the disclosure of accounting policies in Suominen's consolidated financial statements  as the accounting principles presented in the consolidated financial statements will concentrate on presenting the accounting principles which are material for Suominen.- Definition of Accounting Estimates – Amendments to IAS 8  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendments clarify the distinction between the changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. The amendment clarifies that the effects on an accounting estimate of a change in an input or a change in a measurement technique are changes in accounting estimates if they do not result from the correction of prior period errors. The amendment does not have any material impact on Suominen's consolidated financial statements.- Amendments to IAS 12 – Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendments are to be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.The amendment narrowed the scope of the initial recognition exception under IAS 12  so that it no longer applies to taxable and deductible temporary differences. The amendment clarifies deferred tax accounting for transactions and events  such as leases and decommissioning obligations that lead to the initial recognition of both an asset and a liability. The amendments require companies to recognize a separate deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability when the temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of an asset and a liability are equal.As in the most cases the deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from recognition of leases can be offset with each other  the amendment has not material effect on the consolidated statement of financial position of Suominen. The amendment will  however  change the disclosure information in the consolidated financial statements related to the deferred taxes.Other new or amended standards  improvements or annual improvements applicable from January 1  2023 or later are not material for Suominen Group.STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITIONEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Assets Non-current assets Goodwill 15 496 15

performance measures (cash flow from operations per share).Earnings per shareBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net result attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted share-issue adjusted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period  excluding shares acquired by the Group and held as treasury shares.When calculating diluted earnings per share the number of shares is adjusted with the effects of the share-based incentive plans.EUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Profit for the period -13 863 20 734 Average share-issue adjusted number of

30.8Alternative performance measuresSome of Suominen's key ratios are alternative performance measures. An alternative performance measure is a key ratio which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparison between the reporting periods.Operating profit and comparable operating profitOperating profit  or earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is an important measure of profitability as by ignoring income taxes and financial items it focuses solely on the company's ability to generate profit from operations. Operating profit is presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.In order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods  Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods. These items include  among others  impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses  gains or losses from the sales of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets or other assets and restructuring costs. Suominen did not have any items affecting comparability in 2021. In 2022  items affecting comparability of result were impairment losses of property  plant and equipment  right-of-use assets and inventory  arising from the planned closure of the production lines in Italy.Operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Operating profit -8 958 26 941 + Impairment losses of property  plant and equipment  affecting comparability of result 2 288 − + Impairment losses of right-of-use assets  affecting comparability of result 1 536 − + Impairment losses of inventories  affecting comparability of result 971 − Comparable operating profit -4 163 26 941EBITDA and comparable EBITDAEBITDA is an important measure that focuses on the operating performance excluding the effect of depreciation and amortization  financial items and income taxes  in other words what is the margin on net sales after deducting operating expenses.EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment lossesComparable EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment losses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Operating profit -8 958 26 941 + Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 23 245 20 092 EBITDA 14 287 47 033 EBITDA 14 287 47 033 + Impairment losses of inventories  affecting comparability of result 971 − Comparable EBITDA 15 257 47 033Gross capital expenditureSuominen considers gross capital expenditure as a relevant measure in order to understand for example how the Group maintains and renews its production machinery and facilities. Gross capital expenditure includes also capitalized borrowing costs and capitalized cash flow hedges. Gross capital expenditure (gross investments) does not include increases in right-of-use assets.EUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Increases in intangible assets 438 162 Increases in property  plant and equipment 9 275 17 609 Gross capital expenditure 9 713 17 771Interest-bearing net debtSuominen considers interest-bearing net debt to be an important measure for investors to be able to understand the Group’s indebtedness.

In 2022  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 15.3 million. Board proposal on distribution of dividend: The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General meeting  that a dividend of EUR 0.10 per share shall be distributed for the financial year 2022. On February 2  2023  the company had 57 480 727 issued shares  excluding treasury shares. With this number of shares  the total amount of dividends to be distributed would be EUR 5 748 072.70. Klaus Korhonen  interim President and CEO: ”2022 was a difficult year for Suominen. The unprecedented raw material inflation which impacted us significantly already in 2021 persisted  and additionally also energy costs surged in 2022 after Russia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine in February. Suominen’s US business specifically continued to suffer from the high inventory levels in the whole supply chain  where imbalance started to normalize only during the second half of the year. Our net sales in 2022 reached EUR 493.3 million (443.2). Although sales volumes decreased from 2021  net sales were high driven by higher sales prices and also tailwind from currencies which amounted to EUR 32.9 million. Our comparable EBITDA decreased clearly from the previous year and was EUR 15.3 million (47.0). The higher sales prices could not fully compensate for the volume loss and for the higher raw material and energy costs. To improve our profitability  we took several actions during the year such as implementing energy surcharges in Europe in March and September and a general cost surcharge in North America in August as well as widening our product portfolio in the US. We announced in June 2022 an investment to enhance and upgrade one of our lines in Nakkila  Finland. The investment strengthens our capabilities in sustainable products and is made in line with our strategy and vision to be the frontrunner in sustainable nonwovens. The investment project is proceeding according to plan and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023. We are continuously developing our sustainable product offering and our target is to increase the sales of sustainable products by 50% compared to the base year of 2019 and launch over 10 sustainable products per year. In 2022  the sales of sustainable products were 99% higher than in the baseline year 2019 and during the year we launched 12 sustainable products. One example of new products launched in 2022 is our first carbon neutral product BIOLACE® Zero. We also opened our own compostability test center Green Lab in Nakkila  Finland to support our product development. In 2022 we completed the EcoVadis sustainability assessment for the first time and received a silver level rating. This result places us in the top 8% of companies in the manufacture of other textiles industry rated by EcoVadis. Tommi Björnman was appointed Suominen’s new President and CEO in November 2022. He currently works as President and CEO of Avgol Nonwovens and will join Suominen in May 2023 at the latest. In January 2023 we started a consultation procedure regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at our Mozzate plant in Italy. The decision was made with a heavy heart but we see it as unavoidable given the market situation in Europe and the ongoing transition to more sustainable nonwovens for wipes. The plan has no impact to Suominen’s operations at the Cressa plant in Italy. Looking at the year ahead we see several market drivers with a positive impact to Suominen. The raw material cost inflation finally turned in Q4/2022  the energy markets show signs of price decline and in the US market the inventory levels have now receded to their normal levels. However  it remains to be seen how the current high consumer price inflation impacts the end consumer demand of wipes. Usually the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation. To conclude  I want to thank all our employees for their contribution and hard work and our business partners for excellent cooperation in 2022.” NET SALESOctober–December 2022 In the fourth quarter  Suominen’s net sales increased by 15.1% from the comparison period to EUR 133.1 million (115.6).

Gearing was 37.4% (30.4%) and equity ratio 42.5% (42.2%). In 2022  net financial expenses were EUR -2.9 million (-0.4)  or 0.6% (0.1%) of net sales. Net effect of changes in foreign exchange rates in financial items were EUR +2.8 million (+1.7). Suominen sold its minority share in Amerplast (Bright Maze Oy) in March 2021.

The change in the net working capital in 2022 was EUR 7.8 million positive (EUR 25.2 million negative) due to higher payables. In June 2022  Suominen announced that it has extended by one year the maturity of the EUR 100 million syndicated revolving credit facility agreement signed in July 2020. The maturity of the facility is now extended to July 2025. The debenture bond of EUR 85 million issued in 2017 fell due and was repaid in full on October 3  2022. CAPITAL EXPENDITURE In 2022  the gross capital expenditure totaled EUR 9.7 million (17.8) and the largest item was related to the growth investment initiatives in Nakkila  Finland. Other investments were mainly for maintenance. Suominen announced in June that it strengthens its capabilities in sustainable products by enhancing and upgrading one of its production lines in Nakkila  Finland. The investment is made in line with Suominen’s strategy and supports company’s vision to be the frontrunner in sustainability. The total value of the investment is approximately EUR 6 million and the investment project will be completed in the second half of 2023. Depreciations and amortizations were EUR -19.4 million (-20.1) and impairment losses were EUR -3.8 million. PERSONNEL During 2022  Suominen employed 707 FTEs (709) on average  and 710 (707) FTEs at the end of 2022. PROGRESS IN SUSTAINABILITY We have a comprehensive approach to sustainability and our Sustainability agenda 2020‒2025 defines our focus areas and their KPIs. We have strong focus on safety and accident prevention  and our long-term target is to have zero lost-time accidents. In 2022  Suominen had 2 (4) lost time accidents. Increasing employee engagement is another of our key people-related targets. We conducted a third consecutive global employee engagement survey in 2022 and based on the results our employee engagement index is 65% (66%). The index is a combination of questions concerning our people's retention  likelihood to recommend the company  organizational pride and commitment. Our target is that our engagement index will be 73% by 2025. We are committed to continuously improving our production efficiency and the efficient utilization of natural resources. Our target is to reduce our energy consumption  greenhouse gas emissions  water consumption and waste to landfill by 20% per ton of product by 2025 compared to the base year of 2019. By the end of 2022  our water consumption has decreased by 6.1%  waste to landfill by 2.5%  energy consumption by 0.6%  and greenhouse gas emissions by 20.0% per ton of product compared to 2019. As examples of our continuous work to decrease our greenhouse gas emissions  we moved entirely to fossil free electricity in all our European plants and installed solar panels to our Alicante plant in 2022. We monitor our progress regularly and are always seeking new ways to further improve our operations. Regarding sustainable products  our target is to increase their sales by 50% by 2025 and to have over 10 sustainable product launches per year. In 2022  we launched 12 sustainable products  and the sales of sustainable product sales has increased by 99% compared to the base year of 2019. As part of our Annual Report 2022 which will be published in the week starting on March 6  2023  we report the development of our sustainability performance.

BUSINESS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIESManufacturing risks Suominen has production plants in several European countries  United States and Brazil. Interruptions at the plants caused for example by machinery breakdown can cause production losses and delivery problems. Ongoing maintenance and investments aiming to extend the lifetime of the assets are an essential part of ensuring the operational efficiency of the existing production lines. Suominen’s operations could be disrupted due to abrupt and unforeseen events beyond the company's control  such as power outages or fire and water damage. Suominen may not be able to control such events through predictive actions  which could lead to interruptions in business. Risks of this type are insured in order to guarantee the continuity of operations. As Suominen has a valid damage and business interruption insurance  it is expected that the damage would be compensated  and the financial losses caused by the interruption of business would be covered.Suominen uses certain technologies in its production. In the management’s view  the chosen technologies are competitive and there is no need to make major investments in new technologies. However  it cannot be excluded that the company’s technology choices could prove wrong  and the development of new or substitute technologies would then require investments.Competition Suominen has numerous regional  national and global competitors in its different product groups. Products based on new technologies and imports from countries of lower production costs may reduce Suominen’s competitive edge. If Suominen is not able to compete with an attractive product offering  it may lose some of its market share. Competition may lead to increased pricing pressure on the company’s products.Price and availability of raw materials Suominen purchases significant amounts of pulp- and oil-based raw materials. Raw materials are the largest cost item for operations. Changes in the global market prices of raw materials can have an impact on the company’s profitability. Suominen’s stocks equal two to four weeks’ consumption and it generally takes two to five months for raw material price changes to be reflected in Suominen’s customer pricing either through automatic pricing mechanisms or negotiated price changes. Extended interruptions in the supply of Suominen’s main raw materials could disrupt production and have a negative impact on the Group’s overall business operations. As Suominen sources most of its raw materials from a number of major international suppliers  significant interruptions in the production of the majority of Suominen’s products are unlikely.Price and availability of energy Energy costs represent a significant portion of Suominen's production costs. Suominen consumes mainly electricity and gas. Higher prices as well as reduced availability of energy could have an impact on Suominen's profitability through increased production costs.Market and customer risks Suominen’s customer base is fairly concentrated  which increases the potential impact of changes in customer specific sales volumes. In 2022  the Group’s ten largest customers accounted for 64% (66%) of the Group net sales. Long-term contracts are preferred with the largest customers. In practice  the customer relationships are long-term and last for several years. Customer-related credit risks are managed in accordance with a credit policy approved by the Board of Directors. Credit limits are confirmed for customers on the basis of credit ratings and customer history. The demand for Suominen’s products depends on possible changes in consumer preferences. Historically  such changes have had mainly a positive impact on Suominen  as they have resulted in the growing demand for products made of nonwovens. For example  the COVID-19 pandemic increased the demand for nonwovens for cleaning and disinfecting wipes. However  certain factors  including consumers’ attitude towards the use of products made even partially of oil-based raw materials  or their perception on the sustainability of disposable products in general  might change the consumers’ buying habits. Suominen monitors the consumer trends proactively and develops its product offering accordingly. The company has had biodegradable  100% plant-based nonwovens in its portfolio for over 15 years and hence is well positioned to respond to changes in customer preferences related to sustainability and climate change. Generally the demand for nonwovens for wipes has been resilient to changing economic conditions. However  it is conceivable that high consumer price inflation could lead to decline in end consumer demand for wiping products as the consumers’ available income effectively decreases. Regarding the war in Ukraine  the direct impact to Suominen’s business is minor as we have no customers nor suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. Suominen is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war which contribute to the cost inflation. Changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditions Suominen’s business and products can be affected directly or indirectly by political decisions and changes in government regulations for example in areas such as environmental policy or waste legislation. An example of such legislation is the EU's Single-Use Plastics Directive that focuses on reducing marine litter. The potential exists for similar regulations to expand worldwide. This creates demand for more sustainable products  and Suominen is well placed to respond to this increasing demand. Global political developments could have an adverse effect on Suominen. For instance  a political decision that constrains the global free trade may significantly impact the availability and price of certain raw materials  which would in turn affect Suominen’s business and profitability. Suominen’s geographical and customer-industry diversity provide partial protection against this risk. The relevance of the United States in Suominen’s business operations increases the significance of the exchange rate risk related to USD in the Group’s total foreign exchange position. Suominen hedges this foreign exchange position in accordance with its hedging policy.The risks that are characteristic to South American region  including significant changes in political environment or exchange rates  could have an impact on Suominen’s operations in Brazil. Investments Suominen continuously invests in its manufacturing facilities. The deployment of the investments may delay from what was planned  the costs of the investments may increase from what has been expected or the investments may create less business benefits than anticipated. The deployment phase of investments may cause temporary interruptions in operations.Cyber and information security Suominen’s operations are dependent on the integrity  security and stable operation of its information and communication systems and software as well as on the successful management of cyber attack risks. If Suominen’s information and communication systems and software were to become unusable or significantly impaired for an extended period of time  or the cyber attack risks are realized  Suominen’s reputation as well as ability to deliver products at the appointed time  order raw materials and handle inventory could be adversely impacted.Financial risks The Group is exposed to several financial risks  such as foreign exchange  interest rate  counterparty  liquidity and credit risks. The Group’s financial risks are managed in line with a policy confirmed by the Board of Directors. The financial risks are described in the Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements. Suominen is subject to corporate income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine the total amount of corporate income tax at Group level. There are many transactions and calculations that leave room for uncertainty as to the final amount of the income taxes. Tax risks relate also to changes in tax rates or tax legislation or misinterpretations  and materialization of the risks could result in increased payments or sanctions by the tax authorities  which in turn could lead to financial loss. Deferred tax assets included in the statement of financial position require that the deferred tax assets can be recovered against the future taxable income. Suominen performs goodwill impairment testing annually. In impairment testing the recoverable amounts are determined as the value in use  which comprises of the discounted projected future cash flows. Actual cash flows can differ from the discounted projected future cash flows. Uncertainties related to the projected future cash flows include  among others  the long economic useful life of the assets and changes in the forecast sales prices of Suominen’s products  production costs as well as discount rates used in testing. Due to the uncertainty inherent in the future  it is possible that Suominen’s recoverable amounts will be insufficient to cover the carrying amounts of assets  particularly goodwill. If this happens  it will be necessary to recognize an impairment loss  which  when implemented  will weaken the result and equity. Goodwill impairment testing has been described in the consolidated financial statements. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT Suominen’s nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods such as wet wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points. The market expectation is that in the long run the end user demand for wipes will remain above pre-COVID levels. However  towards the end of the second quarter in 2021  especially our North American customers started to experience a sudden deceleration of demand  which in combination with extraordinary stockpiling throughout the entire supply chain created an imbalance of inventories. This impacted also Suominen’s orders  although in several cases we were able to benefit from our position as the preferred supplier of our customers. The demand started to recover in H2/2022 with full recovery expected from 2023 onwards. Looking at the year ahead there are several market drivers with a positive impact to Suominen. The raw material cost inflation finally turned in Q4/2022  and the energy markets show signs of price decline and in the US market the inventory levels have now receded to their normal levels. However  it remains to be seen how the current high consumer price inflation impacts the end consumer demand of wipes. Usually the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation. OUTLOOK Suominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2023 will increase from 2022. In 2022  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 15.3 million.PROPOSAL ON DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS The profit of the financial year 2022 of Suominen Corporation  the parent company of Suominen Group  was EUR 7 988 424.28. The funds distributable as dividends  including the profit for the period  were EUR 16 088 436 and total distributable funds were EUR 91 780 772. The Board of Directors proposes that a dividend of EUR 0.10 per share shall be distributed for the financial year 2022 and that the profit shall be transferred to retained earnings. On February 2  2023  the company had 57 480 727 issued shares  excluding treasury shares. With this number of shares  the total amount of dividends to be distributed would be EUR 5 748 072.70. There have been no significant changes in the company’s financial position after the end of the review period. The record date is April 5  2023 and the dividend will be paid on April 14  2023. DISCLOSURE OF THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT  REMUNERATION REPORT  THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  THE REPORT BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND NON-FINANCIAL REPORT Suominen will publish its Financial Statements  Report by the Board of Directors  Auditor’s Report  Corporate Governance Statement  Remuneration Report and Non-Financial Report including EU Taxonomy report  concerning the financial year 2022  as part of the Annual Report during the week commencing March 6  2023. The above documents will be published as a Stock Exchange Release and they will be available also at www.suominen.fi.ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 2023 The Annual General Meeting of Suominen Corporation is planned to be held on April 3  2023. The Board of Directors will convene the Annual General Meeting by issuing a Notice to the Annual General Meeting as a Stock Exchange Release. The notice to the Annual General Meeting will also be published at www.suominen.fi.EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD Suominen initiates consultation procedure concerning a plan to permanently close manufacturing at its Mozzate plant in Italy (January 10  2023) Suominen will start consultation with local trade unions regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at its Mozzate plant. According to the plan  the production would end during the second quarter of 2023. The consultation will be conducted in accordance with the Italian legislation and applicable National Collective Agreement and is aimed to be completed within 90 days. The Mozzate site currently employs 92 people  working both in production and in office roles. “Since the normalization of the COVID-induced demand surge  the competition in the European wipes nonwovens market has increased significantly driven mainly by imports from Turkey and China. This is the case especially in the traditional blended fiber products. At the same time energy costs in Italy have increased to record high levels. These two factors combined have created huge challenges for the cost competitiveness of our plant in Mozzate ” says Klaus Korhonen  interim President & CEO. The wipes nonwovens market is rapidly transitioning towards more sustainable alternatives. In line with its strategy  Suominen has set targets to increase the sales of sustainable products and to continuously innovate new environmentally friendly nonwovens. “The demand for traditional blended fiber products in Europe is declining. Manufacturing sustainable nonwovens competitively requires production assets and processes optimized specifically for these products. Our lines at the Mozzate plant are not best suited for sustainable fibers  and this combined with high operating costs means that the plant is not competitive and its competitiveness is not expected to improve materially going forward. We are constantly evaluating the performance and profitability of our assets  and in the current situation we have unfortunately come to the conclusion that we need to consider closing the production at Mozzate to improve the competitiveness of our European business ” Klaus Korhonen concludes. The expected financial impacts of the potential closure are approx. EUR 9 million in one-time cash costs in 2023‒24 consisting mainly of severance costs  dismantling the production lines and restoration of leased buildings. One-time net non-cash costs are expected to be approx. EUR 3 million of which approx. EUR 4.5 million will be posted in Q4/2022 and approx. EUR -1.5 million in 2023‒24 corresponding to releases of certain provisions. If implemented  the plan is expected to yield a positive EBITDA impact of approx. EUR 3 million on an annualized basis.

The Board of Directors of Suominen Corporation resolved on a new share-based Long-Term Incentive Plan for management and key employees (February 3  2023) The Board of Directors of Suominen Corporation has resolved on February 2  2023 on a new share-based Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTI Plan) for the management and key employees. The aim of the new plan is to combine the objectives of the shareholders and the persons participating in the plan in order to increase the value of the Company in the long term  to bind the participants to the Company  and to offer them competitive reward plans based on earning and accumulating the Company’s shares. The new LTI Plan has one three-year Performance Period  which includes calendar years 2023–2025. The LTI Plan is directed to approximately 25 people including the President & CEO of Suominen. The Board of Directors resolved that the potential reward for the Performance Period 2023–2025 will be based on the relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR). The maximum total amount of potential share rewards to be paid on the basis of the Performance Period 2023–2025 is 793 500 shares of Suominen Corporation  representing the gross reward before the deduction of taxes and tax-related costs arising from the reward. The Board of Directors will be entitled to reduce the rewards agreed in the LTI Plan if the limits set by the Board of Directors for the share price are reached. If the targets of the Plan are reached  rewards will be paid to participants in spring 2026 after the end of the Performance Period. The potential rewards from the Performance Period 2023–2025 will be paid partly in the Company’s shares and partly in cash. The cash proportion is intended to cover taxes and tax-related costs arising from the reward to the participant. The Company also has the right to pay the reward fully in cash under certain circumstances. As a rule  no reward will be paid  if a participant’s employment or service ends before the reward payment. A member of the Executive Team must hold 50 per cent of the net number of shares given on the basis of the Plan  as long as his or her shareholding in total corresponds to the value of half of his or her annual gross salary. The President & CEO of the Company must hold 50 per cent of the net number of shares given on the basis of the Plan  as long as his or her shareholding in total corresponds to the value of his or her annual gross salary. Such number of shares must be held as long as the participant’s employment or service in a group company continues.

The Auditor’s report has been signed on February 2  2023. Quarterly information  half-year report and interim reports have not been audited. As result of rounding differences  the figures presented in the tables do not necessarily add up to total.ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The consolidated financial statements of Suominen Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  including International Accounting Standards (IAS) and Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (SIC and IFRIC). International Financial Reporting Standards are standards and their interpretations adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The Notes to the Financial Statements are also in accordance with the Finnish Accounting Act and Ordinance and the Finnish Companies' Act. This financial statement release has been prepared in accordance with the principles defined in IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as approved by the European Union. Financial statement release does not include all information required for full financial statements. The principles for preparing consolidated financial statements are mainly the same as those used for preparing the consolidated financial statements for 2021. The new or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022 are presented below. New or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022: - Improvements to IFRS (2018–2020 cycle): Improvement to IFRS 9 – Fees in the ""10 percent"" Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities  applicable from January 1  2022. The amendment clarifies the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. The fees include only fees paid or received between the borrower and the lender. - Amendments to IAS 16 – Property  Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use  applicable from January 1  2022. The amendment prohibits companies deducting from the acquisition cost of an item of property  plant and equipment any proceeds of the sale of items produced while bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The sales proceeds of producing such items as well as the expenses of producing the items are to be recognized in profit or loss. The amendment was to be applied retrospectively. For Suominen  the amendment did not result in any restatement of previously published figures. Other new or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022 were not material for Suominen Group. New and amended IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations published but mandatory from January 1  2023 or later: - Amendments to IAS 1 – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current  applicable from January 1  2024. The amendment specifies the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current  by clarifying for example what is meant by a right to defer settlement  that a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period and that classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right. The amendment will be applied retrospectively. The amendment has no effect on the consolidated financial statements of Suominen. - Disclosure of Accounting Policies – Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendment replaces the requirement to disclose ""significant"" accounting policies with a requirement to disclose ""material"" accounting policies. The amendment aims to help companies to disclose accounting policies  which are material for users to understand the information in the company's financial statements. The amendments require judgement in determining whether accounting policies are material or not. The amendment may have some effect on the disclosure of accounting policies in Suominen's consolidated financial statements  as the accounting principles presented in the consolidated financial statements will concentrate on presenting the accounting principles which are material for Suominen. - Definition of Accounting Estimates – Amendments to IAS 8  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendments clarify the distinction between the changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. The amendment clarifies that the effects on an accounting estimate of a change in an input or a change in a measurement technique are changes in accounting estimates if they do not result from the correction of prior period errors. The amendment does not have any material impact on Suominen's consolidated financial statements. - Amendments to IAS 12 – Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendments are to be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The amendment narrowed the scope of the initial recognition exception under IAS 12  so that it no longer applies to taxable and deductible temporary differences. The amendment clarifies deferred tax accounting for transactions and events  such as leases and decommissioning obligations that lead to the initial recognition of both an asset and a liability. The amendments require companies to recognize a separate deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability when the temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of an asset and a liability are equal. As in the most cases the deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from recognition of leases can be offset with each other  the amendment has not material effect on the consolidated statement of financial position of Suominen. The amendment will  however  change the disclosure information in the consolidated financial statements related to the deferred taxes. Other new or amended standards  improvements or annual improvements applicable from January 1  2023 or later are not material for Suominen Group.

either IFRS key ratios (earnings per share) or required by Ordinance of the Ministry of Finance in Finland or alternative performance measures (cash flow from operations per share). Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net result attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted share-issue adjusted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period  excluding shares acquired by the Group and held as treasury shares. When calculating diluted earnings per share the number of shares is adjusted with the effects of the share-based incentive plans.

An alternative performance measure is a key ratio which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparison between the reporting periods. Operating profit and comparable operating profit Operating profit  or earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is an important measure of profitability as by ignoring income taxes and financial items it focuses solely on the company's ability to generate profit from operations. Operating profit is presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. In order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods  Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods. These items include  among others  impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses  gains or losses from the sales of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets or other assets and restructuring costs. Suominen did not have any items affecting comparability in 2021. In 2022  items affecting comparability of result were impairment losses of property  plant and equipment  right-of-use assets and inventory  arising from the planned closure of the production lines in Italy. Operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Operating profit -8 958 26 941 + Impairment losses of property  plant and equipment  affecting comparability of result 2 288 − + Impairment losses of right-of-use assets  affecting comparability of result 1 536 − + Impairment losses of inventories  affecting comparability of result 971 − Comparable operating profit -4 163 26 941 EBITDA and comparable EBITDA EBITDA is an important measure that focuses on the operating performance excluding the effect of depreciation and amortization  financial items and income taxes  in other words what is the margin on net sales after deducting operating expenses.

Gross capital expenditure includes also capitalized borrowing costs and capitalized cash flow hedges. Gross capital expenditure (gross investments) does not include increases in right-of-use assets.

It is the opinion of Suominen that presenting interest-bearing liabilities not only at amortized cost but also at nominal value gives relevant additional information to the investors. Interest-bearing net debt = Interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value - interest-bearing receivables - cash and cash equivalentsEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Interest-bearing liabilities 103 365 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 705 1 794 Cash and cash equivalents -49 508 -101 357 Interest-bearing net debt 54 562 49 570 Interest-bearing liabilities 103 365 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 705 1 794 Nominal value of interest-bearing liabilities 104 069 150 927 Return on equity (ROE)  % The return on equity is one of the most important profitability ratios used by owners and investors.

With this number of shares  the total amount of dividends to be distributed would be EUR 5 748 072.70.Klaus Korhonen  interim President and CEO:”2022 was a difficult year for Suominen. The unprecedented raw material inflation which impacted us significantly already in 2021 persisted  and additionally also energy costs surged in 2022 after Russia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine in February. Suominen’s US business specifically continued to suffer from the high inventory levels in the whole supply chain  where imbalance started to normalize only during the second half of the year.Our net sales in 2022 reached EUR 493.3 million (443.2). Although sales volumes decreased from 2021  net sales were high driven by higher sales prices and also tailwind from currencies which amounted to EUR 32.9 million. Our comparable EBITDA decreased clearly from the previous year and was EUR 15.3 million (47.0). The higher sales prices could not fully compensate for the volume loss and for the higher raw material and energy costs. To improve our profitability  we took several actions during the year such as implementing energy surcharges in Europe in March and September and a general cost surcharge in North America in August as well as widening our product portfolio in the US.We announced in June 2022 an investment to enhance and upgrade one of our lines in Nakkila  Finland. The investment strengthens our capabilities in sustainable products and is made in line with our strategy and vision to be the frontrunner in sustainable nonwovens. The investment project is proceeding according to plan and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023.We are continuously developing our sustainable product offering and our target is to increase the sales of sustainable products by 50% compared to the base year of 2019 and launch over 10 sustainable products per year. In 2022  the sales of sustainable products were 99% higher than in the baseline year 2019 and during the year we launched 12 sustainable products. One example of new products launched in 2022 is our first carbon neutral product BIOLACE® Zero. We also opened our own compostability test center Green Lab in Nakkila  Finland to support our product development.In 2022 we completed the EcoVadis sustainability assessment for the first time and received a silver level rating. This result places us in the top 8% of companies in the manufacture of other textiles industry rated by EcoVadis.Tommi Björnman was appointed Suominen’s new President and CEO in November 2022. He currently works as President and CEO of Avgol Nonwovens and will join Suominen in May 2023 at the latest.In January 2023 we started a consultation procedure regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at our Mozzate plant in Italy. The decision was made with a heavy heart but we see it as unavoidable given the market situation in Europe and the ongoing transition to more sustainable nonwovens for wipes. The plan has no impact to Suominen’s operations at the Cressa plant in Italy.Looking at the year ahead we see several market drivers with a positive impact to Suominen. The raw material cost inflation finally turned in Q4/2022  the energy markets show signs of price decline and in the US market the inventory levels have now receded to their normal levels. However  it remains to be seen how the current high consumer price inflation impacts the end consumer demand of wipes. Usually the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation.To conclude  I want to thank all our employees for their contribution and hard work and our business partners for excellent cooperation in 2022.”NET SALESOctober–December 2022In the fourth quarter  Suominen’s net sales increased by 15.1% from the comparison period to EUR 133.1 million (115.6). Sales volumes were in line with the comparison period and Q3/2022 while sales prices increased. Currencies impacted net sales positively by EUR 9.3 million.Net sales of the Americas business area amounted to EUR 81.7 million (68.9) and net sales of the Europe business area EUR 51.4 million (46.7).Financial year 2022In 2022  Suominen’s net sales increased by 11.3% from the comparison period to EUR 493.3 million (443.2). The increase in sales was driven by higher sales prices and tailwind from currencies; sales volumes decreased from 2021. Currencies impacted net sales positively by EUR 32.9 million.Net sales of Americas business area were EUR 288.0 million (265.2) and net sales of Europe business area EUR 205.5 million (178.1).EBITDA  OPERATING PROFIT AND RESULTOctober–December 2022Comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) was EUR 5.0 million (9.0). EBITDA was EUR 4.0 million (9.0). The main reasons for the result decline were higher raw material and energy costs versus sales prices and costs related to the CEO change.

Income taxes for the financial year were EUR -2.0 million (-5.8). The income taxes of the year were impacted by derecognition of deferred tax assets in certain countries where Suominen operates as the possibility to utilize assets had decreased.The profit for the period was EUR -13.9 million (20.7).FINANCINGThe Group’s net interest-bearing liabilities  calculated with the nominal value of the interest-bearing liabilities at the end of the review period  December 31  2022  amounted to EUR 54.6 million (49.6).

Net effect of changes in foreign exchange rates in financial items were EUR +2.8 million (+1.7).Suominen sold its minority share in Amerplast (Bright Maze Oy) in March 2021.

Interruptions at the plants caused for example by machinery breakdown can cause production losses and delivery problems. Ongoing maintenance and investments aiming to extend the lifetime of the assets are an essential part of ensuring the operational efficiency of the existing production lines.Suominen’s operations could be disrupted due to abrupt and unforeseen events beyond the company's control  such as power outages or fire and water damage. Suominen may not be able to control such events through predictive actions  which could lead to interruptions in business. Risks of this type are insured in order to guarantee the continuity of operations. As Suominen has a valid damage and business interruption insurance  it is expected that the damage would be compensated  and the financial losses caused by the interruption of business would be covered.Suominen uses certain technologies in its production. In the management’s view  the chosen technologies are competitive and there is no need to make major investments in new technologies. However  it cannot be excluded that the company’s technology choices could prove wrong  and the development of new or substitute technologies would then require investments.CompetitionSuominen has numerous regional  national and global competitors in its different product groups. Products based on new technologies and imports from countries of lower production costs may reduce Suominen’s competitive edge. If Suominen is not able to compete with an attractive product offering  it may lose some of its market share. Competition may lead to increased pricing pressure on the company’s products.Price and availability of raw materialsSuominen purchases significant amounts of pulp- and oil-based raw materials. Raw materials are the largest cost item for operations. Changes in the global market prices of raw materials can have an impact on the company’s profitability. Suominen’s stocks equal two to four weeks’ consumption and it generally takes two to five months for raw material price changes to be reflected in Suominen’s customer pricing either through automatic pricing mechanisms or negotiated price changes.Extended interruptions in the supply of Suominen’s main raw materials could disrupt production and have a negative impact on the Group’s overall business operations. As Suominen sources most of its raw materials from a number of major international suppliers  significant interruptions in the production of the majority of Suominen’s products are unlikely.Price and availability of energyEnergy costs represent a significant portion of Suominen's production costs. Suominen consumes mainly electricity and gas. Higher prices as well as reduced availability of energy could have an impact on Suominen's profitability through increased production costs.Market and customer risksSuominen’s customer base is fairly concentrated  which increases the potential impact of changes in customer specific sales volumes. In 2022  the Group’s ten largest customers accounted for 64% (66%) of the Group net sales. Long-term contracts are preferred with the largest customers. In practice  the customer relationships are long-term and last for several years. Customer-related credit risks are managed in accordance with a credit policy approved by the Board of Directors. Credit limits are confirmed for customers on the basis of credit ratings and customer history.The demand for Suominen’s products depends on possible changes in consumer preferences. Historically  such changes have had mainly a positive impact on Suominen  as they have resulted in the growing demand for products made of nonwovens. For example  the COVID-19 pandemic increased the demand for nonwovens for cleaning and disinfecting wipes. However  certain factors  including consumers’ attitude towards the use of products made even partially of oil-based raw materials  or their perception on the sustainability of disposable products in general  might change the consumers’ buying habits. Suominen monitors the consumer trends proactively and develops its product offering accordingly. The company has had biodegradable  100% plant-based nonwovens in its portfolio for over 15 years and hence is well positioned to respond to changes in customer preferences related to sustainability and climate change.Generally the demand for nonwovens for wipes has been resilient to changing economic conditions. However  it is conceivable that high consumer price inflation could lead to decline in end consumer demand for wiping products as the consumers’ available income effectively decreases.Regarding the war in Ukraine  the direct impact to Suominen’s business is minor as we have no customers nor suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. Suominen is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war which contribute to the cost inflation.Changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditionsSuominen’s business and products can be affected directly or indirectly by political decisions and changes in government regulations for example in areas such as environmental policy or waste legislation. An example of such legislation is the EU's Single-Use Plastics Directive that focuses on reducing marine litter. The potential exists for similar regulations to expand worldwide. This creates demand for more sustainable products  and Suominen is well placed to respond to this increasing demand.Global political developments could have an adverse effect on Suominen. For instance  a political decision that constrains the global free trade may significantly impact the availability and price of certain raw materials  which would in turn affect Suominen’s business and profitability. Suominen’s geographical and customer-industry diversity provide partial protection against this risk.The relevance of the United States in Suominen’s business operations increases the significance of the exchange rate risk related to USD in the Group’s total foreign exchange position. Suominen hedges this foreign exchange position in accordance with its hedging policy.The risks that are characteristic to South American region  including significant changes in political environment or exchange rates  could have an impact on Suominen’s operations in Brazil.InvestmentsSuominen continuously invests in its manufacturing facilities. The deployment of the investments may delay from what was planned  the costs of the investments may increase from what has been expected or the investments may create less business benefits than anticipated. The deployment phase of investments may cause temporary interruptions in operations.Cyber and information securitySuominen’s operations are dependent on the integrity  security and stable operation of its information and communication systems and software as well as on the successful management of cyber attack risks. If Suominen’s information and communication systems and software were to become unusable or significantly impaired for an extended period of time  or the cyber attack risks are realized  Suominen’s reputation as well as ability to deliver products at the appointed time  order raw materials and handle inventory could be adversely impacted.Financial risksThe Group is exposed to several financial risks  such as foreign exchange  interest rate  counterparty  liquidity and credit risks. The Group’s financial risks are managed in line with a policy confirmed by the Board of Directors. The financial risks are described in the Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements.Suominen is subject to corporate income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine the total amount of corporate income tax at Group level. There are many transactions and calculations that leave room for uncertainty as to the final amount of the income taxes. Tax risks relate also to changes in tax rates or tax legislation or misinterpretations  and materialization of the risks could result in increased payments or sanctions by the tax authorities  which in turn could lead to financial loss. Deferred tax assets included in the statement of financial position require that the deferred tax assets can be recovered against the future taxable income.Suominen performs goodwill impairment testing annually. In impairment testing the recoverable amounts are determined as the value in use  which comprises of the discounted projected future cash flows. Actual cash flows can differ from the discounted projected future cash flows. Uncertainties related to the projected future cash flows include  among others  the long economic useful life of the assets and changes in the forecast sales prices of Suominen’s products  production costs as well as discount rates used in testing. Due to the uncertainty inherent in the future  it is possible that Suominen’s recoverable amounts will be insufficient to cover the carrying amounts of assets  particularly goodwill. If this happens  it will be necessary to recognize an impairment loss  which  when implemented  will weaken the result and equity. Goodwill impairment testing has been described in the consolidated financial statements.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTSuominen’s nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods such as wet wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points.The market expectation is that in the long run the end user demand for wipes will remain above pre-COVID levels. However  towards the end of the second quarter in 2021  especially our North American customers started to experience a sudden deceleration of demand  which in combination with extraordinary stockpiling throughout the entire supply chain created an imbalance of inventories. This impacted also Suominen’s orders  although in several cases we were able to benefit from our position as the preferred supplier of our customers. The demand started to recover in H2/2022 with full recovery expected from 2023 onwards.Looking at the year ahead there are several market drivers with a positive impact to Suominen. The raw material cost inflation finally turned in Q4/2022  and the energy markets show signs of price decline and in the US market the inventory levels have now receded to their normal levels. However  it remains to be seen how the current high consumer price inflation impacts the end consumer demand of wipes. Usually the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation.OUTLOOKSuominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2023 will increase from 2022. In 2022  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 15.3 million.PROPOSAL ON DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDSThe profit of the financial year 2022 of Suominen Corporation  the parent company of Suominen Group  was EUR 7 988 424.28. The funds distributable as dividends  including the profit for the period  were EUR 16 088 436 and total distributable funds were EUR 91 780 772.The Board of Directors proposes that a dividend of EUR 0.10 per share shall be distributed for the financial year 2022 and that the profit shall be transferred to retained earnings.On February 2  2023  the company had 57 480 727 issued shares  excluding treasury shares. With this number of shares  the total amount of dividends to be distributed would be EUR 5 748 072.70.There have been no significant changes in the company’s financial position after the end of the review period.The record date is April 5  2023 and the dividend will be paid on April 12  2023.DISCLOSURE OF THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT  REMUNERATION REPORT  THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  THE REPORT BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND NON-FINANCIAL REPORTSuominen will publish its Financial Statements  Report by the Board of Directors  Auditor’s Report  Corporate Governance Statement  Remuneration Report and Non-Financial Report including EU Taxonomy report  concerning the financial year 2022  as part of the Annual Report during the week commencing March 6  2023. The above documents will be published as a Stock Exchange Release and they will be available also at www.suominen.fi.ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 2023The Annual General Meeting of Suominen Corporation is planned to be held on April 3  2023. The Board of Directors will convene the Annual General Meeting by issuing a Notice to the Annual General Meeting as a Stock Exchange Release. The notice to the Annual General Meeting will also be published at www.suominen.fi.EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIODSuominen initiates consultation procedure concerning a plan to permanently close manufacturing at its Mozzate plant in Italy (January 10  2023)Suominen will start consultation with local trade unions regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at its Mozzate plant. According to the plan  the production would end during the second quarter of 2023. The consultation will be conducted in accordance with the Italian legislation and applicable National Collective Agreement and is aimed to be completed within 90 days. The Mozzate site currently employs 92 people  working both in production and in office roles.“Since the normalization of the COVID-induced demand surge  the competition in the European wipes nonwovens market has increased significantly driven mainly by imports from Turkey and China. This is the case especially in the traditional blended fiber products. At the same time energy costs in Italy have increased to record high levels. These two factors combined have created huge challenges for the cost competitiveness of our plant in Mozzate ” says Klaus Korhonen  interim President & CEO.The wipes nonwovens market is rapidly transitioning towards more sustainable alternatives. In line with its strategy  Suominen has set targets to increase the sales of sustainable products and to continuously innovate new environmentally friendly nonwovens.“The demand for traditional blended fiber products in Europe is declining. Manufacturing sustainable nonwovens competitively requires production assets and processes optimized specifically for these products. Our lines at the Mozzate plant are not best suited for sustainable fibers  and this combined with high operating costs means that the plant is not competitive and its competitiveness is not expected to improve materially going forward. We are constantly evaluating the performance and profitability of our assets  and in the current situation we have unfortunately come to the conclusion that we need to consider closing the production at Mozzate to improve the competitiveness of our European business ” Klaus Korhonen concludes.The expected financial impacts of the potential closure are approx. EUR 9 million in one-time cash costs in 2023‒24 consisting mainly of severance costs  dismantling the production lines and restoration of leased buildings. One-time net non-cash costs are expected to be approx. EUR 3 million of which approx. EUR 4.5 million will be posted in Q4/2022 and approx. EUR -1.5 million in 2023‒24 corresponding to releases of certain provisions. If implemented  the plan is expected to yield a positive EBITDA impact of approx. EUR 3 million on an annualized basis.Proposals by the Nomination Board to the Annual General Meeting 2023 of Suominen (January 13  2023)Proposal on the number of the members  on the composition  and on the Chair of the Board of DirectorsThe Nomination Board of Suominen Corporation’s shareholders proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the number of Board members remains unchanged and would be six (6).The Nomination Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that Andreas Ahlström  Aaron Barsness  Björn Borgman  Jaakko Eskola and Nina Linander would be re-elected as members of the Board of Directors and that Laura Remes would be elected as a new member of the Board of Directors.Out of the current Board members  Laura Raitio has informed that she is no longer available as a candidate for the Board of Directors.Laura Remes (born 1980  M.Sc.

The Auditor’s report has been signed on February 2  2023. Quarterly information  half-year report and interim reports have not been audited.As result of rounding differences  the figures presented in the tables do not necessarily add up to total.ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLESThe consolidated financial statements of Suominen Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  including International Accounting Standards (IAS) and Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (SIC and IFRIC). International Financial Reporting Standards are standards and their interpretations adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The Notes to the Financial Statements are also in accordance with the Finnish Accounting Act and Ordinance and the Finnish Companies' Act.This financial statement release has been prepared in accordance with the principles defined in IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as approved by the European Union. Financial statement release does not include all information required for full financial statements.The principles for preparing consolidated financial statements are mainly the same as those used for preparing the consolidated financial statements for 2021. The new or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022 are presented below.New or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022:- Improvements to IFRS (2018–2020 cycle): Improvement to IFRS 9 – Fees in the ""10 percent"" Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities  applicable from January 1  2022. The amendment clarifies the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. The fees include only fees paid or received between the borrower and the lender.- Amendments to IAS 16 – Property  Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use  applicable from January 1  2022. The amendment prohibits companies deducting from the acquisition cost of an item of property  plant and equipment any proceeds of the sale of items produced while bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The sales proceeds of producing such items as well as the expenses of producing the items are to be recognized in profit or loss. The amendment was to be applied retrospectively. For Suominen  the amendment did not result in any restatement of previously published figures.Other new or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022 were not material for Suominen Group.New and amended IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations published but mandatory from January 1  2023 or later:- Amendments to IAS 1 – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current  applicable from January 1  2024. The amendment specifies the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current  by clarifying for example what is meant by a right to defer settlement  that a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period and that classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right. The amendment will be applied retrospectively. The amendment has no effect on the consolidated financial statements of Suominen.- Disclosure of Accounting Policies – Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendment replaces the requirement to disclose ""significant"" accounting policies with a requirement to disclose ""material"" accounting policies. The amendment aims to help companies to disclose accounting policies  which are material for users to understand the information in the company's financial statements. The amendments require judgement in determining whether accounting policies are material or not. The amendment may have some effect on the disclosure of accounting policies in Suominen's consolidated financial statements  as the accounting principles presented in the consolidated financial statements will concentrate on presenting the accounting principles which are material for Suominen.- Definition of Accounting Estimates – Amendments to IAS 8  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendments clarify the distinction between the changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. The amendment clarifies that the effects on an accounting estimate of a change in an input or a change in a measurement technique are changes in accounting estimates if they do not result from the correction of prior period errors. The amendment does not have any material impact on Suominen's consolidated financial statements.- Amendments to IAS 12 – Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendments are to be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.The amendment narrowed the scope of the initial recognition exception under IAS 12  so that it no longer applies to taxable and deductible temporary differences. The amendment clarifies deferred tax accounting for transactions and events  such as leases and decommissioning obligations that lead to the initial recognition of both an asset and a liability. The amendments require companies to recognize a separate deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability when the temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of an asset and a liability are equal.As in the most cases the deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from recognition of leases can be offset with each other  the amendment has not material effect on the consolidated statement of financial position of Suominen. The amendment will  however  change the disclosure information in the consolidated financial statements related to the deferred taxes.Other new or amended standards  improvements or annual improvements applicable from January 1  2023 or later are not material for Suominen Group.STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITIONEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Assets Non-current assets Goodwill 15 496 15

performance measures (cash flow from operations per share).Earnings per shareBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net result attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted share-issue adjusted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period  excluding shares acquired by the Group and held as treasury shares.When calculating diluted earnings per share the number of shares is adjusted with the effects of the share-based incentive plans.EUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Profit for the period -13 863 20 734 Average share-issue adjusted number of

30.8Alternative performance measuresSome of Suominen's key ratios are alternative performance measures. An alternative performance measure is a key ratio which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparison between the reporting periods.Operating profit and comparable operating profitOperating profit  or earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is an important measure of profitability as by ignoring income taxes and financial items it focuses solely on the company's ability to generate profit from operations. Operating profit is presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.In order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods  Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods. These items include  among others  impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses  gains or losses from the sales of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets or other assets and restructuring costs. Suominen did not have any items affecting comparability in 2021. In 2022  items affecting comparability of result were impairment losses of property  plant and equipment  right-of-use assets and inventory  arising from the planned closure of the production lines in Italy.Operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Operating profit -8 958 26 941 + Impairment losses of property  plant and equipment  affecting comparability of result 2 288 − + Impairment losses of right-of-use assets  affecting comparability of result 1 536 − + Impairment losses of inventories  affecting comparability of result 971 − Comparable operating profit -4 163 26 941EBITDA and comparable EBITDAEBITDA is an important measure that focuses on the operating performance excluding the effect of depreciation and amortization  financial items and income taxes  in other words what is the margin on net sales after deducting operating expenses.EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment lossesComparable EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment losses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Operating profit -8 958 26 941 + Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 23 245 20 092 EBITDA 14 287 47 033 EBITDA 14 287 47 033 + Impairment losses of inventories  affecting comparability of result 971 − Comparable EBITDA 15 257 47 033Gross capital expenditureSuominen considers gross capital expenditure as a relevant measure in order to understand for example how the Group maintains and renews its production machinery and facilities. Gross capital expenditure includes also capitalized borrowing costs and capitalized cash flow hedges. Gross capital expenditure (gross investments) does not include increases in right-of-use assets.EUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Increases in intangible assets 438 162 Increases in property  plant and equipment 9 275 17 609 Gross capital expenditure 9 713 17 771Interest-bearing net debtSuominen considers interest-bearing net debt to be an important measure for investors to be able to understand the Group’s indebtedness. It is the opinion of Suominen that presenting interest-bearing liabilities not only at amortized cost but also at nominal value gives relevant additional information to the investors.Interest-bearing net debt = Interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value - interest-bearing receivables - cash and cash equivalentsEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Interest-bearing liabilities 103 365 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 705 1 794 Cash and cash equivalents -49 508 -101 357 Interest-bearing net debt 54 562 49 570 Interest-bearing liabilities 103 365 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 705 1 794 Nominal value of interest-bearing liabilities 104 069 150 927Return on equity (ROE)  %The return on equity is one of the most important profitability ratios used by owners and investors.

Klaus Korhonen  interim President and CEO: ”2022 was a difficult year for Suominen. The unprecedented raw material inflation which impacted us significantly already in 2021 persisted  and additionally also energy costs surged in 2022 after Russia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine in February. Suominen’s US business specifically continued to suffer from the high inventory levels in the whole supply chain  where imbalance started to normalize only during the second half of the year. Our net sales in 2022 reached EUR 493.3 million (443.2). Although sales volumes decreased from 2021  net sales were high driven by higher sales prices and also tailwind from currencies which amounted to EUR 32.9 million. Our comparable EBITDA decreased clearly from the previous year and was EUR 15.3 million (47.0). The higher sales prices could not fully compensate for the volume loss and for the higher raw material and energy costs. To improve our profitability  we took several actions during the year such as implementing energy surcharges in Europe in March and September and a general cost surcharge in North America in August as well as widening our product portfolio in the US. We announced in June 2022 an investment to enhance and upgrade one of our lines in Nakkila  Finland. The investment strengthens our capabilities in sustainable products and is made in line with our strategy and vision to be the frontrunner in sustainable nonwovens. The investment project is proceeding according to plan and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023. We are continuously developing our sustainable product offering and our target is to increase the sales of sustainable products by 50% compared to the base year of 2019 and launch over 10 sustainable products per year. In 2022  the sales of sustainable products were 99% higher than in the baseline year 2019 and during the year we launched 12 sustainable products. One example of new products launched in 2022 is our first carbon neutral product BIOLACE® Zero. We also opened our own compostability test center Green Lab in Nakkila  Finland to support our product development. In 2022 we completed the EcoVadis sustainability assessment for the first time and received a silver level rating. This result places us in the top 8% of companies in the manufacture of other textiles industry rated by EcoVadis. Tommi Björnman was appointed Suominen’s new President and CEO in November 2022. He currently works as President and CEO of Avgol Nonwovens and will join Suominen in May 2023 at the latest. In January 2023 we started a consultation procedure regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at our Mozzate plant in Italy. The decision was made with a heavy heart but we see it as unavoidable given the market situation in Europe and the ongoing transition to more sustainable nonwovens for wipes. The plan has no impact to Suominen’s operations at the Cressa plant in Italy. Looking at the year ahead we see several market drivers with a positive impact to Suominen. The raw material cost inflation finally turned in Q4/2022  the energy markets show signs of price decline and in the US market the inventory levels have now receded to their normal levels. However  it remains to be seen how the current high consumer price inflation impacts the end consumer demand of wipes. Usually the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation. To conclude  I want to thank all our employees for their contribution and hard work and our business partners for excellent cooperation in 2022.” NET SALESOctober–December 2022 In the fourth quarter  Suominen’s net sales increased by 15.1% from the comparison period to EUR 133.1 million (115.6). Sales volumes were in line with the comparison period and Q3/2022 while sales prices increased. Currencies impacted net sales positively by EUR 9.3 million. Net sales of the Americas business area amounted to EUR 81.7 million (68.9) and net sales of the Europe business area EUR 51.4 million (46.7).Financial year 2022 In 2022  Suominen’s net sales increased by 11.3% from the comparison period to EUR 493.3 million (443.2). The increase in sales was driven by higher sales prices and tailwind from currencies; sales volumes decreased from 2021. Currencies impacted net sales positively by EUR 32.9 million. Net sales of Americas business area were EUR 288.0 million (265.2) and net sales of Europe business area EUR 205.5 million (178.1). EBITDA  OPERATING PROFIT AND RESULTOctober–December 2022 Comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) was EUR 5.0 million (9.0). EBITDA was EUR 4.0 million (9.0). The main reasons for the result decline were higher raw material and energy costs versus sales prices and costs related to the CEO change. In addition  in the comparison period the other operating income and expenses included positive onetime items. Currencies impacted EBITDA positively by EUR 0.7 million. Comparable operating profit decreased from the corresponding period of the previous year and was EUR -0.2 million (3.9). Operating profit was EUR -5.0 million (3.9). Items affecting comparability were EUR -4.8 million  consisting of impairment of assets in Italy related to the planned closure of Mozzate production. Result before income taxes in the fourth quarter was EUR -7.6 million (2.8) and profit for the period EUR -8.8 million (2.5). The income taxes for the period were EUR -1.2 million (-0.3).Financial year 2022 Comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) was EUR 15.3 million (47.0). EBITDA was EUR 14.3 million (47.0). EBITDA decreased as the higher sales prices could not fully compensate for the volume loss and the higher raw material and energy costs. Currencies impacted EBITDA positively by EUR 1.0 million. Comparable operating profit amounted to EUR -4.2 million (26.9). Operating profit amounted to EUR -9.0 million (26.9). Items affecting comparability were EUR -4.8 million  consisting of impairment of assets in Italy Italy related to the planned closure of Mozzate production. In 2022  profit before income taxes was EUR -11.9 million (26.6). Income taxes for the financial year were EUR -2.0 million (-5.8). The income taxes of the year were impacted by derecognition of deferred tax assets in certain countries where Suominen operates as the possibility to utilize assets had decreased. The profit for the period was EUR -13.9 million (20.7). FINANCING The Group’s net interest-bearing liabilities  calculated with the nominal value of the interest-bearing liabilities at the end of the review period  December 31  2022  amounted to EUR 54.6 million (49.6). Gearing was 37.4% (30.4%) and equity ratio 42.5% (42.2%). In 2022  net financial expenses were EUR -2.9 million (-0.4)  or 0.6% (0.1%) of net sales. Net effect of changes in foreign exchange rates in financial items were EUR +2.8 million (+1.7). Suominen sold its minority share in Amerplast (Bright Maze Oy) in March 2021. The transaction impacted Suominen’s net financial expenses of the comparison year positively by EUR 3.7 million. The effect on the cash flow in 2021 was EUR 11.6 million. Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was EUR 15.6 million (2.9). Cash flow from operations in 2022 was EUR 14.0 million (11.1). Cash flow from operations per share in 2022 was EUR 0.24 (0.19). The financial items in the cash flow from operations  in total EUR -4.7 million (-5.3)  were principally impacted by the interests paid during the reporting period. The change in the net working capital in 2022 was EUR 7.8 million positive (EUR 25.2 million negative) due to higher payables. In June 2022  Suominen announced that it has extended by one year the maturity of the EUR 100 million syndicated revolving credit facility agreement signed in July 2020. The maturity of the facility is now extended to July 2025. The debenture bond of EUR 85 million issued in 2017 fell due and was repaid in full on October 3  2022. CAPITAL EXPENDITURE In 2022  the gross capital expenditure totaled EUR 9.7 million (17.8) and the largest item was related to the growth investment initiatives in Nakkila  Finland. Other investments were mainly for maintenance. Suominen announced in June that it strengthens its capabilities in sustainable products by enhancing and upgrading one of its production lines in Nakkila  Finland. The investment is made in line with Suominen’s strategy and supports company’s vision to be the frontrunner in sustainability. The total value of the investment is approximately EUR 6 million and the investment project will be completed in the second half of 2023. Depreciations and amortizations were EUR -19.4 million (-20.1) and impairment losses were EUR -3.8 million.

BUSINESS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIESManufacturing risks Suominen has production plants in several European countries  United States and Brazil. Interruptions at the plants caused for example by machinery breakdown can cause production losses and delivery problems. Ongoing maintenance and investments aiming to extend the lifetime of the assets are an essential part of ensuring the operational efficiency of the existing production lines. Suominen’s operations could be disrupted due to abrupt and unforeseen events beyond the company's control  such as power outages or fire and water damage. Suominen may not be able to control such events through predictive actions  which could lead to interruptions in business. Risks of this type are insured in order to guarantee the continuity of operations. As Suominen has a valid damage and business interruption insurance  it is expected that the damage would be compensated  and the financial losses caused by the interruption of business would be covered.Suominen uses certain technologies in its production. In the management’s view  the chosen technologies are competitive and there is no need to make major investments in new technologies. However  it cannot be excluded that the company’s technology choices could prove wrong  and the development of new or substitute technologies would then require investments.Competition Suominen has numerous regional  national and global competitors in its different product groups. Products based on new technologies and imports from countries of lower production costs may reduce Suominen’s competitive edge. If Suominen is not able to compete with an attractive product offering  it may lose some of its market share. Competition may lead to increased pricing pressure on the company’s products.Price and availability of raw materials Suominen purchases significant amounts of pulp- and oil-based raw materials. Raw materials are the largest cost item for operations. Changes in the global market prices of raw materials can have an impact on the company’s profitability. Suominen’s stocks equal two to four weeks’ consumption and it generally takes two to five months for raw material price changes to be reflected in Suominen’s customer pricing either through automatic pricing mechanisms or negotiated price changes. Extended interruptions in the supply of Suominen’s main raw materials could disrupt production and have a negative impact on the Group’s overall business operations. As Suominen sources most of its raw materials from a number of major international suppliers  significant interruptions in the production of the majority of Suominen’s products are unlikely.Price and availability of energy Energy costs represent a significant portion of Suominen's production costs. Suominen consumes mainly electricity and gas. Higher prices as well as reduced availability of energy could have an impact on Suominen's profitability through increased production costs.Market and customer risks Suominen’s customer base is fairly concentrated  which increases the potential impact of changes in customer specific sales volumes. In 2022  the Group’s ten largest customers accounted for 64% (66%) of the Group net sales. Long-term contracts are preferred with the largest customers. In practice  the customer relationships are long-term and last for several years. Customer-related credit risks are managed in accordance with a credit policy approved by the Board of Directors. Credit limits are confirmed for customers on the basis of credit ratings and customer history. The demand for Suominen’s products depends on possible changes in consumer preferences. Historically  such changes have had mainly a positive impact on Suominen  as they have resulted in the growing demand for products made of nonwovens. For example  the COVID-19 pandemic increased the demand for nonwovens for cleaning and disinfecting wipes. However  certain factors  including consumers’ attitude towards the use of products made even partially of oil-based raw materials  or their perception on the sustainability of disposable products in general  might change the consumers’ buying habits. Suominen monitors the consumer trends proactively and develops its product offering accordingly. The company has had biodegradable  100% plant-based nonwovens in its portfolio for over 15 years and hence is well positioned to respond to changes in customer preferences related to sustainability and climate change. Generally the demand for nonwovens for wipes has been resilient to changing economic conditions. However  it is conceivable that high consumer price inflation could lead to decline in end consumer demand for wiping products as the consumers’ available income effectively decreases. Regarding the war in Ukraine  the direct impact to Suominen’s business is minor as we have no customers nor suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. Suominen is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war which contribute to the cost inflation. Changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditions Suominen’s business and products can be affected directly or indirectly by political decisions and changes in government regulations for example in areas such as environmental policy or waste legislation. An example of such legislation is the EU's Single-Use Plastics Directive that focuses on reducing marine litter. The potential exists for similar regulations to expand worldwide. This creates demand for more sustainable products  and Suominen is well placed to respond to this increasing demand. Global political developments could have an adverse effect on Suominen. For instance  a political decision that constrains the global free trade may significantly impact the availability and price of certain raw materials  which would in turn affect Suominen’s business and profitability. Suominen’s geographical and customer-industry diversity provide partial protection against this risk. The relevance of the United States in Suominen’s business operations increases the significance of the exchange rate risk related to USD in the Group’s total foreign exchange position. Suominen hedges this foreign exchange position in accordance with its hedging policy.The risks that are characteristic to South American region  including significant changes in political environment or exchange rates  could have an impact on Suominen’s operations in Brazil. Investments Suominen continuously invests in its manufacturing facilities. The deployment of the investments may delay from what was planned  the costs of the investments may increase from what has been expected or the investments may create less business benefits than anticipated. The deployment phase of investments may cause temporary interruptions in operations.Cyber and information security Suominen’s operations are dependent on the integrity  security and stable operation of its information and communication systems and software as well as on the successful management of cyber attack risks. If Suominen’s information and communication systems and software were to become unusable or significantly impaired for an extended period of time  or the cyber attack risks are realized  Suominen’s reputation as well as ability to deliver products at the appointed time  order raw materials and handle inventory could be adversely impacted.Financial risks The Group is exposed to several financial risks  such as foreign exchange  interest rate  counterparty  liquidity and credit risks. The Group’s financial risks are managed in line with a policy confirmed by the Board of Directors. The financial risks are described in the Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements. Suominen is subject to corporate income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine the total amount of corporate income tax at Group level. There are many transactions and calculations that leave room for uncertainty as to the final amount of the income taxes. Tax risks relate also to changes in tax rates or tax legislation or misinterpretations  and materialization of the risks could result in increased payments or sanctions by the tax authorities  which in turn could lead to financial loss. Deferred tax assets included in the statement of financial position require that the deferred tax assets can be recovered against the future taxable income. Suominen performs goodwill impairment testing annually. In impairment testing the recoverable amounts are determined as the value in use  which comprises of the discounted projected future cash flows. Actual cash flows can differ from the discounted projected future cash flows. Uncertainties related to the projected future cash flows include  among others  the long economic useful life of the assets and changes in the forecast sales prices of Suominen’s products  production costs as well as discount rates used in testing. Due to the uncertainty inherent in the future  it is possible that Suominen’s recoverable amounts will be insufficient to cover the carrying amounts of assets  particularly goodwill. If this happens  it will be necessary to recognize an impairment loss  which  when implemented  will weaken the result and equity. Goodwill impairment testing has been described in the consolidated financial statements. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT Suominen’s nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods such as wet wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points. The market expectation is that in the long run the end user demand for wipes will remain above pre-COVID levels. However  towards the end of the second quarter in 2021  especially our North American customers started to experience a sudden deceleration of demand  which in combination with extraordinary stockpiling throughout the entire supply chain created an imbalance of inventories. This impacted also Suominen’s orders  although in several cases we were able to benefit from our position as the preferred supplier of our customers. The demand started to recover in H2/2022 with full recovery expected from 2023 onwards. Looking at the year ahead there are several market drivers with a positive impact to Suominen. The raw material cost inflation finally turned in Q4/2022  and the energy markets show signs of price decline and in the US market the inventory levels have now receded to their normal levels. However  it remains to be seen how the current high consumer price inflation impacts the end consumer demand of wipes. Usually the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation. OUTLOOK Suominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2023 will increase from 2022. In 2022  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 15.3 million.PROPOSAL ON DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS The profit of the financial year 2022 of Suominen Corporation  the parent company of Suominen Group  was EUR 7 988 424.28. The funds distributable as dividends  including the profit for the period  were EUR 16 088 436 and total distributable funds were EUR 91 780 772. The Board of Directors proposes that a dividend of EUR 0.10 per share shall be distributed for the financial year 2022 and that the profit shall be transferred to retained earnings. On February 2  2023  the company had 57 480 727 issued shares  excluding treasury shares. With this number of shares  the total amount of dividends to be distributed would be EUR 5 748 072.70. There have been no significant changes in the company’s financial position after the end of the review period. The record date is April 5  2023 and the dividend will be paid on April 12  2023. DISCLOSURE OF THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT  REMUNERATION REPORT  THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  THE REPORT BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND NON-FINANCIAL REPORT Suominen will publish its Financial Statements  Report by the Board of Directors  Auditor’s Report  Corporate Governance Statement  Remuneration Report and Non-Financial Report including EU Taxonomy report  concerning the financial year 2022  as part of the Annual Report during the week commencing March 6  2023. The above documents will be published as a Stock Exchange Release and they will be available also at www.suominen.fi.ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 2023 The Annual General Meeting of Suominen Corporation is planned to be held on April 3  2023. The Board of Directors will convene the Annual General Meeting by issuing a Notice to the Annual General Meeting as a Stock Exchange Release. The notice to the Annual General Meeting will also be published at www.suominen.fi.EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD Suominen initiates consultation procedure concerning a plan to permanently close manufacturing at its Mozzate plant in Italy (January 10  2023) Suominen will start consultation with local trade unions regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at its Mozzate plant. According to the plan  the production would end during the second quarter of 2023. The consultation will be conducted in accordance with the Italian legislation and applicable National Collective Agreement and is aimed to be completed within 90 days. The Mozzate site currently employs 92 people  working both in production and in office roles. “Since the normalization of the COVID-induced demand surge  the competition in the European wipes nonwovens market has increased significantly driven mainly by imports from Turkey and China. This is the case especially in the traditional blended fiber products. At the same time energy costs in Italy have increased to record high levels. These two factors combined have created huge challenges for the cost competitiveness of our plant in Mozzate ” says Klaus Korhonen  interim President & CEO. The wipes nonwovens market is rapidly transitioning towards more sustainable alternatives. In line with its strategy  Suominen has set targets to increase the sales of sustainable products and to continuously innovate new environmentally friendly nonwovens. “The demand for traditional blended fiber products in Europe is declining. Manufacturing sustainable nonwovens competitively requires production assets and processes optimized specifically for these products. Our lines at the Mozzate plant are not best suited for sustainable fibers  and this combined with high operating costs means that the plant is not competitive and its competitiveness is not expected to improve materially going forward. We are constantly evaluating the performance and profitability of our assets  and in the current situation we have unfortunately come to the conclusion that we need to consider closing the production at Mozzate to improve the competitiveness of our European business ” Klaus Korhonen concludes. The expected financial impacts of the potential closure are approx. EUR 9 million in one-time cash costs in 2023‒24 consisting mainly of severance costs  dismantling the production lines and restoration of leased buildings. One-time net non-cash costs are expected to be approx. EUR 3 million of which approx. EUR 4.5 million will be posted in Q4/2022 and approx. EUR -1.5 million in 2023‒24 corresponding to releases of certain provisions. If implemented  the plan is expected to yield a positive EBITDA impact of approx. EUR 3 million on an annualized basis.

The Board of Directors of Suominen Corporation resolved on a new share-based Long-Term Incentive Plan for management and key employees (February 3  2023) The Board of Directors of Suominen Corporation has resolved on February 2  2023 on a new share-based Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTI Plan) for the management and key employees. The aim of the new plan is to combine the objectives of the shareholders and the persons participating in the plan in order to increase the value of the Company in the long term  to bind the participants to the Company  and to offer them competitive reward plans based on earning and accumulating the Company’s shares. The new LTI Plan has one three-year Performance Period  which includes calendar years 2023–2025. The LTI Plan is directed to approximately 25 people including the President & CEO of Suominen. The Board of Directors resolved that the potential reward for the Performance Period 2023–2025 will be based on the relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR). The maximum total amount of potential share rewards to be paid on the basis of the Performance Period 2023–2025 is 793 500 shares of Suominen Corporation  representing the gross reward before the deduction of taxes and tax-related costs arising from the reward. The Board of Directors will be entitled to reduce the rewards agreed in the LTI Plan if the limits set by the Board of Directors for the share price are reached. If the targets of the Plan are reached  rewards will be paid to participants in spring 2026 after the end of the Performance Period. The potential rewards from the Performance Period 2023–2025 will be paid partly in the Company’s shares and partly in cash.

The Auditor’s report has been signed on February 2  2023. Quarterly information  half-year report and interim reports have not been audited. As result of rounding differences  the figures presented in the tables do not necessarily add up to total.ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The consolidated financial statements of Suominen Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  including International Accounting Standards (IAS) and Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (SIC and IFRIC). International Financial Reporting Standards are standards and their interpretations adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The Notes to the Financial Statements are also in accordance with the Finnish Accounting Act and Ordinance and the Finnish Companies' Act. This financial statement release has been prepared in accordance with the principles defined in IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as approved by the European Union. Financial statement release does not include all information required for full financial statements. The principles for preparing consolidated financial statements are mainly the same as those used for preparing the consolidated financial statements for 2021. The new or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022 are presented below. New or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022: - Improvements to IFRS (2018–2020 cycle): Improvement to IFRS 9 – Fees in the ""10 percent"" Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities  applicable from January 1  2022. The amendment clarifies the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. The fees include only fees paid or received between the borrower and the lender. - Amendments to IAS 16 – Property  Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use  applicable from January 1  2022. The amendment prohibits companies deducting from the acquisition cost of an item of property  plant and equipment any proceeds of the sale of items produced while bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The sales proceeds of producing such items as well as the expenses of producing the items are to be recognized in profit or loss. The amendment was to be applied retrospectively. For Suominen  the amendment did not result in any restatement of previously published figures. Other new or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022 were not material for Suominen Group. New and amended IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations published but mandatory from January 1  2023 or later: - Amendments to IAS 1 – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current  applicable from January 1  2024. The amendment specifies the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current  by clarifying for example what is meant by a right to defer settlement  that a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period and that classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right. The amendment will be applied retrospectively. The amendment has no effect on the consolidated financial statements of Suominen. - Disclosure of Accounting Policies – Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendment replaces the requirement to disclose ""significant"" accounting policies with a requirement to disclose ""material"" accounting policies. The amendment aims to help companies to disclose accounting policies  which are material for users to understand the information in the company's financial statements. The amendments require judgement in determining whether accounting policies are material or not. The amendment may have some effect on the disclosure of accounting policies in Suominen's consolidated financial statements  as the accounting principles presented in the consolidated financial statements will concentrate on presenting the accounting principles which are material for Suominen. - Definition of Accounting Estimates – Amendments to IAS 8  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendments clarify the distinction between the changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. The amendment clarifies that the effects on an accounting estimate of a change in an input or a change in a measurement technique are changes in accounting estimates if they do not result from the correction of prior period errors. The amendment does not have any material impact on Suominen's consolidated financial statements. - Amendments to IAS 12 – Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendments are to be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The amendment narrowed the scope of the initial recognition exception under IAS 12  so that it no longer applies to taxable and deductible temporary differences. The amendment clarifies deferred tax accounting for transactions and events  such as leases and decommissioning obligations that lead to the initial recognition of both an asset and a liability. The amendments require companies to recognize a separate deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability when the temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of an asset and a liability are equal. As in the most cases the deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from recognition of leases can be offset with each other  the amendment has not material effect on the consolidated statement of financial position of Suominen. The amendment will  however  change the disclosure information in the consolidated financial statements related to the deferred taxes. Other new or amended standards  improvements or annual improvements applicable from January 1  2023 or later are not material for Suominen Group.

either IFRS key ratios (earnings per share) or required by Ordinance of the Ministry of Finance in Finland or alternative performance measures (cash flow from operations per share). Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net result attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted share-issue adjusted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period  excluding shares acquired by the Group and held as treasury shares. When calculating diluted earnings per share the number of shares is adjusted with the effects of the share-based incentive plans.

An alternative performance measure is a key ratio which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparison between the reporting periods. Operating profit and comparable operating profit Operating profit  or earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is an important measure of profitability as by ignoring income taxes and financial items it focuses solely on the company's ability to generate profit from operations. Operating profit is presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. In order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods  Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods. These items include  among others  impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses  gains or losses from the sales of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets or other assets and restructuring costs. Suominen did not have any items affecting comparability in 2021. In 2022  items affecting comparability of result were impairment losses of property  plant and equipment  right-of-use assets and inventory  arising from the planned closure of the production lines in Italy. Operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Operating profit -8 958 26 941 + Impairment losses of property  plant and equipment  affecting comparability of result 2 288 − + Impairment losses of right-of-use assets  affecting comparability of result 1 536 − + Impairment losses of inventories  affecting comparability of result 971 − Comparable operating profit -4 163 26 941 EBITDA and comparable EBITDA EBITDA is an important measure that focuses on the operating performance excluding the effect of depreciation and amortization  financial items and income taxes  in other words what is the margin on net sales after deducting operating expenses.

Gross capital expenditure includes also capitalized borrowing costs and capitalized cash flow hedges. Gross capital expenditure (gross investments) does not include increases in right-of-use assets.

It is the opinion of Suominen that presenting interest-bearing liabilities not only at amortized cost but also at nominal value gives relevant additional information to the investors. Interest-bearing net debt = Interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value - interest-bearing receivables - cash and cash equivalentsEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Interest-bearing liabilities 103 365 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 705 1 794 Cash and cash equivalents -49 508 -101 357 Interest-bearing net debt 54 562 49 570 Interest-bearing liabilities 103 365 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 705 1 794 Nominal value of interest-bearing liabilities 104 069 150 927 Return on equity (ROE)  % The return on equity is one of the most important profitability ratios used by owners and investors.

On February 2  2023  the company had 57 480 727 issued shares  excluding treasury shares. With this number of shares  the total amount of dividends to be distributed would be EUR 5 748 072.70. Klaus Korhonen  interim President and CEO: ”2022 was a difficult year for Suominen. The unprecedented raw material inflation which impacted us significantly already in 2021 persisted  and additionally also energy costs surged in 2022 after Russia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine in February. Suominen’s US business specifically continued to suffer from the high inventory levels in the whole supply chain  where imbalance started to normalize only during the second half of the year. Our net sales in 2022 reached EUR 493.3 million (443.2). Although sales volumes decreased from 2021  net sales were high driven by higher sales prices and also tailwind from currencies which amounted to EUR 32.9 million. Our comparable EBITDA decreased clearly from the previous year and was EUR 15.3 million (47.0). The higher sales prices could not fully compensate for the volume loss and for the higher raw material and energy costs. To improve our profitability  we took several actions during the year such as implementing energy surcharges in Europe in March and September and a general cost surcharge in North America in August as well as widening our product portfolio in the US. We announced in June 2022 an investment to enhance and upgrade one of our lines in Nakkila  Finland. The investment strengthens our capabilities in sustainable products and is made in line with our strategy and vision to be the frontrunner in sustainable nonwovens. The investment project is proceeding according to plan and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023. We are continuously developing our sustainable product offering and our target is to increase the sales of sustainable products by 50% compared to the base year of 2019 and launch over 10 sustainable products per year. In 2022  the sales of sustainable products were 99% higher than in the baseline year 2019 and during the year we launched 12 sustainable products. One example of new products launched in 2022 is our first carbon neutral product BIOLACE® Zero. We also opened our own compostability test center Green Lab in Nakkila  Finland to support our product development. In 2022 we completed the EcoVadis sustainability assessment for the first time and received a silver level rating. This result places us in the top 8% of companies in the manufacture of other textiles industry rated by EcoVadis. Tommi Björnman was appointed Suominen’s new President and CEO in November 2022. He currently works as President and CEO of Avgol Nonwovens and will join Suominen in May 2023 at the latest. In January 2023 we started a consultation procedure regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at our Mozzate plant in Italy. The decision was made with a heavy heart but we see it as unavoidable given the market situation in Europe and the ongoing transition to more sustainable nonwovens for wipes. The plan has no impact to Suominen’s operations at the Cressa plant in Italy. Looking at the year ahead we see several market drivers with a positive impact to Suominen. The raw material cost inflation finally turned in Q4/2022  the energy markets show signs of price decline and in the US market the inventory levels have now receded to their normal levels. However  it remains to be seen how the current high consumer price inflation impacts the end consumer demand of wipes. Usually the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation. To conclude  I want to thank all our employees for their contribution and hard work and our business partners for excellent cooperation in 2022.” NET SALESOctober–December 2022 In the fourth quarter  Suominen’s net sales increased by 15.1% from the comparison period to EUR 133.1 million (115.6).

Gearing was 37.4% (30.4%) and equity ratio 42.5% (42.2%). In 2022  net financial expenses were EUR -2.9 million (-0.4)  or 0.6% (0.1%) of net sales. Net effect of changes in foreign exchange rates in financial items were EUR +2.8 million (+1.7). Suominen sold its minority share in Amerplast (Bright Maze Oy) in March 2021.

The change in the net working capital in 2022 was EUR 7.8 million positive (EUR 25.2 million negative) due to higher payables. In June 2022  Suominen announced that it has extended by one year the maturity of the EUR 100 million syndicated revolving credit facility agreement signed in July 2020. The maturity of the facility is now extended to July 2025. The debenture bond of EUR 85 million issued in 2017 fell due and was repaid in full on October 3  2022. CAPITAL EXPENDITURE In 2022  the gross capital expenditure totaled EUR 9.7 million (17.8) and the largest item was related to the growth investment initiatives in Nakkila  Finland. Other investments were mainly for maintenance. Suominen announced in June that it strengthens its capabilities in sustainable products by enhancing and upgrading one of its production lines in Nakkila  Finland. The investment is made in line with Suominen’s strategy and supports company’s vision to be the frontrunner in sustainability. The total value of the investment is approximately EUR 6 million and the investment project will be completed in the second half of 2023. Depreciations and amortizations were EUR -19.4 million (-20.1) and impairment losses were EUR -3.8 million. PERSONNEL During 2022  Suominen employed 707 FTEs (709) on average  and 710 (707) FTEs at the end of 2022. PROGRESS IN SUSTAINABILITY We have a comprehensive approach to sustainability and our Sustainability agenda 2020‒2025 defines our focus areas and their KPIs. We have strong focus on safety and accident prevention  and our long-term target is to have zero lost-time accidents. In 2022  Suominen had 2 (4) lost time accidents. Increasing employee engagement is another of our key people-related targets. We conducted a third consecutive global employee engagement survey in 2022 and based on the results our employee engagement index is 65% (66%). The index is a combination of questions concerning our people's retention  likelihood to recommend the company  organizational pride and commitment. Our target is that our engagement index will be 73% by 2025. We are committed to continuously improving our production efficiency and the efficient utilization of natural resources. Our target is to reduce our energy consumption  greenhouse gas emissions  water consumption and waste to landfill by 20% per ton of product by 2025 compared to the base year of 2019. By the end of 2022  our water consumption has decreased by 6.1%  waste to landfill by 2.5%  energy consumption by 0.6%  and greenhouse gas emissions by 20.0% per ton of product compared to 2019. As examples of our continuous work to decrease our greenhouse gas emissions  we moved entirely to fossil free electricity in all our European plants and installed solar panels to our Alicante plant in 2022. We monitor our progress regularly and are always seeking new ways to further improve our operations. Regarding sustainable products  our target is to increase their sales by 50% by 2025 and to have over 10 sustainable product launches per year. In 2022  we launched 12 sustainable products  and the sales of sustainable product sales has increased by 99% compared to the base year of 2019. As part of our Annual Report 2022 which will be published in the week starting on March 6  2023  we report the development of our sustainability performance.

BUSINESS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIESManufacturing risks Suominen has production plants in several European countries  United States and Brazil. Interruptions at the plants caused for example by machinery breakdown can cause production losses and delivery problems. Ongoing maintenance and investments aiming to extend the lifetime of the assets are an essential part of ensuring the operational efficiency of the existing production lines. Suominen’s operations could be disrupted due to abrupt and unforeseen events beyond the company's control  such as power outages or fire and water damage. Suominen may not be able to control such events through predictive actions  which could lead to interruptions in business. Risks of this type are insured in order to guarantee the continuity of operations. As Suominen has a valid damage and business interruption insurance  it is expected that the damage would be compensated  and the financial losses caused by the interruption of business would be covered.Suominen uses certain technologies in its production. In the management’s view  the chosen technologies are competitive and there is no need to make major investments in new technologies. However  it cannot be excluded that the company’s technology choices could prove wrong  and the development of new or substitute technologies would then require investments.Competition Suominen has numerous regional  national and global competitors in its different product groups. Products based on new technologies and imports from countries of lower production costs may reduce Suominen’s competitive edge. If Suominen is not able to compete with an attractive product offering  it may lose some of its market share. Competition may lead to increased pricing pressure on the company’s products.Price and availability of raw materials Suominen purchases significant amounts of pulp- and oil-based raw materials. Raw materials are the largest cost item for operations. Changes in the global market prices of raw materials can have an impact on the company’s profitability. Suominen’s stocks equal two to four weeks’ consumption and it generally takes two to five months for raw material price changes to be reflected in Suominen’s customer pricing either through automatic pricing mechanisms or negotiated price changes. Extended interruptions in the supply of Suominen’s main raw materials could disrupt production and have a negative impact on the Group’s overall business operations. As Suominen sources most of its raw materials from a number of major international suppliers  significant interruptions in the production of the majority of Suominen’s products are unlikely.Price and availability of energy Energy costs represent a significant portion of Suominen's production costs. Suominen consumes mainly electricity and gas. Higher prices as well as reduced availability of energy could have an impact on Suominen's profitability through increased production costs.Market and customer risks Suominen’s customer base is fairly concentrated  which increases the potential impact of changes in customer specific sales volumes. In 2022  the Group’s ten largest customers accounted for 64% (66%) of the Group net sales. Long-term contracts are preferred with the largest customers. In practice  the customer relationships are long-term and last for several years. Customer-related credit risks are managed in accordance with a credit policy approved by the Board of Directors. Credit limits are confirmed for customers on the basis of credit ratings and customer history. The demand for Suominen’s products depends on possible changes in consumer preferences. Historically  such changes have had mainly a positive impact on Suominen  as they have resulted in the growing demand for products made of nonwovens. For example  the COVID-19 pandemic increased the demand for nonwovens for cleaning and disinfecting wipes. However  certain factors  including consumers’ attitude towards the use of products made even partially of oil-based raw materials  or their perception on the sustainability of disposable products in general  might change the consumers’ buying habits. Suominen monitors the consumer trends proactively and develops its product offering accordingly. The company has had biodegradable  100% plant-based nonwovens in its portfolio for over 15 years and hence is well positioned to respond to changes in customer preferences related to sustainability and climate change. Generally the demand for nonwovens for wipes has been resilient to changing economic conditions. However  it is conceivable that high consumer price inflation could lead to decline in end consumer demand for wiping products as the consumers’ available income effectively decreases. Regarding the war in Ukraine  the direct impact to Suominen’s business is minor as we have no customers nor suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. Suominen is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war which contribute to the cost inflation. Changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditions Suominen’s business and products can be affected directly or indirectly by political decisions and changes in government regulations for example in areas such as environmental policy or waste legislation. An example of such legislation is the EU's Single-Use Plastics Directive that focuses on reducing marine litter. The potential exists for similar regulations to expand worldwide. This creates demand for more sustainable products  and Suominen is well placed to respond to this increasing demand. Global political developments could have an adverse effect on Suominen. For instance  a political decision that constrains the global free trade may significantly impact the availability and price of certain raw materials  which would in turn affect Suominen’s business and profitability. Suominen’s geographical and customer-industry diversity provide partial protection against this risk. The relevance of the United States in Suominen’s business operations increases the significance of the exchange rate risk related to USD in the Group’s total foreign exchange position. Suominen hedges this foreign exchange position in accordance with its hedging policy.The risks that are characteristic to South American region  including significant changes in political environment or exchange rates  could have an impact on Suominen’s operations in Brazil. Investments Suominen continuously invests in its manufacturing facilities. The deployment of the investments may delay from what was planned  the costs of the investments may increase from what has been expected or the investments may create less business benefits than anticipated. The deployment phase of investments may cause temporary interruptions in operations.Cyber and information security Suominen’s operations are dependent on the integrity  security and stable operation of its information and communication systems and software as well as on the successful management of cyber attack risks. If Suominen’s information and communication systems and software were to become unusable or significantly impaired for an extended period of time  or the cyber attack risks are realized  Suominen’s reputation as well as ability to deliver products at the appointed time  order raw materials and handle inventory could be adversely impacted.Financial risks The Group is exposed to several financial risks  such as foreign exchange  interest rate  counterparty  liquidity and credit risks. The Group’s financial risks are managed in line with a policy confirmed by the Board of Directors. The financial risks are described in the Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements. Suominen is subject to corporate income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine the total amount of corporate income tax at Group level. There are many transactions and calculations that leave room for uncertainty as to the final amount of the income taxes. Tax risks relate also to changes in tax rates or tax legislation or misinterpretations  and materialization of the risks could result in increased payments or sanctions by the tax authorities  which in turn could lead to financial loss. Deferred tax assets included in the statement of financial position require that the deferred tax assets can be recovered against the future taxable income. Suominen performs goodwill impairment testing annually. In impairment testing the recoverable amounts are determined as the value in use  which comprises of the discounted projected future cash flows. Actual cash flows can differ from the discounted projected future cash flows. Uncertainties related to the projected future cash flows include  among others  the long economic useful life of the assets and changes in the forecast sales prices of Suominen’s products  production costs as well as discount rates used in testing. Due to the uncertainty inherent in the future  it is possible that Suominen’s recoverable amounts will be insufficient to cover the carrying amounts of assets  particularly goodwill. If this happens  it will be necessary to recognize an impairment loss  which  when implemented  will weaken the result and equity. Goodwill impairment testing has been described in the consolidated financial statements. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT Suominen’s nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods such as wet wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points. The market expectation is that in the long run the end user demand for wipes will remain above pre-COVID levels. However  towards the end of the second quarter in 2021  especially our North American customers started to experience a sudden deceleration of demand  which in combination with extraordinary stockpiling throughout the entire supply chain created an imbalance of inventories. This impacted also Suominen’s orders  although in several cases we were able to benefit from our position as the preferred supplier of our customers. The demand started to recover in H2/2022 with full recovery expected from 2023 onwards. Looking at the year ahead there are several market drivers with a positive impact to Suominen. The raw material cost inflation finally turned in Q4/2022  and the energy markets show signs of price decline and in the US market the inventory levels have now receded to their normal levels. However  it remains to be seen how the current high consumer price inflation impacts the end consumer demand of wipes. Usually the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation. OUTLOOK Suominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2023 will increase from 2022. In 2022  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 15.3 million.PROPOSAL ON DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS The profit of the financial year 2022 of Suominen Corporation  the parent company of Suominen Group  was EUR 7 988 424.28. The funds distributable as dividends  including the profit for the period  were EUR 16 088 436 and total distributable funds were EUR 91 780 772. The Board of Directors proposes that a dividend of EUR 0.10 per share shall be distributed for the financial year 2022 and that the profit shall be transferred to retained earnings. On February 2  2023  the company had 57 480 727 issued shares  excluding treasury shares. With this number of shares  the total amount of dividends to be distributed would be EUR 5 748 072.70. There have been no significant changes in the company’s financial position after the end of the review period. The record date is April 5  2023 and the dividend will be paid on April 12  2023. DISCLOSURE OF THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT  REMUNERATION REPORT  THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  THE REPORT BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND NON-FINANCIAL REPORT Suominen will publish its Financial Statements  Report by the Board of Directors  Auditor’s Report  Corporate Governance Statement  Remuneration Report and Non-Financial Report including EU Taxonomy report  concerning the financial year 2022  as part of the Annual Report during the week commencing March 6  2023. The above documents will be published as a Stock Exchange Release and they will be available also at www.suominen.fi.ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 2023 The Annual General Meeting of Suominen Corporation is planned to be held on April 3  2023. The Board of Directors will convene the Annual General Meeting by issuing a Notice to the Annual General Meeting as a Stock Exchange Release. The notice to the Annual General Meeting will also be published at www.suominen.fi.EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD Suominen initiates consultation procedure concerning a plan to permanently close manufacturing at its Mozzate plant in Italy (January 10  2023) Suominen will start consultation with local trade unions regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at its Mozzate plant. According to the plan  the production would end during the second quarter of 2023. The consultation will be conducted in accordance with the Italian legislation and applicable National Collective Agreement and is aimed to be completed within 90 days. The Mozzate site currently employs 92 people  working both in production and in office roles. “Since the normalization of the COVID-induced demand surge  the competition in the European wipes nonwovens market has increased significantly driven mainly by imports from Turkey and China. This is the case especially in the traditional blended fiber products. At the same time energy costs in Italy have increased to record high levels. These two factors combined have created huge challenges for the cost competitiveness of our plant in Mozzate ” says Klaus Korhonen  interim President & CEO. The wipes nonwovens market is rapidly transitioning towards more sustainable alternatives. In line with its strategy  Suominen has set targets to increase the sales of sustainable products and to continuously innovate new environmentally friendly nonwovens. “The demand for traditional blended fiber products in Europe is declining. Manufacturing sustainable nonwovens competitively requires production assets and processes optimized specifically for these products. Our lines at the Mozzate plant are not best suited for sustainable fibers  and this combined with high operating costs means that the plant is not competitive and its competitiveness is not expected to improve materially going forward. We are constantly evaluating the performance and profitability of our assets  and in the current situation we have unfortunately come to the conclusion that we need to consider closing the production at Mozzate to improve the competitiveness of our European business ” Klaus Korhonen concludes. The expected financial impacts of the potential closure are approx. EUR 9 million in one-time cash costs in 2023‒24 consisting mainly of severance costs  dismantling the production lines and restoration of leased buildings. One-time net non-cash costs are expected to be approx. EUR 3 million of which approx. EUR 4.5 million will be posted in Q4/2022 and approx. EUR -1.5 million in 2023‒24 corresponding to releases of certain provisions. If implemented  the plan is expected to yield a positive EBITDA impact of approx. EUR 3 million on an annualized basis.

The Board of Directors of Suominen Corporation resolved on a new share-based Long-Term Incentive Plan for management and key employees (February 3  2023) The Board of Directors of Suominen Corporation has resolved on February 2  2023 on a new share-based Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTI Plan) for the management and key employees. The aim of the new plan is to combine the objectives of the shareholders and the persons participating in the plan in order to increase the value of the Company in the long term  to bind the participants to the Company  and to offer them competitive reward plans based on earning and accumulating the Company’s shares. The new LTI Plan has one three-year Performance Period  which includes calendar years 2023–2025. The LTI Plan is directed to approximately 25 people including the President & CEO of Suominen. The Board of Directors resolved that the potential reward for the Performance Period 2023–2025 will be based on the relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR). The maximum total amount of potential share rewards to be paid on the basis of the Performance Period 2023–2025 is 793 500 shares of Suominen Corporation  representing the gross reward before the deduction of taxes and tax-related costs arising from the reward. The Board of Directors will be entitled to reduce the rewards agreed in the LTI Plan if the limits set by the Board of Directors for the share price are reached. If the targets of the Plan are reached  rewards will be paid to participants in spring 2026 after the end of the Performance Period. The potential rewards from the Performance Period 2023–2025 will be paid partly in the Company’s shares and partly in cash. The cash proportion is intended to cover taxes and tax-related costs arising from the reward to the participant. The Company also has the right to pay the reward fully in cash under certain circumstances. As a rule  no reward will be paid  if a participant’s employment or service ends before the reward payment. A member of the Executive Team must hold 50 per cent of the net number of shares given on the basis of the Plan  as long as his or her shareholding in total corresponds to the value of half of his or her annual gross salary. The President & CEO of the Company must hold 50 per cent of the net number of shares given on the basis of the Plan  as long as his or her shareholding in total corresponds to the value of his or her annual gross salary. Such number of shares must be held as long as the participant’s employment or service in a group company continues.

The Auditor’s report has been signed on February 2  2023. Quarterly information  half-year report and interim reports have not been audited. As result of rounding differences  the figures presented in the tables do not necessarily add up to total.ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The consolidated financial statements of Suominen Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  including International Accounting Standards (IAS) and Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (SIC and IFRIC). International Financial Reporting Standards are standards and their interpretations adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The Notes to the Financial Statements are also in accordance with the Finnish Accounting Act and Ordinance and the Finnish Companies' Act. This financial statement release has been prepared in accordance with the principles defined in IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as approved by the European Union. Financial statement release does not include all information required for full financial statements. The principles for preparing consolidated financial statements are mainly the same as those used for preparing the consolidated financial statements for 2021. The new or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022 are presented below. New or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022: - Improvements to IFRS (2018–2020 cycle): Improvement to IFRS 9 – Fees in the ""10 percent"" Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities  applicable from January 1  2022. The amendment clarifies the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. The fees include only fees paid or received between the borrower and the lender. - Amendments to IAS 16 – Property  Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use  applicable from January 1  2022. The amendment prohibits companies deducting from the acquisition cost of an item of property  plant and equipment any proceeds of the sale of items produced while bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The sales proceeds of producing such items as well as the expenses of producing the items are to be recognized in profit or loss. The amendment was to be applied retrospectively. For Suominen  the amendment did not result in any restatement of previously published figures. Other new or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022 were not material for Suominen Group. New and amended IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations published but mandatory from January 1  2023 or later: - Amendments to IAS 1 – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current  applicable from January 1  2024. The amendment specifies the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current  by clarifying for example what is meant by a right to defer settlement  that a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period and that classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right. The amendment will be applied retrospectively. The amendment has no effect on the consolidated financial statements of Suominen. - Disclosure of Accounting Policies – Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendment replaces the requirement to disclose ""significant"" accounting policies with a requirement to disclose ""material"" accounting policies. The amendment aims to help companies to disclose accounting policies  which are material for users to understand the information in the company's financial statements. The amendments require judgement in determining whether accounting policies are material or not. The amendment may have some effect on the disclosure of accounting policies in Suominen's consolidated financial statements  as the accounting principles presented in the consolidated financial statements will concentrate on presenting the accounting principles which are material for Suominen. - Definition of Accounting Estimates – Amendments to IAS 8  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendments clarify the distinction between the changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. The amendment clarifies that the effects on an accounting estimate of a change in an input or a change in a measurement technique are changes in accounting estimates if they do not result from the correction of prior period errors. The amendment does not have any material impact on Suominen's consolidated financial statements. - Amendments to IAS 12 – Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendments are to be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The amendment narrowed the scope of the initial recognition exception under IAS 12  so that it no longer applies to taxable and deductible temporary differences. The amendment clarifies deferred tax accounting for transactions and events  such as leases and decommissioning obligations that lead to the initial recognition of both an asset and a liability. The amendments require companies to recognize a separate deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability when the temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of an asset and a liability are equal. As in the most cases the deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from recognition of leases can be offset with each other  the amendment has not material effect on the consolidated statement of financial position of Suominen. The amendment will  however  change the disclosure information in the consolidated financial statements related to the deferred taxes. Other new or amended standards  improvements or annual improvements applicable from January 1  2023 or later are not material for Suominen Group.

either IFRS key ratios (earnings per share) or required by Ordinance of the Ministry of Finance in Finland or alternative performance measures (cash flow from operations per share). Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net result attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted share-issue adjusted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period  excluding shares acquired by the Group and held as treasury shares. When calculating diluted earnings per share the number of shares is adjusted with the effects of the share-based incentive plans.

An alternative performance measure is a key ratio which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparison between the reporting periods. Operating profit and comparable operating profit Operating profit  or earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is an important measure of profitability as by ignoring income taxes and financial items it focuses solely on the company's ability to generate profit from operations. Operating profit is presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. In order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods  Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods. These items include  among others  impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses  gains or losses from the sales of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets or other assets and restructuring costs. Suominen did not have any items affecting comparability in 2021. In 2022  items affecting comparability of result were impairment losses of property  plant and equipment  right-of-use assets and inventory  arising from the planned closure of the production lines in Italy. Operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Operating profit -8 958 26 941 + Impairment losses of property  plant and equipment  affecting comparability of result 2 288 − + Impairment losses of right-of-use assets  affecting comparability of result 1 536 − + Impairment losses of inventories  affecting comparability of result 971 − Comparable operating profit -4 163 26 941 EBITDA and comparable EBITDA EBITDA is an important measure that focuses on the operating performance excluding the effect of depreciation and amortization  financial items and income taxes  in other words what is the margin on net sales after deducting operating expenses.

Gross capital expenditure includes also capitalized borrowing costs and capitalized cash flow hedges. Gross capital expenditure (gross investments) does not include increases in right-of-use assets.

It is the opinion of Suominen that presenting interest-bearing liabilities not only at amortized cost but also at nominal value gives relevant additional information to the investors. Interest-bearing net debt = Interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value - interest-bearing receivables - cash and cash equivalentsEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Interest-bearing liabilities 103 365 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 705 1 794 Cash and cash equivalents -49 508 -101 357 Interest-bearing net debt 54 562 49 570 Interest-bearing liabilities 103 365 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 705 1 794 Nominal value of interest-bearing liabilities 104 069 150 927 Return on equity (ROE)  % The return on equity is one of the most important profitability ratios used by owners and investors.

With this number of shares  the total amount of dividends to be distributed would be EUR 5 748 072.70.Klaus Korhonen  interim President and CEO:”2022 was a difficult year for Suominen. The unprecedented raw material inflation which impacted us significantly already in 2021 persisted  and additionally also energy costs surged in 2022 after Russia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine in February. Suominen’s US business specifically continued to suffer from the high inventory levels in the whole supply chain  where imbalance started to normalize only during the second half of the year.Our net sales in 2022 reached EUR 493.3 million (443.2). Although sales volumes decreased from 2021  net sales were high driven by higher sales prices and also tailwind from currencies which amounted to EUR 32.9 million. Our comparable EBITDA decreased clearly from the previous year and was EUR 15.3 million (47.0). The higher sales prices could not fully compensate for the volume loss and for the higher raw material and energy costs. To improve our profitability  we took several actions during the year such as implementing energy surcharges in Europe in March and September and a general cost surcharge in North America in August as well as widening our product portfolio in the US.We announced in June 2022 an investment to enhance and upgrade one of our lines in Nakkila  Finland. The investment strengthens our capabilities in sustainable products and is made in line with our strategy and vision to be the frontrunner in sustainable nonwovens. The investment project is proceeding according to plan and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023.We are continuously developing our sustainable product offering and our target is to increase the sales of sustainable products by 50% compared to the base year of 2019 and launch over 10 sustainable products per year. In 2022  the sales of sustainable products were 99% higher than in the baseline year 2019 and during the year we launched 12 sustainable products. One example of new products launched in 2022 is our first carbon neutral product BIOLACE® Zero. We also opened our own compostability test center Green Lab in Nakkila  Finland to support our product development.In 2022 we completed the EcoVadis sustainability assessment for the first time and received a silver level rating. This result places us in the top 8% of companies in the manufacture of other textiles industry rated by EcoVadis.Tommi Björnman was appointed Suominen’s new President and CEO in November 2022. He currently works as President and CEO of Avgol Nonwovens and will join Suominen in May 2023 at the latest.In January 2023 we started a consultation procedure regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at our Mozzate plant in Italy. The decision was made with a heavy heart but we see it as unavoidable given the market situation in Europe and the ongoing transition to more sustainable nonwovens for wipes. The plan has no impact to Suominen’s operations at the Cressa plant in Italy.Looking at the year ahead we see several market drivers with a positive impact to Suominen. The raw material cost inflation finally turned in Q4/2022  the energy markets show signs of price decline and in the US market the inventory levels have now receded to their normal levels. However  it remains to be seen how the current high consumer price inflation impacts the end consumer demand of wipes. Usually the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation.To conclude  I want to thank all our employees for their contribution and hard work and our business partners for excellent cooperation in 2022.”NET SALESOctober–December 2022In the fourth quarter  Suominen’s net sales increased by 15.1% from the comparison period to EUR 133.1 million (115.6). Sales volumes were in line with the comparison period and Q3/2022 while sales prices increased. Currencies impacted net sales positively by EUR 9.3 million.Net sales of the Americas business area amounted to EUR 81.7 million (68.9) and net sales of the Europe business area EUR 51.4 million (46.7).Financial year 2022In 2022  Suominen’s net sales increased by 11.3% from the comparison period to EUR 493.3 million (443.2). The increase in sales was driven by higher sales prices and tailwind from currencies; sales volumes decreased from 2021. Currencies impacted net sales positively by EUR 32.9 million.Net sales of Americas business area were EUR 288.0 million (265.2) and net sales of Europe business area EUR 205.5 million (178.1).EBITDA  OPERATING PROFIT AND RESULTOctober–December 2022Comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) was EUR 5.0 million (9.0). EBITDA was EUR 4.0 million (9.0). The main reasons for the result decline were higher raw material and energy costs versus sales prices and costs related to the CEO change. In addition  in the comparison period the other operating income and expenses included positive onetime items. Currencies impacted EBITDA positively by EUR 0.7 million.Comparable operating profit decreased from the corresponding period of the previous year and was EUR -0.2 million (3.9).

Income taxes for the financial year were EUR -2.0 million (-5.8). The income taxes of the year were impacted by derecognition of deferred tax assets in certain countries where Suominen operates as the possibility to utilize assets had decreased.The profit for the period was EUR -13.9 million (20.7).FINANCINGThe Group’s net interest-bearing liabilities  calculated with the nominal value of the interest-bearing liabilities at the end of the review period  December 31  2022  amounted to EUR 54.6 million (49.6). Gearing was 37.4% (30.4%) and equity ratio 42.5% (42.2%).In 2022  net financial expenses were EUR -2.9 million (-0.4)  or 0.6% (0.1%) of net sales. Net effect of changes in foreign exchange rates in financial items were EUR +2.8 million (+1.7).Suominen sold its minority share in Amerplast (Bright Maze Oy) in March 2021.

The change in the net working capital in 2022 was EUR 7.8 million positive (EUR 25.2 million negative) due to higher payables.In June 2022  Suominen announced that it has extended by one year the maturity of the EUR 100 million syndicated revolving credit facility agreement signed in July 2020.

Interruptions at the plants caused for example by machinery breakdown can cause production losses and delivery problems. Ongoing maintenance and investments aiming to extend the lifetime of the assets are an essential part of ensuring the operational efficiency of the existing production lines.Suominen’s operations could be disrupted due to abrupt and unforeseen events beyond the company's control  such as power outages or fire and water damage. Suominen may not be able to control such events through predictive actions  which could lead to interruptions in business. Risks of this type are insured in order to guarantee the continuity of operations. As Suominen has a valid damage and business interruption insurance  it is expected that the damage would be compensated  and the financial losses caused by the interruption of business would be covered.Suominen uses certain technologies in its production. In the management’s view  the chosen technologies are competitive and there is no need to make major investments in new technologies. However  it cannot be excluded that the company’s technology choices could prove wrong  and the development of new or substitute technologies would then require investments.CompetitionSuominen has numerous regional  national and global competitors in its different product groups. Products based on new technologies and imports from countries of lower production costs may reduce Suominen’s competitive edge. If Suominen is not able to compete with an attractive product offering  it may lose some of its market share. Competition may lead to increased pricing pressure on the company’s products.Price and availability of raw materialsSuominen purchases significant amounts of pulp- and oil-based raw materials. Raw materials are the largest cost item for operations. Changes in the global market prices of raw materials can have an impact on the company’s profitability. Suominen’s stocks equal two to four weeks’ consumption and it generally takes two to five months for raw material price changes to be reflected in Suominen’s customer pricing either through automatic pricing mechanisms or negotiated price changes.Extended interruptions in the supply of Suominen’s main raw materials could disrupt production and have a negative impact on the Group’s overall business operations. As Suominen sources most of its raw materials from a number of major international suppliers  significant interruptions in the production of the majority of Suominen’s products are unlikely.Price and availability of energyEnergy costs represent a significant portion of Suominen's production costs. Suominen consumes mainly electricity and gas. Higher prices as well as reduced availability of energy could have an impact on Suominen's profitability through increased production costs.Market and customer risksSuominen’s customer base is fairly concentrated  which increases the potential impact of changes in customer specific sales volumes. In 2022  the Group’s ten largest customers accounted for 64% (66%) of the Group net sales. Long-term contracts are preferred with the largest customers. In practice  the customer relationships are long-term and last for several years. Customer-related credit risks are managed in accordance with a credit policy approved by the Board of Directors. Credit limits are confirmed for customers on the basis of credit ratings and customer history.The demand for Suominen’s products depends on possible changes in consumer preferences. Historically  such changes have had mainly a positive impact on Suominen  as they have resulted in the growing demand for products made of nonwovens. For example  the COVID-19 pandemic increased the demand for nonwovens for cleaning and disinfecting wipes. However  certain factors  including consumers’ attitude towards the use of products made even partially of oil-based raw materials  or their perception on the sustainability of disposable products in general  might change the consumers’ buying habits. Suominen monitors the consumer trends proactively and develops its product offering accordingly. The company has had biodegradable  100% plant-based nonwovens in its portfolio for over 15 years and hence is well positioned to respond to changes in customer preferences related to sustainability and climate change.Generally the demand for nonwovens for wipes has been resilient to changing economic conditions. However  it is conceivable that high consumer price inflation could lead to decline in end consumer demand for wiping products as the consumers’ available income effectively decreases.Regarding the war in Ukraine  the direct impact to Suominen’s business is minor as we have no customers nor suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. Suominen is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war which contribute to the cost inflation.Changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditionsSuominen’s business and products can be affected directly or indirectly by political decisions and changes in government regulations for example in areas such as environmental policy or waste legislation. An example of such legislation is the EU's Single-Use Plastics Directive that focuses on reducing marine litter. The potential exists for similar regulations to expand worldwide. This creates demand for more sustainable products  and Suominen is well placed to respond to this increasing demand.Global political developments could have an adverse effect on Suominen. For instance  a political decision that constrains the global free trade may significantly impact the availability and price of certain raw materials  which would in turn affect Suominen’s business and profitability. Suominen’s geographical and customer-industry diversity provide partial protection against this risk.The relevance of the United States in Suominen’s business operations increases the significance of the exchange rate risk related to USD in the Group’s total foreign exchange position. Suominen hedges this foreign exchange position in accordance with its hedging policy.The risks that are characteristic to South American region  including significant changes in political environment or exchange rates  could have an impact on Suominen’s operations in Brazil.InvestmentsSuominen continuously invests in its manufacturing facilities. The deployment of the investments may delay from what was planned  the costs of the investments may increase from what has been expected or the investments may create less business benefits than anticipated. The deployment phase of investments may cause temporary interruptions in operations.Cyber and information securitySuominen’s operations are dependent on the integrity  security and stable operation of its information and communication systems and software as well as on the successful management of cyber attack risks. If Suominen’s information and communication systems and software were to become unusable or significantly impaired for an extended period of time  or the cyber attack risks are realized  Suominen’s reputation as well as ability to deliver products at the appointed time  order raw materials and handle inventory could be adversely impacted.Financial risksThe Group is exposed to several financial risks  such as foreign exchange  interest rate  counterparty  liquidity and credit risks. The Group’s financial risks are managed in line with a policy confirmed by the Board of Directors. The financial risks are described in the Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements.Suominen is subject to corporate income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine the total amount of corporate income tax at Group level. There are many transactions and calculations that leave room for uncertainty as to the final amount of the income taxes. Tax risks relate also to changes in tax rates or tax legislation or misinterpretations  and materialization of the risks could result in increased payments or sanctions by the tax authorities  which in turn could lead to financial loss. Deferred tax assets included in the statement of financial position require that the deferred tax assets can be recovered against the future taxable income.Suominen performs goodwill impairment testing annually. In impairment testing the recoverable amounts are determined as the value in use  which comprises of the discounted projected future cash flows. Actual cash flows can differ from the discounted projected future cash flows. Uncertainties related to the projected future cash flows include  among others  the long economic useful life of the assets and changes in the forecast sales prices of Suominen’s products  production costs as well as discount rates used in testing. Due to the uncertainty inherent in the future  it is possible that Suominen’s recoverable amounts will be insufficient to cover the carrying amounts of assets  particularly goodwill. If this happens  it will be necessary to recognize an impairment loss  which  when implemented  will weaken the result and equity. Goodwill impairment testing has been described in the consolidated financial statements.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTSuominen’s nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods such as wet wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points.The market expectation is that in the long run the end user demand for wipes will remain above pre-COVID levels. However  towards the end of the second quarter in 2021  especially our North American customers started to experience a sudden deceleration of demand  which in combination with extraordinary stockpiling throughout the entire supply chain created an imbalance of inventories. This impacted also Suominen’s orders  although in several cases we were able to benefit from our position as the preferred supplier of our customers. The demand started to recover in H2/2022 with full recovery expected from 2023 onwards.Looking at the year ahead there are several market drivers with a positive impact to Suominen. The raw material cost inflation finally turned in Q4/2022  and the energy markets show signs of price decline and in the US market the inventory levels have now receded to their normal levels. However  it remains to be seen how the current high consumer price inflation impacts the end consumer demand of wipes. Usually the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation.OUTLOOKSuominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2023 will increase from 2022. In 2022  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 15.3 million.PROPOSAL ON DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDSThe profit of the financial year 2022 of Suominen Corporation  the parent company of Suominen Group  was EUR 7 988 424.28. The funds distributable as dividends  including the profit for the period  were EUR 16 088 436 and total distributable funds were EUR 91 780 772.The Board of Directors proposes that a dividend of EUR 0.10 per share shall be distributed for the financial year 2022 and that the profit shall be transferred to retained earnings.On February 2  2023  the company had 57 480 727 issued shares  excluding treasury shares. With this number of shares  the total amount of dividends to be distributed would be EUR 5 748 072.70.There have been no significant changes in the company’s financial position after the end of the review period.The record date is April 5  2023 and the dividend will be paid on April 14  2023.DISCLOSURE OF THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT  REMUNERATION REPORT  THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  THE REPORT BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND NON-FINANCIAL REPORTSuominen will publish its Financial Statements  Report by the Board of Directors  Auditor’s Report  Corporate Governance Statement  Remuneration Report and Non-Financial Report including EU Taxonomy report  concerning the financial year 2022  as part of the Annual Report during the week commencing March 6  2023. The above documents will be published as a Stock Exchange Release and they will be available also at www.suominen.fi.ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 2023The Annual General Meeting of Suominen Corporation is planned to be held on April 3  2023. The Board of Directors will convene the Annual General Meeting by issuing a Notice to the Annual General Meeting as a Stock Exchange Release. The notice to the Annual General Meeting will also be published at www.suominen.fi.EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIODSuominen initiates consultation procedure concerning a plan to permanently close manufacturing at its Mozzate plant in Italy (January 10  2023)Suominen will start consultation with local trade unions regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at its Mozzate plant. According to the plan  the production would end during the second quarter of 2023. The consultation will be conducted in accordance with the Italian legislation and applicable National Collective Agreement and is aimed to be completed within 90 days. The Mozzate site currently employs 92 people  working both in production and in office roles.“Since the normalization of the COVID-induced demand surge  the competition in the European wipes nonwovens market has increased significantly driven mainly by imports from Turkey and China. This is the case especially in the traditional blended fiber products. At the same time energy costs in Italy have increased to record high levels. These two factors combined have created huge challenges for the cost competitiveness of our plant in Mozzate ” says Klaus Korhonen  interim President & CEO.The wipes nonwovens market is rapidly transitioning towards more sustainable alternatives. In line with its strategy  Suominen has set targets to increase the sales of sustainable products and to continuously innovate new environmentally friendly nonwovens.“The demand for traditional blended fiber products in Europe is declining. Manufacturing sustainable nonwovens competitively requires production assets and processes optimized specifically for these products. Our lines at the Mozzate plant are not best suited for sustainable fibers  and this combined with high operating costs means that the plant is not competitive and its competitiveness is not expected to improve materially going forward. We are constantly evaluating the performance and profitability of our assets  and in the current situation we have unfortunately come to the conclusion that we need to consider closing the production at Mozzate to improve the competitiveness of our European business ” Klaus Korhonen concludes.The expected financial impacts of the potential closure are approx. EUR 9 million in one-time cash costs in 2023‒24 consisting mainly of severance costs  dismantling the production lines and restoration of leased buildings. One-time net non-cash costs are expected to be approx. EUR 3 million of which approx. EUR 4.5 million will be posted in Q4/2022 and approx. EUR -1.5 million in 2023‒24 corresponding to releases of certain provisions. If implemented  the plan is expected to yield a positive EBITDA impact of approx. EUR 3 million on an annualized basis.Proposals by the Nomination Board to the Annual General Meeting 2023 of Suominen (January 13  2023)Proposal on the number of the members  on the composition  and on the Chair of the Board of DirectorsThe Nomination Board of Suominen Corporation’s shareholders proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the number of Board members remains unchanged and would be six (6).The Nomination Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that Andreas Ahlström  Aaron Barsness  Björn Borgman  Jaakko Eskola and Nina Linander would be re-elected as members of the Board of Directors and that Laura Remes would be elected as a new member of the Board of Directors.Out of the current Board members  Laura Raitio has informed that she is no longer available as a candidate for the Board of Directors.Laura Remes (born 1980  M.Sc.

The Auditor’s report has been signed on February 2  2023. Quarterly information  half-year report and interim reports have not been audited.As result of rounding differences  the figures presented in the tables do not necessarily add up to total.ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLESThe consolidated financial statements of Suominen Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  including International Accounting Standards (IAS) and Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (SIC and IFRIC). International Financial Reporting Standards are standards and their interpretations adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The Notes to the Financial Statements are also in accordance with the Finnish Accounting Act and Ordinance and the Finnish Companies' Act.This financial statement release has been prepared in accordance with the principles defined in IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as approved by the European Union. Financial statement release does not include all information required for full financial statements.The principles for preparing consolidated financial statements are mainly the same as those used for preparing the consolidated financial statements for 2021. The new or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022 are presented below.New or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022:- Improvements to IFRS (2018–2020 cycle): Improvement to IFRS 9 – Fees in the ""10 percent"" Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities  applicable from January 1  2022. The amendment clarifies the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. The fees include only fees paid or received between the borrower and the lender.- Amendments to IAS 16 – Property  Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use  applicable from January 1  2022. The amendment prohibits companies deducting from the acquisition cost of an item of property  plant and equipment any proceeds of the sale of items produced while bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The sales proceeds of producing such items as well as the expenses of producing the items are to be recognized in profit or loss. The amendment was to be applied retrospectively. For Suominen  the amendment did not result in any restatement of previously published figures.Other new or amended standard  annual improvements or interpretations applicable from January 1  2022 were not material for Suominen Group.New and amended IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations published but mandatory from January 1  2023 or later:- Amendments to IAS 1 – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current  applicable from January 1  2024. The amendment specifies the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current  by clarifying for example what is meant by a right to defer settlement  that a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period and that classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right. The amendment will be applied retrospectively. The amendment has no effect on the consolidated financial statements of Suominen.- Disclosure of Accounting Policies – Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendment replaces the requirement to disclose ""significant"" accounting policies with a requirement to disclose ""material"" accounting policies. The amendment aims to help companies to disclose accounting policies  which are material for users to understand the information in the company's financial statements. The amendments require judgement in determining whether accounting policies are material or not. The amendment may have some effect on the disclosure of accounting policies in Suominen's consolidated financial statements  as the accounting principles presented in the consolidated financial statements will concentrate on presenting the accounting principles which are material for Suominen.- Definition of Accounting Estimates – Amendments to IAS 8  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendments clarify the distinction between the changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. The amendment clarifies that the effects on an accounting estimate of a change in an input or a change in a measurement technique are changes in accounting estimates if they do not result from the correction of prior period errors. The amendment does not have any material impact on Suominen's consolidated financial statements.- Amendments to IAS 12 – Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction  applicable from January 1  2023. The amendments are to be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.The amendment narrowed the scope of the initial recognition exception under IAS 12  so that it no longer applies to taxable and deductible temporary differences. The amendment clarifies deferred tax accounting for transactions and events  such as leases and decommissioning obligations that lead to the initial recognition of both an asset and a liability. The amendments require companies to recognize a separate deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability when the temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of an asset and a liability are equal.As in the most cases the deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from recognition of leases can be offset with each other  the amendment has not material effect on the consolidated statement of financial position of Suominen. The amendment will  however  change the disclosure information in the consolidated financial statements related to the deferred taxes.Other new or amended standards  improvements or annual improvements applicable from January 1  2023 or later are not material for Suominen Group.STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITIONEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Assets Non-current assets Goodwill 15 496 15

performance measures (cash flow from operations per share).Earnings per shareBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net result attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted share-issue adjusted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period  excluding shares acquired by the Group and held as treasury shares.When calculating diluted earnings per share the number of shares is adjusted with the effects of the share-based incentive plans.EUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Profit for the period -13 863 20 734 Average share-issue adjusted number of

30.8Alternative performance measuresSome of Suominen's key ratios are alternative performance measures. An alternative performance measure is a key ratio which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparison between the reporting periods.Operating profit and comparable operating profitOperating profit  or earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is an important measure of profitability as by ignoring income taxes and financial items it focuses solely on the company's ability to generate profit from operations. Operating profit is presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.In order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods  Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods. These items include  among others  impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses  gains or losses from the sales of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets or other assets and restructuring costs. Suominen did not have any items affecting comparability in 2021. In 2022  items affecting comparability of result were impairment losses of property  plant and equipment  right-of-use assets and inventory  arising from the planned closure of the production lines in Italy.Operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Operating profit -8 958 26 941 + Impairment losses of property  plant and equipment  affecting comparability of result 2 288 − + Impairment losses of right-of-use assets  affecting comparability of result 1 536 − + Impairment losses of inventories  affecting comparability of result 971 − Comparable operating profit -4 163 26 941EBITDA and comparable EBITDAEBITDA is an important measure that focuses on the operating performance excluding the effect of depreciation and amortization  financial items and income taxes  in other words what is the margin on net sales after deducting operating expenses.EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment lossesComparable EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment losses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Operating profit -8 958 26 941 + Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 23 245 20 092 EBITDA 14 287 47 033 EBITDA 14 287 47 033 + Impairment losses of inventories  affecting comparability of result 971 − Comparable EBITDA 15 257 47 033Gross capital expenditureSuominen considers gross capital expenditure as a relevant measure in order to understand for example how the Group maintains and renews its production machinery and facilities. Gross capital expenditure includes also capitalized borrowing costs and capitalized cash flow hedges. Gross capital expenditure (gross investments) does not include increases in right-of-use assets.EUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Increases in intangible assets 438 162 Increases in property  plant and equipment 9 275 17 609 Gross capital expenditure 9 713 17 771Interest-bearing net debtSuominen considers interest-bearing net debt to be an important measure for investors to be able to understand the Group’s indebtedness. It is the opinion of Suominen that presenting interest-bearing liabilities not only at amortized cost but also at nominal value gives relevant additional information to the investors.Interest-bearing net debt = Interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value - interest-bearing receivables - cash and cash equivalentsEUR thousand 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 Interest-bearing liabilities 103 365 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 705 1 794 Cash and cash equivalents -49 508 -101 357 Interest-bearing net debt 54 562 49 570 Interest-bearing liabilities 103 365 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 705 1 794 Nominal value of interest-bearing liabilities 104 069 150 927Return on equity (ROE)  %The return on equity is one of the most important profitability ratios used by owners and investors.

(“Cellectis” or the “Company”) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage...,Cellectis Inc.NEW YORK  Feb. 02  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cellectis S.A. (“Cellectis” or the “Company”) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies  announces the pricing of its previously announced underwritten global offering by way of a capital increase of 8 800 000 American Depositary Shares (“ADS”)  each representing the right to receive one ordinary share of Cellectis  nominal value €0.05 per share (the “Global Offering”)  comprised of a public offering of ADS in the United States of America only and a private placement in other countries including in European Union member States exclusively to “qualified investors” within the meaning of Article 2(e) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129  as amended (the “Prospectus Regulation”)  which launched on February 2  2023  at a price to the public of $2.50 per ADS. The aggregate net proceeds to be received by Cellectis from the sale of ADSs in the Global Offering are expected to be approximately $20.2 million  equivalent to approximately €18.5 million  after deducting the estimated expenses related to the Global Offering and the underwriting commissions payable by Cellectis. The closing of the Global Offering is expected to occur on or about February 7  2023  subject to customary closing conditions.Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. are acting as joint book-running managers for the Global Offering.Cellectis plans to use (i) approximately $17.0 million (€15.6 million) of the net proceeds of the Global Offering to fund the continued clinical development of UCART 123  UCART22  UCART20x22  and UCARTCS1  and (ii) any remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.Based on the planned use of proceeds from the Global Offering  Cellectis believes that its cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations (including payments it expects to receive pursuant to collaboration agreements and anticipated government funding of research programs  but excluding any potential borrowings under the Company’s finance contract with European Investment Bank) will be sufficient to fund Cellectis’ operations into Q2 2024.Story continuesThe listing of Cellectis’ ordinary shares on Euronext Growth in Paris will be suspended on February 3  2023 until the opening of trading of Cellectis’ ADSs on the Nasdaq Global Market at 3:30 pm (Paris time)/ 9:30 a.m. (New York time)  prior to which Cellectis will publish the allocation of share capital to be effective following settlement and delivery of the ADSs sold in the Global Offering. The 8 800 000 ADSs to be issued in the Global Offering will result in a dilution of approximately 16.2% of Cellectis’ outstanding share capital as of September 30  2022 on a non-diluted basis excluding the exercise of the option granted to the Underwriters to purchase additional ADSs and approximately 18.2% of Cellectis’ outstanding share capital as of September 30  2022 on a non-diluted basis in the case of a full exercise of the option granted to the Underwriters to purchase additional ADSs. On an illustrative basis  a shareholder holding 1% of Cellectis’s capital before the Global Offering will now hold a stake of 0.84% excluding the exercise of the option granted to the Underwriters to purchase additional ADSs.The ordinary shares underlying the ADS offered in the Global Offering will be subject to an application for admission to trading on Euronext Growth in Paris on the same trading line as the existing ordinary shares under the same ISIN code FR0010425595 and under the ticker “ALCLS” and are expected to start trading on or about February 7  2023.The offering price of $2.50 per ADS  corresponding to an offering price of €2.29 per ordinary share (based on an exchange rate of €1.00 = $1.0914 as published by Bloomberg on February 2  2023)  is equal to the volume weighted average price of Cellectis’ ordinary shares on Euronext Growth in Paris over the last three trading sessions preceding the pricing of the Global Offering (i.e.  January 31 and February 1 and 2  2023)  minus a discount of 20%  and has been determined by Cellectis pursuant to the 17th resolution of Cellectis  which was approved at the combined meeting of the Company's shareholders held on June 28  2022.In connection with the Global Offering  Cellectis granted Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Underwriters”) a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1 320 000 ADSs representing 15% of the Global Offering size and on the same terms and conditions.In connection with the Global Offering  Jefferies LLC  acting as stabilization agent  may effect transactions with a view to supporting  stabilizing  or maintaining the market price of the ADSs at a level higher than which might otherwise prevail in the open market for Cellectis’ ADSs. However  there is no assurance that the stabilization agent will take any stabilization action and  if begun  such action may be ended at any time without prior notice. Any stabilization action or over-allotment shall be carried out in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations and may be undertaken on the Nasdaq Global Market.The ADSs are being offered pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form F-3 (Registration No. 333-265826)  which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 24  2022 and subsequently declared effective on July 7  2022. The Global Offering is being made only by means of a prospectus and prospectus supplement that form a part of the registration statement. A preliminary prospectus supplement relating to and describing the terms of the Global Offering has been filed with the SEC on February 2  2023 and is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. The final prospectus supplement relating to the Global Offering will be filed with the SEC. When available  copies of the final prospectus supplement (and accompanying prospectus) relating to the Global Offering may be obtained from Jefferies LLC  Attention: Equity Syndicate Prospectus Department  520 Madison Avenue  2nd Floor  New York  NY 10022 or by telephone at (877) 821-7388 or by email at Prospectus_Department@Jefferies.com; or Barclays Capital Inc.  c/o Broadridge Financial Solutions  1155 Long Island Avenue  Edgewood  NY 11717  or by telephone (888) 603-5847 or by email at Barclaysprospectus@broadridge.com The preliminary prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus  together with the documents incorporated by reference therein do not include any inside information (as defined under Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 16  2014 on market abuse as amended (MAR)).This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities  nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

Smith has had to beat a hasty retreat.What is even more startling is that the UK's flagship consumer good group Unilever  which trades under the banner of making 'sustainable living commonplace'  has stayed open in Russia during the last year of grisly warfare.The maker of Dove soap  Hellmann's mayonnaise and Magnum ice cream has earned an estimated £500million since the start of the conflict.Unilever has a big presence in Russia  with 3 500 employees and four major production facilities. It has maintained that it didn't want to damage the welfare of its staff.Yet there is no escaping the fact that by keeping Russia supplied with hygiene and other products  the group is making life more comfortable for the aggressors in a blood-stained conflict.Continued presence is a direct affront to Unilever's image as apostles of ethical investing. In contrast to Unilever's pussyfooting  some of the great names of capitalism showed little hesitation in pulling out.Links: Goldman Sachs had a thriving investment banking arm in Russia  reaching deep into the country's commerceGoldman Sachs had a thriving investment banking arm in Russia  reaching deep into the country's commerce. It moved rapidly to sever ties with the rest of Goldman and the financial system  and the rump was bought out by local managers.Western sanctions may have hurt living standards in Moscow  but have not brought the country to its knees.When they were first imposed  it was thought that financial measures such as cutting off Putin from the Swift money transfer system and the Western banks would bring his kleptocracy to its knees.Banking sanctions finally brought the apartheid regime in South Africa to its senses. The big difference is that Pretoria was under siege from both the West and the non-aligned world.Putin has forged an alliance of the disgruntled which reinforces still unquenched territorial ambition.City slickersA widely held view when Britain left the EU was that the ability of the City to exercise influence over financial trading in Europe would be diminished.The EU was desperate to ditch the Anglo-Saxon model. Among other things  it proposed a clampdown on dark trading – or pools which allow critical players such as big battalion investors to deal without disclosing details until they are completed. Brussels looks to have decided that if you can't beat them  join them.Just a few weeks ago  Euronext chiefs were making dubious claims about having overtaken the London Stock Exchange for share trading.In an interview with the journal The Trade  Simon Gallagher  Euronext's head of cash and derivatives  concedes: 'The weight of the Financial Conduct Authority and the City in European regulation has never been greater. Post-Brexit the City is defining the rules of Continental Europe more than ever before.'The government view – that of all the economy's sectors  the Square Mile was fit enough to swim on its own – is being vindicated.Lotus positionRemember Lotus? Colin Chapman's Norfolk-based racing and fast cars were seen as a triumph of British engineering.But like so many brilliant UK car marques  it failed commercially and ended up in the hands of China  with the advanced engineering – some of which inspired the Tesla Roadster – remaining on these shores.There are now plans to float Lotus Technology in New York with a heady valuation of £4.4billion.What that will mean for Lotus UK  the brains and heritage behind the brand  is anyone's guess.

We’ve stretched our cash runway by divesting our manufacturing business unit  and discontinued our clinical programs to focus on selected  critical R&D efforts to mitigate the current limitations of CAR T-cell therapy. We believe we are now well-positioned to unleash the power of our IP estate and to help making the cell therapy approach a success.”Operational highlightsThe Company announced a strategic shift in October 2022 to prioritize discovery research in areas of expertise where it can leverage the differentiated nature of its platforms. The Company has implemented a differentiated and innovative strategy  which it believes has the potential to tackle the major current limitations of CAR T-cell therapies. This strategy includes a multiplexing approach of the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) platform  a dual CAR development of a next-generation NKG2D-based CAR  and the development of B7-H6-targeting immunotherapies.In October 2022  the Company decided to discontinue the development of CYAD-101  the allogeneic TIM-based  NKG2D-based CAR T-cell candidate for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)  based on a strategic  financial and medical review  taking into account the costs associated with the pursuit of the program. There were no new safety concerns leading to this decision. The clinical hold announced in March 2022 on the CYAD-101-002 Phase 1b trial had been lifted in July 2022 by the FDA.Data collected in the IMMUNICY-1 trial of the clinical program CYAD-211  the allogeneic shRNA-based  anti-BCMA CAR T candidate for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM)  which was developed to validate shRNA technology in the clinic  have shown a favorable safety profile for CYAD-211 across all dose-levels and cohorts  with 19 patients treated in total. The lack of observed graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) despite engraftment of CYAD-211 provided proof-of-concept for the use of shRNA as a technology to control GvHD of allogeneic CAR T-cells.In December 2022  the Company decided to discontinue the development of its remaining clinical program CYAD-211 based on a strategic and financial review. There were no safety concerns leading to this decision and all patients previously treated with CYAD-211 still continue to receive their protocol-defined follow-up.Corporate highlightsIn September 2022  the Company entered into a €6 million asset purchase agreement with Cellistic  the cell therapy development and manufacturing business of Ncardia BV  whereby Cellistic acquired Celyad Oncology’s Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade cell therapy manufacturing business unit.Since October 2022  the Company has implemented a strategic shift from an organization focused on clinical development to one prioritizing R&D discovery and leveraging its IP estate through partnerships  collaborations and license agreements. The Company has compiled a foundational and broad IP estate that controls key aspects of developing therapies in the allogeneic cell therapy space. The patents around allogeneic CAR T-cell therapies and NKG2D-based therapies provide an avenue to develop intellectual property programs and to partner with outside parties around the licensing of these patents.Financial highlightsAs of December 31  2022  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €12.4 million ($13.3 million). Net cash burn during the fourth quarter of 2022 amounted to €1.0 million  in line with expectations. The Company projects that its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the fourth quarter of 2023.After due consideration of detailed budgets and estimated cash flow forecasts for the year 2023  which reflect the new strategy of the Company and include expenses and cash outflows estimations in relation to the development of its proprietary technology platforms and intellectual property  the Company continues to project that its existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund its estimated operating and capital expenditures over at least the next 12 months from the date that this release is issued.Outlook for 2023Celyad Oncology is increasing its R&D efforts on areas of expertise where it believes it can leverage the differentiated nature of its platform technology and continue to bolster its IP estate. The Company will continue to leverage the dynamic potential of the shRNA platform  and to explore options to tackle the major current limitations of CAR T-cell therapies through its dual targeting CARs with NKG2D capabilities and B7-H6 targeting cell therapies.The Company will provide updates on the potential proof-of-concept of the dual CAR and multiplexing research programs and on business development in the course of 2023 and will take part in several conferences to share these data.Financial Calendar 2023• March 23rd  2023 Full Year 2022 Financial Results • May 5th  2023 First Quarter 2023 Business Update • May 5th  2023 Annual shareholders meeting • August 3rd  2023 First Half 2023 Interim Results • November 9th  2023 Third Quarter 2023 Business UpdateThe financial calendar is communicated on an indicative basis and may be subject to change.About Celyad OncologyCelyad Oncology is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of innovative technologies chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies.

17781,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/cyberattack-on-ion-trading-uk-sends-derivatives-trading-back-to-1980s-123020301086_1.html,Cyberattack on ION Trading UK sends derivatives trading back to 1980s,Derivatives shops  used to clearing hundreds of billions of dollars in trades every day  found themselves in a dramatically different era this week: the old days of manually processing deals,Derivatives shops  used to clearing hundreds of billions of dollars in trades every day  found themselves in a dramatically different era this week: the old days of manually processing deals.Early Tuesday morning in Europe  a little known but critically important software company that underpins the smooth functioning of stock  bond and commodities started to seize up. London-based ION Trading had succumbed to a cyberattack.Suddenly  in offices across the globe  traders and brokers turned to spreadsheets to keep track of their deals  firms resorted to inputting individual trades on websites provided by exchanges  and employees explained to their families why they were going into work at night  according to people with a view of the scene.It was like being back in the 1980s  before electronic trading took off  or in the 1990s  when the web was just starting to change the world. But there was a key difference — the banks and brokers handling client trades on bourses including Intercontinental Exchange Inc.  CME Group Inc. and Cboe Global no longer have hordes of employees ensuring deals are confirmed  processed and settled.“The cyberattack on ION reminds us all that despite best efforts by any organization to protect itself  these issues will occur  and market participants need to be continuously vigilant and prepared for such instances ” said Joseph Schifano  head of regulatory affairs at Eventus  a trade surveillance software firm.For the derivatives market  it was a slap in the face. Not only did companies lack adequate staff to meet the crisis  but many of the workers were too young to know how to keep operations afloat. It was also the second time in just one week that a major market had been humbled. A human error at the New York Stock Exchange set off violent price swings at the start of trading on Jan. 24.Banks and other financial firms frequently label cyber risk as among those they fear most — as the interconnectedness of the financial system has the potential to amplify the ramifications from any attack. Both incidents also underscored how vital the plumbing underpinning trading processes can be  and that however sophisticated they may be  vulnerabilities lurk.Attack ConfirmedION first noticed an issue was preventing access to some of its systems at 2:30 a.m. London time. It took the Dublin-based firm — founded by Italian tycoon Andrea Pignataro — more than five hours to confirm the attack by Russian ransomware gang LockBit  according to correspondence from ION seen by Bloomberg.It wasn’t long before the 42 ION clients affected started reporting difficulties. The US clearing arm of Dutch lender ABN Amro Bank NV sent out a note to clients saying the attack would delay overnight processing  and that it was being forced to deal with transactions manually. StoneX Financial said it was taking “alternative measures” to clear trades and prioritizing expiring contracts. Marex Group resorted to providing clients “indicative” values of transactions in their accounts.On the London Metal Exchange — one of the last venues in the world where trading still takes place face to face — the return to manual processing was familiar for many veteran brokers  but it also provided an opportunity for younger staff to prove their technological prowess.When ION’s systems went down  a team of coders at one London brokerage scrambled to build their own ad-hoc system to match off clients’ trades  and they had it up and running within hours  according to one person familiar with the matter.Liquidity ThreatBut while those types of creative efforts have helped to mitigate the fallout so far  the challenges are growing as the crisis rolls on. Informally  the London brokerage has warned the LME that it expects dealers to reduce activity because of friction in processing trades  reducing liquidity  the person said.Fear of contagion prompted the Futures Industry Association to hold over half a dozen calls over multiple days to give members a chance to talk through the situation and share relevant information. More than 600 people dialed in to one of these calls. Some were clients of ION  directly impacted by the attack. Others discussed potential ripple effects.A spokesman for ION declined to comment on whether it had taken part in the FIA calls.By the end of the day on Tuesday  neither the FIA nor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission — the top US derivatives regulator — disclosed or could confirm how many firms had been affected and how much money was locked up in trades handled by ION  said people who took part in the calls and asked not to be identified  citing confidentiality.The software company never joined the discussion  the people said.The outage  which is still ongoing  affected vital processes including the matching of trades  the calculation of margin calls and regulatory reporting on large market positions. That left many clients in the dark about whether they were making or losing money  and prompted calls for more collateral  the people said.It was only then that customers found out there was a problem  with many more only discovering it when Bloomberg News reported the event on Wednesday morning  one of the people said.‘Isolated’ ProblemOn Wednesday  CME  Intercontinental Exchange and Cboe said that their members had experienced issues with a third-party software vendor. Those issues could affect the timing of publishing exchange reports by the end of the day  the firms said. The London Metal Exchange and Euronext also acknowledged that some of its clients had been affected.“The LME has been closely monitoring liquidity across all venues since the incident occurred  and has not yet seen any evidence of liquidity being affected ” the exchange said in an emailed statement. “We continue to work closely with affected members to help them continue their business as normally as possible  and reduce any wider impact.”The issue is “currently isolated to a small number of smaller and midsize firms  and does not pose a systemic risk to the financial sector ” according to a statement from Todd Conklin  deputy assistant secretary of the US Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection.Regulators in the UK  including the Financial Conduct Authority  started an investigation into the incident  according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also seeking information on the cyberattack and reached out to ION executives  people familiar with the matter said. The agency is aware of the situation  it said in a statement.On Thursday evening  the CFTC said the incident was impacting the ability of some clearing members to provide it with accurate data and that it would delay its weekly trading report for the derivatives market until all trades can be reported.ION told clients on Thursday that its systems won’t be fully operational until Feb. 5  and the firm still hasn’t been able to start several crucial recovery steps  according to email correspondence seen by Bloomberg. The firm also told broker StoneX that it has brought in “multiple industry leading security firms to assist in their investigations and remediation plans ” according to a copy of the memo sent to clients.LockBiton  the group behind the attack  threatened on Thursday to publish “all available data” that it claimed to have stolen from ION on their website on the dark web unless the derivatives trading platform paid an unspecified ransom by February 4.It’s unclear if ION paid or plans to pay the ransom  and the industry is still just getting to grips with the ripple effects the incident may have. Beyond clients who are directly affected  banks and brokers that are trading with them aren’t able to match off trades.The result for now is that derivative shops are turning the clock back by years in an impromptu test of their middle and back offices.(Updates to add detail on ransom demand in third to last paragraph.)--With assistance from Natasha Doff  Lydia Beyoud  Jenny Surane  Yvonne Yue Li  Marvin G.

(Operator Instructions). After today's presentation  there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions). Please note this event is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to Larry Bruno  Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.Larry Bruno: Thanks  Drew. Good morning in the Americas  good afternoon in Europe  Africa and the Middle East  and good evening in Asia-Pacific. We'd like to welcome all of our shareholders  analysts  and most importantly  our employees  to Core Laboratories' fourth quarter 2022 earnings call.This morning  I'm joined by Chris Hill  Core's Chief Financial Officer  and Gwen Gresham  Core's Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations.The call will be divided into six segments. Gwen will start by making remarks regarding forward-looking statements. We'll then have some opening comments  including a high-level review of important factors in Core's Q4 and full year 2022 performance. In addition  we'll review Core's strategies and the three financial tenets that the company employs to build long-term shareholder value.Chris will then give a detailed financial overview and have additional comments regarding shareholder value. Following Chris  Gwen will provide some comments on the company's outlook and guidance.I'll then review Core's two operating segments  detailing our progress and discussing the continued successful introduction and deployment of Core Labs' technologies  as well as highlighting some of Core's operations and major projects worldwide. Then we'll open the phones for a Q&A session.I'll now turn the call over to Gwen for remarks on forward-looking statements.Gwen Gresham: Before we start the conference this morning  I'll mention that some of the statements we make during this call may include projections  estimates and other forward-looking information. This would include any discussion of the company's business outlook. These types of forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in our most recentannual report on Form 10-K  as well as other reports and registration statements filed by us with the SEC and the AFM.We undertake no obligation to publicly update or to revise any forward-looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise.Our comments also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release announcing our fourth quarter results. Those non-GAAP measures can also be found on our website.With that said  I'll pass the discussion back to Larry.Larry Bruno: Thanks  Gwen. For the fourth quarter of 2022  Core Lab achieved sequential improvement in revenue  operating income  operating margins and EPS with strong incremental margins. These improvements translated into higher free cash flow  which enabled the company to reduce net debt by $11.7 million or 7%.We remained focused on executing our key financial strategies including reducing debt and strengthening our balance sheet. For the full year 2022  revenue was $490 million  increasing by more than 4% compared to 2021. However  for 2022  revenue for the full year was adversely impacted by currency devaluation of the Euro and British pound. Using a constant dollar exchange rate  2022 revenue would've been nearly $13 million higher.For the full company  operating margins for the fourth quarter grew to 12%  up from 11% in Q3. Full company sequential incremental margins ex-items exceeded 80%  driven by a strong quarter in production enhancement.Reservoir Description margins lagged after 2 successive quarters with very high incrementals  reflecting adverse impacts from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The Russia-Ukraine conflict posed a headwind to revenue in the fourth quarter and throughout most of 2022  as trading patterns for crude oil and derived products were disrupted in Europe  Russia and Ukraine. For 2022  demand for laboratory services tied to the assay of crude oil and derived products in these regions declined in excess of $9 million year-over-year  offsetting growth in other international regions.Lastly  for the full company  quarter-over-quarter  EPS grew sequentially by 11% to $0.20 per share ex-items.As we look ahead  Core will continue to execute on its key strategic objectives by  one  introducing new product and service offerings in key geographic markets; two  maintaining a lean and focused organization; and three  maintaining our commitment to delevering the company.Now to review Core Lab's strategies and the financial tenets that Core has used to build shareholder value over our 27-plus-year history as a publicly-traded company. The interests of our shareholders  clients  and employees will always be well served by Core Lab's resilient culture  which relies on innovation  leveraging technology to solve problems and dedicated customer service. I'll talk more about some of our latest innovations in the operational review section of this call.While we navigate through the current challenges and pursue growth opportunities  the company will remain focused on its three longstanding  long-term financial tenets; those being to maximize free cash flow  maximize return on invested capital  and returning excess free cash to our shareholders.Before moving on  I want to thank our employees for their dedication  loyalty and adaptability in meeting all of our clients' needs  and for the commitment that many have shown as we navigate the moment and prepare for a more active market.I'll now turn it over to Chris for the detailed financial review.Chris Hill: Thanks  Larry. I would like to begin by highlighting a couple of announcements we made since our last call. As you may be aware  the company's shares were previously dual-listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Euronext Amsterdam Exchange. However  as we rationalize benefits versus the cost of maintaining the dual listing  we decided to delist the shares from the Amsterdam Exchange  which became effective in early December of last year. In following the delisting of the shares on January 17 of this year  we announced our plan to reorganize the company's corporate structure  which includes re-domesticating the parent company from the Netherlands to the United States. The company and its Board believes that re-domestication will enhance long-term shareholder value by reducing administrative costs  simplifying the corporate structure  as well as gaining some operational efficiencies.The company filed a preliminary prospectus and proxy statement associated with the re-domestication  which will require shareholder approval. We anticipate the re-domestication transaction will be completed sometime in the first half of this year.Before we review the financial performance for the quarter  the guidance we gave on our last call and past calls specifically excluded the impact of any FX gains or losses  and assumed an effective tax rate of 20%. So accordingly  our discussion today excludes any foreign exchange gain or loss for current and prior periods.Additionally  the GAAP financial results for the fourth quarter include a non-cash adjustment of $1.9 million  which decreased stock compensation expense associated with performance share awards  which vested during the quarter. This adjustment has also been excluded from the discussion of our fourth quarter and full year results.Now  looking at the income statement  revenue from continuing operations was $127.6 million in the fourth quarter  up slightly from $126 million in the prior quarter. The sequential increase in revenue was driven by growth in both the U.S. and international markets. However  nice growth in multiple international regions has been partially offset by continued disruptions caused by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict  which adversely impacted service revenue in the affected regions.Of this revenue  service revenue  which is more international  was $88.9 million for the quarter  up from $87.9 million last quarter.During the quarter  we saw nice sequential growth of 11% in the U.S.  which was led by our laboratory services and well diagnostic services. We also see nice sequential improvement in multiple international regions outside the areas impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However  the Russia-Ukraine conflict has continued to disrupt the trading patterns and flow of oil in the affected regions.The realignment of these trading patterns still continues  and the realignment of these trading patterns has not been consistent or linear. For example  in Europe  our crude oil assay activity increased during the third quarter  but activity decreased again in the fourth quarter. The company believes these trading patterns will become more stable throughout 2023. And we will continue to monitor the changes to the trading patterns and appropriately adapt our operations accordingly.For the full year of 2022  service revenue of $347 million was relatively flat compared to $344.3 million in 2021.As Larry mentioned  two main factors have adversely impacted our international revenue by over $20 million in 2022: the devaluation of certain currencies  primarily the Euro and British pound  and disruption caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict that we just discussed.Product sales  which is equally tied to North America and international activity  were $38.6 million for the quarter  up slightly compared to $38.1 million last quarter. International product sales for the quarter were up 15% sequentially  and our energetic sales to the U.S. market were also up sequentially. However  this growth was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $2 million in other product sales.For the full year of 2022  product sales revenue was $142.8 million  was up 13% from $125.9 million in 2021.Moving on to the cost of services ex-items for the quarter are 78% of service revenue  which is comparable to last quarter. The service side of our business has been more impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Although we see improvements in absorption of costs and nice incremental margins in regions where activity is expanding  these gains are being offset by disruption to the business in other regions more directly impacted by the conflict.Cost of sales ex-items in the fourth quarter was 79% of revenue and improved from 82% last quarter. The improvement this quarter was primarily driven by gains in manufacturing efficiencies and higher international sales. Manufacturing costs continue to increase due to inflation on materials and other operating costs. However  some of the impact has been mitigated through gains in manufacturing efficiencies and some improvement in pricing.G&A ex-items for the quarter was $10.4 million  relatively flat compared to last quarter. For the full year of 2022  G&A ex-items was $39.3 million  up from $37 million in 2021 due to restoration of employee compensation and benefits. For 2023  we expect G&A to be approximately $40 million to $42 million.Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $4.1 million and comparable to last quarter. For the full year  depreciation and amortization expense was $17.2 million  down from $18.5 million in 2021.EBIT ex-items for the quarter was $14.7 million  up 10% from $13.3 million last quarter  and representing an EBIT margin of approximately 12%  which is also up from 11% last quarter. Operating income for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis was $15.6 million. And for the full year of 2022  EBIT ex-items was $44.8 million  down from $52.3 million in the prior year; and on a GAAP basis  EBIT was $41.5 million for 2022 and $45.3 million in 2021.Interest expense was $3.1 million and comparable to last quarter  and interest expense ex-items for the full year was $11.4 million  up slightly from $11 million in 2021. Although interest rates have significantly increased throughout 2022  the company has substantially offset the impact of this increase by reducing our outstanding debt. On a GAAP basis  interest expense for the full year of 2022 was $11.6 million  up from $9.2 million in 2021  as 2021 interest expense included a $1.4 million gain associated with settling some of our interest rate hedges last year.Income tax expense  ex-items and using an effective tax rate of 20% for the quarter  was $2.3 million. On a GAAP basis  the company recorded income tax expense of $5.8 million for the quarter. And for the full year  income tax expense was $10.3 million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 34% for 2022.However  income tax expense was significantly increased in 2022 due to the devaluation of foreign currencies  primarily Turkey and the United Kingdom  which we discussed in prior quarters. Excluding the impact associated with the devaluation of the Turkish lira and British pound  the company's effective tax rate would've been approximately 18%. The effective tax rate will continue to be somewhat sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings across the globe and the impact of items discrete to each quarter.However  we continue to project the company's effective tax rate to be approximately 20%.Income from continuing operations ex-items for the quarter was $9.3 million  up 11% sequentially from $8.3 million last quarter. For the full year 2022 ex-items  it was $26.8 million  down from $33 million in 2021. GAAP income from continuing operations for the quarter was $6.7 million and for the full year 2022 was $19.7 million.Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations ex-items was $0.20 for the quarter  up from $0.18 last quarter  and was $0.57 for the full year of 2022. GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $0.14 for the quarter and $0.42 for the full year.Now  moving on to the balance sheet  receivables were $106.9 million at December 31  up $6.7 million from last quarter-end.Our DSOs for the fourth quarter were at 70 days  also up when compared to 67 days last quarter. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of billings during the quarter and a slightly higher mix of international revenue  which generally has a longer collection period.Inventory finished the year at $60.4 million  up approximately $5.6 million from last quarter-end. Inventory turns for the quarter were at 2.1  down from 2.3 in the last quarter  and primarily down due to shipping delays postponing some larger international sales into 2023.As previously highlighted  the company continues to experience an increase in cost of raw materials  labor  packaging and transportation costs  which are increasing the cost of inventory. Additionally  challenges in the supply chain persist  which will continue to require carrying a larger amount of inventory to help mitigate disruptions. We anticipate inventory turns will remain at similar levels  but we have a focused effort for improvement as we progress into 2023.On the liability side of the balance sheet  our long-term debt was $175 million at December 31  and was reduced by $10 million this quarter. Our debt is currently comprised of our senior notes at $135 million  as well as $40 million outstanding under our bank revolving credit facility.As Larry mentioned earlier  our free cash flow has also improved  as the company's financial performance has improved the last couple of quarters. Our free cash flow continues to be focused on reducing outstanding debt. Considering cash of $15.4 million  our net debt was $159.6 million at year-end  a reduction of $11.7 million this quarter  which also improved our leverage ratio to 2.29 from 2.42 at last quarter-end.Since announcing the company's commitment and focus on reducing debt in the fourth quarter of 2019  we have reduced net debt by 46%. The company will continue applying free cash towards reducing debt  so the company reaches its target leverage ratio of 1.5 or lower.Looking at cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2022  cash flow from operating activities was $13.2 million. And after paying for $2 million of CapEx  our free cash flow was $11.2 million for the quarter. Our free cash flow generated this quarter is the highest we have achieved since the third quarter of 2020. Lookingforward to 2023  we expect CapEx to modestly expand  and will continue to remain in line with historical levels  but also be aligned with activity levels.For the full year of 2023  we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $12 million to $15 million  which is an increase from $10.2 million in 2022.Core will continue our strict capital discipline and asset-light business model  with capital expenditures primarily targeted at growth opportunities and initiatives. Core Lab's operational leverage continues to provide for the ability to grow revenue and profitability with minimal capital requirements. Capital expenditures have historically ranged from 2.5% to 4% of revenue  even during periods of significant growth. That same level of laboratory infrastructure  intellectual property  and leverage exists in the business today.We believe evaluating a company's ability to generate free cash flow and free cash flow yield is an important metric for shareholders when comparing and projecting companies' financial results  particularly for those shareholders who utilize discounted cash flow models to assess valuations.I will now turn it over to Gwen for an update on our guidance and outlook.Gwen Gresham: Thank you  Chris. Looking forward into 2023  we see crude oil macro fundamentals continuing to support a multiyear recovery cycle for the oil and gas industry. Crude oil demand for 2023  as forecasted by the International Energy Agency in January of this year  is projected to increase by 1.9 million barrels per day to a record 101.7 million barrels per day  as consumption in China grows along with the reopening of its economy.As crude oil demand is projected to exceed pre-Covid levels  crude oil supply is projected to tighten. Production growth continues to face constraints due to prolonged under-investment in many regions around the globe  as well as natural decline of production from existing fields. As a result  we expect operators to expand their upstream spending plans for 2023 by mid-teens compared to 2022. This supports our continued improvement in international onshore and offshore activity with projects emerging and underway  most notably across the Middle East  Latin America and West Africa regions.Moving on to the U.S.  we see similar challenges with crude oil supply  which should require increased spending by operators to grow and replace production. While operators remain focused on capital discipline  2023 forecasts indicate their U.S. upstream spending will increase by approximately 15% year-over-year.Turning to the first quarter of 2023  we anticipate Reservoir Description to be down low-to-mid-single-digits sequentially. There are two factors causing the sequential decline in revenue. First  the typical seasonal industry pattern  which will cause activity in the first quarter to decline in some regions  and second  continued volatility with crude oil trading patterns  which may impact Reservoir Description's international growth within its Russian  Ukrainian and European operations. Helping to offset these revenue headwinds  we will see an increase in international upstream project activity  which is currently underway.For Production Enhancement  revenue is estimated to be up mid-single-digits as U.S. land activity is projected to recover from normal seasonal declines experienced at year-end. We project first quarter 2023 revenue to range from $125 million to $129 million  and operating income of $11.5 million to $14.5 million  yielding operating margins of approximately 10%.EPS for the first quarter is expected to range from $0.14 to $0.19.The company's first quarter guidance is based on projections for underlying operations  and excludes gains and losses in foreign exchange. First quarter guidance also assumes an effective tax rate of 20%.Now  I'll pass the discussion back to Larry.Larry Bruno: Thanks  Gwen. First  I'd like to thank our global team of employees for providing innovative solutions  integrity and superior service to our clients. The team's collective dedication to servicing our clients is the foundation of Core Lab's success.Turning first to Reservoir Description  for the fourth quarter of 2022  revenue came in at just over $78 million  down slightly compared to Q3. When looking at revenue growth for Reservoir Description  it is important to consider the sharp devaluation of the Euro and the British pound. These currency devaluations lowered Reservoir Description revenue for the full year by more than $12 million using 2021 exchange rates.Operating income for Reservoir Description ex-items was $6 million  and operating margins were 8%. Growth across most regions was offset by impacts from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Demand for crude oil and derived product assay work across Europe  Russia and Ukraine  which rebounded somewhat during Q3  subsequently slowed in Q4 as sanctions became formalized. As previously discussed  we expect continued volatility and demand for these laboratory services as global trading patterns realign.However  as Gwen mentioned  the International Energy Agency recently forecast crude oil demand for 2023 to average a record high 101.7 million barrels per day  up by 1.9 million barrels per day from 2022  even after assessing global financial forecasts. This bodes well for growing demand for Reservoir Description's assay work.As we look ahead  while still well below pre-Covid levels  we see the growing international rig count as a harbinger of an improving landscape for Reservoir Description  a trend that we project will play out for the next several years  particularly in the Middle East  North and South America and most other regions.Early movers in the oilfield service sector that are more exposed to well construction have already felt the impact of this cycle shift. As projects progress into field appraisal  field development and eventually  production  demand for Core Lab's Reservoir Description services will rise accordingly.Now for some operational highlights from the fourth quarter. Core Lab's Reservoir Description services were employed on both U.S. and international projects to help our clients evaluate their assets and develop programs to optimize production. Under the direction of a South American national oil company  Core Lab conducted a series of enhanced oil recovery and flow assurance studies for a multi-well onshore program as evaluating the use of CO2-rich injection gases. This laboratory work is determining the impact of blending these CO2-rich gases with existing reservoir fluids  and are providing the basis for advanced equation-of-state modeling.While defining the gas injection parameters for a successful field application are critical to improving crude oil recoveries  operators must also assess the potential for the injected CO2 to unintendedly cause flocculation of asphaltenes. These long-chain asphaltene molecules can clog pores in the rock and impair permeability  thus  reducing the effectiveness of CO2 injection programs. Broadly  CO2 injection projects like this reflect a globally expanding interest in enhanced oil recovery and carbon capture and storage technologies. When properly evaluated with rigorous laboratory testing  injecting CO2 into hydrocarbon-bearing subsurface formations can simultaneously improve oil recovery and reduce CO2 emissions.Also  during the fourth quarter of 2022  Core completed an integrated study on conventional core from a Lower Barnett shale pilot well in the Permian Basin. The key objectives of the study were to evaluate the resource potential of the strata  and identify landing zone targets that will optimize stimulation and hydrocarbon production. Core analysis data acquired from the pilot well was benchmarked against key performance indicators from 21 wells in Core Lab's proprietary Woodford-Barnett joint industry project to provide insights into future production potential in the play.Core applied its new proprietary prism mudstone laboratory workflow  which combines advanced petrophysical and geochemical technologies  including measurements from high frequency  nuclear magnetic resonance and multi-rate pyrolysis to also provide rapid assessment of mobile versus non-mobile hydrocarbons in the rocks. The Prism workflow also refined petrophysical models and allowed for refined calibration of downhole logs  which in turn  resulted in an increase in both calculated reserves and estimated ultimate recovery.Moving now to Production Enhancement  where Core Lab's technologies continue to help our clients optimize their well completions  revenue for Production Enhancement came in at $49 million  up 5% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year. Operating income ex-items was $7.7 million  while operating margins were 16% for the fourth quarter of 2022  and sequential margins were more than 100%.During the fourth quarter of 2022  Core Lab continued to build on the success of its X-SPAN casing and tubing patch technology. The industry-leading versatility and reliability of the X-SPAN system yield significant savings in the remediation of all types of wells with casing damage  ranging from oil and gas producers through to disposal and geothermal wells.Recently  an operator in Alaska had casing leaks in a horizontal water disposal well at four different depths over a 5 000-foot interval. If the disposal well were to become unavailable  hydrocarbon production from nearby oil and gas wells would need to be severely curtailed. Remedial steps that would have otherwise required a workover rig would have been both costly and time-consuming.Instead  Core Lab's experts recommended placing four separate X-SPAN patches via wireline with a configuration that would enable operations in this highly-deviated wellbore. All four patches were successfully deployed  set on depth and the well passed the mandatory mechanical integrity tests required by state authorities. This allowed the disposal operation to continue. Rigless intervention to repair the well with X-SPAN resulted in significant cost savings  and enabled the nearby producing wells to maintain hydrocarbon output. To date  Core Lab has run over 100 000 feet of proprietary casing and tubing patches. The X-SPAN system has a proven track record of reliability  and is one of the most effective solutions of its type.That concludes our operational review. We appreciate your participation. And Drew will now open the call for questions.Questions and AnswersOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Samantha Hoh with Evercore ISI.Samantha Hoh: I wanted to maybe dig in a little bit in just the contrast of the two projects that you highlighted in RD. It's kind of interesting that in Latin America  you guys are doing all this work on EOR and coal assurance; but then in the U.S.  you're kind of evaluating resource potential of the Barnett Shale  which I haven't really thought of in a while. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about that.Just could we be seeing just like a switch at some point where the U.S. shale players think a little bit more about just EOR? You guys spent so much time talking about permissible floods in the past  so I'm just kind of curious if there's any sort of pickup in interest in trying to get a little bit more production out of existing wells in the U.S.?Larry Bruno: Yes  so let's unravel a little bit. The project I talked about on the Barnett  I think most people perhaps mistakenly assume that everything is known about the variability and reservoir quality across the U.S. unconventional plays. That's not the case. We have a good perspective on that because we've done work in all the basins  multi-company studies where we've gotten to see everybody's results. And so there are areas of higher-quality and lower-quality reservoir rock. Over time  technology has helped to bring forward the productive potential of lower-quality rock  but people are always aware that  hey  they've cherry-picked in many cases  some of the better-quality areas that they had.They did exactly what you and I would have done during tough times; they focused their efforts on their best opportunities. And now as people move into  call it  peripheral or second-tier opportunities  they've got to assess what's the quality of the rock and how much movable oil there is.Particularly on the question of EOR and unconventionals  we've been on the forefront of that for quite some time. We have a joint-industry project that has assessed the viability of doing gas injection to strip additional hydrocarbons out of the rock. We won't give you the results of that because  quite frankly  we sell the results of that to our clients. But we have demonstrated in the lab that  with the right combination of injection gases  and the right existing oil in place in the ground  that recovery can be substantially improved. And there are a number of companies that are doing that right now.The EOR project in South America that I talked about today  I think we wanted to highlight that one a bit because there is a growing worldwide  I'll call it  reaction to  hey  there's going to be a lot of CO2 that's going to be captured and available for EOR projects. I think if you look back historically  there would have been more CO2 injection for enhanced oil recovery if large long-term reliable sources of CO2 were available. Well  regulations are now creating that environment where CO2 is going to be captured in large quantities and available for long periods of time.And so we're seeing across the globe  there's an increased attention to  hey  I can take some of that CO2 that's coming from an emission point  and if I put that into my reservoir  what can I get in terms of additional oil recovery? And that's going on in North America  it's going on all over the globe.Samantha Hoh: Just a real quick follow-up on that. Can you take associated gas and treat it  and do whatever  and then use it for injection or to boost production?Larry Bruno: Yes  absolutely  and in fact  that was the focus of our -- or one of the primary focuses of our EOR study on unconventional reservoirs was to take available gases associated either with nearby production or simultaneous from the well  and then look at what chemical changes  what composition you would need to achieve  maybe adding some propane or dialing in some ethane  getting the right chemistry of the associated gases or available gases  and going back into the same wellbores that you've been producing  and then it goes through a soaking process. The physics involved in that are different than a traditional gas flood where the main driver was to push  drive oil from injections to producers.Rather  in this case  the injected gas vaporizes some of that oil. And then as it's withdrawn and the pressures drop  that oil drops out of the injection gases. And so this is a multi-cycle process that goes on where we keep adjusting the chemistry of the gas for injection to get the most oil out. And there are companies that are doing that today.Samantha Hoh: Okay  great. Maybe for my next question  just a little bit on the PE side  what are you anticipating in terms of the energetic sales  obviously  a rebound here in the frac activity? I'm kind of curious what you're expecting throughout the year in terms of demand for your energetic products  what type of seasonal trends  I guess  we should be thinking about for PE beyond the current quarter?Gwen Gresham: Yes  Samantha  we think that for PE and our energetic product sales will continue to have market penetration with that  as well as benefit from activity that will go on throughout 2023. We have seen  as we've started the year  that we're on a bit of a climb-out  let's say  from Q4 from the holidays. So we're not quite back to pre-holiday  let's say  frac spread levels. But we can see that we're starting to move in that direction  so we think it's going to be another nice year of healthy activity.Samantha Hoh: Are you guys anticipating like much of an increase in frac activity this year? I think that's a bit of debate in terms of what the demand is and the movement across the basins.Chris Hill: Yes  so this is Chris. I think what we're seeing is at least we exited -- if you look at where we were in Q4  it was at a pretty high level. I think the frac spread either approached or reached 300. And like Gwen was saying  it kind of dipped off as the holidays were in  which is very typical. And then it sort of rebounds as we begin the New Year and we're seeing that as well. So we think it's going to come back to that 300 level  but we think there are some headwinds to growth there. The rigs are kind of full up and the frac spreads are also kind of full up.But as companies start to bring new equipment on-line  we do think that that will be put to work. And maybe there's more opportunity for some growth from where we kind of exited the year as we get a little deeper into 2023.Larry Bruno: I think I'd sum it up by saying we think in total  2023 will be a better year for energetic sales than 2022.Chris Hill: Yes  year-over-year.Larry Bruno: Yes  in the U.S. and globally year-over-year.Samantha Hoh: Thanks  guys.Operator: Simon Galligani with Awilco AS.Simon Galligani: I saw that you acquired [own] shares for about $1.6 million in the fourth quarter  which I guess is the first buyback since the invasion. I know that you guys are focused on bringing the leverage ratio down to 1.5. But should we read into this that you'll gradually resume the buybacks simultaneously as you continue to reduce the leverage ratio?Chris Hill: Yes  hey  Simon  this is Chris. So when you think about the share buybacks  think about that in maybe two buckets. One is where we go into the open market and buyback shares; the other bucket is when employees have share awards that vest. They have the opportunity  or they generally will sell those shares that are for tax  their tax burden associated with that  to the company. So we will buy those shares from the employee to settle their tax burden associated with the vesting awards  and that's what you saw in the fourth quarter. We did not go out to the open market and buy any shares.Having said that  once we get our leverage ratio down to where at least we're getting towards the target  we've got more clear sight on what the forecast looks like  absolutely  we could see ourselves getting more active in the share buyback program off the open market.Simon Galligani: Okay. Thank you for the clarity and yes  the commentary. Thanks.Larry Bruno: I think we've got a little bit of a crowded earnings release date. So since we're not seeing any other questions  we'll end right there.In summary  Core's operational leadership continues to position the company for improving client activity levels in both the U.S. and international markets for 2023 and beyond. We have never been better operationally or technologically-positioned to help our global client base optimize their reservoirs and to address their evolving needs.

The company believes that providing estimates of the amounts that would be required to reconcile the range of the company's organic growth  adjusted operating expenses and the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors for the reasons identified above.Capital ManagementAt December 31  2022  the company had adjusted cash2 of $403.2 million. Total debt as of December 31  2022 was $1 742.0 million  a decrease of $117.8 million from September 30  2022.The company paid cash dividends of $53.4 million  or $0.50 per share  during the fourth quarter of 2022 and utilized $15.3 million to repurchase 132 thousand shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program at an average price of $116.07 per share.

These measures are not in accordance with  or a substitute for  GAAP  and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP measures provided in this press release include net transaction and clearing fees  adjusted operating expenses  adjusted operating income  organic net revenue  inorganic net revenue  net revenues on a constant currency basis  and adjusted operating margin  adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share  effective tax rate on adjusted earnings  net revenues on a constant currency basis  adjusted cash  EBITDA  EBITDA margin  adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin.Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release provide additional and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations and a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results.Organic net revenue  inorganic net revenue  organic non-transaction revenue and organic net revenue guidance: These are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for the impact of our acquisitions for the period or guidance  as applicable. Management believes the organic net revenue growth and guidance measures provide users with supplemental information regarding the company's ongoing and future potential revenue performances and trends by presenting revenue growth and guidance excluding the impact of the acquisitions. Revenues from acquisitions that have been owned for at least one year are considered organic and are no longer excluded from organic net revenue from either period for comparative purposes.Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets: We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. As such  if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures  it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses  the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods and the earnings power of the company. Therefore  we believe performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization expense provide investors with an additional basis for comparison across accounting periods.Acquisition-related expenses: From time to time  we have pursued acquisitions  which have resulted in expenses which would not otherwise have been incurred in the normal course of the company's business operations. These expenses include integration costs  as well as legal  due diligence  impairment charges  and other third-party transaction costs. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size  timing and complexity of the transaction. Accordingly  we exclude these costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures which provide an additional analysis of Cboe's ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Cboe's performance between periods.The tables below show the reconciliation of each financial measure from GAAP to non-GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of those items detailed below and are referred to as adjusted financial measures.Organic Net Revenue ReconciliationTable 3Three Months EndedTwelve Months Ended(in millions)December 31 December 31 Reconciliation of Revenues Less Cost of Revenues to Organic Net Revenue2022202120222021Revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue)$ 457.1$ 390.5$ 1 741.7$ 1 476.1Less acquisitions:Acquisition revenues less cost of revenues (inorganic net revenue)$ (5.1)$ —$ (28.7)$ —Organic net revenue$ 452.0$ 390.5$ 1 713.0$ 1 476.1Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP InformationThree Months EndedTwelve Months EndedTable 4December 31 December 31 (in millions  except per share amounts)2022202120222021Reconciliation of Net Income Allocated to Common Stockholders to Non-GAAP(As shown on Table 1)Net income allocated to common stockholders$ 159.0$ 165.3$ 234.1$ 527.3Non-GAAP adjustmentsAcquisition-related expenses (1)2.03.719.915.6Investment establishment costs (2)——3.0—Gain on investment (3)——(7.5)—Loan forgiveness (4)——(1.3)—Amortization of acquired intangible assets (5)33.231.4124.3126.6Goodwill impairment (6)——460.9—Impairment of investment (7)——10.65.0Change in contingent consideration (8)(5.2)(2.7)(5.2)(2.7)Total Non-GAAP adjustments30.032.4604.7144.5Income tax expense related to the items above5.3(7.4)(143.7)(31.8)Tax reserves (9)—(5.4)48.5(5.4)Deferred tax re-measurements(2.0)(3.1)(2.0)14.6Net income allocated to participating securities - effect of reconciling items(0.1)(0.1)(1.8)(0.4)Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders$ 192.2$ 181.7$ 739.8$ 648.8Reconciliation of Diluted EPS to Non-GAAPDiluted earnings per common share$ 1.49$ 1.54$ 2.19$ 4.92Per share impact of non-GAAP adjustments noted above0.310.164.741.13Adjusted diluted earnings per common share$ 1.80$ 1.70$ 6.93$ 6.05Reconciliation of Operating Margin to Non-GAAPRevenues less cost of revenues$ 457.1$ 390.5$ 1 741.7$ 1 476.1Non-GAAP adjustments noted above————Adjusted revenues less cost of revenues$ 457.1$ 390.5$ 1 741.7$ 1 476.1Operating expenses (10)$ 206.6$ 169.9$ 1 252.1$ 670.2Non-GAAP adjustments noted above30.032.4599.9139.5Adjusted operating expenses$ 176.6$ 137.5$ 652.2$ 530.7Operating income$ 250.5$ 220.6$ 489.6$ 805.9Non-GAAP adjustments noted above30.032.4599.9139.5Adjusted operating income$ 280.5$ 253.0$ 1 089.5$ 945.4Adjusted operating margin (11)61.4 %64.8 %62.6 %64.0 %Reconciliation of Income Tax Rate to Non-GAAPIncome before income taxes235.8210.2432.9756.1Non-GAAP adjustments noted above30.032.4604.7144.5Adjusted income before income taxes$ 265.8$ 242.6$ 1 037.6$ 900.6Income tax expense76.144.3197.9227.1Non-GAAP adjustments noted above(3.3)15.997.222.6Adjusted income tax expense$ 72.8$ 60.2$ 295.1$ 249.7Adjusted income tax rate27.4 %24.8 %28.4 %27.7 %(1) This amount includes professional fees (which includes fees associated with the valuation of the Cboe Digital goodwill impairment) and outside services  related to the Company's acquisitions.

(10) The company sponsors deferred compensation plans held in a trust. The expenses or income related to the deferred compensation plans are included in ""Compensation and benefits"" ($2.0 million and $1.8 million in expense for the three months ended December 31  2022 and 2021  respectively  and $0.5 million and $3.5 million in expense for the twelve months ended December  2022 and 2021  respectively)  and are directly offset by deferred compensation income  expenses and dividends included within ""Other income  net"" ($2.0 million and $1.8 million in income  expense and dividends in the three months ended December 31  2022 and 2021  respectively  and $0.5 million and $3.5 million in income  expense and dividends in the twelve months ended December  2022 and 2021  respectively)  on the condensed consolidated statements of income. The deferred compensation plans' expenses are not excluded from ""adjusted operating expenses"" and do not have an impact on ""Income before income taxes."" (11) Adjusted operating margin represents adjusted operating income divided by adjusted revenue less cost of revenue.EBITDA ReconciliationsEBITDA (earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA are widely used non-GAAP financial measures of operating performance. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA divided by revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue). It is presented as supplemental information that the company believes is useful to investors to evaluate its results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the company's core operating performance. EBITDA is calculated by adding back to net income interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization.

These measures are not in accordance with  or a substitute for  GAAP  and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP measures provided in this press release include net transaction and clearing fees  adjusted operating expenses  adjusted operating income  organic net revenue  inorganic net revenue  net revenues on a constant currency basis  and adjusted operating margin  adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share  effective tax rate on adjusted earnings  net revenues on a constant currency basis  adjusted cash  EBITDA  EBITDA margin  adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin.Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release provide additional and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations and a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results.Organic net revenue  inorganic net revenue  organic non-transaction revenue and organic net revenue guidance: These are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for the impact of our acquisitions for the period or guidance  as applicable. Management believes the organic net revenue growth and guidance measures provide users with supplemental information regarding the company's ongoing and future potential revenue performances and trends by presenting revenue growth and guidance excluding the impact of the acquisitions. Revenues from acquisitions that have been owned for at least one year are considered organic and are no longer excluded from organic net revenue from either period for comparative purposes.Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets: We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. As such  if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures  it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses  the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods and the earnings power of the company. Therefore  we believe performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization expense provide investors with an additional basis for comparison across accounting periods.Acquisition-related expenses: From time to time  we have pursued acquisitions  which have resulted in expenses which would not otherwise have been incurred in the normal course of the company's business operations. These expenses include integration costs  as well as legal  due diligence  impairment charges  and other third-party transaction costs. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size  timing and complexity of the transaction. Accordingly  we exclude these costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures which provide an additional analysis of Cboe's ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Cboe's performance between periods.The tables below show the reconciliation of each financial measure from GAAP to non-GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of those items detailed below and are referred to as adjusted financial measures.Organic Net Revenue ReconciliationTable 3Three Months EndedTwelve Months Ended(in millions)December 31 December 31 Reconciliation of Revenues Less Cost of Revenues to Organic Net Revenue2022202120222021Revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue)$ 457.1$ 390.5$ 1 741.7$ 1 476.1Less acquisitions:Acquisition revenues less cost of revenues (inorganic net revenue)$ (5.1)$ —$ (28.7)$ —Organic net revenue$ 452.0$ 390.5$ 1 713.0$ 1 476.1Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP InformationThree Months EndedTwelve Months EndedTable 4December 31 December 31 (in millions  except per share amounts)2022202120222021Reconciliation of Net Income Allocated to Common Stockholders to Non-GAAP(As shown on Table 1)Net income allocated to common stockholders$ 159.0$ 165.3$ 234.1$ 527.3Non-GAAP adjustmentsAcquisition-related expenses (1)2.03.719.915.6Investment establishment costs (2)——3.0—Gain on investment (3)——(7.5)—Loan forgiveness (4)——(1.3)—Amortization of acquired intangible assets (5)33.231.4124.3126.6Goodwill impairment (6)——460.9—Impairment of investment (7)——10.65.0Change in contingent consideration (8)(5.2)(2.7)(5.2)(2.7)Total Non-GAAP adjustments30.032.4604.7144.5Income tax expense related to the items above5.3(7.4)(143.7)(31.8)Tax reserves (9)—(5.4)48.5(5.4)Deferred tax re-measurements(2.0)(3.1)(2.0)14.6Net income allocated to participating securities - effect of reconciling items(0.1)(0.1)(1.8)(0.4)Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders$ 192.2$ 181.7$ 739.8$ 648.8Reconciliation of Diluted EPS to Non-GAAPDiluted earnings per common share$ 1.49$ 1.54$ 2.19$ 4.92Per share impact of non-GAAP adjustments noted above0.310.164.741.13Adjusted diluted earnings per common share$ 1.80$ 1.70$ 6.93$ 6.05Reconciliation of Operating Margin to Non-GAAPRevenues less cost of revenues$ 457.1$ 390.5$ 1 741.7$ 1 476.1Non-GAAP adjustments noted above————Adjusted revenues less cost of revenues$ 457.1$ 390.5$ 1 741.7$ 1 476.1Operating expenses (10)$ 206.6$ 169.9$ 1 252.1$ 670.2Non-GAAP adjustments noted above30.032.4599.9139.5Adjusted operating expenses$ 176.6$ 137.5$ 652.2$ 530.7Operating income$ 250.5$ 220.6$ 489.6$ 805.9Non-GAAP adjustments noted above30.032.4599.9139.5Adjusted operating income$ 280.5$ 253.0$ 1 089.5$ 945.4Adjusted operating margin (11)61.4 %64.8 %62.6 %64.0 %Reconciliation of Income Tax Rate to Non-GAAPIncome before income taxes235.8210.2432.9756.1Non-GAAP adjustments noted above30.032.4604.7144.5Adjusted income before income taxes$ 265.8$ 242.6$ 1 037.6$ 900.6Income tax expense76.144.3197.9227.1Non-GAAP adjustments noted above(3.3)15.997.222.6Adjusted income tax expense$ 72.8$ 60.2$ 295.1$ 249.7Adjusted income tax rate27.4 %24.8 %28.4 %27.7 %(1) This amount includes professional fees (which includes fees associated with the valuation of the Cboe Digital goodwill impairment) and outside services  related to the Company's acquisitions.

(10) The company sponsors deferred compensation plans held in a trust. The expenses or income related to the deferred compensation plans are included in ""Compensation and benefits"" ($2.0 million and $1.8 million in expense for the three months ended December 31  2022 and 2021  respectively  and $0.5 million and $3.5 million in expense for the twelve months ended December  2022 and 2021  respectively)  and are directly offset by deferred compensation income  expenses and dividends included within ""Other income  net"" ($2.0 million and $1.8 million in income  expense and dividends in the three months ended December 31  2022 and 2021  respectively  and $0.5 million and $3.5 million in income  expense and dividends in the twelve months ended December  2022 and 2021  respectively)  on the condensed consolidated statements of income. The deferred compensation plans' expenses are not excluded from ""adjusted operating expenses"" and do not have an impact on ""Income before income taxes."" (11) Adjusted operating margin represents adjusted operating income divided by adjusted revenue less cost of revenue.EBITDA ReconciliationsEBITDA (earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA are widely used non-GAAP financial measures of operating performance. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA divided by revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue). It is presented as supplemental information that the company believes is useful to investors to evaluate its results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the company's core operating performance. EBITDA is calculated by adding back to net income interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back to EBITDA acquisition-related expenses  change in contingent consideration  gain on investment  loan forgiveness  investment establishment costs  goodwill impairment  and impairment of investment. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes either for net income  as an indicator of the company's operating performance  or for cash flow  as a measure of the company's liquidity. In addition  because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be calculated identically by all companies  the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue.Table 5Three Months EndedTwelve Months Ended(in millions)December 31 December 31 Reconciliation of Net Income Allocated to Common Stockholders to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA(Per Table 1)2022202120222021Net income allocated to common stockholders$ 159.0$ 165.3$ 234.1$ 527.3Interest expense  net15.711.156.447.4Income tax provision76.144.3197.9227.1Depreciation and amortization44.742.0166.8167.4EBITDA$ 295.5$ 262.7$ 655.2$ 969.2EBITDA Margin64.6 %67.3 %37.6 %65.7 %Non-GAAP adjustments not included in above line itemsAcquisition-related expenses2.03.719.915.6Investment establishment costs——3.0—Gain on investment——(7.5)—Loan forgiveness——(1.3)—Change in contingent consideration(5.2)(2.7)(5.2)(2.7)Goodwill impairment——460.9—Impairment of investment——10.65.0Adjusted EBITDA$ 292.3$ 263.7$ 1 135.6$ 987.1Adjusted EBITDA Margin63.9 %67.5 %65.2 %66.9 %Table 6(in millions)December 31 December 31 Reconciliation of Cash and cash equivalents to Adjusted Cash20222021Cash and cash equivalents$ 432.7$ 341.9Financial investments91.737.1Less deferred compensation plan assets(27.5)(28.0)Less cash collected for Section 31 Fees(93.7)(25.9)Adjusted Cash$ 403.2$ 325.1Table 7(in millions)Reconciliation of Net Transaction and Clearing Fees - Three Months Ended December 31  2022 and 2021ConsolidatedOptionsN.A.

The proposed dividend represents a 7.2% yield. Read more here.,"pawel.gaul/E+ via Getty ImagesIntroductionRetail Estates (OTCPK:RETTF) is a Belgian commercial real estate REIT focusing on retail parks. The REIT originally focused on Belgium but has since expanded into The Netherlands. I like the REIT because of its relatively conservative capitalization rate it applies to calculate its NAV (which means the independent appraisers are more conservative than with for instance high-end malls which are still valued at a capitalization rate of less than 5%).Yahoo FinanceAs Retail Estates is a Belgian REIT  I would strongly recommend you to trade in the REIT's securities on its primary exchange. The ticker symbol on Euronext Brussels is RET and the average daily volume is 9 000 shares. There are currently 14.1M shares outstanding  resulting in a market capitalization of 920M EUR.The financial year started wellRetail Estates has a financial year that ends in March which means the most recent available financial statements are the H1 results which discuss the REIT's performance between April 1 and Sept. 30 of 2022. That's before the world economy got a little bit shakier  but it also means that none of the inflation-related rent hikes are taken into account just yet. Those hikes usually occur at the beginning of each calendar year.Retail Estates Investor RelationsDuring the first half of the financial year  Retail Estates reported a 60.8M EUR rental income  which resulted in a 60.6M EUR net rental income. The vast majority of its property-related expenses was covered by the tenants and the ""property result"" was approximately 59.6M EUR. The operating property result  which we can likely assume to be the NOI-equivalent  was 54M EUR  an increase of approximately 5% compared to the first half of FY 2022.Retail Estates Investor RelationsThe EPRA earnings for the first half of the year came in at 2.84 EUR per share. While that is a 4% decrease compared to the 2.95 EUR per share in H1 2022  keep in mind the average share count increased by approximately 8% as Retail Estates issued new shares during the first half of its financial year. Those new shares were priced at 64.00 EUR per share.While Retail Estates did not provide a full-year EPRA earnings guidance  I think it's safe to assume we will come in at around 5.8-6.00 EUR per share as the majority of the EPRA earnings will be weighed toward the second half of the year. Retail Estates completed a 35.7M EUR acquisition in July  which means the contribution from that new asset was less than half the H1 period and this means the full-year contribution of that sole retail park asset alone will boost the EPRA earnings by about 5 cents per share.Additionally  Retail Estates completed yet another 22.4M EUR acquisition in January 2023. That new acquisition consists of 13 retail units in a 55 unit complex with almost 1 000 parking spaces on the roof. I was pretty pleased when I saw the metrics of this acquisition as the annual net rental income of 2.25M EUR indicates the property was purchased at a 10% capitalization rate. There's one caveat: The equity portion of the acquisition was co-funded with a private equity group. This means that the net attributable investment in the asset was about 4.5M EUR (with about 7M EUR in debt on a 50/50 basis. I'm not sure of the asset will be consolidated but even if it doesn't we should see an increase in the value of the investments in associates and/or joint ventures.Retail Estates Investor RelationsThe book value should hold up  even at a higher capitalization rateAs of the end of September  Retail Estates' properties were valued at 1.82B EUR based on a 6.77% capitalization rate. Notwithstanding the recent purchase at a 10% capitalization rate  I think using 6.77% is actually pretty decent.Keep in mind though the capitalization rate is applied to the rental income and not to the net operating income. That's pretty standard for Europe  while in North America capitalization rates are usually applied on the net operating income. Looking at the H1 results and including the pro forma result of the July acquisition  the capitalization rate based on the NOI is approximately 6.1-6.15% which isn't very high.But even if I would use a 7% capitalization rate on the NOI (adjusted for the July acquisition but excluding the January acquisition)  the fair value of the real estate assets (adjusted for vacancy levels) would be approximately 1.6B EUR. Assuming a 4% increase in the NOI throughout 2023  the NOI would increase to 113M EUR resulting in a fair value of 1.66B EUR.We also know the net debt is approximately 859M EUR. Which means that in the 7% capitalization rate scenario  the fair value of the equity is approximately 800M EUR. And divided over the 14.1M shares outstanding  this means the NAV/share is approximately 56.7 EUR.It's also important to note that even in this scenario using a 15% higher capitalization rate  the LTV ratio will remain limited to just under 52%. That's pretty high  but it does mean Retail Estates remains in the safe zone. And considering the REIT should be able to retain about 14-16M EUR per year in earnings that it doesn't distribute as a dividend  the LTV ratio could easily decrease by about 100 basis points per year so as long as Retail Estates keeps its occupancy level at the current level and doesn't see a spike in defaults  I don't anticipate any issues on the balance sheet front.Retail Estates Investor RelationsRetail Estates also has locked in its effective cost of debt thanks to swaps. In excess of 90% of its gross debt has a been fixed. This will only provide a temporary shield as the average term of the debt is just around four years (and potentially even lower now as we are getting close to the end of the financial year). So we will see a gradual increase of the interest expenses (as the average cost of debt is just around 2% right now) and an increase to 5% would have a negative impact on the EPRA earnings of approximately 1.5-1.7 EUR per share. Of course Retail Estates should be able to 1) hike the rent so it increases its earnings and 2) reduce its net debt a little bit by retaining some of its earnings. A 4% NOI increase in CY 2023 followed by three years of 2% increases should increase the NOI should add about 12M EUR in annual NOI and thus mitigate about half of the impact of a 5% cost of debt.Investment thesisRetail Estates is not cheap based on the NAV using a 7% capitalization rate but based on the EPRA earnings multiple of 11 and the anticipated dividend yield of 7.2% based on the prognosis to pay 4.70 EUR per share as a dividend over FY 2023 (subject to the standard 30% dividend withholding tax in Belgium)  the stock is still somewhat attractive.I was lucky enough to pick up some shares in the high-50 range then the entire REIT sector was hurting at the end of September but I'm not ""averaging up"" at this moment. I may decide to expand my position but I'm in no rush.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
