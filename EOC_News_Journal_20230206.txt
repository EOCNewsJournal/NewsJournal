It will complement the longstanding Goole site and drive productivity and efficiency gains for vehicle preparation. It represents a total investment of around €2.5 million.Once fully operational  this new center will increase Aramis Group’s processing capacity in the UK by around 25 000 vehicles per year  helping serve a growing number of UK customers with quality refurbished cars at the right price  in line with its focus on the circular economy. The Goole center currently processes around 13 000 vehicles annually.Up to 100 qualified local jobs will be created over time  helping further strengthen the industrial network and strong local roots of CarSupermarket.com  Aramis Group’s UK subsidiary. However  in view of current automotive market trends in the UK  the Hull center’s ramp-up has been adapted in line with the level of demand  with certain business experts redeployed from Goole to the Hull site and a limited number of new hires. As soon as the economic context improves  CarSupermarket.com will be able to strongly re-accelerate and relaunch its growth  in a structurally deep and attractive UK market.Nicolas Chartier and Guillaume Paoli  co-founders1 of Aramis Group: “Following the opening of the Antwerp refurbishing center in November 2021  the Group’s first site in Belgium  then the Nemours facility in June 2022  its second site in France  Aramis Group is delighted to inaugurate its second site in the UK. Thank you to all our teams for this great achievement  and particularly Matt Barrick  who has been with CarSupermarket.com for more than 15 years and was recently appointed as CEO of our UK operations  and who has been a driving force behind its development. This center illustrates the convergence of practices within Aramis Group  with CarSupermarket.com benefiting from the transfer of the industry-leading vehicle refurbishing expertise in Europe built up since 2014 by AramisAuto  our French subsidiary  at its Donzère center in the south of France. Located in Hull  Yorkshire  the region where CarSupermarket.com was founded more than 20 years ago and where the brand has a strong leading position locally  this new center will enable us to triple our vehicle processing capacity in the UK over time  helping consolidate our position in this country and supporting our objectives for growth”.Story continues***About Aramis Group – www.aramis.groupAramis Group is the European leader for B2C online used car sales and operates in six countries.

17822,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/02/06/2601763/0/en/VEON-announces-ratio-change-under-its-American-Depositary-Receipt-ADR-program.html,VEON announces ratio change under its American Depositary Receipt (“ADR”) program,VEON announces ratio change under its American Depositary Receipt (“ADR”) program  Amsterdam  Netherlands  6 February 2023 07:00 CET: VEON Ltd....,VEON announces ratio change under its American Depositary Receipt (“ADR”) programAmsterdam  Netherlands  6 February 2023 07:00 CET: VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON) (“VEON” or the “Company”)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  announced today that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) has approved a change of ratio in the Company’s ADR program  comprising a change in the ratio of American Depositary Shares (the “ADSs”) to VEON common shares (the “Shares”) from one (1) ADS representing one (1) Share  to one (1) ADS representing twenty-five (25) Shares (the “Ratio Change”). The effective date of the Ratio Change (the “Effective Date”) is expected to be 6 March 2023.Pursuant to the Ratio Change  as of the Effective Date  record holders who directly hold ADRs will be required to exchange their existing ADRs for new ADRs on the basis of one (1) new ADR for every twenty-five (25) existing ADRs surrendered. The Depositary will contact ADR holders and arrange for the exchange of their existing ADRs for new ADRs. ADS beneficial holders who hold through an ADR holder intermediary need not take any action in connection with the Ratio Change.For ADS holders  the Ratio Change will have the same effect as a one for twenty five reverse ADS split. No new Shares will be issued in connection with the Ratio Change and the ADSs will continue to be traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “VEON.”As a result of the Ratio Change  the trading price of the Company’s ADSs is expected to automatically increase proportionally  but the Company can give no assurance that the ADS trading price following the Ratio Change will be at least equal to the ADS trading price before the Ratio Change multiplied by the new 25:1 ratio. As VEON announced previously on 5 October 2022  the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Market granted VEON an additional grace period through 3 April 2023 to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Price”). While the Ratio Change is intended to bring the bid price of the Company’s ADSs into compliance with the Minimum Bid Price  the Company can give no assurance that the Ratio Change will be effective in achieving this goal.VEON Group CEO Kaan Terzioglu commented: “We believe the Ratio Change is in the best interest of all our stakeholders  as it will allow us to ensure VEON’s continued Nasdaq listing and provide a pathway toward increasing VEON’s visibility on Nasdaq.”About VEONVEON is a global digital operator that currently provides converged connectivity and online services to over 200 million customers in seven dynamic markets.

The Group is a multinational based in Varese  listed on the Euronext STAR Milan segment  and one of the major operators in the world in the air heat exchangers sector.The transaction has sustainability as its objective and is linked to the improvement of specific performance indicators (ESG KPIs). The purpose of the loan is to support LU-VE Group's investment plan and support its working capital. The objective is linked to some green covenants linked to the percentage reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions (Green House Gas - GHG). LU-VE Group in fact contributes directly to the well-being of the environment through the development of heat exchangers that use natural refrigerant fluids (CO2  ammonia  propane and water)  instead of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC)  with the consequent benefit of eliminating or drastically reducing the negative impacts on the environment (ODP - Ozone Depletion Potential and GWP - Global Warming Potential)  thus also responding to the green needs of its customers. From 1986 to today  through research projects on new refrigerants  LU-VE Group can boast a track record of highly successful CO2 installations in Europe  Latin America  the Middle East and Asia.

The proposed transaction would be structured to be taxable to Life Storage equityholders  which would give the combined company a step-up in the tax basis of the acquired assets  providing an enhanced ability to retain free cash flow and fund future accretive growth. Public Storage’s Board of Trustees has unanimously approved the proposal.As detailed in Public Storage’s January 12  2023 letter  Public Storage believes a combination of the two companies will result in immediate benefits to Life Storage shareholders  and will unlock superior near-  medium- and long-term growth and value creation opportunities  including:Accelerated Growth and Profitability: Stronger organic growth resulting in higher profitability as Life Storage’s portfolio benefits from Public Storage’s industry-leading revenue generation and expense efficiency.

We have been disappointed that Life Storage’s board has refused to engage constructively with us. Life Storage explicitly wrote on December 29  2022 that Life Storage is ‘not for sale ’ reaffirmed that stance in a January 31  2023 letter without offering any avenue for further dialogue  and has been unresponsive to our outreach.”“Public Storage has a long and proven track record of delivering shareholder value through strategic growth  and we are confident in our ability to deliver significant operating efficiencies and capitalize on expanded ancillary and capital allocation opportunities. We strongly urge the Life Storage board to act in the best interests of its shareholders and enter into good faith discussions with us regarding the proposed transaction’s benefits.”Public Storage also today announced that its Board of Trustees has increased Public Storage’s regular common quarterly dividend by 50%  from $2.00 to $3.00 per share.The full text of Public Storage’s February 5  2023 and January 12  2023 letters is included below.AdvisorsGoldman Sachs & Co.

Barberio  Chairman of the BoardJoseph V. Saffire  Chief Executive OfficerLife Storage  Inc.6467 Main StreetBuffalo  NY 14221Dear Mark and Joe We are writing to reiterate our proposal to acquire Life Storage  Inc. for consideration consisting of Public Storage common stock at an exchange ratio of 0.4192 shares of Public Storage common stock for each outstanding Life Storage share or unit. Our offer represents a 19% premium based on the 20-day trailing VWAPs of Public Storage and Life Storage as of February 3  2023. This substantial offer provides Life Storage shareholders not only an immediate  highly attractive equity premium  but also a superior opportunity to unlock near-  medium-  and long-term growth  profitability  and value creation.We believe your shareholders deserve to be informed of our proposed transaction and to have the opportunity to make their views known  and we are making this letter public in light of your refusal to engage in any meaningful dialogue  including your declaration in writing on December 29  2022 that Life Storage “is not for sale.”As we have stated multiple times  we admire your business and respect the strides your management team and board have made  particularly in recent years. Your success  coupled with Public Storage’s proven ability to deliver industry-leading performance through superior operational capabilities and strategic growth  is the reason we are so confident in the unique opportunity this proposal represents for your shareholders. Following the transaction  your shareholders would own a combined business with a diversified platform that is well-positioned for enhanced organic growth  profitability  and portfolio expansion utilizing the industry’s most recognized brand and strongest balance sheet.We have made numerous attempts to engage in a constructive private dialogue with you and your board over the past two months. On January 12  we proposed to you in writing a transaction at an exchange ratio of 0.4192 shares  which represented a 20% premium on that day. Instead of meaningfully engaging with us  you sent a letter on January 31 bluntly asserting that our offer is not in the best interests of your shareholders without providing any explanation or avenue for discussion. Your letter—and your lack of response to our outreach since—clearly reflect the “not for sale” stance communicated in your December 29 letter. We believe your persistent unwillingness to engage in discussions regarding this highly beneficial transaction is contrary to the interests of your shareholders.We would have preferred to work privately with you to reach an agreement for the benefit of our respective shareholders  but given your refusal to engage meaningfully  we believe making our proposal public is now the most constructive approach. Your shareholders deserve the opportunity to consider and communicate directly with you regarding the substantial benefits of our offer.Public Storage and our board consider this transaction to be an important strategic priority. We have engaged Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Wachtell  Lipton  Rosen & Katz to assist us in completing this transaction. We believe that this transaction provides a high degree of closing certainty and can be completed quickly.We stand ready to work with you immediately and to move forward on the basis of our proposal. We strongly prefer to engage in direct and constructive discussions to reach an agreement for the benefit of your company. And we hope you  your board  and your advisors are prepared to engage with us in the best interests of your deserving shareholders.Sincerely /s/ Joseph D. Russell  Jr. /s/ Ronald L. Havner  Jr. Joseph D. Russell  Jr. President and Chief Executive Officer Ronald L. Havner  Jr. Chairman of the BoardPublic Storage’s January 12  2023 Letter to Life StorageJanuary 12  2023Mark G. Barberio  Chairman of the BoardJoseph V. Saffire  Chief Executive OfficerLife Storage  Inc.6467 Main StreetBuffalo  NY 14221Dear Mark and Joe We are writing to follow up on our December 22  2022 conversation  during which we conveyed to you Public Storage’s very strong interest in acquiring Life Storage  Inc. We appreciated our conversation and the chance to discuss the merits of a combined company. As discussed  we admire your business and respect what you  your management team  and board have accomplished. We strongly believe that our combined company would be one of the leading and most well-regarded real estate companies and very well received by the investor community.We are proposing that Public Storage would acquire all of the outstanding shares and units of Life Storage for consideration consisting of Public Storage common stock at an exchange ratio of 0.4192 shares of Public Storage common stock for each outstanding Life Storage share or unit. The proposed consideration has a current value of $124.12 per Life Storage share/unit based on the closing price of Public Storage common stock on January 12  2023  which represents a substantial immediate premium for Life Storage equityholders of 20%. We propose to structure the transaction so that it would be taxable for Life Storage equityholders  which we believe would not be of concern to the majority of your shareholders  so that the combined company would benefit from a step-up in tax basis  with a corresponding enhanced ability for the combined company to retain free cash flow to fund future accretive growth.Participating in the combined company on the basis of the exchange ratio we are proposing will provide your equityholders with the opportunity to share in all of the upside of the combined company on a basis reflecting a proportional ownership interest substantially greater than would be implied by our respective underlying fundamentals. Put simply  the immediate equity premium to be paid to your shareholders affords them a turbo-charged share of the combined company and an equity investment far superior to continuing as an investor in your stand-alone company.Our proposed transaction will allow Life Storage shareholders the opportunity to benefit from long-term value creation in a combined company that will have several advantages  including the immediate ability to:Increase significant operational efficiencies and economies of scale  leading to improved margins on Life Storage’s portfolio and enabling your shareholders to benefit from operational improvement quickly;Expand the strongest brand in the industry  which when combined with the leading digital customer experience  will enable more robust customer acquisition and new customer growth;Retain and deploy a strong  low leverage  single-A credit rated balance sheet  which will create significant external growth capacity at a low cost of capital;Unlock additional capital allocation opportunities through acquisitions with the combined company’s higher margins and lower cost of capital  including providing your shareholders exposure to our industry leading in-house development and redevelopment capabilities;Combine our significant 65 million square feet of non-same store portfolios  providing outsized cash flow growth; andAccelerate growth of ancillary operations  including tenant reinsurance and third-party property management  and pair your private owner lending platform with our strong balance sheet.Our industry leading brand  balance sheet  and lower cost of capital  combined with the significant operational efficiencies we expect to achieve through the proposed transaction  will make the combined company more profitable and nimble  driving cash flow and value creation for the shareholders of the combined company.Given the proposed transaction’s immediate and long-term benefits  we feel very strongly that our proposed offer provides Life Storage shareholders a more favorable alternative than its current standalone strategy. We were surprised by your December 29  2022 letter  which stated that “the Company is not for sale ” and your call to request that we not provide you with the specific terms on which we would propose a transaction. Hopefully you agree that this proposal is compelling and merits serious consideration and engagement by your board. We would certainly welcome the opportunity to spend time with you and your Board to discuss our proposal and walk you through why this is such a compelling opportunity for your shareholders.Our proposal provides a high degree of closing certainty and a fast track to completion. We stand ready to enter into a confidentiality agreement  commence our due diligence  and negotiate definitive transaction documentation on a fast track. To that end  we have engaged Wachtell  Lipton  Rosen & Katz as our legal advisor on this transaction  and all of our internal and external resources stand ready to move promptly to the next phase of the transaction  including our completion of customary confirmatory due diligence. This transaction is a very high priority for our management team and Board of Trustees  which has unanimously approved this proposal.This proposal is based solely on public information  is non-binding  and does not constitute an offer or a commitment to submit an offer or to negotiate or enter into a definitive agreement; the parties will not be legally bound with respect to this proposal until execution of definitive transaction agreements  if any  and subject to the terms and conditions expressed therein.* * * *We and our advisors stand ready to engage with you and your team as quickly and intensively as possible  and we look forward to doing so  with a view towards delivering superior value to your equityholders.We would welcome the opportunity to meet with you as soon as possible to discuss this compelling proposal further and answer any questions you may have.Sincerely /s/ Joseph D.

Barberio  Life Storage’s Chairman  and Joseph V. Saffire  Life Storage’s CEO  copied in full below  with respect to its proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares and units of Life Storage  Inc. (NYSE: LSI) in an all-stock transaction.

The proposed transaction would be structured to be taxable to Life Storage equityholders  which would give the combined company a step-up in the tax basis of the acquired assets  providing an enhanced ability to retain free cash flow and fund future accretive growth. Public Storage’s Board of Trustees has unanimously approved the proposal. As detailed in Public Storage’s January 12  2023 letter  Public Storage believes a combination of the two companies will result in immediate benefits to Life Storage shareholders  and will unlock superior near-  medium- and long-term growth and value creation opportunities  including: Accelerated Growth and Profitability: Stronger organic growth resulting in higher profitability as Life Storage’s portfolio benefits from Public Storage’s industry-leading revenue generation and expense efficiency.

Enhanced Ancillary Operations: Complementary enhancements to ancillary operating platforms  including tenant reinsurance  third-party property management  business customer offerings  and lending.

Life Storage explicitly wrote on December 29  2022 that Life Storage is ‘not for sale ’ reaffirmed that stance in a January 31  2023 letter without offering any avenue for further dialogue  and has been unresponsive to our outreach.” “Public Storage has a long and proven track record of delivering shareholder value through strategic growth  and we are confident in our ability to deliver significant operating efficiencies and capitalize on expanded ancillary and capital allocation opportunities. We strongly urge the Life Storage board to act in the best interests of its shareholders and enter into good faith discussions with us regarding the proposed transaction’s benefits.” Public Storage also today announced that its Board of Trustees has increased Public Storage’s regular common quarterly dividend by 50%  from $2.00 to $3.00 per share.

Public Storage’s February 5  2023 Letter to Life Storage February 5  2023 Mark G. Barberio  Chairman of the BoardJoseph V. Saffire  Chief Executive OfficerLife Storage  Inc.6467 Main StreetBuffalo  NY 14221 Dear Mark and Joe  We are writing to reiterate our proposal to acquire Life Storage  Inc. for consideration consisting of Public Storage common stock at an exchange ratio of 0.4192 shares of Public Storage common stock for each outstanding Life Storage share or unit. Our offer represents a 19% premium based on the 20-day trailing VWAPs of Public Storage and Life Storage as of February 3  2023. This substantial offer provides Life Storage shareholders not only an immediate  highly attractive equity premium  but also a superior opportunity to unlock near-  medium-  and long-term growth  profitability  and value creation. We believe your shareholders deserve to be informed of our proposed transaction and to have the opportunity to make their views known  and we are making this letter public in light of your refusal to engage in any meaningful dialogue  including your declaration in writing on December 29  2022 that Life Storage “is not for sale.” As we have stated multiple times  we admire your business and respect the strides your management team and board have made  particularly in recent years. Your success  coupled with Public Storage’s proven ability to deliver industry-leading performance through superior operational capabilities and strategic growth  is the reason we are so confident in the unique opportunity this proposal represents for your shareholders. Following the transaction  your shareholders would own a combined business with a diversified platform that is well-positioned for enhanced organic growth  profitability  and portfolio expansion utilizing the industry’s most recognized brand and strongest balance sheet. We have made numerous attempts to engage in a constructive private dialogue with you and your board over the past two months. On January 12  we proposed to you in writing a transaction at an exchange ratio of 0.4192 shares  which represented a 20% premium on that day. Instead of meaningfully engaging with us  you sent a letter on January 31 bluntly asserting that our offer is not in the best interests of your shareholders without providing any explanation or avenue for discussion. Your letter—and your lack of response to our outreach since—clearly reflect the “not for sale” stance communicated in your December 29 letter. We believe your persistent unwillingness to engage in discussions regarding this highly beneficial transaction is contrary to the interests of your shareholders. We would have preferred to work privately with you to reach an agreement for the benefit of our respective shareholders  but given your refusal to engage meaningfully  we believe making our proposal public is now the most constructive approach. Your shareholders deserve the opportunity to consider and communicate directly with you regarding the substantial benefits of our offer. Public Storage and our board consider this transaction to be an important strategic priority. We have engaged Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Wachtell  Lipton  Rosen & Katz to assist us in completing this transaction. We believe that this transaction provides a high degree of closing certainty and can be completed quickly. We stand ready to work with you immediately and to move forward on the basis of our proposal. We strongly prefer to engage in direct and constructive discussions to reach an agreement for the benefit of your company. And we hope you  your board  and your advisors are prepared to engage with us in the best interests of your deserving shareholders. Sincerely  /s/ Joseph D. Russell  Jr. /s/ Ronald L. Havner  Jr. Joseph D. Russell  Jr. President and Chief Executive Officer Ronald L. Havner  Jr. Chairman of the Board Public Storage’s January 12  2023 Letter to Life Storage January 12  2023 Mark G. Barberio  Chairman of the BoardJoseph V. Saffire  Chief Executive OfficerLife Storage  Inc.6467 Main StreetBuffalo  NY 14221 Dear Mark and Joe  We are writing to follow up on our December 22  2022 conversation  during which we conveyed to you Public Storage’s very strong interest in acquiring Life Storage  Inc. We appreciated our conversation and the chance to discuss the merits of a combined company. As discussed  we admire your business and respect what you  your management team  and board have accomplished. We strongly believe that our combined company would be one of the leading and most well-regarded real estate companies and very well received by the investor community. We are proposing that Public Storage would acquire all of the outstanding shares and units of Life Storage for consideration consisting of Public Storage common stock at an exchange ratio of 0.4192 shares of Public Storage common stock for each outstanding Life Storage share or unit. The proposed consideration has a current value of $124.12 per Life Storage share/unit based on the closing price of Public Storage common stock on January 12  2023  which represents a substantial immediate premium for Life Storage equityholders of 20%. We propose to structure the transaction so that it would be taxable for Life Storage equityholders  which we believe would not be of concern to the majority of your shareholders  so that the combined company would benefit from a step-up in tax basis  with a corresponding enhanced ability for the combined company to retain free cash flow to fund future accretive growth. Participating in the combined company on the basis of the exchange ratio we are proposing will provide your equityholders with the opportunity to share in all of the upside of the combined company on a basis reflecting a proportional ownership interest substantially greater than would be implied by our respective underlying fundamentals. Put simply  the immediate equity premium to be paid to your shareholders affords them a turbo-charged share of the combined company and an equity investment far superior to continuing as an investor in your stand-alone company. Our proposed transaction will allow Life Storage shareholders the opportunity to benefit from long-term value creation in a combined company that will have several advantages  including the immediate ability to: Increase significant operational efficiencies and economies of scale  leading to improved margins on Life Storage’s portfolio and enabling your shareholders to benefit from operational improvement quickly; Expand the strongest brand in the industry  which when combined with the leading digital customer experience  will enable more robust customer acquisition and new customer growth; Retain and deploy a strong  low leverage  single-A credit rated balance sheet  which will create significant external growth capacity at a low cost of capital; Unlock additional capital allocation opportunities through acquisitions with the combined company’s higher margins and lower cost of capital  including providing your shareholders exposure to our industry leading in-house development and redevelopment capabilities; Combine our significant 65 million square feet of non-same store portfolios  providing outsized cash flow growth; and Accelerate growth of ancillary operations  including tenant reinsurance and third-party property management  and pair your private owner lending platform with our strong balance sheet. Our industry leading brand  balance sheet  and lower cost of capital  combined with the significant operational efficiencies we expect to achieve through the proposed transaction  will make the combined company more profitable and nimble  driving cash flow and value creation for the shareholders of the combined company. Given the proposed transaction’s immediate and long-term benefits  we feel very strongly that our proposed offer provides Life Storage shareholders a more favorable alternative than its current standalone strategy. We were surprised by your December 29  2022 letter  which stated that “the Company is not for sale ” and your call to request that we not provide you with the specific terms on which we would propose a transaction. Hopefully you agree that this proposal is compelling and merits serious consideration and engagement by your board. We would certainly welcome the opportunity to spend time with you and your Board to discuss our proposal and walk you through why this is such a compelling opportunity for your shareholders. Our proposal provides a high degree of closing certainty and a fast track to completion. We stand ready to enter into a confidentiality agreement  commence our due diligence  and negotiate definitive transaction documentation on a fast track. To that end  we have engaged Wachtell  Lipton  Rosen & Katz as our legal advisor on this transaction  and all of our internal and external resources stand ready to move promptly to the next phase of the transaction  including our completion of customary confirmatory due diligence. This transaction is a very high priority for our management team and Board of Trustees  which has unanimously approved this proposal. This proposal is based solely on public information  is non-binding  and does not constitute an offer or a commitment to submit an offer or to negotiate or enter into a definitive agreement; the parties will not be legally bound with respect to this proposal until execution of definitive transaction agreements  if any  and subject to the terms and conditions expressed therein. * * * * We and our advisors stand ready to engage with you and your team as quickly and intensively as possible  and we look forward to doing so  with a view towards delivering superior value to your equityholders. We would welcome the opportunity to meet with you as soon as possible to discuss this compelling proposal further and answer any questions you may have. Sincerely  /s/ Joseph D.
