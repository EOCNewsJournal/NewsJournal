It will complement the longstanding Goole site and drive productivity and efficiency gains for vehicle preparation. It represents a total investment of around ‚Ç¨2.5 million.Once fully operational  this new center will increase Aramis Group‚Äôs processing capacity in the UK by around 25 000 vehicles per year  helping serve a growing number of UK customers with quality refurbished cars at the right price  in line with its focus on the circular economy. The Goole center currently processes around 13 000 vehicles annually.Up to 100 qualified local jobs will be created over time  helping further strengthen the industrial network and strong local roots of CarSupermarket.com  Aramis Group‚Äôs UK subsidiary. However  in view of current automotive market trends in the UK  the Hull center‚Äôs ramp-up has been adapted in line with the level of demand  with certain business experts redeployed from Goole to the Hull site and a limited number of new hires. As soon as the economic context improves  CarSupermarket.com will be able to strongly re-accelerate and relaunch its growth  in a structurally deep and attractive UK market.Nicolas Chartier and Guillaume Paoli  co-founders1 of Aramis Group: ‚ÄúFollowing the opening of the Antwerp refurbishing center in November 2021  the Group‚Äôs first site in Belgium  then the Nemours facility in June 2022  its second site in France  Aramis Group is delighted to inaugurate its second site in the UK. Thank you to all our teams for this great achievement  and particularly Matt Barrick  who has been with CarSupermarket.com for more than 15 years and was recently appointed as CEO of our UK operations  and who has been a driving force behind its development. This center illustrates the convergence of practices within Aramis Group  with CarSupermarket.com benefiting from the transfer of the industry-leading vehicle refurbishing expertise in Europe built up since 2014 by AramisAuto  our French subsidiary  at its Donz√®re center in the south of France. Located in Hull  Yorkshire  the region where CarSupermarket.com was founded more than 20 years ago and where the brand has a strong leading position locally  this new center will enable us to triple our vehicle processing capacity in the UK over time  helping consolidate our position in this country and supporting our objectives for growth‚Äù.Story continues***About Aramis Group ‚Äì www.aramis.groupAramis Group is the European leader for B2C online used car sales and operates in six countries.

(NASDAQ  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON) (‚ÄúVEON‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  announced today that its Board of Directors (the ‚ÄúBoard‚Äù) has approved a change of ratio in the Company‚Äôs ADR program  comprising a change in the ratio of American Depositary Shares (the ‚ÄúADSs‚Äù) to VEON common shares (the ‚ÄúShares‚Äù) from one (1) ADS representing one (1) Share  to one (1) ADS representing twenty-five (25) Shares (the ‚ÄúRatio Change‚Äù). The effective date of the Ratio Change (the ‚ÄúEffective Date‚Äù) is expected to be 6 March 2023.Pursuant to the Ratio Change  as of the Effective Date  record holders who directly hold ADRs will be required to exchange their existing ADRs for new ADRs on the basis of one (1) new ADR for every twenty-five (25) existing ADRs surrendered. The Depositary will contact ADR holders and arrange for the exchange of their existing ADRs for new ADRs. ADS beneficial holders who hold through an ADR holder intermediary need not take any action in connection with the Ratio Change.For ADS holders  the Ratio Change will have the same effect as a one for twenty five reverse ADS split. No new Shares will be issued in connection with the Ratio Change and the ADSs will continue to be traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ‚ÄúVEON.‚ÄùAs a result of the Ratio Change  the trading price of the Company‚Äôs ADSs is expected to automatically increase proportionally  but the Company can give no assurance that the ADS trading price following the Ratio Change will be at least equal to the ADS trading price before the Ratio Change multiplied by the new 25:1 ratio. As VEON announced previously on 5 October 2022  the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Market granted VEON an additional grace period through 3 April 2023 to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq‚Äôs Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the ‚ÄúMinimum Bid Price‚Äù). While the Ratio Change is intended to bring the bid price of the Company‚Äôs ADSs into compliance with the Minimum Bid Price  the Company can give no assurance that the Ratio Change will be effective in achieving this goal.VEON Group CEO Kaan Terzioglu commented: ‚ÄúWe believe the Ratio Change is in the best interest of all our stakeholders  as it will allow us to ensure VEON‚Äôs continued Nasdaq listing and provide a pathway toward increasing VEON‚Äôs visibility on Nasdaq.‚ÄùAbout VEONVEON is a global digital operator that currently provides converged connectivity and online services to over 200 million customers in seven dynamic markets.

The Group is a multinational based in Varese  listed on the Euronext STAR Milan segment  and one of the major operators in the world in the air heat exchangers sector.The transaction has sustainability as its objective and is linked to the improvement of specific performance indicators (ESG KPIs). The purpose of the loan is to support LU-VE Group's investment plan and support its working capital. The objective is linked to some green covenants linked to the percentage reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions (Green House Gas - GHG). LU-VE Group in fact contributes directly to the well-being of the environment through the development of heat exchangers that use natural refrigerant fluids (CO2  ammonia  propane and water)  instead of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC)  with the consequent benefit of eliminating or drastically reducing the negative impacts on the environment (ODP - Ozone Depletion Potential and GWP - Global Warming Potential)  thus also responding to the green needs of its customers. From 1986 to today  through research projects on new refrigerants  LU-VE Group can boast a track record of highly successful CO2 installations in Europe  Latin America  the Middle East and Asia. In 2004  the company built Europe's first transcritical CO2 plant (Coop T√§gipark in Wettingen  Switzerland).In January 2023  for the second time in a row  LU-VE Group's commitment to sustainability was awarded the ""Companies most attentive to the climate"" award for having distinguished itself among the best 130 Italian companies that have most committed themselves to reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The award was given by Corriere della Sera in collaboration with Statista GmbH (German company specializing in market research and company data analysis).

Sales growth was driven mainly by sales of Estetrol for Mithra (to be put in perspective  however  with the difficulties faced in recovering certain corresponding receivables from this company)  a strong demand for products from the Turku site  a favorable EUR/USD exchange rate  and the impact of price increases implemented over the past months to cover the very sharp increase in the cost of raw materials and energy.Fine Specialty ChemicalsNet sales of Fine Specialty Chemicals totaled ‚Ç¨82.7 million  a 22.7% increase compared to 2021 (a 18.6% increase at a constant exchange rate). Business has been robust throughout the year with a very strong demand for Electronics and Cosmetics and a positive trend in Lubricants and Fine Chemicals. The increase in the cost of raw materials and energy has been passed through to customers and has thus contributed to the growth of net sales. The dynamics in the industrialization of new products was also very good.Story continuesOutlookAs announced on November 3rd and December 21st  2022  2022 results will remain very negative  as the level of activity remains insufficient to cover fixed costs at several Pharmaceutical Synthesis sites  and due to inventory depreciations for out-of-specification products. Further  these results may be revised depending on the evolution of the ongoing legal proceedings relating to the sales of Estetrol. A follow-up will be provided when the 2022 results will be released on March 30  2023.In this context  PCAS has to study a temporary reduction in activity on the production site concerned by such product  including some workshops dedicated to the production of Estetrol. Although it is not possible at this stage to assess more precisely the consequences on future business and results incurred by the difficulties faced with this client  due to the aforementioned ongoing legal proceedings  the return to positive results announced for 2023 will be delayed.PCAS Group will continue to benefit from the support of its majority shareholder Seqens (owning 76.66%) for the financing of its activities and its development.NEXT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE:2022 Results  March 30  2023ABOUT PCASPCAS specializes in the development and production of complex molecules for life sciences and innovative technologies.

This new credit line replicates the innovative framework of those put in place in 2019 and 2021: the interest rate may be subsidized depending on the achievement of certain Environmental  Social and Governance (ESG) criteria.""The signing of this new syndicated loan allows us to almost double the amount of bank facilities we have at our disposal today. We warmly thank our banking partners  both old and new  for this vote of confidence. As in 2019 and 2021  this financing  the cost of which will be linked to the achievement of non-financial objectives  underlines our desire to pursue concrete CSR actions in the exercise of our mission: improving the global environment by promoting local development""  said S√©bastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.The 250 million euros loan  with a maturity of 5 years extendable to 7 years  is composed of a revolving credit facility (for two thirds) and a term loan that can be drawn down for two years (for one third). The loan also benefits from an extension clause allowing the amount to be increased during the life of the loan.This new syndicated loan comes in addition to the 170 million euros already in place in June 2021. Its purpose is to strengthen the Group's financial flexibility in the context of its continued growth. It will be used  for example  to pre-finance construction work on new power plants before project financing is drawn down. This approach is particularly well suited to Europe  where clients are willing to pay a higher price if projects are started quickly.The new financing is Sustainability-Linked  i.e. the interest rates will potentially be affected by the Group's achievement of the following non-financial objectives:Story continuesOccupational health and safety performance;Business conduct and ethics;Environmental  Social and Governance (""ESG"") performance of the company as assessed by the Ga√Øa extra-financial rating carried out by the EthiFinance1 agency.This loan was contracted with a syndicate of eight banking partners: BNP Paribas  CACIB as Mandated Arrangers and Bookrunners  Natixis as Lead Arranger and Credit Agent  and Ark√©a  Pireaus  La Banque Postale  CIC and Goldman Sachs as Arrangers.EthiFinance conducted the extra-financial analysis of Voltalia to establish its ESG rating.Next on the agenda: FY 2022 Results  on March 23  2023 (before market opening)About Voltalia (www.voltalia.com) Voltalia is an international player in the renewable energy sector.

(NASDAQ...,VEON Ltd.VEON announces ratio change under its American Depositary Receipt (‚ÄúADR‚Äù) programAmsterdam  Netherlands  6 February 2023 07:00 CET: VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON) (‚ÄúVEON‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  announced today that its Board of Directors (the ‚ÄúBoard‚Äù) has approved a change of ratio in the Company‚Äôs ADR program  comprising a change in the ratio of American Depositary Shares (the ‚ÄúADSs‚Äù) to VEON common shares (the ‚ÄúShares‚Äù) from one (1) ADS representing one (1) Share  to one (1) ADS representing twenty-five (25) Shares (the ‚ÄúRatio Change‚Äù). The effective date of the Ratio Change (the ‚ÄúEffective Date‚Äù) is expected to be 6 March 2023.Pursuant to the Ratio Change  as of the Effective Date  record holders who directly hold ADRs will be required to exchange their existing ADRs for new ADRs on the basis of one (1) new ADR for every twenty-five (25) existing ADRs surrendered. The Depositary will contact ADR holders and arrange for the exchange of their existing ADRs for new ADRs. ADS beneficial holders who hold through an ADR holder intermediary need not take any action in connection with the Ratio Change.For ADS holders  the Ratio Change will have the same effect as a one for twenty five reverse ADS split. No new Shares will be issued in connection with the Ratio Change and the ADSs will continue to be traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ‚ÄúVEON.‚ÄùAs a result of the Ratio Change  the trading price of the Company‚Äôs ADSs is expected to automatically increase proportionally  but the Company can give no assurance that the ADS trading price following the Ratio Change will be at least equal to the ADS trading price before the Ratio Change multiplied by the new 25:1 ratio. As VEON announced previously on 5 October 2022  the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Market granted VEON an additional grace period through 3 April 2023 to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq‚Äôs Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the ‚ÄúMinimum Bid Price‚Äù). While the Ratio Change is intended to bring the bid price of the Company‚Äôs ADSs into compliance with the Minimum Bid Price  the Company can give no assurance that the Ratio Change will be effective in achieving this goal.Story continuesVEON Group CEO Kaan Terzioglu commented: ‚ÄúWe believe the Ratio Change is in the best interest of all our stakeholders  as it will allow us to ensure VEON‚Äôs continued Nasdaq listing and provide a pathway toward increasing VEON‚Äôs visibility on Nasdaq.‚ÄùAbout VEONVEON is a global digital operator that currently provides converged connectivity and online services to over 200 million customers in seven dynamic markets.

Additionally  the evolution of the circular economy is highly impacting the e-commerce landscape  contributing to the surge in customer-to-customer (C2C) parcel volumes and delivery services. These trends are leading carriers to look for ways to scale their first-mile activity and innovate to reduce the associated rising costs. Thanks to Quadient‚Äôs modular design  the Drop Box and Printer comes as a unit that can be added to new or existing locker configurations. This module enables consumers to place packages directly into the Drop Box by simply scanning a barcode label  maximising parcel volume while minimising the locker footprint. Users also have the ability to print standard shipping labels directly from the built-in printer. Quadient‚Äôs cloud-based monitoring technology captures every step of the process and gives carriers full visibility of the parcels‚Äô status at any time.As the new solution becomes available in the UK  one of the country‚Äôs largest parcel delivery companies  Evri  will be the first carrier to offer the Drop Box and Printer capability to its customers. Evri is one of four international carriers that have joined the Quadient smart locker open network in the UK. The open locker network already accounts for about 300 locker stations in operation  with plans to reach 5 000 units in the coming years at the pace of about 200 new locations per month.Story continues‚ÄúThe introduction of our fully integrated Drop Box with optional Printer in our carrier-agnostic network makes us unique to the market ‚Äù said Ian Caminsky  SVP & MD Parcel Locker Solutions DACHIT-UKI  Quadient. ‚ÄúQuadient is leveraging its long-standing experience in Japan  France  the US and the UK to bring to market innovations that focus on creating operational efficiencies and eliminating time consuming processes. We are honoured to have Evri as our first integrated carrier to use this new feature to easily manage their first mile flows and deliver exceptional customer experiences to online shoppers.‚Äù‚ÄúWe‚Äôre delighted to expand our out of home network with Quadient‚Äôs smart locker network  taking advantage of new locker technology. It will increase the convenience of sending by allowing customers to print a label directly from the locker 24/7  which is great for customers who can‚Äôt print at home and means that Quadient‚Äôs locker network offers the same services as our ParcelShops. The Drop Box functionality provides a quick and simple way for small businesses to send multiple parcels in one go and maximises the number of parcels that can be handled at a single locker location each day ‚Äù said Kath Gill  Head of Out of Home at Evri.On-screen user satisfaction surveys conducted by Quadient in December 2022 and January 2023 collecting over 60 000 responses in France and Japan showed more than 97% of respondents are satisfied with their parcel locker experience. In addition  97% of first mile users in Japan are satisfied with their experience  highlighting convenience of the location  a contactless experience and wide hours of availability as the main reasons for satisfaction.In the coming months  Quadient will make the Drop Box and Printer available to retailers and other carriers across Europe and in North America.The new Drop Box and Printer is being presented by Quadient and Evri today in London at the UK e-commerce industry‚Äôs main event  The Delivery Conference.

The Company expects a sharp rebound in 2024 and a return to a normalized profitability in 2025.The Company has experienced operational challenges over the past months on the back of a very busy year. Post-Covid demand has been strong and MPC delivered 70 major films with heavy special effects content in 2022.Alongside this sustained demand  Technicolor Creative Studios had to face a significant shortage of experienced talents which have caused delays on both ongoing projects and the start of new ones and highlighted the need for improved project management and monitoring to deliver on time.In addition to this lack of adequate resources  operations were negatively impacted by internal reorganisations at MPC and the Mill post-Covid.Mikros Animation and Technicolor Games have continued to perform in line with expectations.The Company has been focused on its program to address these operational issuesThird-party reviews by renown firms are helping the Company to identify areas for improvements from a financial  reporting and operational perspective.Continued improvement of real-time project tracking with action-orientated process to resolve current delivery issues.

Sales growth was driven mainly by sales of Estetrol for Mithra (to be put in perspective  however  with the difficulties faced in recovering certain corresponding receivables from this company)  a strong demand for products from the Turku site  a favorable EUR/USD exchange rate  and the impact of price increases implemented over the past months to cover the very sharp increase in the cost of raw materials and energy.Fine Specialty ChemicalsNet sales of Fine Specialty Chemicals totaled ‚Ç¨82.7 million  a 22.7% increase compared to 2021 (a 18.6% increase at a constant exchange rate). Business has been robust throughout the year with a very strong demand for Electronics and Cosmetics and a positive trend in Lubricants and Fine Chemicals. The increase in the cost of raw materials and energy has been passed through to customers and has thus contributed to the growth of net sales. The dynamics in the industrialization of new products was also very good.OutlookAs announced on November 3rd and December 21st  2022  2022 results will remain very negative  as the level of activity remains insufficient to cover fixed costs at several Pharmaceutical Synthesis sites  and due to inventory depreciations for out-of-specification products. Further  these results may be revised depending on the evolution of the ongoing legal proceedings relating to the sales of Estetrol. A follow-up will be provided when the 2022 results will be released on March 30  2023.In this context  PCAS has to study a temporary reduction in activity on the production site concerned by such product  including some workshops dedicated to the production of Estetrol. Although it is not possible at this stage to assess more precisely the consequences on future business and results incurred by the difficulties faced with this client  due to the aforementioned ongoing legal proceedings  the return to positive results announced for 2023 will be delayed.PCAS Group will continue to benefit from the support of its majority shareholder Seqens (owning 76.66%) for the financing of its activities and its development.NEXT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE:2022 Results  March 30  2023ABOUT PCASPCAS specializes in the development and production of complex molecules for life sciences and innovative technologies.

(NYSE:CNHI) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 2  2023Operator: Good day  and welcome to today's CNH Conference Call and Webcast. At this time  I'll hand the call over to Jason Omerza. Please go ahead.Jason Omerza: Thank you  Serge. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone. We would like to welcome you to the webcast and conference call for CNH Industrial's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Results for the period ending December 31  2022.

I will now turn the call over to Scott.Scott Wine: Thank you  Jason. And thanks  everyone  for joining our call. We finished 2022 with solid results as fourth quarter revenues were up over 27%  driving full-year consolidated revenues up 21%. Deliveries and product mix improved in both Agriculture and Construction. Our strength was broad-based  with double-digit year-over-year price realization coming from all regions. We expanded profit margins in both Agriculture and Construction despite significant input cost increases. The industry faced many other headwinds during the year  including a choppy supply chain  elevated freight costs  and ongoing inflation. Late in the year  these issues began to modestly improve. And we anticipate that will continue into 2023. The CNH team's creativity  hard work  and strong execution resulted in company records for both adjusted net income  up $2 billion for the year  and adjusted earnings per share  at $1.46  up 14% over 2021.Story continuesWe also generated $2 billion in free cash flow from industrial activities in the fourth quarter and $1.6 billion for the full-year as we over-delivered on our plans to complete and ship our accumulation of partially built units. This benefited our dealers and put us in a net cash position well ahead of our plan. Last year  we launched two potent margin improvement initiatives  the Strategic Sourcing Program  and the CNHI Business System  which we refer to as CBS. Continuous improvement is hard  especially in pursuit of breakthrough results. But our team has embraced this lean mindset  and is poised to deliver value across the business. Looking ahead  we remain focused on executing our strategy  including significant investments in out tech stack and product development.Derek Neilson and his team continue to drive exceptional performance  delivering a strong fourth quarter  with full-year net sales for the AG business up 22%. This growth was largely propelled by robust industry demand and significant year-over-year price realization  especially in North and South America. We saw improved product mix  including Precision AG revenues up 32%  which benefited from both an increased take rate for factor-fit precision options and incremental rate in sales. AG profitability remained healthy  with Q4 gross margins up 280 basis points  and adjusted EBIT margin up 310 points admittedly against an easy comp. Margins were down sequentially versus our record third quarter performance impacted by regional mix and the non-standard work required to finished units.Overall  I'm extremely pleased with the AG team's performance and results. For 2022  AG adjusted EBIT was nearly $2.5 billion  marking our highest profit in more than a decade. We are executing on our customer-centric strategy and customers have responded with continued demand for our high-end products at prices offsetting increased escalated production cost. They have also recognized us with improved net promoter scores  5% higher than in 2021. Derek and his team are ensuring that customer is at the center of all we do  driving the right behaviors and results. Stefano Pampalone and his Construction team executed quite well in the fourth quarter with strong momentum from Sampierana integration  manufacturing improvements  and enhanced customer focus; we expect even better progress in 2023  and beyond.2022 net sales were up 16% for both the full-year and the fourth quarter  with noteworthy growth in Europe and South America. Organic growth accounted for about two-thirds of the increase in the remainder  with the remainder attributed to Sampierana. Their excavator portfolio and technology innovations have enhanced our ability to meet customer needs  and their Eurocomach platforms provide an outstanding foundation for electrification. Construction adjusted EBIT for the quarter was $34 million at a 3.5% margin. Full-year adjusted EBIT was up 38%  to $124 million. And we are encouraged by the ongoing progress in Construction. The team is well-positioned to deliver on their strategic initiatives  support their dealers and customers  and gain market share.This past December  we held an engaging Tech Day to showcase our extensive suite of precision AG technology. Attendees met our deep team of experts in automation  autonomy  and connected platforms to better understand the cutting edge products we are developing. Through a series of live demo stations  the team exhibited the real world applications of our groundbreaking . The products and technology that we demonstrated at Tech Day that you see here on this page and those we will be releasing over the next few years  prove our commitment to being a leader in precision agriculture. We reiterate our expectation to deliver over $1 billion of Precision AG sales in 2023. I also want to highlight two recent investments made through our CNH Industrial Ventures arm.Stout Industrial Technology is a U.S.-based startup focused on AI-powered smart agriculture implements. EarthOptics has proprietary sensor technology that precisely measures soil health and structure. By taking minority stakes in these and similar companies through our Ventures portfolio  CNH is staying on the cutting edge of emerging technology to develop solutions to provide real advantages for customers. CHN remains committed to adding value and creating profitable growth for its customers and shareholders through sustainability. We have a strong history of sustainability performance as evidenced by our recognitions and our innovative products  including the New Holland methane tractor and electric mini excavator pictured here. In 2022  we pledged to set science-based targets that will enhance our operation's Scope 1 and 2 emissions goals  and establish a first-time decarbonization goals related to our products  which we'll announce later this year.With that  I will turn it over to Oddone to take you through our financial results. Oddone?Oddone Incisa: Yes  thank you  Scott  and good morning  good afternoon to everyone on the call. So  fourth quarter net sales from Industrial Activities  of nearly $6.4 billion  were up over 27% net of adverse FX impacts. Full-year net sales of Industrial Activities  of $21.5 billion  were up 21% or over 24% at constant currency. Continued price adjustments were significant drivers for the top line growth in the quarter  and volume and mix also accounted for around 15% sales increase from Q4  2021. Our Industrial segment's fourth quarter gross margin was 21.7%  and 22.2% for the full-year. The year-over-year margin improvement  of 1.5 points  is mainly due to strong and profitable growth in South America  and disciplined price realization globally  which more than offset rising productions cost.Q4 adjusted EBIT came in at $680 million  up $302 million from 2021  with a corresponding EBIT margin of 10.7%  a 310 business points improvement versus prior year. Full-year adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities was $2.4 billion with a margin of 11.3%  up 140 basis points from 2021. Free cash flow from Industrial Activities was $1.6 billion in 2022  which turned our initial Industrial Activities net debt into a net cash position of $362 million at the end of the year  as Scott discussed in his introductory slide. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $486 million  up $61 million compared to prior year. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $0.36  up $0.05 year-over-year  and full-year adjusted EPS was $1.46. Adjusted net income for the quarter was affected by a higher tax rate due to discreet items booked in Q4.The full-year adjusted effective tax rate was about 28% mainly due to the jurisdictional mix of pre-tax profit with higher rates coming from South America. And we will likely see the tax rate a point or two lower in 2023. Available liquidity  as of December 31  was $10.6 billion. And at the Annual General Meeting  the Board of CNH Industrial is planning to recommend an annual cash dividend of $0.36 per common share  totaling a little over $500 million in distribution to shareholders. In the fourth quarter  strong volumes and double-digit price realization continued to shield us from the steep increase in production costs. R&D and our SG&A expenses were higher by technology investments  inflation  and newly acquired businesses. Energy costs increased year-over-year but still accounted for about half-a-percent of our total costs worldwide.Agriculture adjusted EBIT increased by $287 million  to reach $701 million with a margin of 13.1%  up more than 300 basis points from the same quarter in 2021. The higher profits were driven by higher volumes and favorable pricing  which offset higher products cost  SG&A  and R&D expenses. Gross profit was up $394 million compared to Q4 2021  exceeding $1.2 billion with a margin of 13.1%. For the full-year  gross profit was up $989 million or up 140 basis points from 2021 largely driven by strong price realization coming from all regions and better product mix  including margin-rich technology-related sales growing by about 32%. Construction Equipment adjusted EBIT for Q4 increased by $14 million compared to Q4 2021  reaching $34 million with a margin of 3.5%.Industry  Tractors  ProductPhoto by Museums Victoria on UnsplashThese results were driven by favorable volume and positive price realization. But product cost  including site-related costs  were an outsized headwind for the business. Gross profit across the year was up $82 million compared to the full-year 2021  mainly due to higher volumes and stronger pricing. For our financial service business  net income in the fourth quarter was $75 million  down $50 million compared to 2021. Factors include high risk cost  provisions linked to the termination of the construction business in China  increased labor cost  and compressed margin in North America slightly mitigated by robust volumes across the region as well high recovery on those agreements. Retail originations were $2.9 billion in the quarter reaching $10 billion for the year  up to $100 million from 2021.The managed portfolio at the end of 2022 was $23.8 billion  up $4 billion on a constant currency basis. Delinquencies remained at a low level  up 10 basis points year-over-year to 1.3%. Increase from December 2021 is explained by the in-sourcing of the resolving credit account portfolio that was purchased in October 2022. CNH Industrial Capital America acquired receivables previously held by CD on a private label program that will now be run and booked by our company. Free cash flow from industrial activities in the quarter was over $2 billion on the back of $1.5 billion change in working capital driven in large part by the reduction in manufacturing inventory as we mentioned before. At the end of the year  the total gross debt for industrial activity was $5 billion with a net cash position of $362 million.So  within the first year of the spin-off  we were able to improve our net financial position by $1.5 billion on the back of the cash generated by the operations. This takes to our capital allocation priorities. And we have target spending $4.4 billion in combing R&D and CapEx over the 2022 - 2024 plan period  almost doubling what we were spending in the previous three years. In 2022  we spent the first $1.3 billion of that. And we remain committed to invest in our business to fuel profitable growth. We are confident the product and service we would bring to the market with the spending will ensure higher financial performance in the near future  and more importantly  higher efficiencies to our customers. Strong cash generation helps us maintaining our investment grade rating which has been re-affirmed or improved by all the rating agencies after the spin-off.We returned nearly $600 million to shareholders in 2022 through dividend and share repurchases. And as mentioned earlier  we proposed -- the proposed 2023 dividend itself will total above $500 million. And we plan continuing our share buyback program. We have the liquidity to funding organic growth and you are seeing use the ventures on for minority investments when opportunity arises. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and focus on maximizing value for our shareholders. This concludes my prepared remarks. And I will now turn it back to Scott.Scott Wine: Thank you  Oddone. Overall  demand continues to outstrip the industry's ability to supply at least in the near term  which despite record sales has actually dampened the industry levels. Spot commodity prices are trending down. But they are still generally above pre-2022 levels. And fortunately for farmers  fertilizers and other input cost are dropping as well. In North America  elevated farm incomes are sustaining demand for high horsepower tractors and combines. While small tractor demands has slowed from a lofty level seen over the past two years. We see the European Ag industry flattening as the macro-environment starts to impact equipment demand there. South America and Brazil in particular is a very good market for us.The business conditions in Brazil are inflexed following a presidential election. But we believe that the fundamentals are still positive for agriculture in the region. We also see good long-term opportunities in APAC. But this year will likely be slightly down. In construction  global demand is trending is lower. And we expect residential and commercial markets in North America and Europe to decline in 2023 due to rising interest rates. However  public construction spending at least partially fills in those gaps in United States. In Europe and South America  construction markets will be down in reaction to the overall macro-environment. We expect net sales of industrial activities to increase 6% to 10%. With confidence in the stickiness of our 2022 price increases  we expect to build on our margin gains by taking more cost out of our system.We are committed to growing market share. And we have the products  brands  and dealer network to do just that. Returning to full production in our North American plants will also help. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales remains one of the lowest in the industry. And despite inflationary pressures  we will severely limit SG&A growth. Free cash flow will be between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion. A little lower than last year as we have earmarked $1.6 billion for R&D and CapEx  up about $300 million from 2022. Even accounting for the increased R&D cost  our EBIT is projected to grow slightly faster than our top line. We are becoming a simpler  leaner company every day. And expect to modestly improve our industrial margins throughout the year. Earlier today  we announced that our Board of Directors has determined that our shareholders would be best served by a single listing in United States.The majority of our trading in CNH Industrial stock has been shifting to the New York Stock Exchange since the snip-off of Iveco Group. Revealing that CNH's new business profile and investor base better fit with the single New York Stock Exchange listing. Concentrating trading in one market will allow for increased liquidity of our stock  improve investor focus  further simplify the company's profile  enable broader index inclusion  and attract more passive investors. The current Italian regulations only permit the delisting of stocks when they are or will be listed on another EU exchange. By definition  the stock exchange does not qualify. CNH Industrial has an open dialog with Borsa Italiana on Euronext. And we told them about of our intention to leave the European listing.The harmonization and modernization of the Italian financial system  which is underway  is expected to include the New York Stock Exchange as an acceptable exchange. This is our preferred path for smooth delisting from Euronext Milan. But not the only option if this becomes untimely. We are targeting sole trading on NYSE by the end of 2023. But that could shift into 2024 depending on the timing of the regulation change. Rest assured  we will delist it soon as it is legally possible. At this point  we do not intend to change our incorporation in the Netherlands or our tax domicile in U.K. as part of the single listing. Therefore  we do not expect any material tax or trading consequences for our shareholders. Our Board of Directors and management team are grateful to Euronext Milan for being our listing venue for the past 10 years  and excited about the company's full return to the NYSE.I want to stress that this does not change the company's longstanding commitment to Italy and the Italian market. CNH employees over 5000 people in Italy made a significant investment with Sampierana acquisition in late 2021  opened its fifth plant in the country in 2022. We also have three R&D centers in Italy developing products that are sold around the world. While the delisting is another step in corporate simplification  real value creation comes from the business. We are now taking orders into Q4 in some markets. And overall demand remained strong. But the uncertain macro-environment  especially toward the end of 2023 requires vigilance as we strive to support our customers  dealers  suppliers  and employees. We expect to escalate combine CapEx and R&D investment as we launch exciting new products and build out the tech stack.We have already introduced some Raven-enabled products  and we will unveil more in 2023. But the real payoff for these higher margin precision solution kicks in 2024. We are happy to have finally secured a contract with UAW North America. The agreement we reached is fair for our employees and sustainable for the company. Employees returned to work this week. And we expect the two affected plants to ramp up to full production in the coming months. While the pace of inflation is slowing  it is still inflation. And we expect it to have an impact on our manufacturing  energy  SG&A  and R&D cost in 2023. On a more positive note  we are seeing modest supply chain improvements. Our primary margin improvement initiative  strategic sourcing  and CBS will start to yield results in 2023.I want to close by emphasizing again how proud I am of the team for what they have accomplished. And ensure you that we are ready to do even more in 2023. That concludes our prepared remarks. And I will now turn call over to Serge to open the line for questions.See also 20 Least Populated States in America and 13 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy.To continue reading the Q&A session  please click here.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.74,0.11,0.15,True,English,"['CNH Industrial N.V.', '2022 Earnings Call Transcript', 'CNHI', 'comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures', 'two potent margin improvement initiatives', 'significant input cost increases', 'CNH Industrial N.V.', 'record third quarter performance', 'U.S. Securities', 'CNH Industrial Web site', 'escalated production cost', 'Safe Harbor statement', 'choppy supply chain', 'free cash flow', 'Strategic Sourcing Program', 'factor-fit precision options', 'other periodic reports', 'many other headwinds', 'net cash position', 'net promoter scores', 'EU annual report', 'full-year consolidated revenues', 'Precision AG revenues', 'Q4 gross margins', 'fourth quarter revenues', 'year price realization', 'robust industry demand', 'The CNH team', 'strong fourth quarter', 'CNHI Business System', 'CNH Conference Call', 'full-year net sales', '2022 Earnings Call Transcript', 'Continuous improvement', 'EBIT margin', 'other use', 'significant investments', 'net income', '2022 net sales', 'industrial activities', 'significant year', 'recent report', 'continued demand', 'strong execution', 'exceptional performance', 'strong momentum', 'written consent', 'Oddone Incisa', 'looking statements', 'Additional information', 'Exchange Commission', 'equivalent authorities', 'product mix', 'profit margins', 'freight costs', 'ongoing inflation', 'hard work', 'lean mindset', 'product development', 'AG business', 'South America', 'take rate', 'incremental rate', 'AG profitability', 'easy comp', 'regional mix', 'standard work', 'highest profit', 'a decade', 'high-end products', 'right behaviors', 'Stefano Pampalone', 'Sampierana integration', 'manufacturing improvements', 'double-digit year', 'Jason Omerza', 'Good morning', 'good afternoon', 'Full-Year Results', 'Scott Wine', 'presentation material', 'actual results', 'company presentation', 'solid results', 'company records', 'breakthrough results', 'AG team', 'Derek Neilson', 'customer-centric strategy', 'customer focus', 'Construction team', 'February', 'Operator', 'today', 'Webcast', 'time', 'Serge', 'everyone', 'December', 'recording', 'transmission', 'portion', 'broadcast', 'CEO', 'CFO', 'download', 'forward', 'risks', 'uncertainties', 'factors', '20-F', 'filings', 'Netherlands', 'Italy', 'reconciliations', 'Deliveries', 'Agriculture', 'strength', 'regions', 'issues', 'creativity', 'share', 'Story', 'plans', 'units', 'dealers', 'CBS', 'pursuit', 'value', 'stack', 'growth', 'North', 'customers', 'prices', 'center', 'progress']",2023-02-07,2023-02-07,finance.yahoo.com

The Group's three businesses contributed to growth  which came in at 15.6% (9.1% like-for-like) for turnover of ‚Ç¨206.3 million.

The business continued to report strong demand in distribution channels for energy renovation  wood and the AM-X product. It also benefited from the latest acquisitions: MGT and Poralu.Building Materials Trading was up 6.5% compared with the same period in 2021  driven by good momentum in Structural Works  joinery and Public Works  as well as showroom and self-service rollouts.Concrete Industry  with 11.4% growth (1.2% like-for-like)  benefited from the integration of ready-mix concrete plants in the Aquitaine region (Audoin & Fils) and from good momentum in precast concrete.Overall  HERIGE recorded a turnover of ‚Ç¨792.9 million in 2022  up 11.4% (8.3% like-for-like)  thanks to its responsiveness and ability to anticipate inflation.Outlook and developmentsIn view of the performance achieved over the full year  as well as the Group's discipline in protecting its margins  HERIGE expects to deliver a solid operating performance for the year ended December 31  2022.The Group is taking a cautious approach to 2023 in an uncertain geopolitical and macroeconomic environment marked by rising interest rates and persistently high inflation  as well as a slowdown in the new construction market.

This approach is particularly well suited to Europe  where clients are willing to pay a higher price if projects are started quickly.The new financing is Sustainability-Linked  i.e. the interest rates will potentially be affected by the Group's achievement of the following non-financial objectives:Occupational health and safety performance;Business conduct and ethics;Environmental  Social and Governance (""ESG"") performance of the company as assessed by the Ga√Øa extra-financial rating carried out by the EthiFinance1 agency.This loan was contracted with a syndicate of eight banking partners: BNP Paribas  CACIB as Mandated Arrangers and Bookrunners  Natixis as Lead Arranger and Credit Agent  and Ark√©a  Pireaus  La Banque Postale  CIC and Goldman Sachs as Arrangers.EthiFinance conducted the extra-financial analysis of Voltalia to establish its ESG rating.Next on the agenda: FY 2022 Results  on March 23  2023 (before market opening)About Voltalia (www.voltalia.com) Voltalia is an international player in the renewable energy sector.

In particular  in view of Euronav's upcoming general shareholders' meeting convened at the request of CMB NV that will be held on 23 March 2023  Euronav believes that governance tailored to all of Euronav's shareholders and stakeholders  with directors with a constructive mindset  should remain Euronav's goal  which requires retaining a proportional independence and a high degree of continuity of the Supervisory Board to ensure value protection for all shareholders and compliance with Belgian corporate governance standards.For this purpose  on 4 February 2023  the Euronav Supervisory Board sent a letter to CMB NV and Famatown Finance Limited to request each of them to consider a Euronav Supervisory Board composition representing the current proportionate shareholding structure of Euronav  with two (2) newly appointed non-independent members nominated by CMB NV (being Messrs. Marc Saverys and Patrick De Brabandere) and two (2) newly appointed nonindependent members to be nominated by Famatown Finance Limited. CMB NV has on 6 February 2023 responded that it is not inclined to agree and that all mandates should be up for discussion to allow for a comprehensive deliberation. Famatown has not responded to the contents of the proposal.Euronav will continue to update the market in accordance with applicable regulations.Contact: Contact: Brian Gallagher - Head of IR Communications & Management Board member Tel: +44 20 78 70 04 36 Email: IR@euronav.comAnnouncement final year results 2022: 31 March 2023About Euronav NVEuronav is an independent tanker company engaged in the ocean transportation and storage of crude oil.

The Company expects a sharp rebound in 2024 and a return to a normalized profitability in 2025.The Company has experienced operational challenges over the past months on the back of a very busy year. Post-Covid demand has been strong and MPC delivered 70 major films with heavy special effects content in 2022.Alongside this sustained demand  Technicolor Creative Studios had to face a significant shortage of experienced talents which have caused delays on both ongoing projects and the start of new ones and highlighted the need for improved project management and monitoring to deliver on time.In addition to this lack of adequate resources  operations were negatively impacted by internal reorganisations at MPC and the Mill post-Covid.Mikros Animation and Technicolor Games have continued to perform in line with expectations.The Company has been focused on its program to address these operational issuesThird-party reviews by renown firms are helping the Company to identify areas for improvements from a financial  reporting and operational perspective.Continued improvement of real-time project tracking with action-orientated process to resolve current delivery issues.

(NYSE:CLB) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 2  2023 Operator: Good morning  and welcome to the Core Laboratories Fourth...,Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 2  2023Operator: Good morning  and welcome to the Core Laboratories Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. . After today's presentation  there will be an opportunity to ask questions. . Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Larry Bruno  Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.Larry Bruno: Thanks Drew. Good morning in the Americas  good afternoon in Europe  Africa and the Middle East  and good evening in Asia-Pacific. We'd like to welcome all of our shareholders  analysts  and most importantly  our employees to Core Laboratories fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning  I'm joined by Chris Hill  Core's Chief Financial Officer; and Gwen Gresham  Core's Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. The call will be divided into six segments. Gwen will start by making remarks regarding forward-looking statements. We'll then have some opening comments  including a high-level review of important factors in Core's Q4 and full-year 2022 performance. In addition  we'll review Core's strategies and the three financial tenets that the Company employs to build long-term shareholder value.Chris will then give a detailed financial overview and have additional comments regarding shareholder value. Following Chris  Gwen will provide some comments on the Company's outlook and guidance. I'll then review Core's two operating segments  detailing our progress and discussing the continued successful introduction and deployment of Core Labs' technologies  as well as highlighting some of Core's operations and major projects worldwide. Then we'll open the phones for a Q&A session. I'll now turn the call over to Gwen for remarks on forward-looking statements.Gwen Gresham: Before we start the conference this morning  I'll mention that some of the statements we make during this call may include projections  estimates and other forward-looking information. This would include any discussion of the Company's business outlook. These types of forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K  as well as other reports and registration statements filed by us with the SEC and the AFM. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise.Story continuesOur comments also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release announcing our fourth quarter results. Those non-GAAP measures can also be found on our website. With that said  I'll pass the discussion back to Larry.Larry Bruno: Thanks  Gwen. For the fourth quarter of 2022 Core Lab achieved sequential improvement in revenue  operating income  operating margins  and EPS with strong incremental margins. These improvements translated into higher free cash flow  which enabled the company to reduce net debt by $11.7 million or 7%. We remained focused on executing our key financial strategies including reducing debt and strengthening our balance sheet. For the full-year 2022  revenue was $490 million  increasing by more than 4% compared to 2021. However  for 2022  revenue for the full-year was adversely impacted by currency devaluation of the Euro and British pound. Using a constant dollar exchange rate  2022 revenue would've been nearly $13 million higher.For the full company operating margins for the fourth quarter grew to 12%  up from 11% in Q3. Full company sequential incremental margins ex-items exceeded 80%  driven by a strong quarter in production enhancement. Reservoir Description margins lagged after two successive quarters with very high incrementals  reflecting adverse impacts from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The Russia-Ukraine conflict posed a headwind to revenue in the fourth quarter and throughout most of 2022  as trading patterns for crude oil and derived products were disrupted in Europe  Russia  and Ukraine. For 2022  demand for laboratory services tied to the assay of crude oil and derived products in these regions declined in excess of $9 million year-over-year offsetting growth in other international regions.Lastly  for the full company  quarter-over-quarter  EPS grew sequentially by 11% to $0.20 per share ex-items. As we look ahead  Core will continue to execute on its key strategic objectives by one  introducing new product and service offerings in key geographic markets; two  maintaining a lean and focused organization; and three  maintaining our commitment to de-levering the company. Now to review Core Lab's strategies and the financial tenants that Core has used to build shareholder value over our 27 plus year history as a publicly traded company. The interests of our shareholders  clients  and employees will always be well served by Core Lab's resilient culture  which relies on innovation  leveraging technology to solve problems and dedicated customer service.I'll talk more about some of our latest innovations in the operational review section of this call. While we navigate through the current challenges and pursue growth opportunities  the company will remained focused on its three longstanding  long-term financial tenants. Those being to maximize free cash flow  maximize return on invested capital  and returning excess free cash to our shareholders. Before moving on  I want to thank our employees for the dedication  loyalty  and adaptability in meeting all of our clients' needs and for the commitment that many have shown as we navigate the moment and prepare for more active market. I'll now turn it over to Chris for the detailed financial review.Chris Hill: Thanks  Larry. I would like to begin by highlighting a couple of announcements we made since our last call. As you may be aware  the company shares were previously dual listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Euronext Amsterdam Exchange. However  as we rationalize benefits versus the cost of maintaining the dual listing  we decided to de-list the shares from the Amsterdam Exchange  which became effective in early December of last year. In following the de-listing of the shares on January 17 of this year  we announced our plan to reorganize the company's corporate structure which includes redomesticating the parent company from the Netherlands to the United States. The company and its Board believes the redomestication will enhance long-term shareholder value by reducing administrative costs  simplifying the corporate structure  as well as gaining some operational efficiencies.The company filed a preliminary prospectus and proxy statement associated with the redomestication  which will require shareholder approval. We anticipate the redomestication transaction will be completed sometime in the first half of this year. Before we review the financial performance for the quarter  the guidance we gave on our last call and past calls specifically excluded the impact of any FX gains or losses and assumed an effective tax rate of 20%. So accordingly  our discussion today excludes any foreign exchange gain or loss for current and prior periods. Additionally  the GAAP financial results for the fourth quarter include a non-cash adjustment of $1.9 million  which decreased stock compensation expense associated with performance share awards  which vested during the quarter.This adjustment has also been excluded from the discussion of our fourth quarter and full-year results. Now looking at the income statement  revenue from continuing operations was $127.6 million in the fourth quarter  up slightly from $126 million in the prior quarter. The sequential increase in revenue was driven by growth in both the U.S. and international markets. However  nice growth in multiple international regions has been partially offset by continued disruptions caused by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict  which adversely impacted service revenue in the affected regions. Of this revenue  service revenue  which is more international  was $88.9 million for the quarter up from $87.9 million last quarter. During the quarter  we saw nice sequential growth of 11% in the U.S.  which was led by our laboratory services and well diagnostic services.We also see nice sequential improvement in multiple international regions outside the areas impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However  the Russia-Ukraine conflict has continued to disrupt the trading patterns and flow of oil in the affected regions. The realignment of these trading patterns still continues  and the realignment of these trading patterns has not been consistent or linear. For example  in Europe  our crude oil assay activity increased during the third quarter  but activity decreased again in the fourth quarter. The company believes these trading patterns will become more stable throughout 2023  and we will continue to monitor the changes to the trading patterns and appropriately adopt -- adapt our operations accordingly.For the full-year of 2022  service revenue of $347 million was relatively flat compared to $344.3 million in 2021. As Larry mentioned  two main factors have adversely impacted our international revenue by over $20 million in 2022. The devaluation of certain currencies  primarily the Euro and British pound; and disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict as we just discussed. Product sales  which is equally tied to North America and international activity were $38.6 million for the quarter  up slightly compared to $38.1 million last quarter. International product sales for the quarter were up 15% sequentially  and our energetic sales to the U.S. market were also up sequentially. However  this growth was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $2 million in other product sales.For the full-year of 2022  product sales revenue was of $142.8 million was up 13% from $125.9 million in 2021. Moving on to the cost of services ex-items for the quarter are 78% of service revenue  which is comparable to last quarter. The service side of our business has been more impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict  although we see improvements in absorption of costs and nice incremental margins in regions where activity is expanding these gains are being offset by disruption to the business in other regions more directly impacted by the conflict. Cost of sales ex-items in the fourth quarter were 79% of revenue and improved from 82% last quarter. The improvement this quarter was primarily driven by gains in manufacturing efficiencies and higher international sales.Manufacturing costs continue to increase due to inflation on materials and other operating costs. However  some of the impact has been mitigated through gains in manufacturing efficiencies and some improvement in pricing. G&A ex-items for the quarter was $10.4 million  relatively flat compared to last quarter. For the full-year of 2022  G&A ex-items was $39.3 million  up from $37 million in 2021 due to restoration of employee compensation and benefits. For 2023  we expect G&A to be approximately $40 million to $42 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $4.1 million and comparable to last quarter. For the full-year depreciation and amortization expense was $17.2 million  down from $18.5 million in 2021. EBIT ex-items for the quarter was $14.7 million  up 10% from $13.3 million last quarter  and representing an EBIT margin of approximately 12%  which is also up from 11% last quarter.Operating income for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis was $15.6 million. And for the full-year of 2022  EBIT ex-items was $44.8 million  down from $52.3 million in the prior year and on a GAAP basis  EBIT was $41.5 million for 2022 and $45.3 million in 2021. Interest expense was $3.1 million in comparable to last quarter and interest expense ex-items for the full-year was $11.4 million  up slightly from $11 million in 2021. Although  interest rates have significantly increased throughout 2022 the company has substantially offset the impact of this increase by reducing our outstanding debt. On a GAAP basis  interest expense for the full-year of 2022 was $11.6 million  up from $9.2 million in 2021  as 2021 interest expense included a $1.4 million gain associated with settling some of our interest rate hedges last year.Income tax expense ex-items and using an effective tax rate of 20% for the quarter was $2.3 million. On a GAAP basis  the company recorded income tax expense of $5.8 million for the quarter. And for the full-year  income tax expense was $10.3 million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 34% for 2022. However  income tax expense was significantly increased in 2022 due to the devaluation of foreign currencies  primarily Turkey and the United Kingdom  which we discussed in prior quarters. Excluding the impact associated with the devaluation of the Turkish lira and British pound  the company's effective tax rate would've been approximately 18%. The effective tax rate will continue to be somewhat sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings across the globe and the impact of items discrete to each quarter.However  we continue to project the company's effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. Income from continuing operations ex-items for the quarter was $9.3 million  up 11% sequentially from $8.3 million last quarter. For the full-year 2022 ex-items  it was $26.8 million  down from $33 million in 2021. GAAP income from continuing operations for the quarter was $6.7 million  and for the full-year 2022 was $19.7 million. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations ex-items was $0.20 for the quarter  up from $0.18 last quarter  and was $0.57 for the full-year of 2022. GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $0.14 for the quarter and $0.42 for the full-year. Now moving on to the balance sheet  receivables were $106.9 million at December 31  up $6.7 million from last quarter end.Petroleum  Industry  LaboratoryPhoto by Gritte on UnsplashOur DSOs for the fourth quarter were at 70 days also up when compared to 67 days last quarter. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of billings during the quarter and a slightly higher mix of international revenue  which generally has a longer collection period. Inventory finished the year at $60.4 million  up approximately $5.6 million from last quarter end. Inventory turns for the quarter were at 2.1 down from 2.3 in the last quarter  and primarily down due to shipping delays postponing some larger international sales into 2023. As previously highlighted  the company continues to experience an increase in cost of raw materials  labor  packaging  and transportation costs  which are increasing the cost of inventory. Additionally  challenges in the supply chain persist  which will continue to require carrying a larger amount of inventory to help mitigate disruptions.We anticipate inventory turns will remain at similar levels  but we have a focused effort for improvement as we progress into 2023. On the liability side of the balance sheet  our long-term debt was $175 million at December 31 and was reduced by $10 million this quarter. Our debt is currently comprised of our senior notes at $135 million as well as $40 million outstanding under our bank revolving credit facility. As Larry mentioned earlier  our free cash flow has also improved as the company's financial performance has improved the last couple of quarters. Our free cash flow continues to be focused on reducing outstanding debt  considering cash of $15.4 million  our net debt was $159.6 million at year-end  a reduction of $11.7 million this quarter  which also improved our leverage ratio to 2.29 from 2.42 at last quarter end.Since announcing the company's commitment and focus on reducing debt in the fourth quarter of 2019  we have reduced net debt by 46%. The company will continue applying free cash towards reducing debt  so that company reaches its target leverage ratio of 1.5 or lower. Looking at cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2022  cash flow from operating activities was $13.2 million  and after paying for $2 million of CapEx  our free cash flow was $11.2 million for the quarter. Our free cash flow generated this quarter is the highest we have achieved since the third quarter of 2020. Looking forward to 2023  we expect CapEx to modestly expand and will continue to remain in line with historical levels  but also be aligned with activity levels. For the full-year of 2023  we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $12 million to $15 million  which is an increase from $10.2 million in 2022.Core will continue our strict capital discipline and asset-like business model with capital expenditures primarily targeted at growth opportunities and initiatives. Core Lab's operational leverage continues to provide for the ability to grow revenue and profitability with minimal capital requirements. Capital expenditures have historically ranged from 2.5% to 4% of revenue even during periods of significant growth. That same level of laboratory infrastructure  intellectual property  and leverage exists in the business today. We believe evaluating a company's ability to generate free cash flow and free cash flow yield is an important metric for shareholders when comparing and projecting company's financial results  particularly for those shareholders who utilize discounted cash flow models to assess valuations.I will now turn it over to Gwen for an update on our guidance and outlook.Gwen Gresham: Thank you  Chris. Looking forward into 2023  we see crude oil macro fundamentals continuing to support a multi-year recovery cycle for the oil and gas industry. Crude oil demand for 2023 as forecasted by the International Energy Agency in January of this year is projected to increase by 1.9 million barrels per day to a record 101.7 million barrels per day as consumption in China grows along with the reopening of its economy. As crude oil demand is projected to exceed pre-COVID levels  crude-oil supply is projected to tighten. Production growth continues to face constraints due to prolonged underinvestment in many regions around the globe as well as natural decline of production from existing fields. As a result  we expect operators to expand their upstream spending plans for 2023 by mid-teens compared to 2022.This supports our continued improvement in international onshore and offshore activity  with projects emerging and underway  most notably across the Middle East  Latin America and West Africa regions. Moving on to the U.S.  we see similar challenges with crude oil supply which should require increased spending by operators to grow and replace production. While operators remain focused on capital discipline  2023 forecasts indicate their U.S. upstream spending will increase by approximately 15% year- over-year. Turning to the first quarter of 2023  we anticipate Reservoir Description to be down low to mid-single-digits sequentially. There are two factors causing the sequential decline in revenue. First  the typical seasonal industry pattern  which will cause activity in the first quarter to decline in some regions; and second  continued volatility with crude oil trading patterns which may impact Reservoir Description's international growth within its Russian  Ukrainian  and European operations.Helping to offset these revenue headwinds  we will see an increase in international upstream project activity  which is currently underway. For Production Enhancement  revenue is estimated to be up mid-single-digit as U.S. land activity is projected to recover from normal seasonal declines experienced at year-end. We project first quarter 2023 revenue to range from $125 million to $129 million and operating income of $11.5 million to $14.5 million  yielding operating margins of approximately 10%. EPS for the first quarter is expected to range from $0.14 to $0.19. The company's first quarter guidance is based on projections for underlying operations and excludes gains and losses in foreign exchange. First quarter guidance also assumes an effective tax rate of 20%.Now  I'll pass the discussion back to Larry.Larry Bruno: Thanks  Gwen. First  I'd like to thank our global team of employees for providing innovative solutions  integrity  and superior service to our clients. The team's collective dedication to servicing our clients is the foundation of Core Lab's success. Turning first to Reservoir Description  for the fourth quarter of 2022  revenue came in at just over $78 million down slightly compared to Q3. When looking at revenue growth for Reservoir Description  it is important to consider the sharp devaluation of the Euro and the British pound. These currency devaluations lowered Reservoir Description revenue for the full-year  by more than $12 million using 2021 exchange rates. Operating income for Reservoir Description ex-items was $6 million  and operating margins were 8%.Growth across most regions was offset by impacts from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Demand for crude oil and derived product assay work across Europe  Russia  and Ukraine  which rebounded somewhat during Q3  subsequently slowed in Q4 as sanctions became formalized. As previously discussed  we expect continued volatility and demand for these laboratory services as global trading patterns realign. However  as Gwen mentioned  the International Energy Agency recently forecast crude oil demand for 2023 to average a record high 101.7 million barrels per day  up by 1.9 million barrels per day from 2022  even after assessing global financial forecasts. This bodes well for growing demand for Reservoir Description's assay work. As we look ahead  while still well below pre-COVID levels  we see the growing international rig count as a harbinger of an improving landscape for Reservoir Description a trend that we project will play out for the next several years particularly in the Middle East  North and South America and most other regions.Early movers in the oilfield service sector that are more exposed to well construction have already felt the impact of this cycle shift. As projects progress into field appraisal  field development  and eventually production demand for Core Lab's Reservoir Description services will rise accordingly. Now for some operational highlights from the fourth quarter  Core Lab's Reservoir Description services were employed on both U.S. and international projects to help our clients evaluate their assets and develop programs to optimize production. Under the direction of a South American National Oil Company  Core Lab conducted a series of Enhanced Oil Recovery and flow assurance studies for a multi-well onshore program as evaluating the use of CO2-rich injection gases.This laboratory work is determining the impact of blending these CO2-rich gases with existing reservoir fluids and are providing the basis for advanced equation-of-state modeling. While defining the gas injection parameters for a successful field application are critical to improving crude oil recoveries  operators must also assess the potential for the injected CO2 to unintendedly cause flocculation of asphaltenes. These long chain asphaltene molecules can clog pores in the rock and impair permeability  thus reducing the effectiveness of CO2 injection programs. Broadly  CO2 injection projects like this reflect a globally expanding interest in enhanced oil recovery and carbon capture and storage technologies. When properly evaluated with rigorous laboratory testing  injecting CO2 into hydrocarbon bearing subsurface formations can simultaneously improve oil recovery and reduce CO2 emissions.Also  during the fourth quarter of 2022  Core completed an integrated study on conventional core from a lower Barnett shale pilot well in the Permian Basin. The key objectives of the study were to evaluate the resource potential of the strata and identify landing zone targets that will optimize stimulation and hydrocarbon production. Core analysis data acquire from the pilot well was benchmarked against key performance indicators from 21 wells in Core Lab's proprietary Woodford-Barnett joint industry project to provide insights into future production potential of the play. Core applied its new proprietary prism mudstone laboratory workflow  which combines advanced petrophysical and geochemical technologies  including measurements from high frequency  nuclear magnetic resonance and multi-rate pyrolysis to also provide rapid assessment of mobile versus non-mobile hydrocarbons in the rocks.The Prism workflow also refined petrophysical models and allow for refined calibration of downhole logs  which in turn resulted in an increase in both calculated reserves and estimated ultimate recovery. Moving now to Production Enhancement  where Core Lab technologies continue to help our clients optimize their well completions. Revenue for Production Enhancement came in at $49 million  up 5% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year. Operating income ex-items was $7.7 million  while operating margins were 16% for the fourth quarter of 2022 and sequential margins were more than 100%. During the fourth quarter of 2022  Core Lab continued to build on the success of its expand  casing and tubing patch technology. The industry-leading versatility and reliability of the expand system yield significant savings in the remediation of all types of wells with casing damage  ranging from oil and gas producers through to disposal and geothermal wells.Recently  an operator in Alaska had casing leaks in a horizontal water disposal well at four different depths over a 5 000-foot interval. As the disposal well were to become unavailable  hydrocarbon production from nearby oil and gas wells would need to be severely curtailed. Remedial steps that would have otherwise required a workover rig would have been both costly and time-consuming. Instead  Core Lab experts recommended placing four separate expand patches via wireline with a configuration that would enable operations in this highly deviated wellbore. All four patches were successfully deployed  set on depth and the well passed the mandatory mechanical integrity tests required by state authorities. This allowed the disposal operation to continue rigless intervention to repair the well with expand resulted in significant cost savings and enable the nearby producing wells to maintain hydrocarbon output.To-date  Core Lab has run over 100 000 feet of proprietary casing and tubing patches. The expand system has a proven track record of reliability and is one of the most effective solutions of its type. That concludes our operational review. We appreciate your participation. And Drew will now open the call for questions.See also 10 Cheap Lithium Stocks To Buy and 15 Largest Ophtalmology Companies in the World .To continue reading the Q&A session  please click here.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.4,0.12,0.48,True,English,"['Core Laboratories N.V.', 'Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript', 'NYSE', 'CLB', 'Core Laboratories Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call', 'Full company sequential incremental margins', 'higher free cash flow', 'constant dollar exchange rate', 'Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript', 'Core Laboratories N.V.', 'comparable GAAP financial measures', 'full company operating margins', 'strong incremental margins', 'Reservoir Description margins', 'Chief Financial Officer', 'Senior Vice President', 'three financial tenets', 'detailed financial overview', 'Q&A session', 'recent Annual Report', 'two successive quarters', 'key strategic objectives', 'key geographic markets', 'fourth quarter results', 'two operating segments', '27 plus year history', ""Core Labs' technologies"", 'long-term shareholder value', 'key financial strategies', 'other international regions', 'other forward-looking information', 'GAAP measures', 'sequential improvement', 'strong quarter', 'financial tenants', 'operating income', 'other reports', 'six segments', 'actual results', 'new information', 'forward-looking statements', 'Good morning', 'good afternoon', 'Middle East', 'good evening', 'Investor Relations', 'high-level review', 'important factors', 'successful introduction', 'major projects', 'business outlook', 'Form 10-K', 'future events', 'press release', 'balance sheet', 'currency devaluation', 'British pound', 'production enhancement', 'high incrementals', 'adverse impacts', 'Russia-Ukraine conflict', 'trading patterns', 'crude oil', 'laboratory services', 'new product', 'service offerings', 'focused organization', 'registration statements', 'Larry Bruno', 'opening comments', 'additional comments', 'net debt', 'Chris Hill', 'Gwen Gresham', 'full-year 2022 performance', 'derived products', 'NYSE', 'CLB', 'Operator', 'participants', 'listen', 'mode', 'today', 'presentation', 'opportunity', 'questions', 'conference', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'Americas', 'Europe', 'Africa', 'Asia-Pacific', 'shareholders', 'analysts', 'employees', 'Head', 'remarks', 'guidance', 'progress', 'continued', 'deployment', 'operations', 'phones', 'projections', 'estimates', 'discussion', 'types', 'number', 'risks', 'uncertainties', 'SEC', 'AFM.', 'obligation', 'Reconciliation', 'website', 'revenue', 'EPS', 'improvements', 'Q3.', 'items', 'demand', 'assay', 'excess', 'growth', 'lean', 'commitment', 'interests', 'clients']",2023-02-07,2023-02-07,finance.yahoo.com

Sales growth was driven mainly by sales of Estetrol for Mithra (to be put in perspective  however  with the difficulties faced in recovering certain corresponding receivables from this company)  a strong demand for products from the Turku site  a favorable EUR/USD exchange rate  and the impact of price increases implemented over the past months to cover the very sharp increase in the cost of raw materials and energy.Fine Specialty ChemicalsNet sales of Fine Specialty Chemicals totaled ‚Ç¨82.7 million  a 22.7% increase compared to 2021 (a 18.6% increase at a constant exchange rate). Business has been robust throughout the year with a very strong demand for Electronics and Cosmetics and a positive trend in Lubricants and Fine Chemicals. The increase in the cost of raw materials and energy has been passed through to customers and has thus contributed to the growth of net sales. The dynamics in the industrialization of new products was also very good.OutlookAs announced on November 3rd and December 21st  2022  2022 results will remain very negative  as the level of activity remains insufficient to cover fixed costs at several Pharmaceutical Synthesis sites  and due to inventory depreciations for out-of-specification products. Further  these results may be revised depending on the evolution of the ongoing legal proceedings relating to the sales of Estetrol. A follow-up will be provided when the 2022 results will be released on March 30  2023.In this context  PCAS has to study a temporary reduction in activity on the production site concerned by such product  including some workshops dedicated to the production of Estetrol. Although it is not possible at this stage to assess more precisely the consequences on future business and results incurred by the difficulties faced with this client  due to the aforementioned ongoing legal proceedings  the return to positive results announced for 2023 will be delayed.PCAS Group will continue to benefit from the support of its majority shareholder Seqens (owning 76.66%) for the financing of its activities and its development.NEXT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE:2022 Results  March 30  2023ABOUT PCASPCAS specializes in the development and production of complex molecules for life sciences and innovative technologies.
