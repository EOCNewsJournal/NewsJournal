Sales growth was driven mainly by sales of Estetrol for Mithra (to be put in perspective  however  with the difficulties faced in recovering certain corresponding receivables from this company)  a strong demand for products from the Turku site  a favorable EUR/USD exchange rate  and the impact of price increases implemented over the past months to cover the very sharp increase in the cost of raw materials and energy.Fine Specialty ChemicalsNet sales of Fine Specialty Chemicals totaled ‚Ç¨82.7 million  a 22.7% increase compared to 2021 (a 18.6% increase at a constant exchange rate). Business has been robust throughout the year with a very strong demand for Electronics and Cosmetics and a positive trend in Lubricants and Fine Chemicals. The increase in the cost of raw materials and energy has been passed through to customers and has thus contributed to the growth of net sales. The dynamics in the industrialization of new products was also very good.Story continuesOutlookAs announced on November 3rd and December 21st  2022  2022 results will remain very negative  as the level of activity remains insufficient to cover fixed costs at several Pharmaceutical Synthesis sites  and due to inventory depreciations for out-of-specification products. Further  these results may be revised depending on the evolution of the ongoing legal proceedings relating to the sales of Estetrol. A follow-up will be provided when the 2022 results will be released on March 30  2023.In this context  PCAS has to study a temporary reduction in activity on the production site concerned by such product  including some workshops dedicated to the production of Estetrol. Although it is not possible at this stage to assess more precisely the consequences on future business and results incurred by the difficulties faced with this client  due to the aforementioned ongoing legal proceedings  the return to positive results announced for 2023 will be delayed.PCAS Group will continue to benefit from the support of its majority shareholder Seqens (owning 76.66%) for the financing of its activities and its development.NEXT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE:2022 Results  March 30  2023ABOUT PCASPCAS specializes in the development and production of complex molecules for life sciences and innovative technologies.

This new credit line replicates the innovative framework of those put in place in 2019 and 2021: the interest rate may be subsidized depending on the achievement of certain Environmental  Social and Governance (ESG) criteria.""The signing of this new syndicated loan allows us to almost double the amount of bank facilities we have at our disposal today. We warmly thank our banking partners  both old and new  for this vote of confidence. As in 2019 and 2021  this financing  the cost of which will be linked to the achievement of non-financial objectives  underlines our desire to pursue concrete CSR actions in the exercise of our mission: improving the global environment by promoting local development""  said S√©bastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.The 250 million euros loan  with a maturity of 5 years extendable to 7 years  is composed of a revolving credit facility (for two thirds) and a term loan that can be drawn down for two years (for one third). The loan also benefits from an extension clause allowing the amount to be increased during the life of the loan.This new syndicated loan comes in addition to the 170 million euros already in place in June 2021. Its purpose is to strengthen the Group's financial flexibility in the context of its continued growth. It will be used  for example  to pre-finance construction work on new power plants before project financing is drawn down. This approach is particularly well suited to Europe  where clients are willing to pay a higher price if projects are started quickly.The new financing is Sustainability-Linked  i.e. the interest rates will potentially be affected by the Group's achievement of the following non-financial objectives:Story continuesOccupational health and safety performance;Business conduct and ethics;Environmental  Social and Governance (""ESG"") performance of the company as assessed by the Ga√Øa extra-financial rating carried out by the EthiFinance1 agency.This loan was contracted with a syndicate of eight banking partners: BNP Paribas  CACIB as Mandated Arrangers and Bookrunners  Natixis as Lead Arranger and Credit Agent  and Ark√©a  Pireaus  La Banque Postale  CIC and Goldman Sachs as Arrangers.EthiFinance conducted the extra-financial analysis of Voltalia to establish its ESG rating.Next on the agenda: FY 2022 Results  on March 23  2023 (before market opening)About Voltalia (www.voltalia.com) Voltalia is an international player in the renewable energy sector.

Additionally  the evolution of the circular economy is highly impacting the e-commerce landscape  contributing to the surge in customer-to-customer (C2C) parcel volumes and delivery services. These trends are leading carriers to look for ways to scale their first-mile activity and innovate to reduce the associated rising costs. Thanks to Quadient‚Äôs modular design  the Drop Box and Printer comes as a unit that can be added to new or existing locker configurations. This module enables consumers to place packages directly into the Drop Box by simply scanning a barcode label  maximising parcel volume while minimising the locker footprint. Users also have the ability to print standard shipping labels directly from the built-in printer.

The Company expects a sharp rebound in 2024 and a return to a normalized profitability in 2025.The Company has experienced operational challenges over the past months on the back of a very busy year. Post-Covid demand has been strong and MPC delivered 70 major films with heavy special effects content in 2022.Alongside this sustained demand  Technicolor Creative Studios had to face a significant shortage of experienced talents which have caused delays on both ongoing projects and the start of new ones and highlighted the need for improved project management and monitoring to deliver on time.In addition to this lack of adequate resources  operations were negatively impacted by internal reorganisations at MPC and the Mill post-Covid.Mikros Animation and Technicolor Games have continued to perform in line with expectations.The Company has been focused on its program to address these operational issuesThird-party reviews by renown firms are helping the Company to identify areas for improvements from a financial  reporting and operational perspective.Continued improvement of real-time project tracking with action-orientated process to resolve current delivery issues.

Sales growth was driven mainly by sales of Estetrol for Mithra (to be put in perspective  however  with the difficulties faced in recovering certain corresponding receivables from this company)  a strong demand for products from the Turku site  a favorable EUR/USD exchange rate  and the impact of price increases implemented over the past months to cover the very sharp increase in the cost of raw materials and energy.Fine Specialty ChemicalsNet sales of Fine Specialty Chemicals totaled ‚Ç¨82.7 million  a 22.7% increase compared to 2021 (a 18.6% increase at a constant exchange rate). Business has been robust throughout the year with a very strong demand for Electronics and Cosmetics and a positive trend in Lubricants and Fine Chemicals. The increase in the cost of raw materials and energy has been passed through to customers and has thus contributed to the growth of net sales. The dynamics in the industrialization of new products was also very good.OutlookAs announced on November 3rd and December 21st  2022  2022 results will remain very negative  as the level of activity remains insufficient to cover fixed costs at several Pharmaceutical Synthesis sites  and due to inventory depreciations for out-of-specification products. Further  these results may be revised depending on the evolution of the ongoing legal proceedings relating to the sales of Estetrol. A follow-up will be provided when the 2022 results will be released on March 30  2023.In this context  PCAS has to study a temporary reduction in activity on the production site concerned by such product  including some workshops dedicated to the production of Estetrol. Although it is not possible at this stage to assess more precisely the consequences on future business and results incurred by the difficulties faced with this client  due to the aforementioned ongoing legal proceedings  the return to positive results announced for 2023 will be delayed.PCAS Group will continue to benefit from the support of its majority shareholder Seqens (owning 76.66%) for the financing of its activities and its development.NEXT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE:2022 Results  March 30  2023ABOUT PCASPCAS specializes in the development and production of complex molecules for life sciences and innovative technologies.

I will now turn the call over to Scott.Scott Wine: Thank you  Jason. And thanks  everyone  for joining our call. We finished 2022 with solid results as fourth quarter revenues were up over 27%  driving full-year consolidated revenues up 21%. Deliveries and product mix improved in both Agriculture and Construction. Our strength was broad-based  with double-digit year-over-year price realization coming from all regions. We expanded profit margins in both Agriculture and Construction despite significant input cost increases. The industry faced many other headwinds during the year  including a choppy supply chain  elevated freight costs  and ongoing inflation. Late in the year  these issues began to modestly improve. And we anticipate that will continue into 2023. The CNH team's creativity  hard work  and strong execution resulted in company records for both adjusted net income  up $2 billion for the year  and adjusted earnings per share  at $1.46  up 14% over 2021.Story continuesWe also generated $2 billion in free cash flow from industrial activities in the fourth quarter and $1.6 billion for the full-year as we over-delivered on our plans to complete and ship our accumulation of partially built units. This benefited our dealers and put us in a net cash position well ahead of our plan. Last year  we launched two potent margin improvement initiatives  the Strategic Sourcing Program  and the CNHI Business System  which we refer to as CBS. Continuous improvement is hard  especially in pursuit of breakthrough results. But our team has embraced this lean mindset  and is poised to deliver value across the business. Looking ahead  we remain focused on executing our strategy  including significant investments in out tech stack and product development.Derek Neilson and his team continue to drive exceptional performance  delivering a strong fourth quarter  with full-year net sales for the AG business up 22%. This growth was largely propelled by robust industry demand and significant year-over-year price realization  especially in North and South America. We saw improved product mix  including Precision AG revenues up 32%  which benefited from both an increased take rate for factor-fit precision options and incremental rate in sales. AG profitability remained healthy  with Q4 gross margins up 280 basis points  and adjusted EBIT margin up 310 points admittedly against an easy comp. Margins were down sequentially versus our record third quarter performance impacted by regional mix and the non-standard work required to finished units.Overall  I'm extremely pleased with the AG team's performance and results. For 2022  AG adjusted EBIT was nearly $2.5 billion  marking our highest profit in more than a decade. We are executing on our customer-centric strategy and customers have responded with continued demand for our high-end products at prices offsetting increased escalated production cost. They have also recognized us with improved net promoter scores  5% higher than in 2021. Derek and his team are ensuring that customer is at the center of all we do  driving the right behaviors and results. Stefano Pampalone and his Construction team executed quite well in the fourth quarter with strong momentum from Sampierana integration  manufacturing improvements  and enhanced customer focus; we expect even better progress in 2023  and beyond.2022 net sales were up 16% for both the full-year and the fourth quarter  with noteworthy growth in Europe and South America. Organic growth accounted for about two-thirds of the increase in the remainder  with the remainder attributed to Sampierana. Their excavator portfolio and technology innovations have enhanced our ability to meet customer needs  and their Eurocomach platforms provide an outstanding foundation for electrification. Construction adjusted EBIT for the quarter was $34 million at a 3.5% margin. Full-year adjusted EBIT was up 38%  to $124 million. And we are encouraged by the ongoing progress in Construction. The team is well-positioned to deliver on their strategic initiatives  support their dealers and customers  and gain market share.This past December  we held an engaging Tech Day to showcase our extensive suite of precision AG technology. Attendees met our deep team of experts in automation  autonomy  and connected platforms to better understand the cutting edge products we are developing. Through a series of live demo stations  the team exhibited the real world applications of our groundbreaking . The products and technology that we demonstrated at Tech Day that you see here on this page and those we will be releasing over the next few years  prove our commitment to being a leader in precision agriculture. We reiterate our expectation to deliver over $1 billion of Precision AG sales in 2023. I also want to highlight two recent investments made through our CNH Industrial Ventures arm.Stout Industrial Technology is a U.S.-based startup focused on AI-powered smart agriculture implements. EarthOptics has proprietary sensor technology that precisely measures soil health and structure. By taking minority stakes in these and similar companies through our Ventures portfolio  CNH is staying on the cutting edge of emerging technology to develop solutions to provide real advantages for customers. CHN remains committed to adding value and creating profitable growth for its customers and shareholders through sustainability. We have a strong history of sustainability performance as evidenced by our recognitions and our innovative products  including the New Holland methane tractor and electric mini excavator pictured here. In 2022  we pledged to set science-based targets that will enhance our operation's Scope 1 and 2 emissions goals  and establish a first-time decarbonization goals related to our products  which we'll announce later this year.With that  I will turn it over to Oddone to take you through our financial results. Oddone?Oddone Incisa: Yes  thank you  Scott  and good morning  good afternoon to everyone on the call. So  fourth quarter net sales from Industrial Activities  of nearly $6.4 billion  were up over 27% net of adverse FX impacts. Full-year net sales of Industrial Activities  of $21.5 billion  were up 21% or over 24% at constant currency. Continued price adjustments were significant drivers for the top line growth in the quarter  and volume and mix also accounted for around 15% sales increase from Q4  2021. Our Industrial segment's fourth quarter gross margin was 21.7%  and 22.2% for the full-year. The year-over-year margin improvement  of 1.5 points  is mainly due to strong and profitable growth in South America  and disciplined price realization globally  which more than offset rising productions cost.Q4 adjusted EBIT came in at $680 million  up $302 million from 2021  with a corresponding EBIT margin of 10.7%  a 310 business points improvement versus prior year. Full-year adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities was $2.4 billion with a margin of 11.3%  up 140 basis points from 2021. Free cash flow from Industrial Activities was $1.6 billion in 2022  which turned our initial Industrial Activities net debt into a net cash position of $362 million at the end of the year  as Scott discussed in his introductory slide. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $486 million  up $61 million compared to prior year. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $0.36  up $0.05 year-over-year  and full-year adjusted EPS was $1.46. Adjusted net income for the quarter was affected by a higher tax rate due to discreet items booked in Q4.The full-year adjusted effective tax rate was about 28% mainly due to the jurisdictional mix of pre-tax profit with higher rates coming from South America. And we will likely see the tax rate a point or two lower in 2023. Available liquidity  as of December 31  was $10.6 billion. And at the Annual General Meeting  the Board of CNH Industrial is planning to recommend an annual cash dividend of $0.36 per common share  totaling a little over $500 million in distribution to shareholders. In the fourth quarter  strong volumes and double-digit price realization continued to shield us from the steep increase in production costs. R&D and our SG&A expenses were higher by technology investments  inflation  and newly acquired businesses. Energy costs increased year-over-year but still accounted for about half-a-percent of our total costs worldwide.Agriculture adjusted EBIT increased by $287 million  to reach $701 million with a margin of 13.1%  up more than 300 basis points from the same quarter in 2021. The higher profits were driven by higher volumes and favorable pricing  which offset higher products cost  SG&A  and R&D expenses. Gross profit was up $394 million compared to Q4 2021  exceeding $1.2 billion with a margin of 13.1%. For the full-year  gross profit was up $989 million or up 140 basis points from 2021 largely driven by strong price realization coming from all regions and better product mix  including margin-rich technology-related sales growing by about 32%. Construction Equipment adjusted EBIT for Q4 increased by $14 million compared to Q4 2021  reaching $34 million with a margin of 3.5%.Industry  Tractors  ProductPhoto by Museums Victoria on UnsplashThese results were driven by favorable volume and positive price realization. But product cost  including site-related costs  were an outsized headwind for the business. Gross profit across the year was up $82 million compared to the full-year 2021  mainly due to higher volumes and stronger pricing. For our financial service business  net income in the fourth quarter was $75 million  down $50 million compared to 2021. Factors include high risk cost  provisions linked to the termination of the construction business in China  increased labor cost  and compressed margin in North America slightly mitigated by robust volumes across the region as well high recovery on those agreements. Retail originations were $2.9 billion in the quarter reaching $10 billion for the year  up to $100 million from 2021.The managed portfolio at the end of 2022 was $23.8 billion  up $4 billion on a constant currency basis. Delinquencies remained at a low level  up 10 basis points year-over-year to 1.3%. Increase from December 2021 is explained by the in-sourcing of the resolving credit account portfolio that was purchased in October 2022. CNH Industrial Capital America acquired receivables previously held by CD on a private label program that will now be run and booked by our company. Free cash flow from industrial activities in the quarter was over $2 billion on the back of $1.5 billion change in working capital driven in large part by the reduction in manufacturing inventory as we mentioned before. At the end of the year  the total gross debt for industrial activity was $5 billion with a net cash position of $362 million.So  within the first year of the spin-off  we were able to improve our net financial position by $1.5 billion on the back of the cash generated by the operations. This takes to our capital allocation priorities. And we have target spending $4.4 billion in combing R&D and CapEx over the 2022 - 2024 plan period  almost doubling what we were spending in the previous three years. In 2022  we spent the first $1.3 billion of that. And we remain committed to invest in our business to fuel profitable growth. We are confident the product and service we would bring to the market with the spending will ensure higher financial performance in the near future  and more importantly  higher efficiencies to our customers. Strong cash generation helps us maintaining our investment grade rating which has been re-affirmed or improved by all the rating agencies after the spin-off.We returned nearly $600 million to shareholders in 2022 through dividend and share repurchases. And as mentioned earlier  we proposed -- the proposed 2023 dividend itself will total above $500 million. And we plan continuing our share buyback program. We have the liquidity to funding organic growth and you are seeing use the ventures on for minority investments when opportunity arises. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and focus on maximizing value for our shareholders. This concludes my prepared remarks. And I will now turn it back to Scott.Scott Wine: Thank you  Oddone. Overall  demand continues to outstrip the industry's ability to supply at least in the near term  which despite record sales has actually dampened the industry levels. Spot commodity prices are trending down. But they are still generally above pre-2022 levels. And fortunately for farmers  fertilizers and other input cost are dropping as well. In North America  elevated farm incomes are sustaining demand for high horsepower tractors and combines. While small tractor demands has slowed from a lofty level seen over the past two years. We see the European Ag industry flattening as the macro-environment starts to impact equipment demand there. South America and Brazil in particular is a very good market for us.The business conditions in Brazil are inflexed following a presidential election. But we believe that the fundamentals are still positive for agriculture in the region. We also see good long-term opportunities in APAC. But this year will likely be slightly down. In construction  global demand is trending is lower. And we expect residential and commercial markets in North America and Europe to decline in 2023 due to rising interest rates. However  public construction spending at least partially fills in those gaps in United States. In Europe and South America  construction markets will be down in reaction to the overall macro-environment. We expect net sales of industrial activities to increase 6% to 10%. With confidence in the stickiness of our 2022 price increases  we expect to build on our margin gains by taking more cost out of our system.We are committed to growing market share. And we have the products  brands  and dealer network to do just that. Returning to full production in our North American plants will also help. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales remains one of the lowest in the industry. And despite inflationary pressures  we will severely limit SG&A growth. Free cash flow will be between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion. A little lower than last year as we have earmarked $1.6 billion for R&D and CapEx  up about $300 million from 2022. Even accounting for the increased R&D cost  our EBIT is projected to grow slightly faster than our top line. We are becoming a simpler  leaner company every day. And expect to modestly improve our industrial margins throughout the year. Earlier today  we announced that our Board of Directors has determined that our shareholders would be best served by a single listing in United States.The majority of our trading in CNH Industrial stock has been shifting to the New York Stock Exchange since the snip-off of Iveco Group. Revealing that CNH's new business profile and investor base better fit with the single New York Stock Exchange listing. Concentrating trading in one market will allow for increased liquidity of our stock  improve investor focus  further simplify the company's profile  enable broader index inclusion  and attract more passive investors. The current Italian regulations only permit the delisting of stocks when they are or will be listed on another EU exchange. By definition  the stock exchange does not qualify. CNH Industrial has an open dialog with Borsa Italiana on Euronext. And we told them about of our intention to leave the European listing.The harmonization and modernization of the Italian financial system  which is underway  is expected to include the New York Stock Exchange as an acceptable exchange. This is our preferred path for smooth delisting from Euronext Milan. But not the only option if this becomes untimely. We are targeting sole trading on NYSE by the end of 2023. But that could shift into 2024 depending on the timing of the regulation change. Rest assured  we will delist it soon as it is legally possible. At this point  we do not intend to change our incorporation in the Netherlands or our tax domicile in U.K. as part of the single listing. Therefore  we do not expect any material tax or trading consequences for our shareholders. Our Board of Directors and management team are grateful to Euronext Milan for being our listing venue for the past 10 years  and excited about the company's full return to the NYSE.I want to stress that this does not change the company's longstanding commitment to Italy and the Italian market. CNH employees over 5000 people in Italy made a significant investment with Sampierana acquisition in late 2021  opened its fifth plant in the country in 2022. We also have three R&D centers in Italy developing products that are sold around the world. While the delisting is another step in corporate simplification  real value creation comes from the business. We are now taking orders into Q4 in some markets. And overall demand remained strong. But the uncertain macro-environment  especially toward the end of 2023 requires vigilance as we strive to support our customers  dealers  suppliers  and employees. We expect to escalate combine CapEx and R&D investment as we launch exciting new products and build out the tech stack.We have already introduced some Raven-enabled products  and we will unveil more in 2023. But the real payoff for these higher margin precision solution kicks in 2024. We are happy to have finally secured a contract with UAW North America. The agreement we reached is fair for our employees and sustainable for the company. Employees returned to work this week. And we expect the two affected plants to ramp up to full production in the coming months. While the pace of inflation is slowing  it is still inflation. And we expect it to have an impact on our manufacturing  energy  SG&A  and R&D cost in 2023. On a more positive note  we are seeing modest supply chain improvements. Our primary margin improvement initiative  strategic sourcing  and CBS will start to yield results in 2023.I want to close by emphasizing again how proud I am of the team for what they have accomplished. And ensure you that we are ready to do even more in 2023. That concludes our prepared remarks. And I will now turn call over to Serge to open the line for questions.See also 20 Least Populated States in America and 13 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy.To continue reading the Q&A session  please click here.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.74,0.11,0.15,True,English,"['CNH Industrial N.V.', '2022 Earnings Call Transcript', 'CNHI', 'comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures', 'two potent margin improvement initiatives', 'significant input cost increases', 'CNH Industrial N.V.', 'record third quarter performance', 'U.S. Securities', 'CNH Industrial Web site', 'escalated production cost', 'Safe Harbor statement', 'choppy supply chain', 'free cash flow', 'Strategic Sourcing Program', 'factor-fit precision options', 'other periodic reports', 'many other headwinds', 'net cash position', 'net promoter scores', 'EU annual report', 'full-year consolidated revenues', 'Precision AG revenues', 'Q4 gross margins', 'fourth quarter revenues', 'year price realization', 'robust industry demand', 'The CNH team', 'strong fourth quarter', 'CNHI Business System', 'CNH Conference Call', 'full-year net sales', '2022 Earnings Call Transcript', 'Continuous improvement', 'EBIT margin', 'other use', 'significant investments', 'net income', '2022 net sales', 'industrial activities', 'significant year', 'recent report', 'continued demand', 'strong execution', 'exceptional performance', 'strong momentum', 'written consent', 'Oddone Incisa', 'looking statements', 'Additional information', 'Exchange Commission', 'equivalent authorities', 'product mix', 'profit margins', 'freight costs', 'ongoing inflation', 'hard work', 'lean mindset', 'product development', 'AG business', 'South America', 'take rate', 'incremental rate', 'AG profitability', 'easy comp', 'regional mix', 'standard work', 'highest profit', 'a decade', 'high-end products', 'right behaviors', 'Stefano Pampalone', 'Sampierana integration', 'manufacturing improvements', 'double-digit year', 'Jason Omerza', 'Good morning', 'good afternoon', 'Full-Year Results', 'Scott Wine', 'presentation material', 'actual results', 'company presentation', 'solid results', 'company records', 'breakthrough results', 'AG team', 'Derek Neilson', 'customer-centric strategy', 'customer focus', 'Construction team', 'February', 'Operator', 'today', 'Webcast', 'time', 'Serge', 'everyone', 'December', 'recording', 'transmission', 'portion', 'broadcast', 'CEO', 'CFO', 'download', 'forward', 'risks', 'uncertainties', 'factors', '20-F', 'filings', 'Netherlands', 'Italy', 'reconciliations', 'Deliveries', 'Agriculture', 'strength', 'regions', 'issues', 'creativity', 'share', 'Story', 'plans', 'units', 'dealers', 'CBS', 'pursuit', 'value', 'stack', 'growth', 'North', 'customers', 'prices', 'center', 'progress']",2023-02-07,2023-02-08,finance.yahoo.com

The Group's three businesses contributed to growth  which came in at 15.6% (9.1% like-for-like) for turnover of ‚Ç¨206.3 million. This growth was bolstered by a favorable price effect  due to performance initiatives  as well as a favorable volume/product mix effect.Industrial Joinery expanded by 36.7% (16.8% like-for-like). The business continued to report strong demand in distribution channels for energy renovation  wood and the AM-X product. It also benefited from the latest acquisitions: MGT and Poralu.Building Materials Trading was up 6.5% compared with the same period in 2021  driven by good momentum in Structural Works  joinery and Public Works  as well as showroom and self-service rollouts.Concrete Industry  with 11.4% growth (1.2% like-for-like)  benefited from the integration of ready-mix concrete plants in the Aquitaine region (Audoin & Fils) and from good momentum in precast concrete.Overall  HERIGE recorded a turnover of ‚Ç¨792.9 million in 2022  up 11.4% (8.3% like-for-like)  thanks to its responsiveness and ability to anticipate inflation.Outlook and developmentsIn view of the performance achieved over the full year  as well as the Group's discipline in protecting its margins  HERIGE expects to deliver a solid operating performance for the year ended December 31  2022.The Group is taking a cautious approach to 2023 in an uncertain geopolitical and macroeconomic environment marked by rising interest rates and persistently high inflation  as well as a slowdown in the new construction market.

Additionally  the evolution of the circular economy is highly impacting the e-commerce landscape  contributing to the surge in customer-to-customer (C2C) parcel volumes and delivery services. These trends are leading carriers to look for ways to scale their first-mile activity and innovate to reduce the associated rising costs. Thanks to Quadient‚Äôs modular design  the Drop Box and Printer comes as a unit that can be added to new or existing locker configurations. This module enables consumers to place packages directly into the Drop Box by simply scanning a barcode label  maximising parcel volume while minimising the locker footprint. Users also have the ability to print standard shipping labels directly from the built-in printer. Quadient‚Äôs cloud-based monitoring technology captures every step of the process and gives carriers full visibility of the parcels‚Äô status at any time.As the new solution becomes available in the UK  one of the country‚Äôs largest parcel delivery companies  Evri  will be the first carrier to offer the Drop Box and Printer capability to its customers. Evri is one of four international carriers that have joined the Quadient smart locker open network in the UK. The open locker network already accounts for about 300 locker stations in operation  with plans to reach 5 000 units in the coming years at the pace of about 200 new locations per month.‚ÄúThe introduction of our fully integrated Drop Box with optional Printer in our carrier-agnostic network makes us unique to the market ‚Äù said Ian Caminsky  SVP & MD Parcel Locker Solutions DACHIT-UKI  Quadient. ‚ÄúQuadient is leveraging its long-standing experience in Japan  France  the US and the UK to bring to market innovations that focus on creating operational efficiencies and eliminating time consuming processes. We are honoured to have Evri as our first integrated carrier to use this new feature to easily manage their first mile flows and deliver exceptional customer experiences to online shoppers.‚Äù‚ÄúWe‚Äôre delighted to expand our out of home network with Quadient‚Äôs smart locker network  taking advantage of new locker technology. It will increase the convenience of sending by allowing customers to print a label directly from the locker 24/7  which is great for customers who can‚Äôt print at home and means that Quadient‚Äôs locker network offers the same services as our ParcelShops. The Drop Box functionality provides a quick and simple way for small businesses to send multiple parcels in one go and maximises the number of parcels that can be handled at a single locker location each day ‚Äù said Kath Gill  Head of Out of Home at Evri.On-screen user satisfaction surveys conducted by Quadient in December 2022 and January 2023 collecting over 60 000 responses in France and Japan showed more than 97% of respondents are satisfied with their parcel locker experience. In addition  97% of first mile users in Japan are satisfied with their experience  highlighting convenience of the location  a contactless experience and wide hours of availability as the main reasons for satisfaction.In the coming months  Quadient will make the Drop Box and Printer available to retailers and other carriers across Europe and in North America.The new Drop Box and Printer is being presented by Quadient and Evri today in London at the UK e-commerce industry‚Äôs main event  The Delivery Conference.

Additionally  the evolution of the circular economy is highly impacting the e-commerce landscape  contributing to the surge in customer-to-customer (C2C) parcel volumes and delivery services. These trends are leading carriers to look for ways to scale their first-mile activity and innovate to reduce the associated rising costs. Thanks to Quadient‚Äôs modular design  the Drop Box and Printer comes as a unit that can be added to new or existing locker configurations. This module enables consumers to place packages directly into the Drop Box by simply scanning a barcode label  maximising parcel volume while minimising the locker footprint. Users also have the ability to print standard shipping labels directly from the built-in printer. Quadient‚Äôs cloud-based monitoring technology captures every step of the process and gives carriers full visibility of the parcels‚Äô status at any time.As the new solution becomes available in the UK  one of the country‚Äôs largest parcel delivery companies  Evri  will be the first carrier to offer the Drop Box and Printer capability to its customers. Evri is one of four international carriers that have joined the Quadient smart locker open network in the UK. The open locker network already accounts for about 300 locker stations in operation  with plans to reach 5 000 units in the coming years at the pace of about 200 new locations per month.‚ÄúThe introduction of our fully integrated Drop Box with optional Printer in our carrier-agnostic network makes us unique to the market ‚Äù said Ian Caminsky  SVP & MD Parcel Locker Solutions DACHIT-UKI  Quadient. ‚ÄúQuadient is leveraging its long-standing experience in Japan  France  the US and the UK to bring to market innovations that focus on creating operational efficiencies and eliminating time consuming processes. We are honoured to have Evri as our first integrated carrier to use this new feature to easily manage their first mile flows and deliver exceptional customer experiences to online shoppers.‚Äù‚ÄúWe‚Äôre delighted to expand our out of home network with Quadient‚Äôs smart locker network  taking advantage of new locker technology. It will increase the convenience of sending by allowing customers to print a label directly from the locker 24/7  which is great for customers who can‚Äôt print at home and means that Quadient‚Äôs locker network offers the same services as our ParcelShops. The Drop Box functionality provides a quick and simple way for small businesses to send multiple parcels in one go and maximises the number of parcels that can be handled at a single locker location each day ‚Äù said Kath Gill  Head of Out of Home at Evri.On-screen user satisfaction surveys conducted by Quadient in December 2022 and January 2023 collecting over 60 000 responses in France and Japan showed more than 97% of respondents are satisfied with their parcel locker experience. In addition  97% of first mile users in Japan are satisfied with their experience  highlighting convenience of the location  a contactless experience and wide hours of availability as the main reasons for satisfaction.In the coming months  Quadient will make the Drop Box and Printer available to retailers and other carriers across Europe and in North America.The new Drop Box and Printer is being presented by Quadient and Evri today in London at the UK e-commerce industry‚Äôs main event  The Delivery Conference.

In particular  in view of Euronav's upcoming general shareholders' meeting convened at the request of CMB NV that will be held on 23 March 2023  Euronav believes that governance tailored to all of Euronav's shareholders and stakeholders  with directors with a constructive mindset  should remain Euronav's goal  which requires retaining a proportional independence and a high degree of continuity of the Supervisory Board to ensure value protection for all shareholders and compliance with Belgian corporate governance standards.For this purpose  on 4 February 2023  the Euronav Supervisory Board sent a letter to CMB NV and Famatown Finance Limited to request each of them to consider a Euronav Supervisory Board composition representing the current proportionate shareholding structure of Euronav  with two (2) newly appointed non-independent members nominated by CMB NV (being Messrs. Marc Saverys and Patrick De Brabandere) and two (2) newly appointed nonindependent members to be nominated by Famatown Finance Limited. CMB NV has on 6 February 2023 responded that it is not inclined to agree and that all mandates should be up for discussion to allow for a comprehensive deliberation. Famatown has not responded to the contents of the proposal.Euronav will continue to update the market in accordance with applicable regulations.Contact: Contact: Brian Gallagher - Head of IR Communications & Management Board member Tel: +44 20 78 70 04 36 Email: IR@euronav.comAnnouncement final year results 2022: 31 March 2023About Euronav NVEuronav is an independent tanker company engaged in the ocean transportation and storage of crude oil.

(NYSE:CLB) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 2  2023 Operator: Good morning  and welcome to the Core Laboratories Fourth...,Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 2  2023Operator: Good morning  and welcome to the Core Laboratories Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. . After today's presentation  there will be an opportunity to ask questions. . Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Larry Bruno  Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.Larry Bruno: Thanks Drew. Good morning in the Americas  good afternoon in Europe  Africa and the Middle East  and good evening in Asia-Pacific. We'd like to welcome all of our shareholders  analysts  and most importantly  our employees to Core Laboratories fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning  I'm joined by Chris Hill  Core's Chief Financial Officer; and Gwen Gresham  Core's Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. The call will be divided into six segments. Gwen will start by making remarks regarding forward-looking statements. We'll then have some opening comments  including a high-level review of important factors in Core's Q4 and full-year 2022 performance. In addition  we'll review Core's strategies and the three financial tenets that the Company employs to build long-term shareholder value.Chris will then give a detailed financial overview and have additional comments regarding shareholder value. Following Chris  Gwen will provide some comments on the Company's outlook and guidance. I'll then review Core's two operating segments  detailing our progress and discussing the continued successful introduction and deployment of Core Labs' technologies  as well as highlighting some of Core's operations and major projects worldwide. Then we'll open the phones for a Q&A session. I'll now turn the call over to Gwen for remarks on forward-looking statements.Gwen Gresham: Before we start the conference this morning  I'll mention that some of the statements we make during this call may include projections  estimates and other forward-looking information. This would include any discussion of the Company's business outlook. These types of forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K  as well as other reports and registration statements filed by us with the SEC and the AFM. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise.Story continuesOur comments also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release announcing our fourth quarter results. Those non-GAAP measures can also be found on our website. With that said  I'll pass the discussion back to Larry.Larry Bruno: Thanks  Gwen. For the fourth quarter of 2022 Core Lab achieved sequential improvement in revenue  operating income  operating margins  and EPS with strong incremental margins. These improvements translated into higher free cash flow  which enabled the company to reduce net debt by $11.7 million or 7%. We remained focused on executing our key financial strategies including reducing debt and strengthening our balance sheet. For the full-year 2022  revenue was $490 million  increasing by more than 4% compared to 2021. However  for 2022  revenue for the full-year was adversely impacted by currency devaluation of the Euro and British pound. Using a constant dollar exchange rate  2022 revenue would've been nearly $13 million higher.For the full company operating margins for the fourth quarter grew to 12%  up from 11% in Q3. Full company sequential incremental margins ex-items exceeded 80%  driven by a strong quarter in production enhancement. Reservoir Description margins lagged after two successive quarters with very high incrementals  reflecting adverse impacts from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The Russia-Ukraine conflict posed a headwind to revenue in the fourth quarter and throughout most of 2022  as trading patterns for crude oil and derived products were disrupted in Europe  Russia  and Ukraine. For 2022  demand for laboratory services tied to the assay of crude oil and derived products in these regions declined in excess of $9 million year-over-year offsetting growth in other international regions.Lastly  for the full company  quarter-over-quarter  EPS grew sequentially by 11% to $0.20 per share ex-items. As we look ahead  Core will continue to execute on its key strategic objectives by one  introducing new product and service offerings in key geographic markets; two  maintaining a lean and focused organization; and three  maintaining our commitment to de-levering the company. Now to review Core Lab's strategies and the financial tenants that Core has used to build shareholder value over our 27 plus year history as a publicly traded company. The interests of our shareholders  clients  and employees will always be well served by Core Lab's resilient culture  which relies on innovation  leveraging technology to solve problems and dedicated customer service.I'll talk more about some of our latest innovations in the operational review section of this call. While we navigate through the current challenges and pursue growth opportunities  the company will remained focused on its three longstanding  long-term financial tenants. Those being to maximize free cash flow  maximize return on invested capital  and returning excess free cash to our shareholders. Before moving on  I want to thank our employees for the dedication  loyalty  and adaptability in meeting all of our clients' needs and for the commitment that many have shown as we navigate the moment and prepare for more active market. I'll now turn it over to Chris for the detailed financial review.Chris Hill: Thanks  Larry. I would like to begin by highlighting a couple of announcements we made since our last call. As you may be aware  the company shares were previously dual listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Euronext Amsterdam Exchange. However  as we rationalize benefits versus the cost of maintaining the dual listing  we decided to de-list the shares from the Amsterdam Exchange  which became effective in early December of last year. In following the de-listing of the shares on January 17 of this year  we announced our plan to reorganize the company's corporate structure which includes redomesticating the parent company from the Netherlands to the United States. The company and its Board believes the redomestication will enhance long-term shareholder value by reducing administrative costs  simplifying the corporate structure  as well as gaining some operational efficiencies.The company filed a preliminary prospectus and proxy statement associated with the redomestication  which will require shareholder approval. We anticipate the redomestication transaction will be completed sometime in the first half of this year. Before we review the financial performance for the quarter  the guidance we gave on our last call and past calls specifically excluded the impact of any FX gains or losses and assumed an effective tax rate of 20%. So accordingly  our discussion today excludes any foreign exchange gain or loss for current and prior periods. Additionally  the GAAP financial results for the fourth quarter include a non-cash adjustment of $1.9 million  which decreased stock compensation expense associated with performance share awards  which vested during the quarter.This adjustment has also been excluded from the discussion of our fourth quarter and full-year results. Now looking at the income statement  revenue from continuing operations was $127.6 million in the fourth quarter  up slightly from $126 million in the prior quarter. The sequential increase in revenue was driven by growth in both the U.S. and international markets. However  nice growth in multiple international regions has been partially offset by continued disruptions caused by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict  which adversely impacted service revenue in the affected regions. Of this revenue  service revenue  which is more international  was $88.9 million for the quarter up from $87.9 million last quarter. During the quarter  we saw nice sequential growth of 11% in the U.S.  which was led by our laboratory services and well diagnostic services.We also see nice sequential improvement in multiple international regions outside the areas impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However  the Russia-Ukraine conflict has continued to disrupt the trading patterns and flow of oil in the affected regions. The realignment of these trading patterns still continues  and the realignment of these trading patterns has not been consistent or linear. For example  in Europe  our crude oil assay activity increased during the third quarter  but activity decreased again in the fourth quarter. The company believes these trading patterns will become more stable throughout 2023  and we will continue to monitor the changes to the trading patterns and appropriately adopt -- adapt our operations accordingly.For the full-year of 2022  service revenue of $347 million was relatively flat compared to $344.3 million in 2021. As Larry mentioned  two main factors have adversely impacted our international revenue by over $20 million in 2022. The devaluation of certain currencies  primarily the Euro and British pound; and disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict as we just discussed. Product sales  which is equally tied to North America and international activity were $38.6 million for the quarter  up slightly compared to $38.1 million last quarter. International product sales for the quarter were up 15% sequentially  and our energetic sales to the U.S. market were also up sequentially. However  this growth was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $2 million in other product sales.For the full-year of 2022  product sales revenue was of $142.8 million was up 13% from $125.9 million in 2021. Moving on to the cost of services ex-items for the quarter are 78% of service revenue  which is comparable to last quarter. The service side of our business has been more impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict  although we see improvements in absorption of costs and nice incremental margins in regions where activity is expanding these gains are being offset by disruption to the business in other regions more directly impacted by the conflict. Cost of sales ex-items in the fourth quarter were 79% of revenue and improved from 82% last quarter. The improvement this quarter was primarily driven by gains in manufacturing efficiencies and higher international sales.Manufacturing costs continue to increase due to inflation on materials and other operating costs. However  some of the impact has been mitigated through gains in manufacturing efficiencies and some improvement in pricing. G&A ex-items for the quarter was $10.4 million  relatively flat compared to last quarter. For the full-year of 2022  G&A ex-items was $39.3 million  up from $37 million in 2021 due to restoration of employee compensation and benefits. For 2023  we expect G&A to be approximately $40 million to $42 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $4.1 million and comparable to last quarter. For the full-year depreciation and amortization expense was $17.2 million  down from $18.5 million in 2021. EBIT ex-items for the quarter was $14.7 million  up 10% from $13.3 million last quarter  and representing an EBIT margin of approximately 12%  which is also up from 11% last quarter.Operating income for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis was $15.6 million. And for the full-year of 2022  EBIT ex-items was $44.8 million  down from $52.3 million in the prior year and on a GAAP basis  EBIT was $41.5 million for 2022 and $45.3 million in 2021. Interest expense was $3.1 million in comparable to last quarter and interest expense ex-items for the full-year was $11.4 million  up slightly from $11 million in 2021. Although  interest rates have significantly increased throughout 2022 the company has substantially offset the impact of this increase by reducing our outstanding debt. On a GAAP basis  interest expense for the full-year of 2022 was $11.6 million  up from $9.2 million in 2021  as 2021 interest expense included a $1.4 million gain associated with settling some of our interest rate hedges last year.Income tax expense ex-items and using an effective tax rate of 20% for the quarter was $2.3 million. On a GAAP basis  the company recorded income tax expense of $5.8 million for the quarter. And for the full-year  income tax expense was $10.3 million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 34% for 2022. However  income tax expense was significantly increased in 2022 due to the devaluation of foreign currencies  primarily Turkey and the United Kingdom  which we discussed in prior quarters. Excluding the impact associated with the devaluation of the Turkish lira and British pound  the company's effective tax rate would've been approximately 18%. The effective tax rate will continue to be somewhat sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings across the globe and the impact of items discrete to each quarter.However  we continue to project the company's effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. Income from continuing operations ex-items for the quarter was $9.3 million  up 11% sequentially from $8.3 million last quarter. For the full-year 2022 ex-items  it was $26.8 million  down from $33 million in 2021. GAAP income from continuing operations for the quarter was $6.7 million  and for the full-year 2022 was $19.7 million. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations ex-items was $0.20 for the quarter  up from $0.18 last quarter  and was $0.57 for the full-year of 2022. GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $0.14 for the quarter and $0.42 for the full-year. Now moving on to the balance sheet  receivables were $106.9 million at December 31  up $6.7 million from last quarter end.Petroleum  Industry  LaboratoryPhoto by Gritte on UnsplashOur DSOs for the fourth quarter were at 70 days also up when compared to 67 days last quarter. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of billings during the quarter and a slightly higher mix of international revenue  which generally has a longer collection period. Inventory finished the year at $60.4 million  up approximately $5.6 million from last quarter end. Inventory turns for the quarter were at 2.1 down from 2.3 in the last quarter  and primarily down due to shipping delays postponing some larger international sales into 2023. As previously highlighted  the company continues to experience an increase in cost of raw materials  labor  packaging  and transportation costs  which are increasing the cost of inventory. Additionally  challenges in the supply chain persist  which will continue to require carrying a larger amount of inventory to help mitigate disruptions.We anticipate inventory turns will remain at similar levels  but we have a focused effort for improvement as we progress into 2023. On the liability side of the balance sheet  our long-term debt was $175 million at December 31 and was reduced by $10 million this quarter. Our debt is currently comprised of our senior notes at $135 million as well as $40 million outstanding under our bank revolving credit facility. As Larry mentioned earlier  our free cash flow has also improved as the company's financial performance has improved the last couple of quarters. Our free cash flow continues to be focused on reducing outstanding debt  considering cash of $15.4 million  our net debt was $159.6 million at year-end  a reduction of $11.7 million this quarter  which also improved our leverage ratio to 2.29 from 2.42 at last quarter end.Since announcing the company's commitment and focus on reducing debt in the fourth quarter of 2019  we have reduced net debt by 46%. The company will continue applying free cash towards reducing debt  so that company reaches its target leverage ratio of 1.5 or lower. Looking at cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2022  cash flow from operating activities was $13.2 million  and after paying for $2 million of CapEx  our free cash flow was $11.2 million for the quarter. Our free cash flow generated this quarter is the highest we have achieved since the third quarter of 2020. Looking forward to 2023  we expect CapEx to modestly expand and will continue to remain in line with historical levels  but also be aligned with activity levels. For the full-year of 2023  we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $12 million to $15 million  which is an increase from $10.2 million in 2022.Core will continue our strict capital discipline and asset-like business model with capital expenditures primarily targeted at growth opportunities and initiatives. Core Lab's operational leverage continues to provide for the ability to grow revenue and profitability with minimal capital requirements. Capital expenditures have historically ranged from 2.5% to 4% of revenue even during periods of significant growth. That same level of laboratory infrastructure  intellectual property  and leverage exists in the business today. We believe evaluating a company's ability to generate free cash flow and free cash flow yield is an important metric for shareholders when comparing and projecting company's financial results  particularly for those shareholders who utilize discounted cash flow models to assess valuations.I will now turn it over to Gwen for an update on our guidance and outlook.Gwen Gresham: Thank you  Chris. Looking forward into 2023  we see crude oil macro fundamentals continuing to support a multi-year recovery cycle for the oil and gas industry. Crude oil demand for 2023 as forecasted by the International Energy Agency in January of this year is projected to increase by 1.9 million barrels per day to a record 101.7 million barrels per day as consumption in China grows along with the reopening of its economy. As crude oil demand is projected to exceed pre-COVID levels  crude-oil supply is projected to tighten. Production growth continues to face constraints due to prolonged underinvestment in many regions around the globe as well as natural decline of production from existing fields. As a result  we expect operators to expand their upstream spending plans for 2023 by mid-teens compared to 2022.This supports our continued improvement in international onshore and offshore activity  with projects emerging and underway  most notably across the Middle East  Latin America and West Africa regions. Moving on to the U.S.  we see similar challenges with crude oil supply which should require increased spending by operators to grow and replace production. While operators remain focused on capital discipline  2023 forecasts indicate their U.S. upstream spending will increase by approximately 15% year- over-year. Turning to the first quarter of 2023  we anticipate Reservoir Description to be down low to mid-single-digits sequentially. There are two factors causing the sequential decline in revenue. First  the typical seasonal industry pattern  which will cause activity in the first quarter to decline in some regions; and second  continued volatility with crude oil trading patterns which may impact Reservoir Description's international growth within its Russian  Ukrainian  and European operations.Helping to offset these revenue headwinds  we will see an increase in international upstream project activity  which is currently underway. For Production Enhancement  revenue is estimated to be up mid-single-digit as U.S. land activity is projected to recover from normal seasonal declines experienced at year-end. We project first quarter 2023 revenue to range from $125 million to $129 million and operating income of $11.5 million to $14.5 million  yielding operating margins of approximately 10%. EPS for the first quarter is expected to range from $0.14 to $0.19. The company's first quarter guidance is based on projections for underlying operations and excludes gains and losses in foreign exchange. First quarter guidance also assumes an effective tax rate of 20%.Now  I'll pass the discussion back to Larry.Larry Bruno: Thanks  Gwen. First  I'd like to thank our global team of employees for providing innovative solutions  integrity  and superior service to our clients. The team's collective dedication to servicing our clients is the foundation of Core Lab's success. Turning first to Reservoir Description  for the fourth quarter of 2022  revenue came in at just over $78 million down slightly compared to Q3. When looking at revenue growth for Reservoir Description  it is important to consider the sharp devaluation of the Euro and the British pound. These currency devaluations lowered Reservoir Description revenue for the full-year  by more than $12 million using 2021 exchange rates. Operating income for Reservoir Description ex-items was $6 million  and operating margins were 8%.Growth across most regions was offset by impacts from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Demand for crude oil and derived product assay work across Europe  Russia  and Ukraine  which rebounded somewhat during Q3  subsequently slowed in Q4 as sanctions became formalized. As previously discussed  we expect continued volatility and demand for these laboratory services as global trading patterns realign. However  as Gwen mentioned  the International Energy Agency recently forecast crude oil demand for 2023 to average a record high 101.7 million barrels per day  up by 1.9 million barrels per day from 2022  even after assessing global financial forecasts. This bodes well for growing demand for Reservoir Description's assay work. As we look ahead  while still well below pre-COVID levels  we see the growing international rig count as a harbinger of an improving landscape for Reservoir Description a trend that we project will play out for the next several years particularly in the Middle East  North and South America and most other regions.Early movers in the oilfield service sector that are more exposed to well construction have already felt the impact of this cycle shift. As projects progress into field appraisal  field development  and eventually production demand for Core Lab's Reservoir Description services will rise accordingly. Now for some operational highlights from the fourth quarter  Core Lab's Reservoir Description services were employed on both U.S. and international projects to help our clients evaluate their assets and develop programs to optimize production. Under the direction of a South American National Oil Company  Core Lab conducted a series of Enhanced Oil Recovery and flow assurance studies for a multi-well onshore program as evaluating the use of CO2-rich injection gases.This laboratory work is determining the impact of blending these CO2-rich gases with existing reservoir fluids and are providing the basis for advanced equation-of-state modeling. While defining the gas injection parameters for a successful field application are critical to improving crude oil recoveries  operators must also assess the potential for the injected CO2 to unintendedly cause flocculation of asphaltenes. These long chain asphaltene molecules can clog pores in the rock and impair permeability  thus reducing the effectiveness of CO2 injection programs. Broadly  CO2 injection projects like this reflect a globally expanding interest in enhanced oil recovery and carbon capture and storage technologies. When properly evaluated with rigorous laboratory testing  injecting CO2 into hydrocarbon bearing subsurface formations can simultaneously improve oil recovery and reduce CO2 emissions.Also  during the fourth quarter of 2022  Core completed an integrated study on conventional core from a lower Barnett shale pilot well in the Permian Basin. The key objectives of the study were to evaluate the resource potential of the strata and identify landing zone targets that will optimize stimulation and hydrocarbon production. Core analysis data acquire from the pilot well was benchmarked against key performance indicators from 21 wells in Core Lab's proprietary Woodford-Barnett joint industry project to provide insights into future production potential of the play. Core applied its new proprietary prism mudstone laboratory workflow  which combines advanced petrophysical and geochemical technologies  including measurements from high frequency  nuclear magnetic resonance and multi-rate pyrolysis to also provide rapid assessment of mobile versus non-mobile hydrocarbons in the rocks.The Prism workflow also refined petrophysical models and allow for refined calibration of downhole logs  which in turn resulted in an increase in both calculated reserves and estimated ultimate recovery. Moving now to Production Enhancement  where Core Lab technologies continue to help our clients optimize their well completions. Revenue for Production Enhancement came in at $49 million  up 5% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year. Operating income ex-items was $7.7 million  while operating margins were 16% for the fourth quarter of 2022 and sequential margins were more than 100%. During the fourth quarter of 2022  Core Lab continued to build on the success of its expand  casing and tubing patch technology. The industry-leading versatility and reliability of the expand system yield significant savings in the remediation of all types of wells with casing damage  ranging from oil and gas producers through to disposal and geothermal wells.Recently  an operator in Alaska had casing leaks in a horizontal water disposal well at four different depths over a 5 000-foot interval. As the disposal well were to become unavailable  hydrocarbon production from nearby oil and gas wells would need to be severely curtailed. Remedial steps that would have otherwise required a workover rig would have been both costly and time-consuming. Instead  Core Lab experts recommended placing four separate expand patches via wireline with a configuration that would enable operations in this highly deviated wellbore. All four patches were successfully deployed  set on depth and the well passed the mandatory mechanical integrity tests required by state authorities. This allowed the disposal operation to continue rigless intervention to repair the well with expand resulted in significant cost savings and enable the nearby producing wells to maintain hydrocarbon output.To-date  Core Lab has run over 100 000 feet of proprietary casing and tubing patches. The expand system has a proven track record of reliability and is one of the most effective solutions of its type. That concludes our operational review. We appreciate your participation. And Drew will now open the call for questions.See also 10 Cheap Lithium Stocks To Buy and 15 Largest Ophtalmology Companies in the World .To continue reading the Q&A session  please click here.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.4,0.12,0.48,True,English,"['Core Laboratories N.V.', 'Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript', 'NYSE', 'CLB', 'Core Laboratories Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call', 'Full company sequential incremental margins', 'higher free cash flow', 'constant dollar exchange rate', 'Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript', 'Core Laboratories N.V.', 'comparable GAAP financial measures', 'full company operating margins', 'strong incremental margins', 'Reservoir Description margins', 'Chief Financial Officer', 'Senior Vice President', 'three financial tenets', 'detailed financial overview', 'Q&A session', 'recent Annual Report', 'two successive quarters', 'key strategic objectives', 'key geographic markets', 'fourth quarter results', 'two operating segments', '27 plus year history', ""Core Labs' technologies"", 'long-term shareholder value', 'key financial strategies', 'other international regions', 'other forward-looking information', 'GAAP measures', 'sequential improvement', 'strong quarter', 'financial tenants', 'operating income', 'other reports', 'six segments', 'actual results', 'new information', 'forward-looking statements', 'Good morning', 'good afternoon', 'Middle East', 'good evening', 'Investor Relations', 'high-level review', 'important factors', 'successful introduction', 'major projects', 'business outlook', 'Form 10-K', 'future events', 'press release', 'balance sheet', 'currency devaluation', 'British pound', 'production enhancement', 'high incrementals', 'adverse impacts', 'Russia-Ukraine conflict', 'trading patterns', 'crude oil', 'laboratory services', 'new product', 'service offerings', 'focused organization', 'registration statements', 'Larry Bruno', 'opening comments', 'additional comments', 'net debt', 'Chris Hill', 'Gwen Gresham', 'full-year 2022 performance', 'derived products', 'NYSE', 'CLB', 'Operator', 'participants', 'listen', 'mode', 'today', 'presentation', 'opportunity', 'questions', 'conference', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'Americas', 'Europe', 'Africa', 'Asia-Pacific', 'shareholders', 'analysts', 'employees', 'Head', 'remarks', 'guidance', 'progress', 'continued', 'deployment', 'operations', 'phones', 'projections', 'estimates', 'discussion', 'types', 'number', 'risks', 'uncertainties', 'SEC', 'AFM.', 'obligation', 'Reconciliation', 'website', 'revenue', 'EPS', 'improvements', 'Q3.', 'items', 'demand', 'assay', 'excess', 'growth', 'lean', 'commitment', 'interests', 'clients']",2023-02-07,2023-02-08,finance.yahoo.com

Sales growth was driven mainly by sales of Estetrol for Mithra (to be put in perspective  however  with the difficulties faced in recovering certain corresponding receivables from this company)  a strong demand for products from the Turku site  a favorable EUR/USD exchange rate  and the impact of price increases implemented over the past months to cover the very sharp increase in the cost of raw materials and energy.Fine Specialty ChemicalsNet sales of Fine Specialty Chemicals totaled ‚Ç¨82.7 million  a 22.7% increase compared to 2021 (a 18.6% increase at a constant exchange rate). Business has been robust throughout the year with a very strong demand for Electronics and Cosmetics and a positive trend in Lubricants and Fine Chemicals. The increase in the cost of raw materials and energy has been passed through to customers and has thus contributed to the growth of net sales. The dynamics in the industrialization of new products was also very good.OutlookAs announced on November 3rd and December 21st  2022  2022 results will remain very negative  as the level of activity remains insufficient to cover fixed costs at several Pharmaceutical Synthesis sites  and due to inventory depreciations for out-of-specification products. Further  these results may be revised depending on the evolution of the ongoing legal proceedings relating to the sales of Estetrol. A follow-up will be provided when the 2022 results will be released on March 30  2023.In this context  PCAS has to study a temporary reduction in activity on the production site concerned by such product  including some workshops dedicated to the production of Estetrol. Although it is not possible at this stage to assess more precisely the consequences on future business and results incurred by the difficulties faced with this client  due to the aforementioned ongoing legal proceedings  the return to positive results announced for 2023 will be delayed.PCAS Group will continue to benefit from the support of its majority shareholder Seqens (owning 76.66%) for the financing of its activities and its development.NEXT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE:2022 Results  March 30  2023ABOUT PCASPCAS specializes in the development and production of complex molecules for life sciences and innovative technologies.

17938,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/571166-euroclear-profits-russian-frozen-assets/,EU clearing house profits on frozen Russian assets,Nearly half of Euroclear‚Äôs net profit last year came from interest earned on blocked Russian funds  according to the company Read Full Article at RT.com,Roughly half of Euroclear‚Äôs earnings in 2022 came from interest on funds that belong to RussiansA major EU securities transactions company  Euroclear  reported a record-high net profit in its 2022 earnings report on Wednesday.According to the company  its earnings amounted to ‚Ç¨1.2 billion ($1.3 billion)  a 162% increase on the previous year. It noted that ‚Ç¨597 million ($641 million) or roughly a half of those earnings came from operations with Russian assets that have been frozen under EU sanctions against Moscow.The Belgium-based firm settles and clears securities trades carried out on European exchanges  and serves as a central securities depository for financial institutions that operate on European markets. The company ceased transactions with Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD) and blocked NSD accounts within its system following sanctions against the Russian clearing house in mid-2022. The move effectively made Russians unable to access their assets held within Euroclear.Throughout the year  dividends  coupon payments and redemptions on securities that belong to Russians have been piling up on Euroclear accounts. The bank estimated that as of the end of 2022  its balance sheet increased by ‚Ç¨99 billion compared to 2021  to ‚Ç¨124 billion. The funds  in accordance with the company's risk strategy  were invested  bringing in a cumulative income of ‚Ç¨821 million.‚ÄúCash balances increased materially as a consequence of the international sanctions on Russia... The international sanctions and Russian countermeasures resulted in a loss of activities from sanctioned clients and Russian securities which impacted business income ‚Äù Euroclear said  noting  however  that the accumulated interest income ‚Äúmore than made up‚Äù for any losses.‚ÄúFuture earnings linked to the sanctions will continue to depend on the prevailing interest rate environment and the evolution of the sanctions. The Board expects interest income to continue to grow as blocked payments and redemptions continue to accumulate  albeit at a slower pace during 2023 ‚Äù the company predicted.Russian investors first faced problems with conducting transactions and receiving payments on foreign securities in early March last year  even before the NSD was sanctioned  as foreign clearing houses halted transfers while waiting for clarifications on anti-Russia restrictions from authorities.The NSD has been trying for months to obtain permits for the release of Russian funds from the clearing systems. In December  regulators in Belgium and Luxembourg issued such permits  after which the NSD and a number of other Russian brokers applied for the release of funds.However  experts say the permits do not guarantee Russian investors will see their money in the near future  as there is uncertainty around the procedure of their withdrawal. Also  there have been calls within the EU and the broader West to seize the frozen Russian funds and use them for the reconstruction of Ukraine.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.06,0.93,0.01,negative,0.0,0.13,0.87,True,English,"['EU clearing house profits', 'frozen Russian assets', 'major EU securities transactions company', 'prevailing interest rate environment', 'record-high net profit', 'National Settlement Depository', 'central securities depository', 'other Russian brokers', 'foreign clearing houses', 'Russian clearing house', 'foreign securities', 'Russian securities', 'clearing systems', 'securities trades', 'interest income', 'Russian countermeasures', 'Russian investors', 'EU sanctions', 'Belgium-based firm', 'European exchanges', 'financial institutions', 'European markets', 'balance sheet', 'risk strategy', 'cumulative income', 'Cash balances', 'business income', 'slower pace', 'early March', 'anti-Russia restrictions', 'near future', 'broader West', 'business section', 'Russian assets', 'Russian funds', 'previous year', 'a half', 'international sanctions', '2022 earnings report', 'NSD accounts', 'Future earnings', 'The NSD', 'coupon payments', 'Euroclear accounts', 'Russians', 'Wednesday', '162% increase', 'operations', 'Moscow', 'mid-2022', 'move', 'dividends', 'redemptions', 'bank', 'accordance', 'consequence', 'loss', 'activities', 'clients', 'evolution', 'Board', 'problems', 'transfers', 'clarifications', 'authorities', 'months', 'permits', 'release', 'December', 'regulators', 'Luxembourg', 'number', 'experts', 'money', 'uncertainty', 'procedure', 'withdrawal', 'calls', 'reconstruction', 'Ukraine', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-02-08,2023-02-08,rt.com

On an underlying basis  earnings per share grew to EUR 191.7.The group maintains a strong capital position and a low-risk profile  which are critical as a financial market infrastructure and create headroom for further growth.2022 Operating EnvironmentIn 2022 financial markets experienced negative returns from both equities and fixed income for the first time in over 50 years. Equity markets were characterised by higher levels of volatility and lower traded volumes. The funds industry was also affected by the fall in value of the underlying assets.The fragile external context  already impacted by the pandemic over the previous two years  was further impacted by rising geopolitical tensions. Most notably  the invasion of Ukraine by Russia led to a raft of international sanctions being imposed on capital market entities and individuals.Inflation increased across international economies  with central banks responding by raising interest rates throughout the year.The consequence of the operating environment is shown below in the group's key operating metrics.FY 2022 % change vs FY 2021 Assets under Custody EUR 35.6 trillion -6 % Number of transactions 304 million +3 % Turnover (Value of transactions processed) EUR 1 066 trillion +7 % Fund assets under custody EUR 2.8 trillion -11 % Collateral Highway EUR 1.8 trillion -7 %Progressing on our new strategic vision to grow stakeholder valueIn 2022  management and the Board defined Euroclear's corporate purpose  an ambitious long-term vision and a five-year business strategy. Euroclear's purpose to innovate to bring safety  efficiency  and connections to financial markets for sustainable economic growth  combined with its culture and values  underpins the long-term aspiration to become a digital and data-enabled financial market infrastructure.To realise this vision  Euroclear will continue to build an open  shared platform providing a catalogue of services to all market stakeholders and complemented by third parties. Euroclear's aim is to evolve the current market model to provide efficiencies that deliver more client value  building on previous successes in collateral and funds.Through its strategy  the group will continue to focus on meeting the evolving needs of all financial market participants from issuers to investors. In addition  Euroclear will increase its focus on ESG  data-driven and digital innovations and expanding its global reach.The strategy will be enabled by Euroclear's people and its technology  with increased investments ongoing to extend the group's capabilities  with a particular focus on strengthening and modernising the group's technology.In addition  greater emphasis is placed on M&A to accelerate the strategy and to provide enhanced capabilities to the group's service offering. Several steps have been taken through the course of 2022 to rollout the M&A strategy  including the investments in Greenomy  Impact Cubed  Fnality and Goji as well as the ongoing integration of MFEX. The Goji acquisition is novel  as it is the first time Euroclear will be operating in the digitalisation of private assets space  in effect a new asset class in its books.The integration of MFEX remains on track despite the challenging external context for the funds industry given lower equity  fixed-income and fund valuations. The combination of MFEX with the existing Euroclear funds business  and alternative investments through Goji  provides a compelling vision for a comprehensive end-to-end funds offering.Ambitious metrics have been outlined to measure the implementation of the strategy over the next five years. The strategy is expected to further diversify the business model and generate value for clients  employees  shareholders  and society  in line with Euroclear's corporate purpose.Underlying Business PerformanceExcluding the impact of the Russian sanctions  Euroclear's underlying business continues to perform strongly. Adjusted net profit rose by 32% to EUR 603 million.Business income was up 5% to EUR 1 607 million  reflecting continued growth of Euroclear's business lines.The diversification of our business provided a hedge against market volatility. The impact of lower equity markets is mitigated by the group's diversified and subscription-like business model. Approximately three quarters of the group's business income is decoupled from financial market valuations.In addition  interest  banking and other income increased by 289% to EUR 348 million on an underlying basis  benefitting from rising interest rates.Underlying operating expenses increased to EUR 1 133 million  up 15% compared to the prior year  partly due to inflation on costs but also as Euroclear continued to invest in its technology and service offering. As well as enhancing Euroclear's client proposition and resilience  the investments in Euroclear's technology are expected to increase efficiency through standardisation and modernisation.Inflationary pressures on costs  as well as the broader impact of the macro-economic environment  are monitored at the level of each of operating entity. Only Euroclear Bank benefits directly from the compensating effect of higher interest rates.Euroclear continues to expect expenditure to remain above its ""through-the-cycle"" target of 4-6% p.a. in 2023  due to accelerating investment in both its strategy and the resilience of the business  coupled with continued inflationary pressures on the cost base. However  profitability is expected to rise as inflation headwinds are more than offset by higher net interest income from subsequent rate increases.Implications of Russian sanctionsRussia's invasion of Ukraine resulted in market-wide application of international sanctions  which had a material impact on Euroclear's financial market infrastructure.As a regulated entity with a critical role in the operation of global financial markets  Euroclear takes its responsibility of complying with sanctions very seriously. Well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining the normal course of business.There is  however  additional complexity because the package of sanctions is wide-ranging and  moreover  Russia does not recognise the international sanctions and has implemented its own economic countermeasures. Euroclear maintains regular dialogue with clients and other impacted stakeholders in managing the market issues and implication of Russian countermeasures.The international sanctions and Russian countermeasures resulted in a loss of activities from sanctioned clients and Russian securities which impacted business income. It is more than offset by increased interest income.The cash on the balance sheet has increased as blocked coupon payments and redemptions accumulate. At the end of December 2022  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet increased by EUR 99 billion year-on-year to a total of EUR 124 billion.As per Euroclear's standard process  which is the same for any client's long cash balances  the cash balances arising from the sanctions are invested to minimise credit risk. Over 2022  interest arising on cash balances from Russia-sanctioned assets was EUR 821 million.Future earnings linked to the sanctions will continue to depend on the prevailing interest rate environment and the evolution of the sanctions. The Board expects interest income to continue to grow as blocked payments and redemptions continue to accumulate  albeit at a slower pace during 2023.As previously outlined  while the Russian sanctions materially impact the balance sheet  the impact on the group's capital ratios is not expected to be significant. Euroclear maintains a strong capital position.The nature of the activities undertaken as a financial market infrastructure has led various parties to contest the sanctions and countermeasures  as well as their application  with legal proceedings ongoing in both the European Union and Russia. While not presently considered a material risk and having limited financial impact  the probability has increased that financial impacts arise  which may result in a possible post balance sheet event. As such  the Board considers it necessary to separate the sanction-related earnings from the underlying financial results when assessing the company's performance and resources.The Board recognises that the unexpected profit should be managed prudently  in line with its corporate purpose and considering its responsibilities towards stakeholders and society  as well as a more uncertain risk environment. Euroclear continues to act in a transparent manner with all authorities involved. The Board will continue to act cautiously by not distributing any profits related to the Russian sanctions until the situation becomes clearer.Responsibility to our people and societyThe newly articulated corporate purpose and strategy recognises Euroclear's responsibilities to its communities and society. Management and the Board would like to thank colleagues for the way in which they responded to the challenges of the past year  while also adapting to a new hybrid way of working.Having established a group sustainability office in 2021  this year Euroclear set out a pathway to reach its net zero science-based targets. This includes setting near term 2030 goals to cut absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 55%  from a 2019 base year.Shareholder returnsThe Board considers the core of the group's performance to be the underlying business performance and shareholder returns are assessed on this basis.Underlying EPS increased by 30% to 191.7 per share  reflecting growth in net profit after adjusting for results related to the implementation of international sanctions.The Board signals its intention to pay dividend per share to EUR 115.5 in the third quarter. This represents an increase of 31% and maintains the payout ratio at 60% of the underlying earnings  in line with last year.Commenting on the resultsLieve Mostrey  Chief Executive Officer  Euroclear""Throughout 2022  Euroclear has continued to innovate to bring safety  efficiency and connections to the financial markets for sustainable economic growth.I would like to extend my gratitude to our people  together with our clients and partners  for their continued efforts in navigating the extraordinary circumstances that we faced last year.

Financial Services‚Äô net banking income was significantly higher by +35.8%* vs. 2021  while Insurance net banking income increased by +6.5%* vs. 2021.Global Banking & Investor Solutions‚Äô revenues were up +14.3% (+12.9%*) vs. 2021. Global Markets & Investor Services‚Äô revenues posted a +18.7% increase in revenues (14.1%*) vs. 2021  while Financing & Advisory activities increased by +15.2% (+10.7%*) vs. 2021.In Q4 22  the Group continued to post robust revenue growth of +5.9% (+8.1%*) vs. Q4 21.Operating expensesIn 2022  operating expenses totalled EUR 18 630 million on a reported basis and EUR 17 991 million on an underlying basis (restated for transformation costs)  i.e.  an increase of +4.5% vs. 2021 (on an underlying basis).The rise can be mainly attributed to the EUR 864 million contribution to the Single Resolution Fund  and increase of EUR 278 million  currency effects  notably in US dollars and a rise in the variable components of employee remuneration associated with higher revenues.Underlying(1) gross operating income increased by +18.9% to EUR 10 068 million in 2022  while the underlying(1) cost to income ratio (excluding the Single Resolution Fund) posted a 3.4 point improvement to 61.0% (vs. 64.4% in 2021).In Q4 22  operating expenses totalled EUR 4 610 million on a reported basis and EUR 4 718 million on an underlying basis (restated for the linearisation of IFRIC 21 and transformation costs)  i.e.  a limited increase of +2.2% vs. Q4 21.Excluding the Single Resolution Fund  the underlying(1) cost to income ratio is expected to range between 66% and 68% in 2023  based notably on normalised revenues in Global Markets.Cost of riskThe cost of risk remained moderate at 28 basis points in Q4 22  or EUR 413 million. It breaks down into a provision on non-performing loans which remains limited at EUR 346 million (23 basis points)  and an additional provision on performing loans of EUR 67 million (5 basis points).Over the full year  the cost of risk amounted to 28 basis points  landing below the guidance of between 30 and 35 basis points.Offshore exposure to Russia was reduced to EUR 1.8 billion of EAD (Exposure At Default) at 31 December 2022  i.e.  a decrease of around -45% since 31 December 2021.

APPENDIX 2: METHODOLOGY1 ‚ÄìThe financial information presented for the fourth quarter and full year 2022 was examined by the Board of Directors on 7 February 2023 and has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted in the European Union and applicable at that date. This information has not been audited.2 - Net banking incomeThe pillars‚Äô net banking income is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document. The terms ‚ÄúRevenues‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Banking Income‚Äù are used interchangeably. They provide a normalised measure of each pillar‚Äôs net banking income taking into account the normative capital mobilised for its activity.3 - Operating expensesOperating expenses correspond to the ‚ÄúOperating Expenses‚Äù as presented in note 8.1 to the Group‚Äôs consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2021 (pages 482 et seq. of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document). The term ‚Äúcosts‚Äù is also used to refer to Operating Expenses. The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document.4 - IFRIC 21 adjustmentThe IFRIC 21 adjustment corrects the result of the charges recognised in the accounts in their entirety when they are due (generating event) so as to recognise only the portion relating to the current quarter  i.e. a quarter of the total. It consists in smoothing the charge recognised accordingly over the financial year in order to provide a more economic idea of the costs actually attributable to the activity over the period analysed.The contributions to Single Resolution Fund (¬´ SRF ¬ª) are part of IFRIC21 adjusted charges  they include contributions to national resolution funds within the EU.5 ‚Äì Exceptional items ‚Äì Transition from accounting data to underlying dataIt may be necessary for the Group to present underlying indicators in order to facilitate the understanding of its actual performance. The transition from published data to underlying data is obtained by restating published data for exceptional items and the IFRIC 21 adjustment.Moreover  the Group restates the revenues and earnings of the French Retail Banking pillar for PEL/CEL provision allocations or write-backs. This adjustment makes it easier to identify the revenues and earnings relating to the pillar‚Äôs activity  by excluding the volatile component related to commitments specific to regulated savings.The reconciliation enabling the transition from published accounting data to underlying data is set out in the table below:in EUR m Q4-22 Q4-21 2022 2021 Exceptional Net banking income (+) 0 (117) 0 (117) Revaluation gain 0 (117) 0 (117) Exceptional operating expenses (-) (108) (52) 639 379 IFRIC linearisation (285) (199) 0 0 Transformation costs(1) 177 147 639 379 Of which related to French Retail Banking 69 91 370 201 Of which related to Global Banking & Investor Solutions 54 30 117 92 Of which related to Corporate Centre 54 26 152 86 Exceptional Net profit or losses from other assets (+/-) 54 (439) 3 357 (624) Goodwill impairment (-)(1) 0 114 0 114 Total exceptional items (pre-tax) (54) (494) 3 996 (248) DTA recognition (+)(1) 0 (130) 0 (130) Total exceptional items (post-tax) (34) (561) 3 598 (377) Reported Net income - Group Share 1 160 1 787 2 018 5 641 Total exceptional items - Group share (post-tax) (34) (561) 3 598 (377) Underlying Net income - Group Share 1 126 1 226 5 616 5 264(1) Allocated to Corporate CentreNB: Amounts restated in Q1 22 to take into account the transfer of Private Banking activities (French and international) to the French Retail Banking.

This indicator makes it possible to assess the level of risk of each of the pillars as a percentage of balance sheet loan commitments  including operating leases.In EURm Q4 22 Q4 21 2022 2021 French Retail BankingNet Cost Of Risk 219 (20) 483 125 Gross loan Outstandings 250 175 237 305 246 249 235 220 Cost of Risk in bp 35 (3) 20 5 International Retail Banking and Financial ServicesNet Cost Of Risk 133 96 705 504 Gross loan Outstandings 133 756 137 018 135 743 133 321 Cost of Risk in bp 40 28 52 38 Global Banking and Investor SolutionsNet Cost Of Risk 78 3 421 65 Gross loan Outstandings 190 079 160 333 182 110 148 426 Cost of Risk in bp 16 1 23 4 Corporate CentreNet Cost Of Risk (17) 7 38 6 Gross loan Outstandings 16 363 14 574 15 411 13 835 Cost of Risk in bp (41) 16 25 4 Societe Generale GroupNet Cost Of Risk 413 86 1 647 700 Gross loan Outstandings 590 373 549 229 579 513 530 801 Cost of Risk in bp 28 6 28 13The gross coverage ratio for doubtful outstandings is calculated as the ratio of provisions recognised in respect of the credit risk to gross outstandings identified as in default within the meaning of the regulations  without taking account of any guarantees provided. This coverage ratio measures the maximum residual risk associated with outstandings in default (‚Äúdoubtful‚Äù).7 - ROE  ROTE  RONEThe notions of ROE (Return on Equity) and ROTE (Return on Tangible Equity)  as well as their calculation methodology  are specified on page 43 and 44 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document. This measure makes it possible to assess Societe Generale‚Äôs return on equity and return on tangible equity.RONE (Return on Normative Equity) determines the return on average normative equity allocated to the Group‚Äôs businesses  according to the principles presented on page 44 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document.Group net income used for the ratio numerator is book Group net income adjusted for ‚Äúinterest net of tax payable on deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  interest paid to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisations‚Äù and ‚Äúunrealised gains/losses booked under shareholders‚Äô equity  excluding conversion reserves‚Äù (see methodology note No. 9).

These are contained in the Company's Annual Report.Resolution 2- To receive and approve the Directors' Remuneration ReportUnder section 420 of the Companies Act 2006 (the ""Act"")  the Directors must prepare an annual report detailing the remuneration of the Directors and a statement by the chair of the remuneration committee (together  the ""Directors' Remuneration Report""). The Act also requires that a resolution be put to shareholders each year for their approval of that report. The Directors' Remuneration Report can be found on pages 39 to 41 of the Annual Report. Resolution 2 is an advisory vote only and therefore is not binding.Resolution 3 - To approve the Directors' Remuneration PolicyShareholder approval of the Directors' Remuneration Policy is required every three years. A binding ordinary resolution approving the Directors' Remuneration Policy was last approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 25 June 2020 andit is therefore being submitted for shareholder approval at the forthcoming AGM. There are no proposed changes to the Remuneration Policy. The Policy is set out on page 39 of the Annual Report.Resolutions 4 and 5 - To re-appoint BDO LLP as independent auditor of the Company  to hold office until the conclusion of the next general meeting at which accounts are laid before the Company and to authorise the Directors to determine the remuneration of BDO LLPAt each general meeting at which the Company's accounts are presented to its members  the Company is required to re-appoint an auditor to serve until the next such meeting. The Board  on the recommendation of the Audit Committee  recommends the appointment of BDO LLP and resolution 4 seeks shareholder authority for this reappointment. Resolution 5 gives authority to the Directors to determine the auditor's remuneration.Resolutions 6 and 7 - To re-elect DirectorsThe Articles of Association of the Company require that each Director retires by rotation every three years and being eligible  offer themselves for re-election. Accordingly  David Hunter will retire and being eligible  offer himself for re-election at the AGM.The Articles of Association of the Company also require that at the next AGM following a Director's first appointment  such Director will retire from office. Accordingly  Giles Clark will retire and being eligible  offer himself for election at the AGM.The Board confirms that the performance of both of the Directors seeking re-election continues to be effective and each Director demonstrates commitment to the role. The Board believes that it is therefore in the best interests of shareholders that each of these Directors be re-elected.The Directors also believe that the Board includes an appropriate balance of skills  experience and knowledge. Full biographies of all the Directors are set out on page 3 of the Annual Report.Resolution 8 - Cancellation of share premium account and capital redemption reserveUnder the Act and the Companies (Reduction of Share Capital) Order 2008  a company may  with the sanction of a special resolution of its shareholders and the confirmation of the Court  reduce its existing share capital and apply the sums resulting from such reduction to  among other things  create distributable reserves. Resolution 8 is a special resolution to cancel the entire amount standing to the credit of both the Company's share premium account and the Company's capital redemption reserve as at the date the relevant Court order is made.Subject to confirmation by the High Court of Justice in London and the reduction of capital taking effect  the amounts so cancelled will be credited to the Company's distributable reserves. This will improve the Company's distributable reserves position and will provide the Company with flexibility to support  amongst other things  share buy-backs and the payment of dividends or other distributions to shareholders in the future.Resolution 9 - Notice period for general meetingsUnder the Act  subject to certain exceptions  the notice period required for all general meetings of the Company is 21 clear days. AGMs will always be held on at least 21 clear days' notice  but shareholders can approve a shorter notice period for other general meetings.The Board believes that it is in the best interests of shareholders of the Company for the Board to have the ability to call meetings on no less than 14 clear days' notice should an urgent matter arise. The Board is therefore proposing resolution 9 to approve the reduction in the minimum notice period from 21 clear days to 14 clear days for all general meetings other than AGMs. The Directors do not intend to use less than 21 clear days' notice unless the urgency of the matter merits such a reduced notice period. In order to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days' notice the Company must make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting.NOTICE OF THE TWELFTH ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF GRESHAM HOUSE RENEWABLE ENERGY VCT 1 PLCNOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that the twelfth Annual General Meeting of Gresham House Renewable Energy VCT 1 plc (the ""Company"") will be held at 11.30 a.m. on Tuesday  21 March 2023 at the offices of JTC (UK) Limited  The Scalpel  18th Floor  52 Lime Street  London EC3M 7AF (the ""Annual General Meeting"" or ""AGM"") for the transaction of the following business.As Ordinary Business  to consider and  if thought fit  pass the following resolutions which will be proposed as ordinary resolutions:Ordinary Resolutions1.

CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a ""CREST Proxy Instruction"") must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & International Limited's (""EUI"") specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual.

Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s)  to procure that his/her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time.In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.(g) Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001  the Company has specified that only those holders of the Company's shares registered on the Register of Members of the Company as at close of business on 17 March 2023 or  in the event that the meeting is adjourned  on the Register of Members 48 hours (excluding non-working days and public holidays in England and Wales) before the time of any adjourned meeting  shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting in respect of such shares registered in their name at the relevant time. Changes to entries on the Register of Members after the relevant deadline shall be disregarded in determining the right of any person to attend and vote at the meeting (or the relevant adjournment thereof).(h) As at close of business on 7 February 2023 (being the last business day prior to the publication of this notice)  the Company's issued share capital comprised 25 515 242 Ordinary Shares and 38 512 032 'A' Shares  excluding shares held in treasury  and the total number of voting rights in the Company was 25 553 754 032 votes  being 25 515 242 000 votes attributable to Ordinary Shares and 38 512 032 votes attributable to 'A' Shares. Information regarding the number of shares in issue and voting rights may be obtained from the website  https://greshamhouse.com/real-assets/new-energy/gresham-house-renewable-energy-vct-1-plc/.(i) A member may appoint more than one proxy  provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. Members may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. The return of a completed proxy form or other instrument of proxy will not prevent you attending the meeting and voting in person if you wish. The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons whose shares are held on their behalf by another person and who have been nominated to enjoy information rights in respect of the Company in accordance with Section 146 of the Act (""Nominated Persons""). Nominated Persons may have a right under an agreement with a member of the Company who has nominated the Nominated Person to have information rights (a ""Relevant Shareholder"") to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively  if Nominated Persons do not have such a right  or do not wish to exercise it  they may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the Relevant Shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights. The main point of contact in terms of a Nominated Person's investment in the Company remains the Relevant Shareholder (or  perhaps  the Nominated Person's custodian or broker) and a Nominated Person should continue to contact them (and not the Company) regarding any changes or queries relating to the Nominated Person's personal details and interest in the Company (including any administrative matters). The only exception to this is where the Company expressly requests a response from the Nominated Person.(j) A company which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise  on its behalf  all its powers as a member provided that no more than one corporate representative exercises powers in respect of the same share.(k) Except as provided above  members who have general queries about the Annual General Meeting should write to the Company Secretary at GreshamVCTs@jtcgroup.com.(l) Information regarding the Annual General Meeting  including the information required by section 311A of the Act  can be found at https://greshamhouse.com/real-assets/new-energy/gresham-house-renewable-energy-vct-1-plc/.(m) Members may not use any electronic address provided either in this notice  or any related documents (including the Chairman's letter and Form of Proxy)  to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.(n) Under section 338 of the Act  members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require the Company to give notice of a resolution which may properly be moved at the AGM. Any such request  which must comply with section 338(4) of the Act  must be received by the Company no later than six weeks before the date fixed for the AGM.(o) Under section 338A of the Act  members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require the Company to include a matter (other than a proposed resolution) in the business to be dealt with at the AGM. Any such request  which must comply with section 338A(3) of the Act  must be received by the Company no later than six weeks before the date fixed for the AGM.(p) Members satisfying the thresholds in section 527 of the Act can require the Company to publish a statement on its website setting out any matter relating to: (a) the audit of the Company's accounts (including the auditor's report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the AGM; or (b) any circumstances connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the last AGM  that the members propose to raise at the meeting. The Company cannot require the members requesting the publication to pay its expenses. Any statement required to be placed on the website must also be sent to the Company's auditors no later than the time it makes its statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required to publish on its website.(q) Shareholders may submit questions in advance of the meeting by email to renewablevcts@greshamhouse.com by 11.30 a.m. on 10 March 2023.(r) Voting on all resolutions will be conducted by way of a poll rather than a show of hands.

Any member of the Company entitled to attend  speak and vote at the AGM is also entitled to appoint one or more proxies to exercise all or any of that member's rights to attend  speak and vote on behalf of that member at the AGM (or any adjournment thereof). A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the AGM provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A proxy may demand  or join in demanding  a poll. A proxy need not be a member of the Company but must attend the meeting in order to represent his or her appointer. A member entitled to attend  speak and vote at the meeting may appoint the Chairman of the meeting or another person as his or her proxy although the Chairman of the meeting will not speak for the member. A member who wishes his or her proxy to speak for him or her should appoint his or her own choice of proxy (not the Chairman of the meeting) and give instructions directly to that person. Where you appoint as your proxy someone other than the Chairman  you are responsible for ensuring that they attend the meeting and are aware of your voting instructions.2. Delete ""the Chairman of the meeting"" if it is desired to appoint any other person and insert his or her name and address. If no name is inserted  the proxy will be deemed to have been given in favour of the Chairman of the meeting. If this Form of Proxy is signed and returned without stating how the proxy shall vote on any particular matter the proxy will exercise his or her discretion as to whether  and if so how  he or she votes.3. To be valid  a Form of Proxy must be completed  signed and delivered (together with the power of attorney or other written authority  if any  under which it is signed or an office or notarially certified copy or a copy certified in accordance with the Powers of Attorney Act 1971 of such power and written authority) to the Company's Registrar Link Group at 10th Floor  Central Square  29 Wellington Street  Leeds  LS1 4DL  not less than 48 hours (excluding weekends and public holidays in England and Wales) before the time appointed for holding the AGM or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the Form of Proxy proposes to vote. In the case of a poll taken more than 48 hours (excluding weekends and public holidays in England and Wales) after it is demanded  the document(s) must be delivered as aforesaid not less than 24 hours (excluding weekends and public holidays) before the time appointed for taking the poll  or where the poll is taken not more than 48 hours (excluding weekends and public holidays in England and Wales) after it was demanded  be delivered at the meeting at which the demand is made.4. In the case of a member which is a company  this form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or attorney duly authorised by that company.5. In the case of joint holders  the signature of any one joint holder is sufficient. If more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy  the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted to the exclusion of the appointments submitted by the other joint holders. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company's register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).6. The completion and return of this Form of Proxy will not preclude you from attending and voting at the AGM should you subsequently decide to do so. If a member appoints a proxy and that member attends the AGM in person and votes  the proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.7. To direct your proxy how to vote on the resolutions  mark the appropriate box with an 'X'. If you mark 'X' in more than one box in respect of the same resolution  this Form of Proxy will be invalid. To abstain from voting on a resolution  select the relevant ""withheld"" box. A vote withheld is not a vote in law  which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. If no voting indication is given  the proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. The proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the meeting.",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.51,0.2,0.28,True,English,"['Gresham House Renewable Energy VCT', 'Annual General Meeting', 'Notice', 'Gresham House Renewable Energy VCT 1 plc', 'unique personal identification Investor Code', 'Dear Shareholder Annual General Meeting', 'Gresham House Investor Relations', 'twelfth Annual General Meeting', 'other independent professional adviser', 'local securities laws', 'independent financial advice', 'London Stock Exchange', 'investment platform provider', 'Registrar Link Group', 'Share Portal service', 'The Investment Adviser', 'The Annual Report', 'other nominee service', 'other agent', 'share certificate', 'Financial Services', 'London EC3M', 'Financial Statements', 'The Scalpel', 'IMMEDIATE ATTENTION', 'Markets Act', 'United Kingdom', 'registered number', 'UK) Limited', '18th Floor', '52 Lime Street', 'online facility', '10th Floor', 'Central Square', '29 Wellington Street', 'confidential information', 'best interests', 'The Board', 'accompanying Form', 'Further details', 'hard copy', 'The AGM', 'The Company', 'bank manager', 'DOCUMENT', 'doubt', 'action', 'stockbroker', 'solicitor', 'accountant', 'jurisdiction', 'shares', 'Proxy', 'sale', 'transfer', 'disposal', 'transmission', 'purchaser', 'circumstances', 'violation', 'regulations', 'part', 'holding', 'England', 'Wales', 'Notice', 'Tuesday', 'March', '11.30 a', 'offices', 'JTC', 'Shareholders', 'resolutions', 'votes', 'behalf', 'Friday', 'IVC', 'accordance', 'instructions', 'Leeds', 'LS1', 'pages', 'year', 'website', 'greshamhouse', 'real-assets/new-energy', 'gresham-house-renewable-energy-vct', 'questions', 'advance', 'email', 'telephone', 'later', 'responses', 'disclosure', 'presentation', '12.30pm', 'slides', 'representatives', 'changes', 'arrangements', 'announcement', '020']",2023-02-08,2023-02-08,marketscreener.com

Financial Services‚Äô net banking income was significantly higher by +35.8%* vs. 2021  while Insurance net banking income increased by +6.5%* vs. 2021.Global Banking & Investor Solutions‚Äô revenues were up +14.3% (+12.9%*) vs. 2021. Global Markets & Investor Services‚Äô revenues posted a +18.7% increase in revenues (14.1%*) vs. 2021  while Financing & Advisory activities increased by +15.2% (+10.7%*) vs. 2021.In Q4 22  the Group continued to post robust revenue growth of +5.9% (+8.1%*) vs. Q4 21.Operating expensesIn 2022  operating expenses totalled EUR 18 630 million on a reported basis and EUR 17 991 million on an underlying basis (restated for transformation costs)  i.e.  an increase of +4.5% vs. 2021 (on an underlying basis).The rise can be mainly attributed to the EUR 864 million contribution to the Single Resolution Fund  and increase of EUR 278 million  currency effects  notably in US dollars and a rise in the variable components of employee remuneration associated with higher revenues.Underlying(1) gross operating income increased by +18.9% to EUR 10 068 million in 2022  while the underlying(1) cost to income ratio (excluding the Single Resolution Fund) posted a 3.4 point improvement to 61.0% (vs. 64.4% in 2021).In Q4 22  operating expenses totalled EUR 4 610 million on a reported basis and EUR 4 718 million on an underlying basis (restated for the linearisation of IFRIC 21 and transformation costs)  i.e.  a limited increase of +2.2% vs. Q4 21.Excluding the Single Resolution Fund  the underlying(1) cost to income ratio is expected to range between 66% and 68% in 2023  based notably on normalised revenues in Global Markets.Cost of riskThe cost of risk remained moderate at 28 basis points in Q4 22  or EUR 413 million. It breaks down into a provision on non-performing loans which remains limited at EUR 346 million (23 basis points)  and an additional provision on performing loans of EUR 67 million (5 basis points).Over the full year  the cost of risk amounted to 28 basis points  landing below the guidance of between 30 and 35 basis points.Offshore exposure to Russia was reduced to EUR 1.8 billion of EAD (Exposure At Default) at 31 December 2022  i.e.  a decrease of around -45% since 31 December 2021. Exposure at risk on this portfolio is estimated at less than EUR 0.6 billion  compared with less than EUR 1 billion for the previous quarter. Total associated provisions stood at EUR 427 million at end-December 2022.Moreover  at end-December 2022  the Group‚Äôs residual exposure to Rosbank amounted to less than EUR 0.1 billion  corresponding mainly to guarantees and letters of credit.The Group‚Äôs provisions on performing loans amounted to EUR 3 769 million at end-December  an increase of EUR 414 million in 2022.The non-performing loans ratio amounted to 2.8%(2) at 31 December 2022  down 10 basis points vs. 31 December 2021. The gross coverage ratio on doubtful loans for the Group stood at 48%(3) at 31 December 2022.The cost of risk in 2023 is expected to range between 30 and 35 basis points.(1) Underlying data (see Methodology note No.5 for the transition from accounting data to underlying data)(2) NPL ratio calculated according to EBA methodology published on 16 July 2019(3) Ratio of S3 assets calculated on the gross carrying amount of the loans before offsetting guarantees and collateralGroup net incomeIn EURm Q4 22 Q4 21 2022 2021 Reported Group net income 1 160 1 787 2 018 5 641 Underlying Group net income(1) 1 126 1 226 5 616 5 264As a % Q4 22 Q4 21 2022 2021 ROTE 7.8% 16.6% 2.9% 11.7% Underlying ROTE(1) 7.6% 9.2% 9.6% 10.2%Earnings per share amounts to EUR 1.73 in 2022 (EUR 5.97 in 2021). Underlying earnings per share amounts to EUR 6.10 over the same period (EUR 5.52 in 2021).Shareholder distributionThe Board of Directors approved its distribution policy to an equivalent of EUR 2.25 per share(2). A cash dividend of EUR 1.70 per share will be proposed at the General Meeting of Shareholders on 23 May 2023. The dividend will be detached on 30 May 2023 and paid out on 1 June 2023.The Group is also planning to launch a share buyback programme for a total of around EUR 440 million  i.e.  equivalent to EUR 0.55 per share. The rollout of the programme is conditional on receiving the usual clearances from the ECB.Considering the strong financial performance in 2022 and an exceptional year  this distribution level ensures on one hand a fair remuneration of shareholders  and on the other hand  further strengthens the Group CET 1 ratio.Upscaled ESG actions and commitments by the GroupThe Group defined its new CSR ambition in 2022 and committed to accelerating the decarbonisation of its business portfolios. It also adopted a global approach to preserve biodiversity  enhance positive local impact and deploy an ESG culture to support clients in responsible social and energy transition.On this score  Societe Generale strengthened its ambitions to reduce finance for the most carbon-emissive sectors by setting new targets for upstream oil and gas. We are committed to reducing our exposure by -20% out to 2025 vs. 2019 and to scaling down scope 3 carbon emissions by -30% out to 2030 vs. 2019. Likewise  Societe Generale is targeting power generation emission intensity of 125g of Co2/KWh out to 2030. During 2022  the Group fixed a new sustainable finance contribution target of EUR 300 billion out to 2025. At end-2022  the bank had already exceeded the EUR 100 billion mark.The bank has also implemented several sectorial initiatives such as playing an active role in market coalitions destined to establish a common financing framework on aluminium  steel and aviation  and being at the forefront of rapid-growth economies  such as hydrogen. Societe Generale also increased the weight of biodiversity concerns when managing new commitments involving agriculture and logging operations by giving them greater prominence in its activities  and by taking active part in market initiatives to create common frameworks.Last  to integrate ESG considerations within the Group  Societe Generale launched a vast internal programme to make ESG culture second nature among its employees  notably by rolling out an extensive training programme and making ESG transformation operational as part of the ‚ÄúESG by Design‚Äù strategic project.(1) Underlying data (see methodology note No.5 for the transition from accounting data to underlying data)(2) Subject to usual approvals from the General Meeting and the ECBTHE GROUP‚ÄôS FINANCIAL STRUCTUREGroup shareholders‚Äô equity totalled EUR 66.5 billion at 31 December 2022 (vs. EUR 65.1 billion at 31 December 2021).

APPENDIX 2: METHODOLOGY1 ‚ÄìThe financial information presented for the fourth quarter and full year 2022 was examined by the Board of Directors on 7 February 2023 and has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted in the European Union and applicable at that date. This information has not been audited.2 - Net banking incomeThe pillars‚Äô net banking income is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document. The terms ‚ÄúRevenues‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Banking Income‚Äù are used interchangeably. They provide a normalised measure of each pillar‚Äôs net banking income taking into account the normative capital mobilised for its activity.3 - Operating expensesOperating expenses correspond to the ‚ÄúOperating Expenses‚Äù as presented in note 8.1 to the Group‚Äôs consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2021 (pages 482 et seq. of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document). The term ‚Äúcosts‚Äù is also used to refer to Operating Expenses. The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document.4 - IFRIC 21 adjustmentThe IFRIC 21 adjustment corrects the result of the charges recognised in the accounts in their entirety when they are due (generating event) so as to recognise only the portion relating to the current quarter  i.e. a quarter of the total. It consists in smoothing the charge recognised accordingly over the financial year in order to provide a more economic idea of the costs actually attributable to the activity over the period analysed.The contributions to Single Resolution Fund (¬´ SRF ¬ª) are part of IFRIC21 adjusted charges  they include contributions to national resolution funds within the EU.5 ‚Äì Exceptional items ‚Äì Transition from accounting data to underlying dataIt may be necessary for the Group to present underlying indicators in order to facilitate the understanding of its actual performance. The transition from published data to underlying data is obtained by restating published data for exceptional items and the IFRIC 21 adjustment.Moreover  the Group restates the revenues and earnings of the French Retail Banking pillar for PEL/CEL provision allocations or write-backs. This adjustment makes it easier to identify the revenues and earnings relating to the pillar‚Äôs activity  by excluding the volatile component related to commitments specific to regulated savings.The reconciliation enabling the transition from published accounting data to underlying data is set out in the table below:in EUR m Q4-22 Q4-21 2022 2021 Exceptional Net banking income (+) 0 (117) 0 (117) Revaluation gain 0 (117) 0 (117) Exceptional operating expenses (-) (108) (52) 639 379 IFRIC linearisation (285) (199) 0 0 Transformation costs(1) 177 147 639 379 Of which related to French Retail Banking 69 91 370 201 Of which related to Global Banking & Investor Solutions 54 30 117 92 Of which related to Corporate Centre 54 26 152 86 Exceptional Net profit or losses from other assets (+/-) 54 (439) 3 357 (624) Goodwill impairment (-)(1) 0 114 0 114 Total exceptional items (pre-tax) (54) (494) 3 996 (248) DTA recognition (+)(1) 0 (130) 0 (130) Total exceptional items (post-tax) (34) (561) 3 598 (377) Reported Net income - Group Share 1 160 1 787 2 018 5 641 Total exceptional items - Group share (post-tax) (34) (561) 3 598 (377) Underlying Net income - Group Share 1 126 1 226 5 616 5 264(1) Allocated to Corporate CentreNB: Amounts restated in Q1 22 to take into account the transfer of Private Banking activities (French and international) to the French Retail Banking.

This indicator makes it possible to assess the level of risk of each of the pillars as a percentage of balance sheet loan commitments  including operating leases.In EURm Q4 22 Q4 21 2022 2021 French Retail BankingNet Cost Of Risk 219 (20) 483 125 Gross loan Outstandings 250 175 237 305 246 249 235 220 Cost of Risk in bp 35 (3) 20 5 International Retail Banking and Financial ServicesNet Cost Of Risk 133 96 705 504 Gross loan Outstandings 133 756 137 018 135 743 133 321 Cost of Risk in bp 40 28 52 38 Global Banking and Investor SolutionsNet Cost Of Risk 78 3 421 65 Gross loan Outstandings 190 079 160 333 182 110 148 426 Cost of Risk in bp 16 1 23 4 Corporate CentreNet Cost Of Risk (17) 7 38 6 Gross loan Outstandings 16 363 14 574 15 411 13 835 Cost of Risk in bp (41) 16 25 4 Societe Generale GroupNet Cost Of Risk 413 86 1 647 700 Gross loan Outstandings 590 373 549 229 579 513 530 801 Cost of Risk in bp 28 6 28 13The gross coverage ratio for doubtful outstandings is calculated as the ratio of provisions recognised in respect of the credit risk to gross outstandings identified as in default within the meaning of the regulations  without taking account of any guarantees provided. This coverage ratio measures the maximum residual risk associated with outstandings in default (‚Äúdoubtful‚Äù).7 - ROE  ROTE  RONEThe notions of ROE (Return on Equity) and ROTE (Return on Tangible Equity)  as well as their calculation methodology  are specified on page 43 and 44 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document. This measure makes it possible to assess Societe Generale‚Äôs return on equity and return on tangible equity.RONE (Return on Normative Equity) determines the return on average normative equity allocated to the Group‚Äôs businesses  according to the principles presented on page 44 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document.Group net income used for the ratio numerator is book Group net income adjusted for ‚Äúinterest net of tax payable on deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  interest paid to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisations‚Äù and ‚Äúunrealised gains/losses booked under shareholders‚Äô equity  excluding conversion reserves‚Äù (see methodology note No. 9).

The various restatements enabling the transition from underlying data to published data are presented in the methodology notes (section 9.5). Net banking income Underlying net banking income(1) grew strongly in 2022 at +9.3% (+10.2%*) vs. 2021  fuelled by record performances in Financing & Advisory  Global Markets and ALD  strong growth in Private Banking and International Retail Banking and a solid performance by the French Retail Bank. French Retail Banking revenues grew +4.1% vs. 2021 fuelled notably by robust service fee growth and a very solid showing by Private Banking. International Retail Banking & Financial Services‚Äô revenues rose +12.4% (+17.9%*) vs. 2021  driven by a record performance at ALD and strong growth at International Retail Banking whose revenues grew +11.5%* vs. 2021. Financial Services‚Äô net banking income was significantly higher by +35.8%* vs. 2021  while Insurance net banking income increased by +6.5%* vs. 2021. Global Banking & Investor Solutions‚Äô revenues were up +14.3% (+12.9%*) vs. 2021. Global Markets & Investor Services‚Äô revenues posted a +18.7% increase in revenues (14.1%*) vs. 2021  while Financing & Advisory activities increased by +15.2% (+10.7%*) vs. 2021. In Q4 22  the Group continued to post robust revenue growth of +5.9% (+8.1%*) vs. Q4 21. Operating expenses In 2022  operating expenses totalled EUR 18 630 million on a reported basis and EUR 17 991 million on an underlying basis (restated for transformation costs)  i.e.  an increase of +4.5% vs. 2021 (on an underlying basis). The rise can be mainly attributed to the EUR 864 million contribution to the Single Resolution Fund  and increase of EUR 278 million  currency effects  notably in US dollars and a rise in the variable components of employee remuneration associated with higher revenues.Underlying(1) gross operating income increased by +18.9% to EUR 10 068 million in 2022  while the underlying(1) cost to income ratio (excluding the Single Resolution Fund) posted a 3.4 point improvement to 61.0% (vs. 64.4% in 2021). In Q4 22  operating expenses totalled EUR 4 610 million on a reported basis and EUR 4 718 million on an underlying basis (restated for the linearisation of IFRIC 21 and transformation costs)  i.e.  a limited increase of +2.2% vs. Q4 21. Excluding the Single Resolution Fund  the underlying(1) cost to income ratio is expected to range between 66% and 68% in 2023  based notably on normalised revenues in Global Markets. Cost of risk The cost of risk remained moderate at 28 basis points in Q4 22  or EUR 413 million. It breaks down into a provision on non-performing loans which remains limited at EUR 346 million (23 basis points)  and an additional provision on performing loans of EUR 67 million (5 basis points). Over the full year  the cost of risk amounted to 28 basis points  landing below the guidance of between 30 and 35 basis points. Offshore exposure to Russia was reduced to EUR 1.8 billion of EAD (Exposure At Default) at 31 December 2022  i.e.  a decrease of around -45% since 31 December 2021. Exposure at risk on this portfolio is estimated at less than EUR 0.6 billion  compared with less than EUR 1 billion for the previous quarter. Total associated provisions stood at EUR 427 million at end-December 2022. Moreover  at end-December 2022  the Group‚Äôs residual exposure to Rosbank amounted to less than EUR 0.1 billion  corresponding mainly to guarantees and letters of credit. The Group‚Äôs provisions on performing loans amounted to EUR 3 769 million at end-December  an increase of EUR 414 million in 2022. The non-performing loans ratio amounted to 2.8%(2) at 31 December 2022  down 10 basis points vs. 31 December 2021. The gross coverage ratio on doubtful loans for the Group stood at 48%(3) at 31 December 2022. The cost of risk in 2023 is expected to range between 30 and 35 basis points.

Underlying earnings per share amounts to EUR 6.10 over the same period (EUR 5.52 in 2021). Shareholder distribution The Board of Directors approved its distribution policy to an equivalent of EUR 2.25 per share(2). A cash dividend of EUR 1.70 per share will be proposed at the General Meeting of Shareholders on 23 May 2023. The dividend will be detached on 30 May 2023 and paid out on 1 June 2023. The Group is also planning to launch a share buyback programme for a total of around EUR 440 million  i.e.  equivalent to EUR 0.55 per share. The rollout of the programme is conditional on receiving the usual clearances from the ECB. Considering the strong financial performance in 2022 and an exceptional year  this distribution level ensures on one hand a fair remuneration of shareholders  and on the other hand  further strengthens the Group CET 1 ratio. Upscaled ESG actions and commitments by the Group The Group defined its new CSR ambition in 2022 and committed to accelerating the decarbonisation of its business portfolios. It also adopted a global approach to preserve biodiversity  enhance positive local impact and deploy an ESG culture to support clients in responsible social and energy transition. On this score  Societe Generale strengthened its ambitions to reduce finance for the most carbon-emissive sectors by setting new targets for upstream oil and gas. We are committed to reducing our exposure by -20% out to 2025 vs. 2019 and to scaling down scope 3 carbon emissions by -30% out to 2030 vs. 2019. Likewise  Societe Generale is targeting power generation emission intensity of 125g of Co2/KWh out to 2030. During 2022  the Group fixed a new sustainable finance contribution target of EUR 300 billion out to 2025. At end-2022  the bank had already exceeded the EUR 100 billion mark. The bank has also implemented several sectorial initiatives such as playing an active role in market coalitions destined to establish a common financing framework on aluminium  steel and aviation  and being at the forefront of rapid-growth economies  such as hydrogen. Societe Generale also increased the weight of biodiversity concerns when managing new commitments involving agriculture and logging operations by giving them greater prominence in its activities  and by taking active part in market initiatives to create common frameworks. Last  to integrate ESG considerations within the Group  Societe Generale launched a vast internal programme to make ESG culture second nature among its employees  notably by rolling out an extensive training programme and making ESG transformation operational as part of the ‚ÄúESG by Design‚Äù strategic project.

SG is henceforth the Group‚Äôs new retail bank in France. SG bank‚Äôs ambition is to create a top-tier banking partner  serving 10 million clients in the French market and ranking among the Top 3 for customer satisfaction. Boursorama The bank enjoyed a new client acquisition record  attracting more than 1.4 million new clients in 2022 (2x the 2021 level)  including nearly 396 000 in Q4 22 alone. The bank consolidated its position as the leading online bank in France  with almost 4.7 million clients at end-December 2022  and a target of more than 5.5 million clients at the end of 2023. In the meantime  the acquisition cost per client contracted by around -20% relative to 2021. Average outstanding loans rose +14.4% vs. Q4 21 to EUR 16 billion.

Net banking income amounted to EUR 296 million in Q4 22 (+7.6% vs. Q4 21) and EUR 1 278 million over the full year (+15.9% vs. 2021). Net banking income In Q4 22  revenues totalled EUR 2 219 million  stable vs. Q4 21  including PEL/CEL. Net interest income and other revenues  including PEL/CEL  was down -1.8% vs. Q4 21  impacted primarily by the higher interest rate on regulated savings and the usury rate  which was partly offset by TLTRO benefits. Fees increased by +1.9% vs. Q4 21  driven by the +5% rise vs. Q4 21 in service and financial fees in the Societe Generale and Cr√©dit du Nord networks. In 2022  revenuestotalled EUR 8 839 million  up +4.1% vs. 2021  including PEL/CEL. Net interest income and other revenues  including PEL/CEL  were up +2.9% vs. 2021. Fees were +5.6% higher than in 2021  benefiting from strong growth in service and financial fees. In respect of the outlook  2023 will be a transition year with decreased revenues due to the negative impacts of the end of the TLTRO benefit for around EUR 0.3bn vs. 2022  the specific functioning of the French market that will continue to curb loan production due to the usury rate  as was also the case in 2022  and the continued rise in the regulated savings rate that will have an impact on net banking income of around EUR 50m for each 25 basis point increase. Furthermore  net interest margin hedges that will gradually mature as of 2024 will deprive us in 2023 of the benefit of increased savings. Operating expenses Quarterly operating expenses totalled EUR 1 717 million (+1.7% vs. Q4 21) and EUR 1 773 million on an underlying basis (+2.4% vs. Q4 21).

Outstanding deposits are stable* at EUR 51.6 billion. Robust momentum in Romania (+8.3%* vs. 2021) offset the slowdown in the Czech Republic notably due to a shift in some deposits towards financial savings.

APPENDIX 2: METHODOLOGY1 ‚ÄìThe financial information presented for the fourth quarter and full year 2022 was examined by the Board of Directors on 7 February 2023 and has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted in the European Union and applicable at that date. This information has not been audited. 2 - Net banking income The pillars‚Äô net banking income is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document. The terms ‚ÄúRevenues‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Banking Income‚Äù are used interchangeably. They provide a normalised measure of each pillar‚Äôs net banking income taking into account the normative capital mobilised for its activity. 3 - Operating expenses Operating expenses correspond to the ‚ÄúOperating Expenses‚Äù as presented in note 8.1 to the Group‚Äôs consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2021 (pages 482 et seq. of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document). The term ‚Äúcosts‚Äù is also used to refer to Operating Expenses. The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document. 4 - IFRIC 21 adjustment The IFRIC 21 adjustment corrects the result of the charges recognised in the accounts in their entirety when they are due (generating event) so as to recognise only the portion relating to the current quarter  i.e. a quarter of the total. It consists in smoothing the charge recognised accordingly over the financial year in order to provide a more economic idea of the costs actually attributable to the activity over the period analysed. The contributions to Single Resolution Fund (¬´ SRF ¬ª) are part of IFRIC21 adjusted charges  they include contributions to national resolution funds within the EU. 5 ‚Äì Exceptional items ‚Äì Transition from accounting data to underlying data It may be necessary for the Group to present underlying indicators in order to facilitate the understanding of its actual performance. The transition from published data to underlying data is obtained by restating published data for exceptional items and the IFRIC 21 adjustment. Moreover  the Group restates the revenues and earnings of the French Retail Banking pillar for PEL/CEL provision allocations or write-backs. This adjustment makes it easier to identify the revenues and earnings relating to the pillar‚Äôs activity  by excluding the volatile component related to commitments specific to regulated savings. The reconciliation enabling the transition from published accounting data to underlying data is set out in the table below: in EUR m Q4-22 Q4-21 2022 2021 Exceptional Net banking income (+) 0 (117) 0 (117) Revaluation gain 0 (117) 0 (117) Exceptional operating expenses (-) (108) (52) 639 379 IFRIC linearisation (285) (199) 0 0 Transformation costs(1) 177 147 639 379 Of which related to French Retail Banking 69 91 370 201 Of which related to Global Banking & Investor Solutions 54 30 117 92 Of which related to Corporate Centre 54 26 152 86 Exceptional Net profit or losses from other assets (+/-) 54 (439) 3 357 (624) Goodwill impairment (-)(1) 0 114 0 114 Total exceptional items (pre-tax) (54) (494) 3 996 (248) DTA recognition (+)(1) 0 (130) 0 (130) Total exceptional items (post-tax) (34) (561) 3 598 (377) Reported Net income - Group Share 1 160 1 787 2 018 5 641 Total exceptional items - Group share (post-tax) (34) (561) 3 598 (377) Underlying Net income - Group Share 1 126 1 226 5 616 5 264 (1) Allocated to Corporate CentreNB: Amounts restated in Q1 22 to take into account the transfer of Private Banking activities (French and international) to the French Retail Banking.

This coverage ratio measures the maximum residual risk associated with outstandings in default (‚Äúdoubtful‚Äù). 7 - ROE  ROTE  RONE The notions of ROE (Return on Equity) and ROTE (Return on Tangible Equity)  as well as their calculation methodology  are specified on page 43 and 44 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document. This measure makes it possible to assess Societe Generale‚Äôs return on equity and return on tangible equity.RONE (Return on Normative Equity) determines the return on average normative equity allocated to the Group‚Äôs businesses  according to the principles presented on page 44 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document.Group net income used for the ratio numerator is book Group net income adjusted for ‚Äúinterest net of tax payable on deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  interest paid to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisations‚Äù and ‚Äúunrealised gains/losses booked under shareholders‚Äô equity  excluding conversion reserves‚Äù (see methodology note No. 9).

Cash balances increased materially as a consequence of the international sanctions on Russia.Full year 2022 net profit increased 162% to EUR 1 201 million  of which EUR 603 million resulted from the underlying business performance.Euroclear Holding(‚Ç¨ m)FY 2021FY 2022RussiansanctionsimpactsFY 2022UnderlyingUnderlyingvs 2021Operating income1 6152 7698141 955340 21 % Business income1 5251 600-71 60782 5 % Interest  banking & other income901 170821348259 289 %Operating expenses-988-1 152-20-1 133-145 -15 %Operating profit before Impairment6271 617795823195 31 %-1Impairment-16-12-1-124Pre tax profit6111 605794811199 33 % Tax-153-405-197-207-55 -36 % Net profit4581 201597603145 32 %EPS147.0381.4191.7Business income operating margin35.2 %28.0 %29.5 %EBITDA margin (EBITDA/oper.income)45.6 %62.3 %47.7 %Note: 2021 figures (except for EPS) have been restated to include MFEX pro forma  in order to allow like-for-like comparison.Year-to-date operating income was up 71% year-on-year to EUR 2 769 million  of which EUR 1 955 million related to the underlying business performance.An increase of 159% in earnings per share to EUR 381.4 per share  reflected the increase in net profit. On an underlying basis  earnings per share grew to EUR 191.7.The group maintains a strong capital position and a low-risk profile  which are critical as a financial market infrastructure and create headroom for further growth.2022 Operating EnvironmentIn 2022 financial markets experienced negative returns from both equities and fixed income for the first time in over 50 years. Equity markets were characterised by higher levels of volatility and lower traded volumes. The funds industry was also affected by the fall in value of the underlying assets.The fragile external context  already impacted by the pandemic over the previous two years  was further impacted by rising geopolitical tensions. Most notably  the invasion of Ukraine by Russia led to a raft of international sanctions being imposed on capital market entities and individuals.Inflation increased across international economies  with central banks responding by raising interest rates throughout the year.The consequence of the operating environment is shown below in the group's key operating metrics.FY 2022 % change vs FY 2021 Assets under Custody EUR 35.6 trillion -6 % Number of transactions 304 million +3 % Turnover (Value of transactions processed) EUR 1 066 trillion +7 % Fund assets under custody EUR 2.8 trillion -11 % Collateral Highway EUR 1.8 trillion -7 %Progressing on our new strategic vision to grow stakeholder valueIn 2022  management and the Board defined Euroclear's corporate purpose  an ambitious long-term vision and a five-year business strategy. Euroclear's purpose to innovate to bring safety  efficiency  and connections to financial markets for sustainable economic growth  combined with its culture and values  underpins the long-term aspiration to become a digital and data-enabled financial market infrastructure.To realise this vision  Euroclear will continue to build an open  shared platform providing a catalogue of services to all market stakeholders and complemented by third parties. Euroclear's aim is to evolve the current market model to provide efficiencies that deliver more client value  building on previous successes in collateral and funds.Through its strategy  the group will continue to focus on meeting the evolving needs of all financial market participants from issuers to investors. In addition  Euroclear will increase its focus on ESG  data-driven and digital innovations and expanding its global reach.The strategy will be enabled by Euroclear's people and its technology  with increased investments ongoing to extend the group's capabilities  with a particular focus on strengthening and modernising the group's technology.In addition  greater emphasis is placed on M&A to accelerate the strategy and to provide enhanced capabilities to the group's service offering. Several steps have been taken through the course of 2022 to rollout the M&A strategy  including the investments in Greenomy  Impact Cubed  Fnality and Goji as well as the ongoing integration of MFEX. The Goji acquisition is novel  as it is the first time Euroclear will be operating in the digitalisation of private assets space  in effect a new asset class in its books.The integration of MFEX remains on track despite the challenging external context for the funds industry given lower equity  fixed-income and fund valuations. The combination of MFEX with the existing Euroclear funds business  and alternative investments through Goji  provides a compelling vision for a comprehensive end-to-end funds offering.Ambitious metrics have been outlined to measure the implementation of the strategy over the next five years. The strategy is expected to further diversify the business model and generate value for clients  employees  shareholders  and society  in line with Euroclear's corporate purpose.Underlying Business PerformanceExcluding the impact of the Russian sanctions  Euroclear's underlying business continues to perform strongly. Adjusted net profit rose by 32% to EUR 603 million.Business income was up 5% to EUR 1 607 million  reflecting continued growth of Euroclear's business lines.The diversification of our business provided a hedge against market volatility. The impact of lower equity markets is mitigated by the group's diversified and subscription-like business model. Approximately three quarters of the group's business income is decoupled from financial market valuations.In addition  interest  banking and other income increased by 289% to EUR 348 million on an underlying basis  benefitting from rising interest rates.Underlying operating expenses increased to EUR 1 133 million  up 15% compared to the prior year  partly due to inflation on costs but also as Euroclear continued to invest in its technology and service offering. As well as enhancing Euroclear's client proposition and resilience  the investments in Euroclear's technology are expected to increase efficiency through standardisation and modernisation.Inflationary pressures on costs  as well as the broader impact of the macro-economic environment  are monitored at the level of each of operating entity. Only Euroclear Bank benefits directly from the compensating effect of higher interest rates.Euroclear continues to expect expenditure to remain above its ""through-the-cycle"" target of 4-6% p.a. in 2023  due to accelerating investment in both its strategy and the resilience of the business  coupled with continued inflationary pressures on the cost base. However  profitability is expected to rise as inflation headwinds are more than offset by higher net interest income from subsequent rate increases.Implications of Russian sanctionsRussia's invasion of Ukraine resulted in market-wide application of international sanctions  which had a material impact on Euroclear's financial market infrastructure.As a regulated entity with a critical role in the operation of global financial markets  Euroclear takes its responsibility of complying with sanctions very seriously. Well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining the normal course of business.There is  however  additional complexity because the package of sanctions is wide-ranging and  moreover  Russia does not recognise the international sanctions and has implemented its own economic countermeasures. Euroclear maintains regular dialogue with clients and other impacted stakeholders in managing the market issues and implication of Russian countermeasures.The international sanctions and Russian countermeasures resulted in a loss of activities from sanctioned clients and Russian securities which impacted business income. It is more than offset by increased interest income.The cash on the balance sheet has increased as blocked coupon payments and redemptions accumulate. At the end of December 2022  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet increased by EUR 99 billion year-on-year to a total of EUR 124 billion.As per Euroclear's standard process  which is the same for any client's long cash balances  the cash balances arising from the sanctions are invested to minimise credit risk. Over 2022  interest arising on cash balances from Russia-sanctioned assets was EUR 821 million.Future earnings linked to the sanctions will continue to depend on the prevailing interest rate environment and the evolution of the sanctions. The Board expects interest income to continue to grow as blocked payments and redemptions continue to accumulate  albeit at a slower pace during 2023.As previously outlined  while the Russian sanctions materially impact the balance sheet  the impact on the group's capital ratios is not expected to be significant. Euroclear maintains a strong capital position.The nature of the activities undertaken as a financial market infrastructure has led various parties to contest the sanctions and countermeasures  as well as their application  with legal proceedings ongoing in both the European Union and Russia. While not presently considered a material risk and having limited financial impact  the probability has increased that financial impacts arise  which may result in a possible post balance sheet event. As such  the Board considers it necessary to separate the sanction-related earnings from the underlying financial results when assessing the company's performance and resources.The Board recognises that the unexpected profit should be managed prudently  in line with its corporate purpose and considering its responsibilities towards stakeholders and society  as well as a more uncertain risk environment. Euroclear continues to act in a transparent manner with all authorities involved. The Board will continue to act cautiously by not distributing any profits related to the Russian sanctions until the situation becomes clearer.Responsibility to our people and societyThe newly articulated corporate purpose and strategy recognises Euroclear's responsibilities to its communities and society. Management and the Board would like to thank colleagues for the way in which they responded to the challenges of the past year  while also adapting to a new hybrid way of working.Having established a group sustainability office in 2021  this year Euroclear set out a pathway to reach its net zero science-based targets. This includes setting near term 2030 goals to cut absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 55%  from a 2019 base year.Shareholder returnsThe Board considers the core of the group's performance to be the underlying business performance and shareholder returns are assessed on this basis.Underlying EPS increased by 30% to 191.7 per share  reflecting growth in net profit after adjusting for results related to the implementation of international sanctions.The Board signals its intention to pay dividend per share to EUR 115.5 in the third quarter. This represents an increase of 31% and maintains the payout ratio at 60% of the underlying earnings  in line with last year.Commenting on the resultsLieve Mostrey  Chief Executive Officer  Euroclear""Throughout 2022  Euroclear has continued to innovate to bring safety  efficiency and connections to the financial markets for sustainable economic growth.I would like to extend my gratitude to our people  together with our clients and partners  for their continued efforts in navigating the extraordinary circumstances that we faced last year.

In Asia  stock benchmarks were mixed; Treasury yields fell; the dollar weakened; oil was mixed; while gold gained.Equities:European stocks are poised for gains on Wednesday  tracking the overnight rise on Wall Street in the wake of Fed Chair Powell's comments that inflation will decline significantly in 2023 but more interest-rate hikes will be necessary.The comments ""do nothing to undermine the recent strength in the market  "" said TradeStation. ""They also seem to keep us on track for another 25 basis points in March  with possibly no more increases after that. It's a potential Goldilocks environment for the bulls and a very tough spot for the bears.""However  TradeStation said Powell's remarks mean he refrained from walking back his disinflation comment. ""If anything  he reiterated it in a guarded way "" which gives investors breathing room for the next few weeks as they wait for more economic data.Other market analysts were concerned the noisy economic data has created an even greater divergence between market pricing on interest rates  and the Fed's expectations of how the economic and financial conditions are likely to evolve.""The market has been almost contorting itself into a pretzel and trying to over-analyze his [Powell's] words "" said Newton Investment Management. ""The clear message is if we're going to make a mistake  we're going to move too slowly to reduce rates. We're not going to move too prematurely to raise rates.""Bets in fed-funds futures markets show that traders are still firmly convinced that another quarter-point interest-rate rise is the Fed's likely next move when U.S. central bankers convene in March  according to CME Group's tracker.BRI Wealth Management expects higher borrowing costs and inflation to eat further into companies' profitability. Companies in the S&P 500 are expected to report that profit margins shrank by 8.7% in the fourth quarter compared with the prior year  according to estimates from Credit Suisse.Forex:The dollar softened in Asia  although there seems to be a mild risk-on mood.Sentiment appears to be risk-on as Fed Chair Powell's allusion to ""further hikes"" was overlooked in favor of ""dis-inflationary process "" said Mizuho Bank.Silicon Valley Bank said there is a lot of crosswinds in forex and elsewhere  as markets react to Powell's comments. There are signs of disinflation happening  but the fight is far from over and the strength of the economy can withstand more rate hikes  it said.While there is still need to be vigilant about inflation  there could be another flare-up  and ""the wild card this year is the reopening of China  "" a commodity-hungry economy that represents a ""big supply-side influx "" it said further.Bonds:Treasury yields dropped after Fed Chair Powell's remarks weren't as hawkish as investors had feared.""The key takeaway from Jay Powell's Washington Economics Club appearance is that Friday's strong employment report underscores the Fed's Wednesday message. That message  Powell says  is there is still a lot more work to do "" said FHN Financial.""Powell's communication is consistent with another quarter-point hike in March and plans for more after that "" it said. ""Of course  those plans will change if the economy unfolds differently than the Fed currently expects.""Sevens Report Research pointed out that the market no longer seems to be responding to what Fed's Powell is saying. Instead  it is responding to the underlying economic data  which are suggesting that the Fed may need to be even more aggressive if it hopes to drive inflation back to its 2% target.While inflation has been waning for six months  wages are still rising and some on Wall Street are worried that this disinflation  which Powell cited during Wednesday's press conference  might turn out to be transitory.Fed funds futures  which traders use to place bets on the direction of monetary policy  have also reflected expectations for more rate hikes this year  according to the CME's FedWatch tool.Energy:Oil prices were mixed  but were likely to be supported by Saudi Aramco's unexpected price increase.The producer raised most prices for its flagship Arab Light grade  defying expectations of a cut  ANZ Research said. Aramco also signaled it expects demand to strengthen  especially in China  which is reopening after years of Covid-19-related restrictions  it added.""The price of the barrel is finding support as the reopening of the Chinese economy  following the end of the zero-Covid policy  is expected to drive a significant increase in demand for crude this year "" said ActivTrades.""At the same time  the earthquake in Turkey forced the shutting down of a major export terminal  responsible for 1 million barrels per day  exacerbating supply side pressures and contributing to increases in oil prices."".ActivTraders noted that gains for crude prices have come alongside a bounce for the U.S. dollar. Typically a stronger dollar is a negative for commodities priced in the unit  making them more expensive to users of other currencies.Metals:Gold prices rose after Fed's Powell refrained from pushing back against expectations the Fed would ease monetary policy this year  said Oanda.However  risks of two or three more rate increases remain on the horizon  which should keep gold prices somewhat grounded  it added.Near term  gold and silver are ""likely to remain traders' markets  punctuated by spikes and troughs as consumers acclimatize to these higher levels and U.S. data either confirm or refute hopes for a turnaround in Fed policy "" said BullionVault.---Lead prices climbed on supply concerns.The Shanghai Metals Market has reported that a primary lead smelter in China's Hunan province has been closed for maintenance this week  with operations scheduled to resume next week  said ING.The output of primary lead from this smelter in February is estimated to fall by 2 000 tons  ING added  citing the SMM report.---Chinese iron-ore futures were lower  as the investor-sentiment-led rally fueled by China's reopening is fading.""With the recent ebb of market optimism  price of iron ore faces the risk of pullback in the short term "" said CSC Financial. It remains neutral in the long-run  as fundamentals are strong while regulatory risks remain.TODAY'S TOP HEADLINESJoe Biden Touts Economic Gains in State of the UnionWASHINGTON-President Biden used his State of the Union address to try to sell Americans on his economic agenda and called for renewed bipartisanship  but his appeals for unity were punctuated by Republican lawmakers' loud objections to his remarks.The annual speech  which was delivered in the House chamber before a joint session of the newly divided Congress on Tuesday  gave Mr. Biden  80  a chance to test his message in front of a large audience weeks or months before he is expected to announce his reelection bid. Recent polls show a majority of Democratic voters don't want him to run for a second term  and his approval ratings remain low.Fed's Jerome Powell Braces for Longer Inflation Fight Amid Hiring SurgeFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the labor market's surprising strength underscores why bringing inflation down will take longer and require higher interest rates than many investors have been anticipating.A government report Friday that showed hiring accelerated in January was ""certainly strong-stronger than anyone I know expected "" Mr. Powell said Tuesday during a moderated discussion before the Economic Club of Washington  D.C. ""It kind of shows you why we think this will be a process that takes a significant period of time.""European Officials Push for Joint Effort With U.S. on Green-Technology MineralsWASHINGTON-Representatives of Europe's two top economies proposed new efforts with the U.S. to strengthen supply chains for critical minerals used in electric vehicles and other green-technology products  even as they continued to press the U.S. about its clean energy legislation.Robert Habeck  German vice chancellor and minister for economic affairs and climate action  proposed Tuesday creating a ""critical minerals club"" with the U.S. during a trip to Washington where he met with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen; Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo; and Brian Deese  director of the White House National Economic Council  among others.

'We are proud to have already fulfilled this so demanding task now  far ahead of the planned launch date at the end of March  and in this way to be able to make our customers fit for this revolution in Eurex derivatives trading at this early stage ' explains Carsten SchoÃàlzki  CEO of tickTradingSoftwareAG. With the release 'Next Generation ETD Contracts' (ETD stands for Exchange Traded Derivatives)  EUREX introduces a new Contract Identification Concept which allows to define more than one expiration per month on product level (sub-monthly contracts). Thus  all EURO-STOXX-50 options (OESX  OES1  OES2  OES4 and OMSX) can be combined into a single product OESX.Furthermore  the basis for 'Daily Expiring' MSCI Futures as well as physically fulfilled Single Stock Futures was created  which allow the introduction of new strategies and calendar spreads. Zulfukar Olgar  project manager at tick Trading Software AG adds: 'One of the biggest challenges of the extensive project was that the new release for the most part involved significant changes in all logics relevant to trading and settlement for the trading system we operate'.For example  the introduction of sub-monthly expiring contracts at the product level impacted the trading  clearing  reconciliation and risk management levels of the TBMX system provided by tick-TS. This required a new concept for the representation and identification of EUREX contracts in all interfaces.About tick Trading Software AGWith the TradeBase Multi Exchange Platform (TBMX)  tick-TS AG has successfully provided its professional customers with one of the world's most advanced and reliable trading platforms for more than 20 years.

The acquired wind farm Bergheim in North Rhine-Westphalia is a repowering project  that can draw on long-term historical data on wind occurrence in the region and thus offers particularly predictable yields. The two wind turbines with a combined rated output of around 11.2 MW will generate around 28.1 GWh of electricity annually from the first full year of operation. This covers the average annual electricity demand of about 10 000 households and saves about 20 000 tonnes of CO 2 per year. The commissioning of the two wind turbines is planned for the end of the fourth quarter 2023.This repowering wind farm project Bergheim  in which new wind turbines replace old ones  developed by Energiekontor  is located in the area of the towns of Bergheim and Pulheim in the Rhine-Erft district of North Rhine-Westphalia. The wind farm benefits from a state-guaranteed Feed-in Tariff (FIT) under the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) for a term of in total 20 years after commissioning. The Renewable Energy will be generated by two Vestas V 150-5.6 turbines with a rotor diametre of 150 metres and a hub height of 166 metres.""Repowering wind projects offer particularly predictable and secure yields. Aside from the guaranteed EEG remuneration over 20 years after commissioning  the ""Bergheim"" wind farm offers additional attractive earnings potential through the possible conclusion of PPAs "" Mario Schirru  Chief Investment Officer/Chief Operating Officer (CIO/COO) of Encavis AG  welcomes the latest transaction.

Both companies are united by their passion and conviction for the economically profitable development of Renewable Energies "" Schirru continues.Hamburg-based Encavis AG and Bremen-based Energiekontor AG have already been working together successfully since November 2015. The newly acquired ""Bergheim"" wind farm is already the eighth wind farm project that Energiekontor has sold to Encavis. Both companies want to continue their good cooperation in the future. Together  they are making an important contribution to the energy transition in Germany and actively driving forward the expansion of Renewable Energies.""We are pleased to have once again successfully concluded the sale of a wind farm project with Encavis as a reliable and long-standing partner. The repowering potential in Germany is increasing with each passing year. The sale of the repowering wind farm project illustrates that we at Energiekontor will continue to consistently exploit this potential in the future and have already secured further attractive repowering projects "" said Peter Szabo  CEO of Energiekontor AG  commenting on the deal.About ENCAVIS:Encavis AG (Prime Standard; ISIN: DE0006095003; ticker symbol: ECV) is a producer of electricity from Renewable Energies listed on the MDAX of Deutsche B√∂rse AG.

The acquired wind farm ‚ÄúBergheim‚Äù in North Rhine-Westphalia is a repowering project  that can draw on long-term historical data on wind occurrence in the region and thus offers particularly predictable yields. The two wind turbines with a combined rated output of around 11.2 MW will generate around 28.1 GWh of electricity annually from the first full year of operation. This covers the average annual electricity demand of about 10 000 households and saves about 20 000 tonnes of CO 2 per year. The commissioning of the two wind turbines is planned for the end of the fourth quarter 2023. This repowering wind farm project ‚ÄúBergheim‚Äù  in which new wind turbines replace old ones  developed by Energiekontor  is located in the area of the towns of Bergheim and Pulheim in the Rhine-Erft district of North Rhine-Westphalia. The wind farm benefits from a state-guaranteed Feed-in Tariff (FIT) under the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) for a term of in total 20 years after commissioning. The Renewable Energy will be generated by two Vestas V 150-5.6 turbines with a rotor diametre of 150 metres and a hub height of 166 metres. ""Repowering wind projects offer particularly predictable and secure yields. Aside from the guaranteed EEG remuneration over 20 years after commissioning  the ""Bergheim"" wind farm offers additional attractive earnings potential through the possible conclusion of PPAs "" Mario Schirru  Chief Investment Officer/Chief Operating Officer (CIO/COO) of Encavis AG  welcomes the latest transaction. ""With Encavis and Energiekontor  two Hanseatic companies have been successfully meeting at eye level for years. Both companies are united by their passion and conviction for the economically profitable development of Renewable Energies "" Schirru continues. Hamburg-based Encavis AG and Bremen-based Energiekontor AG have already been working together successfully since November 2015. The newly acquired ""Bergheim"" wind farm is already the eighth wind farm project that Energiekontor has sold to Encavis. Both companies want to continue their good cooperation in the future. Together  they are making an important contribution to the energy transition in Germany and actively driving forward the expansion of Renewable Energies. ""We are pleased to have once again successfully concluded the sale of a wind farm project with Encavis as a reliable and long-standing partner. The repowering potential in Germany is increasing with each passing year. The sale of the repowering wind farm project illustrates that we at Energiekontor will continue to consistently exploit this potential in the future and have already secured further attractive repowering projects "" said Peter Szabo  CEO of Energiekontor AG  commenting on the deal.

These animal data  together with the data from the Phase 1 CHIHUAHUA study  are intended to support the US IND filing of DSR 2.0. FDA approval of the US IND will enable the Company to start MOJAVE  its randomized  controlled  multi-center Phase 1/2a US study of DSR 2.0  planned for Q2 2023.The GLP studies were conducted on 30 healthy mice and 18 healthy sheep. Each animal study comprised of three study groups which included one control group using standard peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution and two test groups using Sequana Medical‚Äôs proprietary DSR 2.0 product. The test groups consisted of one group being given the anticipated maximum standard dose and one group being given double of the maximum dose. The mice were exposed for 30 days  resembling their average life time  and the sheep were exposed for up to 45 days.The purpose of these GLP studies was to evaluate the chronic exposure of DSR 2.0 on animal health and tissue of peritoneum  kidneys  omentum  and peritoneal cavity. Data from both studies reported that no difference in systemic and local toxic effects were observed in animals treated repeatedly with DSR 2.0  compared to animals in the control group  concluding that DSR 2.0 had consistent safety with the standard PD solution.Oliver G√∂dje  Chief Medical Officer at Sequana Medical  commented: ‚ÄúWe are pleased to see these positive animal data of our second-generation DSR product  which is designed to deliver therapeutic and safety benefits over the first-generation DSR product. We have previously reported impressive clinical results from the SAHARA study with DSR 1.0 as a potential disease-modifying heart failure therapy  and we look forward to commencing MOJAVE  the first randomized controlled multi-center study in the US using DSR 2.0.‚ÄùStory continuesOn track to start M OJAVE with DSR 2.0 in Q2 2023The Company is progressing the development of its proprietary DSR 2.0 product  a sodium-free dextrose / icodextrin solution expected to have an improved therapeutic and favourable safety profile  and robust intellectual property protection. Two ongoing Phase 1 interventional  single-centre  single-arm studies  one in Canada (YUKON) and one in Mexico (CHIHUAHUA)  are evaluating the safety  tolerability and efficacy of DSR 2.0 and are expected to each enroll up to ten stable peritoneal dialysis patients to receive a single treatment of DSR 2.0  administered through their peritoneal dialysis catheter. The choice of peritoneal dialysis patients is driven by their pre-existing peritoneal dialysis catheter. Data from the GLP animal and Phase 1 CHIHUAHUA studies are intended to support the filing of the US IND  planned for Q1 2023.Following several initial discussions with the FDA  MOJAVE  a randomized controlled Phase 1/2a US study of DSR 2.0  is on track to start in Q2 2023  assuming FDA approval of the US IND application. The intention is to enrol 30 diuretic-resistant chronic heart failure patients with persistent congestion  with 20 patients randomized to DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter on top of usual care for congestive heart failure (CHF) for up to four weeks and ten patients randomized to intravenous loop diuretic treatment as part of maximized usual care for CHF alone. Following four weeks of treatment  there will be a three-month safety follow-up period. Prior to enrolment of these 30 patients  the intention is for three additional patients to be enrolled in a non-randomized safety cohort and to receive DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter on top of CHF usual care for up to four weeks. Progression to the enrolment of the 30 randomized patients will be dependent upon DSMBiv approval following their review of the initial three patients. More details on the final study design will be announced following the FDA approval of the US IND application. Interim data of MOJAVE are expected in H2 2023 followed by top-line results in H2 2024.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)498 053579Optimum Strategic CommunicationsNick Bastin  Jonathan Edwards  Vici RabbettsE: Sequana@optimumcomms.comT: +44 (0) 208 078 4357About fluid overload in heart failure (AKA congestion)Heart failure is the leading cause of US hospitalizations in patients over 65 years old and 90% of these admissions are due to fluid overload  which is recognized as the primary driver of morbidity and hospitalization. Standard of care includes treatment with diuretic drugs  but these have well-recognized toxicity and resistance issues. Half of the heart failure patients admitted for fluid overload are discharged with no clinically relevant loss of fluid and one in four is re-admitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. It is estimated that 200 000 of US heart failure patients have drug-resistant congestion requiring repeated hospitalization  severely impacting their survival and quality of life and creating a heavy financial burden.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficult breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ‚Äúdiuretic-resistant‚Äù patient population.alfapump¬Æ and DSR¬Æ are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company has reported positive primary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  enabling the filing of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA  planned for H2 2023. Having delivered clinical proof-of-concept for DSR as a disease-modifying drug program for the treatment of heart failure  the Company is planning to commence MOJAVE  a US multi-centered randomized controlled Phase 1/2a clinical study of DSR 2.0  in Q2 2023.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

The round was led by...,"functional protein platform developer on mission to clean labels  improve plant-based foodsHAIFA  Israel   Feb. 8  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Start-up Meala FoodTech  Ltd.  the developer of a functional protein platform  announces the close of USD1.9M in pre-seed investment. The round was led by The Kitchen FoodTech Hub  part of The Strauss-Group and DSM Venturing (the corporate venture arm of the Dutch multinational Royal DSM); with participation of Milk & Honey Ventures  specializing in alt-protein investments DSM Venturing's contribution marks its third investment in the Israeli FoodTech ecosystem in 2022.Meala FoodTech founders  from right to left: Liran Gruda  Hadar Ekhoiz Razmovich  Dr. Tali Feldman SivanWhile the plant-based category continues to gain momentum  alt-protein food formulators still struggle to improve the labels and mouthfeel of their products to match traditional  animal-based counterparts. Currently  popular meat alternatives such as veggie burgers and sausages  typically contain a long list of ingredients  some with complex chemical names unfamiliar to consumers.Meala FoodTech is on a mission to revolutionize the plant-based protein industry by developing new ingredients and processes that allow the creation of cleaner  better-for-you  products.Meala's multi-functional proteins vastly improve the texture of meat alternatives to more compellingly mimic the organoleptic qualities of real meat and deliver a more full-bodied flavor. Meala's proprietary platform creates functional proteins designed to be used as binding and gelling agents thanks to their superior water retention capabilities. The platform enables formulators to boost meat analogues with better nutritional value and functional properties using a short list of ingredients as in real meat.""We are excited to complete this investment round with the support of leading investors "" notes Hadar Razmovich  CEO and Meala co-founder. ""This achievement reflects the investors' trust in our technology and R&D team of experts. ""There is a significant need in the plant-based industry to effectively reduce undesirable ingredients and clean up labels. This investment will help us get closer and faster to the market  better address the companies' specific needs and provide affordable  smarter solutions.""Story continues""It is exciting to support Meala on this important mission to improve plant-based foods  making them tastier  more nutritious  and with readily recognizable ingredients "" expresses Jonathan Berger  CEO of The Kitchen FoodTech Hub. ""This is another milestone in our quest to nourish a better tomorrow  and we are honored to have a leading entity such as DSM Venturing co-invest with us in such a promising company.""The new funding will initially go toward continuing the development of the company's platform technology and accelerate from lab to pilot scale. The start-up's core technology enables the development of functional proteins for multiple meat replacements  including burgers  sausages  nuggets with egg and fish alternatives in development.""This investment will enable us to accelerate our growth and support plant-based producers in their mission to reach new consumer segments "" states Dr. Tali Feldman Sivan  PhD  co-founder of Meala. ""We already initiated collaborations with leading plant-based CPG manufacturers to implement Meala's solution in their products. We are on track to launch products in the US and European markets in 2024.""Meala's vision for plant-based alternatives is to have a short list of simple  recognizable ""home kitchen"" ingredients while delivering the same full-bodied flavor and texture of real meat. The platform works with a versatile range of plant proteins. The Meala solution can be easily integrated into CPG products through existing manufacturing lines.About MealaMeala was founded in 2021 by product innovation specialist Hadar Ekhoiz Razmovich; Tali Feldman Sivan  PhD  a serial entrepreneur and business strategist; and Liran Gruda  CIO and culinary chef. After delving into the meat alternative category in depth  the trio joined forces on a mission to bridge the gap between processed vegan products currently available  and the perception that plant-based products are better for you  and to break down the last barriers between meat and meat analogs.About DSM VenturingDSM Venturing is the corporate venture arm of Royal DSM ‚Äìa global  purpose-led company in Health  Nutrition & Bioscience  applying science to improve the health of people  animals  and the planet.

17997,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4576365-cme-group-owning-the-house-is-not-cheap,CME Group Stock: Owning The House Is Not Cheap (NASDAQ:CME),CME Group primarily operates future and options markets across several products. It has grown consistently due to greater volume in financial markets. Read more here.,"R.M. NunesCompany overview:CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) operates markets for the trading of futures and options on contracts worldwide.CME's product offerings include:Futures and options - They offer futures and options products linked to interest rates  equity futures  foreign exchange  agric. commodities  energy  and metals  as well as fixed income products.Clearing services - This involves clearing  settling  and guaranteeing futures and options contracts  and cleared swaps products traded through its exchanges.Market data - This includes real-time and historical data services.CME's revenue split is heavily weighted towards future and options  as this is their primary operations. Interest rates are the largest derivative traded  given their importance in global markets as a hedging / liquidity tool. This is generally a sticky service for this reason  with a great amount of the trading stemming from SOFR (And other LIBOR successors) and U.S. treasuries.CME revenue breakdown (Q3 investor pack)Investors who have owned CME Group Inc. for any extend period of time have been handsomely rewarded  with continued and sustained gains into 2022. With the business essentially being the ""market"" (or at least a part of it)  this is a reflection of greater market and corporate activity over time.Data by YChartsAn interest factor to consider with CME is that they make their money from trades  which means the business has the potential to be a great hedge as markets decline. The reason for this is that volatility generally increases  which means more trading. This is what initially sparked our interest and will be an important part of this analysis. We will look to consider the quality of the business' current and forecast financial performance  alongside our view of current market conditions and any other factors impacting the exchange industry. Finally  we will look at CME's relative performance against its peers  to assess if it is an attractive investment today.Financials:CME - Financial performance (Tikr Terminal)CME's financial performance has been very strong across the last ten-years  with total revenue growing at a CAGR of 5%. The primary driving factor for this is greater average daily volume over the period. Interest rate and equity indexes are the primary growth area.Avg. daily volume by product type (Annual accounts)Our only concern is that their rate per contract (RPC) has been gradually falling in recent quarters. Management attributes this to a change in product mix and it could act as a drag on revenue should it continue. It has yet to be seen if this will continue or not.Market data revenue is up 6% on the prior year's quarter  as CME has been able to increase pricing. Although this revenue stream is far less significant  it is positive to see inflationary pressures are not impacting margins here.CME's income from ""other"" sources has increased substantially  especially investment income. They are now 29% of revenue. This is driven in large part by strategic investments in businesses  earning dividends and (un)realized gains. Although this is great  it is non-trading and in many cases  one-off in nature  thus has the ability to distort net income.Long term investments disclosure (1/2) (2021 FS) Long term investments disclosure (2/2) (2021 FS)Margins are very impressive and translate straight into free cash flow (""FCF""). In the LTM period  FCF yield stands at an eye-watering 42%. Management's policy is to pay a normal dividend  alongside a special dividend to the extent that all unrequired cash is distributed. Thus  investors are rewarded by both dividends and capital appreciation.Dividend declared (Q3 Investor pack)ROE is an attractive 10%  with much of their equity value now represented by intangibles. This is not a concern as the business does not require a significant asset base as part of its operations.The business is moderately leveraged with any debt issued repaid when possible. This gives the business scope for M&A / greenfield expansion should the opportunity arise. We like that the business has not been tempted into funding large dividend payments with debt  which many mature businesses like to do. With debt at 0.5x EBITDA  there is no real reason to reduce this further and with little in the way of capex commitments  dividends are an appropriate use of capital.Looking forward  2022 is likely to come at around $5BN in revenue  which representing 7% growth Y/Y. Markets have been fairly volatile during 2022  contributing to greater ADV. Beyond this  we believe the business can continue to grow at 3-5% indefinitely  with margins remaining consistent. The business is a market leader in the options/futures space and the barriers to entry are very high. CME can likely maintain this growth with just their current suite of products due to their importance to investors. Analyst forecasts support these assumptions.Analyst estimates (Tikr Terminal)Product innovation:As we mentioned previously  CME could easily continue its current offerings only and be highly successful. However  no sane Management would and so the business is looking to expand and develop its product offering. This includes:Development to e-mini weekly optionsGreater e-mini sector coverageEther options and Euro-denominated Bitcoin and Ether futuresEuro short-term rateTBA MBSsEvent contracts.These cover all forms of development  from incremental improvements such as the e-mini contacts to new products such as Event contracts. This allows CME to maintain its market leading status product wise  while also looking to find solutions for current problems.Mortgage and interest rates have increased significantly in 2022 and Cryptocurrencies have reached new peaks in popularity. CME expanding their offerings in these areas is a great way to align their products with areas of importance in today's market.Event contracts are more streamlined ways of accessing key futures markets globally. CME has seen strong engagement with these contracts and are attracting investors who otherwise would not use futures. This is an opportunity to increase their total addressable market and target new audiences.Macro considerations:Inflationary pressure had caused economic conditions to reverse in late 2021 / early 2022. Interest rates began to be lifted following a decade of record low levels. This was initiated in order to cool demand and ease inflation. A large portion of this inflation is derived from energy prices  which is a market materially disrupted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. For this reason  interest rates have been slow to dampening inflation. With inflation >5% in most western nations  it is likely that rates will continue to rise  with a normalization to sustainable levels in early 2024. The 10-year / 3-month yield curve inverted in Nov22 and remains so. At these levels  a recession is looks likely.10Y/3M YC (FRED)With the cost of capital increasing  valuations have contracted. Further  businesses are posting weaker LTM numbers  many of which suffering margin contractions due to supply chain issues. This has caused a re-rating in global markets  with the S&P 500 down c.20% in 2022 for example.This is neither significantly good nor bad for CME  the house wins regardless. If we look back at Q1 or Q2 2020  the peak of market hysteria during the initial days of COVID-19 in the west  CME posted better quarterly results than the year prior. If we look back at the '08 Financial Crisis  we observe a similar thing  revenues and NI up Y/Y (45% in 08'  2% in '09 and 15% in '10). With interest rates as high as they are  we are likely seeing above average levels of hedging. This is likely one of the key drivers of growth in the LTM period. For this reason  we are comfortable that CME will perform well in 2023  despite weakening market conditions. The only downside risk is if volume falls due to a stagnation in markets  but this should be mitigated by the interest rate segment of their services.Peer group analysis:Peer group analysis (Tikr Terminal)CME's peers are other exchanges  such as HKE  ICE and LSEG  as well as other financial services businesses.As a general observation  we see high levels of profits and general market leading economics. There are multiple reasons for this including:The marginal benefit from extra investor / volume is very high as the associated cost is low. These businesses have built liquid markets through volume  which drives credibility and further users.These businesses operate in the same overarching industry but generally specialize in their own area (e.g.  OTCPK:LDNXF in the UK equity market). This allows for the development of barriers to entry and aggressive pricing.From a profitability perspective  CME performs extremely well  exceeding the average of the peer group. Only HKE (OTCPK:HKXCF) and Euronext (OTCPK:EUXTF) exceeds CME on a FCF basis but lack the geographical diversification.Historic growth is difficult to compare  as many of CME's competitors have been acquisitive at much larger levels  such as LSEG with Refinitiv ($27BN). Forward-looking data suggests CME is slightly below market average.Based on this data  CME is a leading market participate. We would hesitate to suggest that they are the premier business in this group  as slightly lower margins combined with greater growth can be superior. With the strategy Management have maintained to date  sustainable moderate growth will continue.Valuation:Peer group valuation (Tikr Terminal)With attractive economics these businesses bring  it is unsurprising that they are trading at high multiples. The average is 19x / 37x  with CME slightly above average at an EBITDA level and low on a PE level.CME's dividends are only marginally higher than the average of their peers  with the optionality of a special dividend. This is a fairly attractive proposition for long-term holders looking for exposure in this market.In order to determine our fair value for CME  we considered the relative position of CME v. each of the peer group  applying a discount or premium individual. In culmination  this gives us a 20x multiple. At this level  we see an upside of around 5%. Generally  we apply a 5% margin of error and so the upside is not sufficient enough to suggest this stock is a buy at its current level.CME Group Inc. stock has seen very little in the way of re-rating during the last 10-years  meaning it could be very difficult to pick this one up at a discount. For this reason  investors seeking to hold long term can certainly achieve alpha at this price  but today  it is difficult to suggest there is a buy opportunity here.Conclusion:From a commercial perspective  CME is a fantastic business. It has cornered an incredibly large market  which is vital to global operations and will consistently grow into the long-term. Despite this  the business is showing innovation and sequential improvements. From a financial perspective  CME is incredibly disciplined. They have grown well  even during downturns  and have complete control over expenses to ensure profitability. Payouts only reflect what the business is able to distribute  with debt being a non-issue. This is clearly a fantastic choice as a low-risk component of a diversified portfolio.The problem is that a company with all these characteristics is rarely cheap  and CME Group Inc. investors today are required to pay a fair price. We rate this stock a hold for that reason but believe in its long-term growth.With market conditions weakening further  general sentiment could bring CME Group Inc. stock down into undervalued territory  regardless of performance  which is what we are banking on.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

All our efforts are focused on advancing our clinical studies and actively seeking partners for other indications. The positive and very promising results in our main development programs for cGvHD and tibial fracture repair are the main driver for our clinical teams to be able to offer as soon as possible new and effective therapeutic solutions for today's largely unmet medical needs "" said Prof. Fran√ßois Rieger  President and CEO of BioSenic.In October 2022  BioSenic issued 90 668 594 new shares.

The Prospectus also contains the audited financial statements in IFRS of Medsenic for the years ended 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020 and the related notes.About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company focused on (i) the development of innovative products to address high unmet needs in orthopedics and (ii) exploiting the possibilities offered by the therapeutic use of arsenic salts (mainly arsenic trioxide (ATO)) for patients with autoimmune diseases. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic‚Äôs technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAPr.

Today  Lectra‚Äôs Board of Directors  chaired by Daniel Harari  reviewed the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2022. Audit procedures have been performed by the Statutory Auditors. The certification report will be issued at the end of the Board of Director‚Äôs meeting of February 23  2023.To facilitate the analysis of the Group‚Äôs results  the financial statements are compared to those published in 2021 and to the 2021 pro forma financial statement (‚Äú2021 Pro forma‚Äù)  prepared by integrating the three acquisitions made in 2021 ‚Äì Gerber Technology (‚ÄúGerber‚Äù)  Neteven  and Gemini CAD Systems (‚ÄúGemini‚Äù) ‚Äì as if they had been consolidated from January 1  2021  whereas they have been consolidated since June 1  July 28 and September 27  2021 respectively.Story continues1. GREAT RESILIENCY IN A DEGRADED ENVIRONMENT2022 was significantly marked by the war in Ukraine and its consequences. As soon as the conflict began  the Company decided to cease its operations in Russia  by suspending the activity of its subsidiary Lectra Russia and stopping all deliveries of products or services. The Group's direct exposure to Ukraine and Russia is low; the contribution of these two countries in 2021 accounted for less than 1 percent of revenues.This war has accelerated price increases  energy shortfalls and shortages in some raw materials. However  their impact on the Group's financial statements was limited due to its low exposure to energy costs and a limited dependency on those raw materials affected the most.The Group also adjusted sale prices to compensate for the increase in its production costs in January and in July.In addition  the COVID-19 epidemic in China  involving very strict lockdowns and then  following the change in strategy  a surge in contaminations late in the year  had a negative impact on business in Asia  and particularly in China.The climate of uncertainty since the year began was intensified during the second half of the year by growing fears of recession in many countries.These situations have led some of the Group‚Äôs customers to reduce their investment budgets to cope with cost increases  shortages  or potential reductions in activity  while others have postponed purchasing decisions until their business environment and visibility improve.Finally  since the beginning of 2022  the dollar has significantly strengthened against the euro. With a yearly average exchange rate of $1.05/‚Ç¨1  the dollar was up 12% compared to 2021. This change and other currency changes mechanically increased revenues by roughly 7%.In this environment  the Group has once again demonstrated its resiliency  with strong earnings growth.2. Q4 2022In Q4 2021  the Gerber  Neteven and Gemini accounts were consolidated for the entire period. As a result  the published figures and the 2021 Pro forma figures were identical.In a particularly difficult macroeconomic environment  orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (48.7 million euros) decreased by 13% compared to Q4 2021. This decline is attributable to the decrease recorded in Asia-Pacific  particularly in China owing to the impact of COVID-19  and in the countries of Northern and Eastern Europe  which  because of their geographical situation  are more exposed to the economic and social consequences of the war in Ukraine.At the same time  orders for new software subscriptions (equivalent to 3.4 million euros in annual revenues) increased by 68%  again confirming the success and excellent adoption of these products.Q4 2022 revenues (129.9 million euros) increased by 3%. EBITDA before non-recurring items (23.5 million euros) increased by 8% and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items was 18.1% (+0.8 percentage points).Net income (8.4 million euros) was down 26% compared to Q4 2021.Free cash flow before non-recurring items came to 12.1 million euros (13.9 million euros in Q4 2021).3. 2022Acquisition of the majority of the capital of TextileGenesisOn December 8  2022  Lectra announced the signature of an agreement to acquire the majority of the capital and voting rights of the Dutch company TextileGenesis (see press release issued on that date).The transaction was finalized on January 9  2023.Revenues and earnings in line with published objectives2022 revenues (521.9 million euros) and EBITDA before non-recurring items (98.4 million euros) were in the range of the objectives published in February 2022  as fine-tuned in July and confirmed in October.Revenues increased by 35% and EBITDA before non-recurring items by 51% compared to the financial statements published in 2021. The EBITDA margin before non-recurring items was 18.8%.Income from operations before non-recurring items (68.5 million euros) was up 54%. This includes an 11.8-million-euro charge for amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisitions of Gerber  Neteven  Gemini  and of the activity of Glengo Teknoloji. After recognizing a non-recurring charge of 4.0 million euros in 2022  income from operations amounted to 64.5 million euros.Net income (43.8 million euros) was up 55%.Free cash flow before non-recurring items (43.7 million euros) was down slightly compared to 2021 due to a temporary increase in working capital requirement.Comparison to the 2021 Pro formaIn 2022 orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (202.5 million euros) were stable compared to the amount of 2021 Pro forma orders. The annual value of new software subscription orders (9.6 million euros) was up 34%  illustrating the success of the SaaS offers for Industry 4.0.Despite the negative impact of the war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 epidemic in China  revenues (521.9 million euros) increased by 12% compared to the 2021 Pro forma. Revenues from perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (208.8 million euros) increased by 10%  those from recurring contracts (168.4 million euros) by 13% and those from consumables and parts (144.7 million euros) by 12%.EBITDA before non-recurring items increased by 35% and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items by 3.2 percentage points.Balance sheet at December 31  2022At December 31  2022  the Group had a particularly robust balance sheet with a consolidated shareholders‚Äô equity of 452.2 million euros (400.8 million euros at December 31  2021) and a positive net cash position of 11.4 million euros  less than two years after the acquisition of Gerber. The working capital requirement was a negative 6.3 million euros.4. DIVIDEND INCREASED TO ‚Ç¨0.48 PER SHAREThe Board of Directors will propose to the Shareholders‚Äô Meeting of April 28  2023  the payment of a dividend at ‚Ç¨0.48 per share in respect of fiscal year 2022.5. OUTLOOKA new strategic roadmap for 2023-2025Launched in 2017  the Lectra 4.0 strategy aims to position the Lectra as a key Industry 4.0 player in its three strategic market sectors  fashion  automotive and furniture  before 2030. The strategy has been implemented up to now through two strategic roadmaps covering the periods 2017-2019  then 2020-2022.Lectra will continue to implement the Lectra 4.0 strategy over the next three years through a new strategic roadmap for 2023-2025.The Group intends to take full advantage of its change in dimension ‚Äì mainly following the acquisition of Gerber in June 2021 ‚Äì to accelerate growth  to significantly increase the volume of SaaS in its revenue  and to seize acquisition opportunities. With the commitment and engagement of employees  and recognition by customers  Lectra will be at the forefront in building a more sustainable future.To achieve these objectives  the Group has set six strategic priorities for 2023-2025:reinforce implementation of ethical  social  societal and environmental best practices both internally and for customers;leverage all synergies arising from the Gerber acquisition;accelerate the transition of software sales to the SaaS model;accelerate the transformation of the Group's customer relationship and customer engagement model;following on from the previous two roadmaps  continue to pursue external growth;prepare Lectra for the 2026-2030 period.These six strategic priorities provide the Group with a structure for the work required to achieve the ambitions of its strategic roadmap. They are detailed in the financial report on the activity and the consolidated financial statements for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022.Financial objectivesLectra's ambition is to achieve  in 2025  revenues of over 700 million euros (including 10% in SaaS revenues)  combining both organic growth and acquisitions  and an EBITDA margin before non-recurring items of over 20%. These objectives were prepared on the basis of the closing exchange rates on December 30  2022  in particular $1.07 to the euro.The Company intends to keep its attractive shareholder payment policy with dividends that over the roadmap period should represent a payout ratio of about 40% of net income  excluding non-recurring items.Free cash flow generation will also contribute to financing the Group‚Äôs internal development strategy and acquisitions  as well as the repayment of debt.Outlook for 2023In its financial report on the third quarter and first nine months of the year  which included a review of the 2020-2022 roadmap  the Group confirmed that the progress made during the period  as well as the acquisitions of 2021  and the Gerber acquisition in particular  had given the Group a new dimension and increased opportunities for continued growth.While this new status enables Lectra to look ahead with confidence at its development over the medium term  the year 2023 remains unpredictable given the degraded macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  as numerous uncertainties could continue to weigh upon the investment decisions of the Group's customers. Still  the lifting of restrictions in China that was announced at the end of 2022  and which resulted in the reopening of the country at the start of the year  is expected to have a positive impact in 2023.In a challenging context  the Group invested in 2022 to prepare for execution of its strategic roadmap for 2023-2025. By proceeding with two general salary increases during the year  it also decided to protect employees against the impact of inflation  thereby strengthening their engagement and commitment to the Group.Despite the persistent lack of visibility for 2023  Lectra  which has a particularly strong balance sheet and a proven business model featuring a very high percentage of recurring revenues  will continue to invest in order to prioritize medium-term growth.Because of an exceptionally large order backlog at January 1  2022 (4.3 million euros higher than the backlog at January 1  2023)  and the very high amount of orders booked in January 2022  before the start of the war in Ukraine  revenues for the first quarter of 2023 are expected to be slightly lower than for the first quarter of 2022. Combined with the increase in overhead costs  this decline is expected to also lead to a decrease in EBIDTA before non-recurring items.More generally  the contextual elements that affected the Group‚Äôs activity and results in 2022 were reflected heterogeneously over each quarter  making quarterly comparisons between 2023 and 2022 less relevant.Financial objectives for 2023In light of the above  Lectra has set its objectives for 2023  with revenues in the range of 522 to 576 million euros (+2% to +12% at constant exchange rates relative to 2022) and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 90 to 113 million euros (-5% to +20% at constant exchange rates relative to 2022).The Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations and the financial statements for Q4 and the fiscal year 2022 are available on lectra.com. First quarter earnings for 2023 will be published on April 27  2023.

In total  33% of patients in Cohort A and 52% of patients in Cohort B had failed treatment with 3 or more biologic drugs.Both induction cohorts of the study failed to meet the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic response for filgotinib  100mg and 200mg once daily.In the maintenance phase of the study  a statistically significant higher proportion of patients receiving filgotinib 200mg once daily achieved the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission (43.8% vs. 26.4%; p=0.0382) and endoscopic response (30.4% vs. 9.4%; p=0.0038) compared to placebo at Week 58.Story continuesThe safety observations of the study were in line with the underlying disease and were consistent with the safety profile of filgotinib in previous studies across indications.‚ÄúWhile Crohn‚Äôs disease is a difficult-to-treat condition and a large proportion of patients enrolled in DIVERSITY had high disease activity and long-standing disease with prior exposure to multiple therapies  we are disappointed with the outcome of the induction studies. However  at the same time  we are encouraged by the confirmed safety profile and the clinical efficacy signs observed in the maintenance phase ‚Äù said Prof. Dr. S√©verine Vermeire  Research Director of the Group Biomedical Sciences  University of Leuven and staff member at the Gastroenterology Department of the University Hospital Leuven  Belgium.Daniele D‚ÄôAmbrosio  MD  PhD  Therapeutic Area Head  Immunology  at Galapagos added: ‚ÄúAs filgotinib demonstrated robust late-stage clinical data in UC1 and in earlier Phase 2 clinical studies in CD  we are very disappointed with this outcome. The current topline data do not support a Marketing Authorization Application in Europe  and we will analyze the full results to gain valuable insights to guide future research efforts. Galapagos remains fully committed to filgotinib and its approved indications of RA and UC  and we are on track to initiate a Phase 3 study in patients with AxSpA later this year. We are grateful to the patients and all medical professionals who participated in this trial.‚ÄùAbout Crohn‚Äôs diseaseCrohn‚Äôs disease is an inflammatory bowel disease in which the balance of the intestinal immune system is disturbed causing a significant burden on people living with this disease. Crohn‚Äôs disease is considered to be a progressive disease and causes ulcerations that may affect any part of the digestive system from mouth to anus. The cause of the disease is unknown  with onset usually between the ages of 15 and 35. Patients suffer from abdominal pain  diarrhea (often bloody)  vomiting  fever  and weight loss. Estimates suggest there could be up to 1.6 million people living with Crohn‚Äôs disease across Europe  with up to 78 000 new cases every year.2 Despite the availability of advanced therapies  insufficient control of inflammation and loss of response over time are still a big problem for many CD patients.3About the filgotinib clinical development program in Crohn‚Äôs diseaseDIVERSITY consisted of a combined (induction and maintenance)  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial  enrolling 1 374 biologic-naive and biologic-experienced patients with moderately to severely active CD in 384 centers worldwide. The primary objectives of the trial were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of filgotinib 100mg or 200mg  once-daily oral treatment  versus placebo.The co-primary endpoints at Week 10 and Week 58 were clinical remission per Patient Reported Outcome (PRO-2) and endoscopic response per Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn‚Äôs Disease (SES-CD). Clinical remission measured by the Crohn‚Äôs Disease Activity Index (CDAI) was a key secondary endpoint in the induction and maintenance phase of the study. Additional secondary endpoints were clinical remission and endoscopic response (combined into a single endpoint on a patient level) at Week 10  clinical remission and endoscopic response (combined into a single endpoint on a patient level) at Weeks 10 and 58  sustained clinical remission and endoscopic response at Weeks 10 and 58  and 6-month corticosteroid-free clinical remission at Week 58.The results from the previous studies  Phase 2 FITZROY and Phase 2b DIVERGENCE  contributed to the long-term evaluation of filgotinib in Crohn‚Äôs disease.

These animal data  together with the data from the Phase 1 CHIHUAHUA study  are intended to support the US IND filing of DSR 2.0. FDA approval of the US IND will enable the Company to start MOJAVE  its randomized  controlled  multi-center Phase 1/2a US study of DSR 2.0  planned for Q2 2023.The GLP studies were conducted on 30 healthy mice and 18 healthy sheep. Each animal study comprised of three study groups which included one control group using standard peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution and two test groups using Sequana Medical‚Äôs proprietary DSR 2.0 product. The test groups consisted of one group being given the anticipated maximum standard dose and one group being given double of the maximum dose. The mice were exposed for 30 days  resembling their average life time  and the sheep were exposed for up to 45 days.The purpose of these GLP studies was to evaluate the chronic exposure of DSR 2.0 on animal health and tissue of peritoneum  kidneys  omentum  and peritoneal cavity. Data from both studies reported that no difference in systemic and local toxic effects were observed in animals treated repeatedly with DSR 2.0  compared to animals in the control group  concluding that DSR 2.0 had consistent safety with the standard PD solution.Oliver G√∂dje  Chief Medical Officer at Sequana Medical  commented: ‚ÄúWe are pleased to see these positive animal data of our second-generation DSR product  which is designed to deliver therapeutic and safety benefits over the first-generation DSR product. We have previously reported impressive clinical results from the SAHARA study with DSR 1.0 as a potential disease-modifying heart failure therapy  and we look forward to commencing MOJAVE  the first randomized controlled multi-center study in the US using DSR 2.0.‚ÄùOn track to start M OJAVE with DSR 2.0 in Q2 2023The Company is progressing the development of its proprietary DSR 2.0 product  a sodium-free dextrose / icodextrin solution expected to have an improved therapeutic and favourable safety profile  and robust intellectual property protection. Two ongoing Phase 1 interventional  single-centre  single-arm studies  one in Canada (YUKON) and one in Mexico (CHIHUAHUA)  are evaluating the safety  tolerability and efficacy of DSR 2.0 and are expected to each enroll up to ten stable peritoneal dialysis patients to receive a single treatment of DSR 2.0  administered through their peritoneal dialysis catheter. The choice of peritoneal dialysis patients is driven by their pre-existing peritoneal dialysis catheter. Data from the GLP animal and Phase 1 CHIHUAHUA studies are intended to support the filing of the US IND  planned for Q1 2023.Following several initial discussions with the FDA  MOJAVE  a randomized controlled Phase 1/2a US study of DSR 2.0  is on track to start in Q2 2023  assuming FDA approval of the US IND application. The intention is to enrol 30 diuretic-resistant chronic heart failure patients with persistent congestion  with 20 patients randomized to DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter on top of usual care for congestive heart failure (CHF) for up to four weeks and ten patients randomized to intravenous loop diuretic treatment as part of maximized usual care for CHF alone. Following four weeks of treatment  there will be a three-month safety follow-up period. Prior to enrolment of these 30 patients  the intention is for three additional patients to be enrolled in a non-randomized safety cohort and to receive DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter on top of CHF usual care for up to four weeks. Progression to the enrolment of the 30 randomized patients will be dependent upon DSMBiv approval following their review of the initial three patients. More details on the final study design will be announced following the FDA approval of the US IND application. Interim data of MOJAVE are expected in H2 2023 followed by top-line results in H2 2024.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)498 053579Optimum Strategic CommunicationsNick Bastin  Jonathan Edwards  Vici RabbettsE: Sequana@optimumcomms.comT: +44 (0) 208 078 4357About fluid overload in heart failure (AKA congestion)Heart failure is the leading cause of US hospitalizations in patients over 65 years old and 90% of these admissions are due to fluid overload  which is recognized as the primary driver of morbidity and hospitalization. Standard of care includes treatment with diuretic drugs  but these have well-recognized toxicity and resistance issues. Half of the heart failure patients admitted for fluid overload are discharged with no clinically relevant loss of fluid and one in four is re-admitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. It is estimated that 200 000 of US heart failure patients have drug-resistant congestion requiring repeated hospitalization  severely impacting their survival and quality of life and creating a heavy financial burden.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficult breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ‚Äúdiuretic-resistant‚Äù patient population.alfapump¬Æ and DSR¬Æ are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company has reported positive primary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  enabling the filing of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA  planned for H2 2023. Having delivered clinical proof-of-concept for DSR as a disease-modifying drug program for the treatment of heart failure  the Company is planning to commence MOJAVE  a US multi-centered randomized controlled Phase 1/2a clinical study of DSR 2.0  in Q2 2023.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

The division continued its momentum in North America  particularly in the Gymnastics business.Sportainment & Climbing division revenue declined in Q3 following strong first half growth (H1 2022/23 up 34.1%) and a challenging comparison base (Q3 2021/22 up 43.6%)  particularly in North America. The division was impacted by longer negotiation time for projects  in a highly competitive market  for which the Group is currently adapting its offering. The European market remains well on track.Lastly  the Changing Rooms division posted strong Q3 revenue growth of 17.2%  confirming the robust sales momentum seen in the previous quarter across French and German markets.Accordingly  ABEO 2022/23 9-month revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨173.2m  up 17.1% versus the same period last year. Organic growth for the period came to 12.7%  amplified by a 2.3% consolidation gain (consolidation of Eurogym and BigAirBag) and a 2.1% currency gain.Trends and outlookSales activity remained strong during the 9 months ended 31 December 2022  resulting in order intake of ‚Ç¨176.7m for the period  up 8.0% (3.0% organic growth  3.5% acquisitions and a 1.5% currency gain) versus 9-month 2021/22 order intake.ABEO is in line with its roadmap for 2022/23 financial year and confirms its double-digit organic growth targets. Against a backdrop of increased inflationary pressure in the second half coupled with a highly competitive market environment  the Group is seeking the right balance between volume and operating margin  considering that Q4 tends to be a stronger period in terms of business and earnings.Over the medium term  the Group will benefit from the strong visibility gained by its Spieth America brand after its first appointment as official equipment supplier to major US national and international competitions by the American gymnastics federation (USA Gymnastics). This will be a new growth driver for ABEO's Sports division over the coming years.Lastly  ABEO expects business to gradually pick up in Asia as the market grinds back into action after the lifting of health restrictions in China.Next release16 May 2023 after close of trading 2022/23 annual revenueFind more at www.abeo-bourse.comABOUT ABEO ABEO is a major player in the sports and leisure market.

The round was led by The Kitchen FoodTech Hub  part of The Strauss-Group and DSM Venturing (the corporate venture arm of the Dutch multinational Royal DSM); with participation of Milk & Honey Ventures  specializing in alt-protein investments DSM Venturing's contribution marks its third investment in the Israeli FoodTech ecosystem in 2022.While the plant-based category continues to gain momentum  alt-protein food formulators still struggle to improve the labels and mouthfeel of their products to match traditional  animal-based counterparts. Currently  popular meat alternatives such as veggie burgers and sausages  typically contain a long list of ingredients  some with complex chemical names unfamiliar to consumers.Meala FoodTech is on a mission to revolutionize the plant-based protein industry by developing new ingredients and processes that allow the creation of cleaner  better-for-you  products.Meala's multi-functional proteins vastly improve the texture of meat alternatives to more compellingly mimic the organoleptic qualities of real meat and deliver a more full-bodied flavor. Meala's proprietary platform creates functional proteins designed to be used as binding and gelling agents thanks to their superior water retention capabilities. The platform enables formulators to boost meat analogues with better nutritional value and functional properties using a short list of ingredients as in real meat.""We are excited to complete this investment round with the support of leading investors "" notes Hadar Razmovich  CEO and Meala co-founder. ""This achievement reflects the investors' trust in our technology and R&D team of experts. ""There is a significant need in the plant-based industry to effectively reduce undesirable ingredients and clean up labels. This investment will help us get closer and faster to the market  better address the companies' specific needs and provide affordable  smarter solutions.""""It is exciting to support Meala on this important mission to improve plant-based foods  making them tastier  more nutritious  and with readily recognizable ingredients "" expresses Jonathan Berger  CEO of The Kitchen FoodTech Hub. ""This is another milestone in our quest to nourish a better tomorrow  and we are honored to have a leading entity such as DSM Venturing co-invest with us in such a promising company.""The new funding will initially go toward continuing the development of the company's platform technology and accelerate from lab to pilot scale. The start-up's core technology enables the development of functional proteins for multiple meat replacements  including burgers  sausages  nuggets with egg and fish alternatives in development.""This investment will enable us to accelerate our growth and support plant-based producers in their mission to reach new consumer segments "" states Dr. Tali Feldman Sivan  PhD  co-founder of Meala. ""We already initiated collaborations with leading plant-based CPG manufacturers to implement Meala's solution in their products. We are on track to launch products in the US and European markets in 2024.""Meala's vision for plant-based alternatives is to have a short list of simple  recognizable ""home kitchen"" ingredients while delivering the same full-bodied flavor and texture of real meat. The platform works with a versatile range of plant proteins. The Meala solution can be easily integrated into CPG products through existing manufacturing lines.About MealaMeala was founded in 2021 by product innovation specialist Hadar Ekhoiz Razmovich; Tali Feldman Sivan  PhD  a serial entrepreneur and business strategist; and Liran Gruda  CIO and culinary chef. After delving into the meat alternative category in depth  the trio joined forces on a mission to bridge the gap between processed vegan products currently available  and the perception that plant-based products are better for you  and to break down the last barriers between meat and meat analogs.About DSM VenturingDSM Venturing is the corporate venture arm of Royal DSM ‚Äìa global  purpose-led company in Health  Nutrition & Bioscience  applying science to improve the health of people  animals  and the planet.

Speaking on the sidelines of a conference in Saudi Arabia  Goldman‚Äôs global head of commodities research Jeff Currie predicts that oil prices could climb back above $100 a barrel this year.,Oil faces a 'serious problem' by 2024 as production capacity runs out  warns Goldman ‚Äî here are 3 big oil stocks with yields as high as 4%Oil prices have cooled down in recent months  but Goldman Sachs sees a major rebound on the horizon.Speaking on the sidelines of a conference in Saudi Arabia  Goldman‚Äôs global head of commodities research Jeff Currie predicts that oil prices could climb back above $100 a barrel this year.The analyst sees rising demand for oil from China. Meanwhile  sanctions against Russia will likely reduce the country‚Äôs oil exports.‚ÄúRight now  we‚Äôre still balanced to a surplus because China has still yet to fully rebound ‚Äù Currie tells Bloomberg. But the analyst notes that by May  the oil market could swing to a supply deficit.And that‚Äôs not all.‚ÄúAre we going to run out of spare production capacity? Potentially by 2024  you start to have a serious problem.‚ÄùDon't missGoldman Sachs says bitcoin is not investable ‚Äî this is where they think you should put 33% of your wealth instead'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile  refrigerator  or whatever' ‚Äî here are 3 better recession-proof buysYou could be the landlord of Walmart  Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Economics 101 tells us that shortages drive prices up. If Currie is right and oil prices shoot up  oil producers stand ready to benefit.Here is a look at three big oil stocks. Wall Street already sees upside in this trio.ShellHeadquartered in London  Shell (SHEL) is a multinational energy giant with operations in more than 70 countries. It produces around 3.2 barrels of oil equivalent per day  has an interest in 10 refineries  and sold 64.2 million tons of liquefied natural gas in 2021.It‚Äôs a staple for global investors  too. Shell is listed on the London Stock Exchange  Euronext Amsterdam  and the New York Stock Exchange.The company‚Äôs NYSE-listed shares are up 5% over the past year.Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd sees an opportunity in the oil and gas supermajor. The analyst has an ‚Äòoverweight‚Äô rating on Shell and a price target of $70.Story continuesConsidering that Shell trades at around $58.50 per share today  Todd‚Äôs price target implies a potential upside of 20%. The stock also offers a dividend yield of 4.0%.ChevronChevron (CVX) is another oil and gas supermajor that‚Äôs benefiting from the commodity boom.In 2022  the company reported earnings of $35.5 billion  which represented a 127% increase from 2021. Sales and other operating revenues totaled $235.7 billion for 2022  up 51% year over year.Last month  Chevron‚Äôs board approved a 6% increase to the quarterly dividend rate to $1.51 per share. That gives the company an annual dividend yield of 3.5%.Read more: Your cash is trash: 4 simple ways to protect your money against white-hot inflation (without being a stock market genius)The stock has enjoyed a nice rally too  climbing 23% in the last 12 months.In January  Barclays analyst Jeanine Wai reiterated an ‚Äòoverweight‚Äô rating on Chevron while raising the price target from $196 to $212. That implies a potential upside of 24% from the current levels.Exxon MobilCommanding a market cap of over $460 billion  Exxon Mobil (XOM) is bigger than Shell and Chevron.The company also boasts the strongest stock price performance among the three ‚Äî Exxon shares are up 36% over the past year.It‚Äôs not hard to see why investors like the stock: the oil-producing giant gushes profits and cash flow in this commodity price environment. In 2022  Exxon earned $55.7 billion in profits  a huge increase from the $23.0 billion in 2021. Free cash flow totaled $62.1 billion for the year  compared to $37.9 billion in 2021.Solid financials allow the company to return cash to investors. Exxon pays quarterly dividends of 91 cents per share  translating to an annual yield of 3.2%.Bank of America analyst Doug Leggate has a ‚Äòbuy‚Äô rating on Exxon and a price target of $140 ‚Äî around 25% above where the stock sits today.What to read nextThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.
