17938,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/571166-euroclear-profits-russian-frozen-assets/,EU clearing house profits on frozen Russian assets,Nearly half of Euroclear‚Äôs net profit last year came from interest earned on blocked Russian funds  according to the company Read Full Article at RT.com,Roughly half of Euroclear‚Äôs earnings in 2022 came from interest on funds that belong to RussiansA major EU securities transactions company  Euroclear  reported a record-high net profit in its 2022 earnings report on Wednesday.According to the company  its earnings amounted to ‚Ç¨1.2 billion ($1.3 billion)  a 162% increase on the previous year. It noted that ‚Ç¨597 million ($641 million) or roughly a half of those earnings came from operations with Russian assets that have been frozen under EU sanctions against Moscow.The Belgium-based firm settles and clears securities trades carried out on European exchanges  and serves as a central securities depository for financial institutions that operate on European markets. The company ceased transactions with Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD) and blocked NSD accounts within its system following sanctions against the Russian clearing house in mid-2022. The move effectively made Russians unable to access their assets held within Euroclear.Throughout the year  dividends  coupon payments and redemptions on securities that belong to Russians have been piling up on Euroclear accounts. The bank estimated that as of the end of 2022  its balance sheet increased by ‚Ç¨99 billion compared to 2021  to ‚Ç¨124 billion. The funds  in accordance with the company's risk strategy  were invested  bringing in a cumulative income of ‚Ç¨821 million.‚ÄúCash balances increased materially as a consequence of the international sanctions on Russia... The international sanctions and Russian countermeasures resulted in a loss of activities from sanctioned clients and Russian securities which impacted business income ‚Äù Euroclear said  noting  however  that the accumulated interest income ‚Äúmore than made up‚Äù for any losses.‚ÄúFuture earnings linked to the sanctions will continue to depend on the prevailing interest rate environment and the evolution of the sanctions. The Board expects interest income to continue to grow as blocked payments and redemptions continue to accumulate  albeit at a slower pace during 2023 ‚Äù the company predicted.Russian investors first faced problems with conducting transactions and receiving payments on foreign securities in early March last year  even before the NSD was sanctioned  as foreign clearing houses halted transfers while waiting for clarifications on anti-Russia restrictions from authorities.The NSD has been trying for months to obtain permits for the release of Russian funds from the clearing systems. In December  regulators in Belgium and Luxembourg issued such permits  after which the NSD and a number of other Russian brokers applied for the release of funds.However  experts say the permits do not guarantee Russian investors will see their money in the near future  as there is uncertainty around the procedure of their withdrawal. Also  there have been calls within the EU and the broader West to seize the frozen Russian funds and use them for the reconstruction of Ukraine.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.06,0.93,0.01,negative,0.0,0.13,0.87,True,English,"['EU clearing house profits', 'frozen Russian assets', 'major EU securities transactions company', 'prevailing interest rate environment', 'record-high net profit', 'National Settlement Depository', 'central securities depository', 'other Russian brokers', 'foreign clearing houses', 'Russian clearing house', 'foreign securities', 'Russian securities', 'clearing systems', 'securities trades', 'interest income', 'Russian countermeasures', 'Russian investors', 'EU sanctions', 'Belgium-based firm', 'European exchanges', 'financial institutions', 'European markets', 'balance sheet', 'risk strategy', 'cumulative income', 'Cash balances', 'business income', 'slower pace', 'early March', 'anti-Russia restrictions', 'near future', 'broader West', 'business section', 'Russian assets', 'Russian funds', 'previous year', 'a half', 'international sanctions', '2022 earnings report', 'NSD accounts', 'Future earnings', 'The NSD', 'coupon payments', 'Euroclear accounts', 'Russians', 'Wednesday', '162% increase', 'operations', 'Moscow', 'mid-2022', 'move', 'dividends', 'redemptions', 'bank', 'accordance', 'consequence', 'loss', 'activities', 'clients', 'evolution', 'Board', 'problems', 'transfers', 'clarifications', 'authorities', 'months', 'permits', 'release', 'December', 'regulators', 'Luxembourg', 'number', 'experts', 'money', 'uncertainty', 'procedure', 'withdrawal', 'calls', 'reconstruction', 'Ukraine', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-02-08,2023-02-09,rt.com

On an underlying basis  earnings per share grew to EUR 191.7.The group maintains a strong capital position and a low-risk profile  which are critical as a financial market infrastructure and create headroom for further growth.2022 Operating EnvironmentIn 2022 financial markets experienced negative returns from both equities and fixed income for the first time in over 50 years. Equity markets were characterised by higher levels of volatility and lower traded volumes. The funds industry was also affected by the fall in value of the underlying assets.The fragile external context  already impacted by the pandemic over the previous two years  was further impacted by rising geopolitical tensions. Most notably  the invasion of Ukraine by Russia led to a raft of international sanctions being imposed on capital market entities and individuals.Inflation increased across international economies  with central banks responding by raising interest rates throughout the year.The consequence of the operating environment is shown below in the group's key operating metrics.FY 2022 % change vs FY 2021 Assets under Custody EUR 35.6 trillion -6 % Number of transactions 304 million +3 % Turnover (Value of transactions processed) EUR 1 066 trillion +7 % Fund assets under custody EUR 2.8 trillion -11 % Collateral Highway EUR 1.8 trillion -7 %Progressing on our new strategic vision to grow stakeholder valueIn 2022  management and the Board defined Euroclear's corporate purpose  an ambitious long-term vision and a five-year business strategy. Euroclear's purpose to innovate to bring safety  efficiency  and connections to financial markets for sustainable economic growth  combined with its culture and values  underpins the long-term aspiration to become a digital and data-enabled financial market infrastructure.To realise this vision  Euroclear will continue to build an open  shared platform providing a catalogue of services to all market stakeholders and complemented by third parties. Euroclear's aim is to evolve the current market model to provide efficiencies that deliver more client value  building on previous successes in collateral and funds.Through its strategy  the group will continue to focus on meeting the evolving needs of all financial market participants from issuers to investors. In addition  Euroclear will increase its focus on ESG  data-driven and digital innovations and expanding its global reach.The strategy will be enabled by Euroclear's people and its technology  with increased investments ongoing to extend the group's capabilities  with a particular focus on strengthening and modernising the group's technology.In addition  greater emphasis is placed on M&A to accelerate the strategy and to provide enhanced capabilities to the group's service offering. Several steps have been taken through the course of 2022 to rollout the M&A strategy  including the investments in Greenomy  Impact Cubed  Fnality and Goji as well as the ongoing integration of MFEX. The Goji acquisition is novel  as it is the first time Euroclear will be operating in the digitalisation of private assets space  in effect a new asset class in its books.The integration of MFEX remains on track despite the challenging external context for the funds industry given lower equity  fixed-income and fund valuations. The combination of MFEX with the existing Euroclear funds business  and alternative investments through Goji  provides a compelling vision for a comprehensive end-to-end funds offering.Ambitious metrics have been outlined to measure the implementation of the strategy over the next five years. The strategy is expected to further diversify the business model and generate value for clients  employees  shareholders  and society  in line with Euroclear's corporate purpose.Underlying Business PerformanceExcluding the impact of the Russian sanctions  Euroclear's underlying business continues to perform strongly. Adjusted net profit rose by 32% to EUR 603 million.Business income was up 5% to EUR 1 607 million  reflecting continued growth of Euroclear's business lines.The diversification of our business provided a hedge against market volatility. The impact of lower equity markets is mitigated by the group's diversified and subscription-like business model. Approximately three quarters of the group's business income is decoupled from financial market valuations.In addition  interest  banking and other income increased by 289% to EUR 348 million on an underlying basis  benefitting from rising interest rates.Underlying operating expenses increased to EUR 1 133 million  up 15% compared to the prior year  partly due to inflation on costs but also as Euroclear continued to invest in its technology and service offering. As well as enhancing Euroclear's client proposition and resilience  the investments in Euroclear's technology are expected to increase efficiency through standardisation and modernisation.Inflationary pressures on costs  as well as the broader impact of the macro-economic environment  are monitored at the level of each of operating entity. Only Euroclear Bank benefits directly from the compensating effect of higher interest rates.Euroclear continues to expect expenditure to remain above its ""through-the-cycle"" target of 4-6% p.a. in 2023  due to accelerating investment in both its strategy and the resilience of the business  coupled with continued inflationary pressures on the cost base. However  profitability is expected to rise as inflation headwinds are more than offset by higher net interest income from subsequent rate increases.Implications of Russian sanctionsRussia's invasion of Ukraine resulted in market-wide application of international sanctions  which had a material impact on Euroclear's financial market infrastructure.As a regulated entity with a critical role in the operation of global financial markets  Euroclear takes its responsibility of complying with sanctions very seriously. Well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining the normal course of business.There is  however  additional complexity because the package of sanctions is wide-ranging and  moreover  Russia does not recognise the international sanctions and has implemented its own economic countermeasures. Euroclear maintains regular dialogue with clients and other impacted stakeholders in managing the market issues and implication of Russian countermeasures.The international sanctions and Russian countermeasures resulted in a loss of activities from sanctioned clients and Russian securities which impacted business income. It is more than offset by increased interest income.The cash on the balance sheet has increased as blocked coupon payments and redemptions accumulate. At the end of December 2022  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet increased by EUR 99 billion year-on-year to a total of EUR 124 billion.As per Euroclear's standard process  which is the same for any client's long cash balances  the cash balances arising from the sanctions are invested to minimise credit risk. Over 2022  interest arising on cash balances from Russia-sanctioned assets was EUR 821 million.Future earnings linked to the sanctions will continue to depend on the prevailing interest rate environment and the evolution of the sanctions. The Board expects interest income to continue to grow as blocked payments and redemptions continue to accumulate  albeit at a slower pace during 2023.As previously outlined  while the Russian sanctions materially impact the balance sheet  the impact on the group's capital ratios is not expected to be significant. Euroclear maintains a strong capital position.The nature of the activities undertaken as a financial market infrastructure has led various parties to contest the sanctions and countermeasures  as well as their application  with legal proceedings ongoing in both the European Union and Russia. While not presently considered a material risk and having limited financial impact  the probability has increased that financial impacts arise  which may result in a possible post balance sheet event. As such  the Board considers it necessary to separate the sanction-related earnings from the underlying financial results when assessing the company's performance and resources.The Board recognises that the unexpected profit should be managed prudently  in line with its corporate purpose and considering its responsibilities towards stakeholders and society  as well as a more uncertain risk environment. Euroclear continues to act in a transparent manner with all authorities involved. The Board will continue to act cautiously by not distributing any profits related to the Russian sanctions until the situation becomes clearer.Responsibility to our people and societyThe newly articulated corporate purpose and strategy recognises Euroclear's responsibilities to its communities and society. Management and the Board would like to thank colleagues for the way in which they responded to the challenges of the past year  while also adapting to a new hybrid way of working.Having established a group sustainability office in 2021  this year Euroclear set out a pathway to reach its net zero science-based targets. This includes setting near term 2030 goals to cut absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 55%  from a 2019 base year.Shareholder returnsThe Board considers the core of the group's performance to be the underlying business performance and shareholder returns are assessed on this basis.Underlying EPS increased by 30% to 191.7 per share  reflecting growth in net profit after adjusting for results related to the implementation of international sanctions.The Board signals its intention to pay dividend per share to EUR 115.5 in the third quarter. This represents an increase of 31% and maintains the payout ratio at 60% of the underlying earnings  in line with last year.Commenting on the resultsLieve Mostrey  Chief Executive Officer  Euroclear""Throughout 2022  Euroclear has continued to innovate to bring safety  efficiency and connections to the financial markets for sustainable economic growth.I would like to extend my gratitude to our people  together with our clients and partners  for their continued efforts in navigating the extraordinary circumstances that we faced last year.

It breaks down into a provision on non-performing loans which remains limited at EUR 346 million (23 basis points)  and an additional provision on performing loans of EUR 67 million (5 basis points).Over the full year  the cost of risk amounted to 28 basis points  landing below the guidance of between 30 and 35 basis points.Offshore exposure to Russia was reduced to EUR 1.8 billion of EAD (Exposure At Default) at 31 December 2022  i.e.  a decrease of around -45% since 31 December 2021.

A cash dividend of EUR 1.70 per share will be proposed at the General Meeting of Shareholders on 23 May 2023. The dividend will be detached on 30 May 2023 and paid out on 1 June 2023.The Group is also planning to launch a share buyback programme for a total of around EUR 440 million  i.e.  equivalent to EUR 0.55 per share. The rollout of the programme is conditional on receiving the usual clearances from the ECB.Considering the strong financial performance in 2022 and an exceptional year  this distribution level ensures on one hand a fair remuneration of shareholders  and on the other hand  further strengthens the Group CET 1 ratio.Upscaled ESG actions and commitments by the GroupThe Group defined its new CSR ambition in 2022 and committed to accelerating the decarbonisation of its business portfolios. It also adopted a global approach to preserve biodiversity  enhance positive local impact and deploy an ESG culture to support clients in responsible social and energy transition.On this score  Societe Generale strengthened its ambitions to reduce finance for the most carbon-emissive sectors by setting new targets for upstream oil and gas. We are committed to reducing our exposure by -20% out to 2025 vs. 2019 and to scaling down scope 3 carbon emissions by -30% out to 2030 vs. 2019. Likewise  Societe Generale is targeting power generation emission intensity of 125g of Co2/KWh out to 2030. During 2022  the Group fixed a new sustainable finance contribution target of EUR 300 billion out to 2025. At end-2022  the bank had already exceeded the EUR 100 billion mark.The bank has also implemented several sectorial initiatives such as playing an active role in market coalitions destined to establish a common financing framework on aluminium  steel and aviation  and being at the forefront of rapid-growth economies  such as hydrogen.

Net interest income and other revenues  including PEL/CEL  was down -1.8% vs. Q4 21  impacted primarily by the higher interest rate on regulated savings and the usury rate  which was partly offset by TLTRO benefits.

Net interest income and other revenues  including PEL/CEL  were up +2.9% vs. 2021. Fees were +5.6% higher than in 2021  benefiting from strong growth in service and financial fees.In respect of the outlook  2023 will be a transition year with decreased revenues due to the negative impacts of the end of the TLTRO benefit for around EUR 0.3bn vs. 2022  the specific functioning of the French market that will continue to curb loan production due to the usury rate  as was also the case in 2022  and the continued rise in the regulated savings rate that will have an impact on net banking income of around EUR 50m for each 25 basis point increase. Furthermore  net interest margin hedges that will gradually mature as of 2024 will deprive us in 2023 of the benefit of increased savings.Operating expensesQuarterly operating expenses totalled EUR 1 717 million (+1.7% vs. Q4 21) and EUR 1 773 million on an underlying basis (+2.4% vs. Q4 21).

APPENDIX 2: METHODOLOGY1 ‚ÄìThe financial information presented for the fourth quarter and full year 2022 was examined by the Board of Directors on 7 February 2023 and has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted in the European Union and applicable at that date. This information has not been audited.2 - Net banking incomeThe pillars‚Äô net banking income is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document. The terms ‚ÄúRevenues‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Banking Income‚Äù are used interchangeably. They provide a normalised measure of each pillar‚Äôs net banking income taking into account the normative capital mobilised for its activity.3 - Operating expensesOperating expenses correspond to the ‚ÄúOperating Expenses‚Äù as presented in note 8.1 to the Group‚Äôs consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2021 (pages 482 et seq. of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document). The term ‚Äúcosts‚Äù is also used to refer to Operating Expenses. The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document.4 - IFRIC 21 adjustmentThe IFRIC 21 adjustment corrects the result of the charges recognised in the accounts in their entirety when they are due (generating event) so as to recognise only the portion relating to the current quarter  i.e. a quarter of the total. It consists in smoothing the charge recognised accordingly over the financial year in order to provide a more economic idea of the costs actually attributable to the activity over the period analysed.The contributions to Single Resolution Fund (¬´ SRF ¬ª) are part of IFRIC21 adjusted charges  they include contributions to national resolution funds within the EU.5 ‚Äì Exceptional items ‚Äì Transition from accounting data to underlying dataIt may be necessary for the Group to present underlying indicators in order to facilitate the understanding of its actual performance. The transition from published data to underlying data is obtained by restating published data for exceptional items and the IFRIC 21 adjustment.Moreover  the Group restates the revenues and earnings of the French Retail Banking pillar for PEL/CEL provision allocations or write-backs.

These are contained in the Company's Annual Report.Resolution 2- To receive and approve the Directors' Remuneration ReportUnder section 420 of the Companies Act 2006 (the ""Act"")  the Directors must prepare an annual report detailing the remuneration of the Directors and a statement by the chair of the remuneration committee (together  the ""Directors' Remuneration Report""). The Act also requires that a resolution be put to shareholders each year for their approval of that report. The Directors' Remuneration Report can be found on pages 39 to 41 of the Annual Report. Resolution 2 is an advisory vote only and therefore is not binding.Resolution 3 - To approve the Directors' Remuneration PolicyShareholder approval of the Directors' Remuneration Policy is required every three years. A binding ordinary resolution approving the Directors' Remuneration Policy was last approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 25 June 2020 andit is therefore being submitted for shareholder approval at the forthcoming AGM. There are no proposed changes to the Remuneration Policy. The Policy is set out on page 39 of the Annual Report.Resolutions 4 and 5 - To re-appoint BDO LLP as independent auditor of the Company  to hold office until the conclusion of the next general meeting at which accounts are laid before the Company and to authorise the Directors to determine the remuneration of BDO LLPAt each general meeting at which the Company's accounts are presented to its members  the Company is required to re-appoint an auditor to serve until the next such meeting. The Board  on the recommendation of the Audit Committee  recommends the appointment of BDO LLP and resolution 4 seeks shareholder authority for this reappointment. Resolution 5 gives authority to the Directors to determine the auditor's remuneration.Resolutions 6 and 7 - To re-elect DirectorsThe Articles of Association of the Company require that each Director retires by rotation every three years and being eligible  offer themselves for re-election. Accordingly  David Hunter will retire and being eligible  offer himself for re-election at the AGM.The Articles of Association of the Company also require that at the next AGM following a Director's first appointment  such Director will retire from office. Accordingly  Giles Clark will retire and being eligible  offer himself for election at the AGM.The Board confirms that the performance of both of the Directors seeking re-election continues to be effective and each Director demonstrates commitment to the role. The Board believes that it is therefore in the best interests of shareholders that each of these Directors be re-elected.The Directors also believe that the Board includes an appropriate balance of skills  experience and knowledge. Full biographies of all the Directors are set out on page 3 of the Annual Report.Resolution 8 - Cancellation of share premium account and capital redemption reserveUnder the Act and the Companies (Reduction of Share Capital) Order 2008  a company may  with the sanction of a special resolution of its shareholders and the confirmation of the Court  reduce its existing share capital and apply the sums resulting from such reduction to  among other things  create distributable reserves. Resolution 8 is a special resolution to cancel the entire amount standing to the credit of both the Company's share premium account and the Company's capital redemption reserve as at the date the relevant Court order is made.Subject to confirmation by the High Court of Justice in London and the reduction of capital taking effect  the amounts so cancelled will be credited to the Company's distributable reserves. This will improve the Company's distributable reserves position and will provide the Company with flexibility to support  amongst other things  share buy-backs and the payment of dividends or other distributions to shareholders in the future.Resolution 9 - Notice period for general meetingsUnder the Act  subject to certain exceptions  the notice period required for all general meetings of the Company is 21 clear days. AGMs will always be held on at least 21 clear days' notice  but shareholders can approve a shorter notice period for other general meetings.The Board believes that it is in the best interests of shareholders of the Company for the Board to have the ability to call meetings on no less than 14 clear days' notice should an urgent matter arise. The Board is therefore proposing resolution 9 to approve the reduction in the minimum notice period from 21 clear days to 14 clear days for all general meetings other than AGMs. The Directors do not intend to use less than 21 clear days' notice unless the urgency of the matter merits such a reduced notice period. In order to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days' notice the Company must make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting.NOTICE OF THE TWELFTH ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF GRESHAM HOUSE RENEWABLE ENERGY VCT 1 PLCNOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that the twelfth Annual General Meeting of Gresham House Renewable Energy VCT 1 plc (the ""Company"") will be held at 11.30 a.m. on Tuesday  21 March 2023 at the offices of JTC (UK) Limited  The Scalpel  18th Floor  52 Lime Street  London EC3M 7AF (the ""Annual General Meeting"" or ""AGM"") for the transaction of the following business.As Ordinary Business  to consider and  if thought fit  pass the following resolutions which will be proposed as ordinary resolutions:Ordinary Resolutions1.

Please read Note (i) below. Under section 319A of the Companies Act 2006 (the ""Act"")  any member attending the meeting has a right to ask questions. The Company must answer any question a member asks relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting unless:¬∑ answering the question would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information;¬∑ the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question; or¬∑ it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.(d) In order to revoke a proxy instruction  a member will need to inform the Company by sending a signed hard copy notice clearly stating the intention to revoke the proxy appointment to the Company's Registrar Link Group at 10th Floor  Central Square  29 Wellington Street  Leeds  LS1 4DL. In the case of a member which is a company  the revocation notice must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for the company. Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the revocation notice is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be included with the revocation notice.The revocation notice must be received by the Registrar not less than 48 hours (excluding non-working days and public holidays in England and Wales) before the time appointed for holding the meeting or any adjourned meeting.(e) You may submit your proxy electronically using the Share Portal service at www.signalshares.com. Shareholders can use this service to appoint a proxy online. The same voting deadline of 48 hours (excluding non-working days and public holidays in England and Wales) before the time of the meeting applies. Shareholders will need to use the unique personal identification Investor Code (""IVC"") printed on your share certificate. If you need help with using this service  please contact our Registrar  Link Group on 0371 664 0300 or via email at shareholderenquiries@linkgroup.co.uk.

Lines are open between 9.00 a.m. - 5.30 p.m.  Monday to Friday excluding public holidays in England and Wales.(f) CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the meeting and any adjournment(s) of it by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available from https://www.euroclear.com/site/ public/EUI). CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a ""CREST Proxy Instruction"") must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & International Limited's (""EUI"") specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message  regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the Company's Registrar (ID: RA10) no later than 48 hours (excluding non-working days) before the time of the meeting or any adjournment thereof. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the Company's Registrar is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST.CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that EUI does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s)  to procure that his/her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time.In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.(g) Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001  the Company has specified that only those holders of the Company's shares registered on the Register of Members of the Company as at close of business on 17 March 2023 or  in the event that the meeting is adjourned  on the Register of Members 48 hours (excluding non-working days and public holidays in England and Wales) before the time of any adjourned meeting  shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting in respect of such shares registered in their name at the relevant time. Changes to entries on the Register of Members after the relevant deadline shall be disregarded in determining the right of any person to attend and vote at the meeting (or the relevant adjournment thereof).(h) As at close of business on 7 February 2023 (being the last business day prior to the publication of this notice)  the Company's issued share capital comprised 25 515 242 Ordinary Shares and 38 512 032 'A' Shares  excluding shares held in treasury  and the total number of voting rights in the Company was 25 553 754 032 votes  being 25 515 242 000 votes attributable to Ordinary Shares and 38 512 032 votes attributable to 'A' Shares. Information regarding the number of shares in issue and voting rights may be obtained from the website  https://greshamhouse.com/real-assets/new-energy/gresham-house-renewable-energy-vct-1-plc/.(i) A member may appoint more than one proxy  provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. Members may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. The return of a completed proxy form or other instrument of proxy will not prevent you attending the meeting and voting in person if you wish. The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons whose shares are held on their behalf by another person and who have been nominated to enjoy information rights in respect of the Company in accordance with Section 146 of the Act (""Nominated Persons""). Nominated Persons may have a right under an agreement with a member of the Company who has nominated the Nominated Person to have information rights (a ""Relevant Shareholder"") to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively  if Nominated Persons do not have such a right  or do not wish to exercise it  they may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the Relevant Shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights. The main point of contact in terms of a Nominated Person's investment in the Company remains the Relevant Shareholder (or  perhaps  the Nominated Person's custodian or broker) and a Nominated Person should continue to contact them (and not the Company) regarding any changes or queries relating to the Nominated Person's personal details and interest in the Company (including any administrative matters). The only exception to this is where the Company expressly requests a response from the Nominated Person.(j) A company which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise  on its behalf  all its powers as a member provided that no more than one corporate representative exercises powers in respect of the same share.(k) Except as provided above  members who have general queries about the Annual General Meeting should write to the Company Secretary at GreshamVCTs@jtcgroup.com.(l) Information regarding the Annual General Meeting  including the information required by section 311A of the Act  can be found at https://greshamhouse.com/real-assets/new-energy/gresham-house-renewable-energy-vct-1-plc/.(m) Members may not use any electronic address provided either in this notice  or any related documents (including the Chairman's letter and Form of Proxy)  to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.(n) Under section 338 of the Act  members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require the Company to give notice of a resolution which may properly be moved at the AGM. Any such request  which must comply with section 338(4) of the Act  must be received by the Company no later than six weeks before the date fixed for the AGM.(o) Under section 338A of the Act  members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require the Company to include a matter (other than a proposed resolution) in the business to be dealt with at the AGM. Any such request  which must comply with section 338A(3) of the Act  must be received by the Company no later than six weeks before the date fixed for the AGM.(p) Members satisfying the thresholds in section 527 of the Act can require the Company to publish a statement on its website setting out any matter relating to: (a) the audit of the Company's accounts (including the auditor's report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the AGM; or (b) any circumstances connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the last AGM  that the members propose to raise at the meeting. The Company cannot require the members requesting the publication to pay its expenses. Any statement required to be placed on the website must also be sent to the Company's auditors no later than the time it makes its statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required to publish on its website.(q) Shareholders may submit questions in advance of the meeting by email to renewablevcts@greshamhouse.com by 11.30 a.m. on 10 March 2023.(r) Voting on all resolutions will be conducted by way of a poll rather than a show of hands. The Board believes that this is a more transparent method of voting as member votes are to be counted according to the number of shares held. As soon as practicable following the meeting  the results of the voting and the number of proxy votes cast for and against and the number of votes actively withheld in respect of each of the resolutions will be announced via a regulatory information service and also placed on the Company's website.(s) None of the Directors has a contract of service with the Company. A copy of the generic terms and conditions of appointment that have been adopted by the Directors will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during usual business hours on any weekday (except weekends and public holidays) until the date of the meeting and at the place of the meeting for a period of fifteen minutes prior to and during the meeting.BEFORE COMPLETING THIS FORM PLEASE READ THE EXPLANATORY NOTESFor use at the Annual General Meeting of the above-named Company to be held at 11.30 a.m. on 21 March 2023 at the offices of JTC (UK) Limited  The Scalpel  18th Floor  52 Lime Street  London EC3M 7AF and at any adjournment thereof (the ""Annual General Meeting"" or ""AGM"").I/We*(in BLOCK CAPITALS) ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..........................‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Ä¶....................of .‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...............being the holder(s)* of Ordinary Shares of 0.1p each/ A Shares of 0.1p each in the above-named Company  hereby appoint the Chairman of the meeting (see Note 2)or ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...............of .‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.............as my/our* proxy to exercise my/our* rights in respect of the aforementioned shares to attend  speak and vote on my/our* behalf at the AGM or at any adjournment thereof.I/We* desire to vote on the resolutions as indicated in the appropriate column below.Please indicate with an ""X"" in the appropriate box opposite each resolution how you wish your vote to be cast.Details of the resolutions are set out in the Notice of the Annual General Meeting.ORDINARY BUSINESS FOR AGAINST WITHELD 1.

Any member of the Company entitled to attend  speak and vote at the AGM is also entitled to appoint one or more proxies to exercise all or any of that member's rights to attend  speak and vote on behalf of that member at the AGM (or any adjournment thereof). A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the AGM provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A proxy may demand  or join in demanding  a poll. A proxy need not be a member of the Company but must attend the meeting in order to represent his or her appointer. A member entitled to attend  speak and vote at the meeting may appoint the Chairman of the meeting or another person as his or her proxy although the Chairman of the meeting will not speak for the member. A member who wishes his or her proxy to speak for him or her should appoint his or her own choice of proxy (not the Chairman of the meeting) and give instructions directly to that person. Where you appoint as your proxy someone other than the Chairman  you are responsible for ensuring that they attend the meeting and are aware of your voting instructions.2. Delete ""the Chairman of the meeting"" if it is desired to appoint any other person and insert his or her name and address. If no name is inserted  the proxy will be deemed to have been given in favour of the Chairman of the meeting. If this Form of Proxy is signed and returned without stating how the proxy shall vote on any particular matter the proxy will exercise his or her discretion as to whether  and if so how  he or she votes.3. To be valid  a Form of Proxy must be completed  signed and delivered (together with the power of attorney or other written authority  if any  under which it is signed or an office or notarially certified copy or a copy certified in accordance with the Powers of Attorney Act 1971 of such power and written authority) to the Company's Registrar Link Group at 10th Floor  Central Square  29 Wellington Street  Leeds  LS1 4DL  not less than 48 hours (excluding weekends and public holidays in England and Wales) before the time appointed for holding the AGM or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the Form of Proxy proposes to vote. In the case of a poll taken more than 48 hours (excluding weekends and public holidays in England and Wales) after it is demanded  the document(s) must be delivered as aforesaid not less than 24 hours (excluding weekends and public holidays) before the time appointed for taking the poll  or where the poll is taken not more than 48 hours (excluding weekends and public holidays in England and Wales) after it was demanded  be delivered at the meeting at which the demand is made.4. In the case of a member which is a company  this form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or attorney duly authorised by that company.5. In the case of joint holders  the signature of any one joint holder is sufficient. If more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy  the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted to the exclusion of the appointments submitted by the other joint holders. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company's register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).6. The completion and return of this Form of Proxy will not preclude you from attending and voting at the AGM should you subsequently decide to do so. If a member appoints a proxy and that member attends the AGM in person and votes  the proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.7. To direct your proxy how to vote on the resolutions  mark the appropriate box with an 'X'. If you mark 'X' in more than one box in respect of the same resolution  this Form of Proxy will be invalid. To abstain from voting on a resolution  select the relevant ""withheld"" box. A vote withheld is not a vote in law  which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. If no voting indication is given  the proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. The proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the meeting.",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.51,0.2,0.28,True,English,"['Gresham House Renewable Energy VCT', 'Annual General Meeting', 'Notice', 'Gresham House Renewable Energy VCT 1 plc', 'unique personal identification Investor Code', 'Dear Shareholder Annual General Meeting', 'Gresham House Investor Relations', 'twelfth Annual General Meeting', 'other independent professional adviser', 'local securities laws', 'independent financial advice', 'London Stock Exchange', 'investment platform provider', 'Registrar Link Group', 'Share Portal service', 'The Investment Adviser', 'The Annual Report', 'other nominee service', 'other agent', 'share certificate', 'Financial Services', 'London EC3M', 'Financial Statements', 'The Scalpel', 'IMMEDIATE ATTENTION', 'Markets Act', 'United Kingdom', 'registered number', 'UK) Limited', '18th Floor', '52 Lime Street', 'online facility', '10th Floor', 'Central Square', '29 Wellington Street', 'confidential information', 'best interests', 'The Board', 'accompanying Form', 'Further details', 'hard copy', 'The AGM', 'The Company', 'bank manager', 'DOCUMENT', 'doubt', 'action', 'stockbroker', 'solicitor', 'accountant', 'jurisdiction', 'shares', 'Proxy', 'sale', 'transfer', 'disposal', 'transmission', 'purchaser', 'circumstances', 'violation', 'regulations', 'part', 'holding', 'England', 'Wales', 'Notice', 'Tuesday', 'March', '11.30 a', 'offices', 'JTC', 'Shareholders', 'resolutions', 'votes', 'behalf', 'Friday', 'IVC', 'accordance', 'instructions', 'Leeds', 'LS1', 'pages', 'year', 'website', 'greshamhouse', 'real-assets/new-energy', 'gresham-house-renewable-energy-vct', 'questions', 'advance', 'email', 'telephone', 'later', 'responses', 'disclosure', 'presentation', '12.30pm', 'slides', 'representatives', 'changes', 'arrangements', 'announcement', '020']",2023-02-08,2023-02-09,marketscreener.com

The dividend will be detached on 30 May 2023 and paid out on 1 June 2023.The Group is also planning to launch a share buyback programme for a total of around EUR 440 million  i.e.  equivalent to EUR 0.55 per share. The rollout of the programme is conditional on receiving the usual clearances from the ECB.Considering the strong financial performance in 2022 and an exceptional year  this distribution level ensures on one hand a fair remuneration of shareholders  and on the other hand  further strengthens the Group CET 1 ratio.Upscaled ESG actions and commitments by the GroupThe Group defined its new CSR ambition in 2022 and committed to accelerating the decarbonisation of its business portfolios. It also adopted a global approach to preserve biodiversity  enhance positive local impact and deploy an ESG culture to support clients in responsible social and energy transition.On this score  Societe Generale strengthened its ambitions to reduce finance for the most carbon-emissive sectors by setting new targets for upstream oil and gas. We are committed to reducing our exposure by -20% out to 2025 vs. 2019 and to scaling down scope 3 carbon emissions by -30% out to 2030 vs. 2019. Likewise  Societe Generale is targeting power generation emission intensity of 125g of Co2/KWh out to 2030. During 2022  the Group fixed a new sustainable finance contribution target of EUR 300 billion out to 2025. At end-2022  the bank had already exceeded the EUR 100 billion mark.The bank has also implemented several sectorial initiatives such as playing an active role in market coalitions destined to establish a common financing framework on aluminium  steel and aviation  and being at the forefront of rapid-growth economies  such as hydrogen. Societe Generale also increased the weight of biodiversity concerns when managing new commitments involving agriculture and logging operations by giving them greater prominence in its activities  and by taking active part in market initiatives to create common frameworks.Last  to integrate ESG considerations within the Group  Societe Generale launched a vast internal programme to make ESG culture second nature among its employees  notably by rolling out an extensive training programme and making ESG transformation operational as part of the ‚ÄúESG by Design‚Äù strategic project.(1) Underlying data (see methodology note No.5 for the transition from accounting data to underlying data)(2) Subject to usual approvals from the General Meeting and the ECBTHE GROUP‚ÄôS FINANCIAL STRUCTUREGroup shareholders‚Äô equity totalled EUR 66.5 billion at 31 December 2022 (vs. EUR 65.1 billion at 31 December 2021).

Net interest income and other revenues  including PEL/CEL  was down -1.8% vs. Q4 21  impacted primarily by the higher interest rate on regulated savings and the usury rate  which was partly offset by TLTRO benefits.

Net interest income and other revenues  including PEL/CEL  were up +2.9% vs. 2021. Fees were +5.6% higher than in 2021  benefiting from strong growth in service and financial fees.In respect of the outlook  2023 will be a transition year with decreased revenues due to the negative impacts of the end of the TLTRO benefit for around EUR 0.3bn vs. 2022  the specific functioning of the French market that will continue to curb loan production due to the usury rate  as was also the case in 2022  and the continued rise in the regulated savings rate that will have an impact on net banking income of around EUR 50m for each 25 basis point increase.

APPENDIX 2: METHODOLOGY1 ‚ÄìThe financial information presented for the fourth quarter and full year 2022 was examined by the Board of Directors on 7 February 2023 and has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted in the European Union and applicable at that date. This information has not been audited.2 - Net banking incomeThe pillars‚Äô net banking income is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document. The terms ‚ÄúRevenues‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Banking Income‚Äù are used interchangeably. They provide a normalised measure of each pillar‚Äôs net banking income taking into account the normative capital mobilised for its activity.3 - Operating expensesOperating expenses correspond to the ‚ÄúOperating Expenses‚Äù as presented in note 8.1 to the Group‚Äôs consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2021 (pages 482 et seq. of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document). The term ‚Äúcosts‚Äù is also used to refer to Operating Expenses. The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document.4 - IFRIC 21 adjustmentThe IFRIC 21 adjustment corrects the result of the charges recognised in the accounts in their entirety when they are due (generating event) so as to recognise only the portion relating to the current quarter  i.e. a quarter of the total. It consists in smoothing the charge recognised accordingly over the financial year in order to provide a more economic idea of the costs actually attributable to the activity over the period analysed.The contributions to Single Resolution Fund (¬´ SRF ¬ª) are part of IFRIC21 adjusted charges  they include contributions to national resolution funds within the EU.5 ‚Äì Exceptional items ‚Äì Transition from accounting data to underlying dataIt may be necessary for the Group to present underlying indicators in order to facilitate the understanding of its actual performance. The transition from published data to underlying data is obtained by restating published data for exceptional items and the IFRIC 21 adjustment.Moreover  the Group restates the revenues and earnings of the French Retail Banking pillar for PEL/CEL provision allocations or write-backs. This adjustment makes it easier to identify the revenues and earnings relating to the pillar‚Äôs activity  by excluding the volatile component related to commitments specific to regulated savings.The reconciliation enabling the transition from published accounting data to underlying data is set out in the table below:in EUR m Q4-22 Q4-21 2022 2021 Exceptional Net banking income (+) 0 (117) 0 (117) Revaluation gain 0 (117) 0 (117) Exceptional operating expenses (-) (108) (52) 639 379 IFRIC linearisation (285) (199) 0 0 Transformation costs(1) 177 147 639 379 Of which related to French Retail Banking 69 91 370 201 Of which related to Global Banking & Investor Solutions 54 30 117 92 Of which related to Corporate Centre 54 26 152 86 Exceptional Net profit or losses from other assets (+/-) 54 (439) 3 357 (624) Goodwill impairment (-)(1) 0 114 0 114 Total exceptional items (pre-tax) (54) (494) 3 996 (248) DTA recognition (+)(1) 0 (130) 0 (130) Total exceptional items (post-tax) (34) (561) 3 598 (377) Reported Net income - Group Share 1 160 1 787 2 018 5 641 Total exceptional items - Group share (post-tax) (34) (561) 3 598 (377) Underlying Net income - Group Share 1 126 1 226 5 616 5 264(1) Allocated to Corporate CentreNB: Amounts restated in Q1 22 to take into account the transfer of Private Banking activities (French and international) to the French Retail Banking.

This coverage ratio measures the maximum residual risk associated with outstandings in default (‚Äúdoubtful‚Äù).7 - ROE  ROTE  RONEThe notions of ROE (Return on Equity) and ROTE (Return on Tangible Equity)  as well as their calculation methodology  are specified on page 43 and 44 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document. This measure makes it possible to assess Societe Generale‚Äôs return on equity and return on tangible equity.RONE (Return on Normative Equity) determines the return on average normative equity allocated to the Group‚Äôs businesses  according to the principles presented on page 44 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document.Group net income used for the ratio numerator is book Group net income adjusted for ‚Äúinterest net of tax payable on deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  interest paid to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisations‚Äù and ‚Äúunrealised gains/losses booked under shareholders‚Äô equity  excluding conversion reserves‚Äù (see methodology note No. 9).

The various restatements enabling the transition from underlying data to published data are presented in the methodology notes (section 9.5). Net banking income Underlying net banking income(1) grew strongly in 2022 at +9.3% (+10.2%*) vs. 2021  fuelled by record performances in Financing & Advisory  Global Markets and ALD  strong growth in Private Banking and International Retail Banking and a solid performance by the French Retail Bank. French Retail Banking revenues grew +4.1% vs. 2021 fuelled notably by robust service fee growth and a very solid showing by Private Banking. International Retail Banking & Financial Services‚Äô revenues rose +12.4% (+17.9%*) vs. 2021  driven by a record performance at ALD and strong growth at International Retail Banking whose revenues grew +11.5%* vs. 2021. Financial Services‚Äô net banking income was significantly higher by +35.8%* vs. 2021  while Insurance net banking income increased by +6.5%* vs. 2021. Global Banking & Investor Solutions‚Äô revenues were up +14.3% (+12.9%*) vs. 2021. Global Markets & Investor Services‚Äô revenues posted a +18.7% increase in revenues (14.1%*) vs. 2021  while Financing & Advisory activities increased by +15.2% (+10.7%*) vs. 2021. In Q4 22  the Group continued to post robust revenue growth of +5.9% (+8.1%*) vs. Q4 21. Operating expenses In 2022  operating expenses totalled EUR 18 630 million on a reported basis and EUR 17 991 million on an underlying basis (restated for transformation costs)  i.e.  an increase of +4.5% vs. 2021 (on an underlying basis). The rise can be mainly attributed to the EUR 864 million contribution to the Single Resolution Fund  and increase of EUR 278 million  currency effects  notably in US dollars and a rise in the variable components of employee remuneration associated with higher revenues.Underlying(1) gross operating income increased by +18.9% to EUR 10 068 million in 2022  while the underlying(1) cost to income ratio (excluding the Single Resolution Fund) posted a 3.4 point improvement to 61.0% (vs. 64.4% in 2021). In Q4 22  operating expenses totalled EUR 4 610 million on a reported basis and EUR 4 718 million on an underlying basis (restated for the linearisation of IFRIC 21 and transformation costs)  i.e.  a limited increase of +2.2% vs. Q4 21. Excluding the Single Resolution Fund  the underlying(1) cost to income ratio is expected to range between 66% and 68% in 2023  based notably on normalised revenues in Global Markets. Cost of risk The cost of risk remained moderate at 28 basis points in Q4 22  or EUR 413 million. It breaks down into a provision on non-performing loans which remains limited at EUR 346 million (23 basis points)  and an additional provision on performing loans of EUR 67 million (5 basis points). Over the full year  the cost of risk amounted to 28 basis points  landing below the guidance of between 30 and 35 basis points. Offshore exposure to Russia was reduced to EUR 1.8 billion of EAD (Exposure At Default) at 31 December 2022  i.e.  a decrease of around -45% since 31 December 2021. Exposure at risk on this portfolio is estimated at less than EUR 0.6 billion  compared with less than EUR 1 billion for the previous quarter. Total associated provisions stood at EUR 427 million at end-December 2022. Moreover  at end-December 2022  the Group‚Äôs residual exposure to Rosbank amounted to less than EUR 0.1 billion  corresponding mainly to guarantees and letters of credit. The Group‚Äôs provisions on performing loans amounted to EUR 3 769 million at end-December  an increase of EUR 414 million in 2022. The non-performing loans ratio amounted to 2.8%(2) at 31 December 2022  down 10 basis points vs. 31 December 2021. The gross coverage ratio on doubtful loans for the Group stood at 48%(3) at 31 December 2022. The cost of risk in 2023 is expected to range between 30 and 35 basis points.

Underlying earnings per share amounts to EUR 6.10 over the same period (EUR 5.52 in 2021). Shareholder distribution The Board of Directors approved its distribution policy to an equivalent of EUR 2.25 per share(2). A cash dividend of EUR 1.70 per share will be proposed at the General Meeting of Shareholders on 23 May 2023. The dividend will be detached on 30 May 2023 and paid out on 1 June 2023. The Group is also planning to launch a share buyback programme for a total of around EUR 440 million  i.e.  equivalent to EUR 0.55 per share. The rollout of the programme is conditional on receiving the usual clearances from the ECB. Considering the strong financial performance in 2022 and an exceptional year  this distribution level ensures on one hand a fair remuneration of shareholders  and on the other hand  further strengthens the Group CET 1 ratio. Upscaled ESG actions and commitments by the Group The Group defined its new CSR ambition in 2022 and committed to accelerating the decarbonisation of its business portfolios. It also adopted a global approach to preserve biodiversity  enhance positive local impact and deploy an ESG culture to support clients in responsible social and energy transition. On this score  Societe Generale strengthened its ambitions to reduce finance for the most carbon-emissive sectors by setting new targets for upstream oil and gas. We are committed to reducing our exposure by -20% out to 2025 vs. 2019 and to scaling down scope 3 carbon emissions by -30% out to 2030 vs. 2019. Likewise  Societe Generale is targeting power generation emission intensity of 125g of Co2/KWh out to 2030. During 2022  the Group fixed a new sustainable finance contribution target of EUR 300 billion out to 2025. At end-2022  the bank had already exceeded the EUR 100 billion mark. The bank has also implemented several sectorial initiatives such as playing an active role in market coalitions destined to establish a common financing framework on aluminium  steel and aviation  and being at the forefront of rapid-growth economies  such as hydrogen. Societe Generale also increased the weight of biodiversity concerns when managing new commitments involving agriculture and logging operations by giving them greater prominence in its activities  and by taking active part in market initiatives to create common frameworks. Last  to integrate ESG considerations within the Group  Societe Generale launched a vast internal programme to make ESG culture second nature among its employees  notably by rolling out an extensive training programme and making ESG transformation operational as part of the ‚ÄúESG by Design‚Äù strategic project.

APPENDIX 2: METHODOLOGY1 ‚ÄìThe financial information presented for the fourth quarter and full year 2022 was examined by the Board of Directors on 7 February 2023 and has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted in the European Union and applicable at that date. This information has not been audited. 2 - Net banking income The pillars‚Äô net banking income is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document. The terms ‚ÄúRevenues‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Banking Income‚Äù are used interchangeably. They provide a normalised measure of each pillar‚Äôs net banking income taking into account the normative capital mobilised for its activity. 3 - Operating expenses Operating expenses correspond to the ‚ÄúOperating Expenses‚Äù as presented in note 8.1 to the Group‚Äôs consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2021 (pages 482 et seq. of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document). The term ‚Äúcosts‚Äù is also used to refer to Operating Expenses. The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document. 4 - IFRIC 21 adjustment The IFRIC 21 adjustment corrects the result of the charges recognised in the accounts in their entirety when they are due (generating event) so as to recognise only the portion relating to the current quarter  i.e. a quarter of the total. It consists in smoothing the charge recognised accordingly over the financial year in order to provide a more economic idea of the costs actually attributable to the activity over the period analysed. The contributions to Single Resolution Fund (¬´ SRF ¬ª) are part of IFRIC21 adjusted charges  they include contributions to national resolution funds within the EU. 5 ‚Äì Exceptional items ‚Äì Transition from accounting data to underlying data It may be necessary for the Group to present underlying indicators in order to facilitate the understanding of its actual performance. The transition from published data to underlying data is obtained by restating published data for exceptional items and the IFRIC 21 adjustment. Moreover  the Group restates the revenues and earnings of the French Retail Banking pillar for PEL/CEL provision allocations or write-backs. This adjustment makes it easier to identify the revenues and earnings relating to the pillar‚Äôs activity  by excluding the volatile component related to commitments specific to regulated savings. The reconciliation enabling the transition from published accounting data to underlying data is set out in the table below: in EUR m Q4-22 Q4-21 2022 2021 Exceptional Net banking income (+) 0 (117) 0 (117) Revaluation gain 0 (117) 0 (117) Exceptional operating expenses (-) (108) (52) 639 379 IFRIC linearisation (285) (199) 0 0 Transformation costs(1) 177 147 639 379 Of which related to French Retail Banking 69 91 370 201 Of which related to Global Banking & Investor Solutions 54 30 117 92 Of which related to Corporate Centre 54 26 152 86 Exceptional Net profit or losses from other assets (+/-) 54 (439) 3 357 (624) Goodwill impairment (-)(1) 0 114 0 114 Total exceptional items (pre-tax) (54) (494) 3 996 (248) DTA recognition (+)(1) 0 (130) 0 (130) Total exceptional items (post-tax) (34) (561) 3 598 (377) Reported Net income - Group Share 1 160 1 787 2 018 5 641 Total exceptional items - Group share (post-tax) (34) (561) 3 598 (377) Underlying Net income - Group Share 1 126 1 226 5 616 5 264 (1) Allocated to Corporate CentreNB: Amounts restated in Q1 22 to take into account the transfer of Private Banking activities (French and international) to the French Retail Banking.

This indicator makes it possible to assess the level of risk of each of the pillars as a percentage of balance sheet loan commitments  including operating leases.

This coverage ratio measures the maximum residual risk associated with outstandings in default (‚Äúdoubtful‚Äù). 7 - ROE  ROTE  RONE The notions of ROE (Return on Equity) and ROTE (Return on Tangible Equity)  as well as their calculation methodology  are specified on page 43 and 44 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document. This measure makes it possible to assess Societe Generale‚Äôs return on equity and return on tangible equity.RONE (Return on Normative Equity) determines the return on average normative equity allocated to the Group‚Äôs businesses  according to the principles presented on page 44 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document.Group net income used for the ratio numerator is book Group net income adjusted for ‚Äúinterest net of tax payable on deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  interest paid to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisations‚Äù and ‚Äúunrealised gains/losses booked under shareholders‚Äô equity  excluding conversion reserves‚Äù (see methodology note No. 9).

In Asia  stock benchmarks were mixed; Treasury yields fell; the dollar weakened; oil was mixed; while gold gained.Equities:European stocks are poised for gains on Wednesday  tracking the overnight rise on Wall Street in the wake of Fed Chair Powell's comments that inflation will decline significantly in 2023 but more interest-rate hikes will be necessary.The comments ""do nothing to undermine the recent strength in the market  "" said TradeStation. ""They also seem to keep us on track for another 25 basis points in March  with possibly no more increases after that. It's a potential Goldilocks environment for the bulls and a very tough spot for the bears.""However  TradeStation said Powell's remarks mean he refrained from walking back his disinflation comment. ""If anything  he reiterated it in a guarded way "" which gives investors breathing room for the next few weeks as they wait for more economic data.Other market analysts were concerned the noisy economic data has created an even greater divergence between market pricing on interest rates  and the Fed's expectations of how the economic and financial conditions are likely to evolve.""The market has been almost contorting itself into a pretzel and trying to over-analyze his [Powell's] words "" said Newton Investment Management. ""The clear message is if we're going to make a mistake  we're going to move too slowly to reduce rates. We're not going to move too prematurely to raise rates.""Bets in fed-funds futures markets show that traders are still firmly convinced that another quarter-point interest-rate rise is the Fed's likely next move when U.S. central bankers convene in March  according to CME Group's tracker.BRI Wealth Management expects higher borrowing costs and inflation to eat further into companies' profitability. Companies in the S&P 500 are expected to report that profit margins shrank by 8.7% in the fourth quarter compared with the prior year  according to estimates from Credit Suisse.Forex:The dollar softened in Asia  although there seems to be a mild risk-on mood.Sentiment appears to be risk-on as Fed Chair Powell's allusion to ""further hikes"" was overlooked in favor of ""dis-inflationary process "" said Mizuho Bank.Silicon Valley Bank said there is a lot of crosswinds in forex and elsewhere  as markets react to Powell's comments. There are signs of disinflation happening  but the fight is far from over and the strength of the economy can withstand more rate hikes  it said.While there is still need to be vigilant about inflation  there could be another flare-up  and ""the wild card this year is the reopening of China  "" a commodity-hungry economy that represents a ""big supply-side influx "" it said further.Bonds:Treasury yields dropped after Fed Chair Powell's remarks weren't as hawkish as investors had feared.""The key takeaway from Jay Powell's Washington Economics Club appearance is that Friday's strong employment report underscores the Fed's Wednesday message. That message  Powell says  is there is still a lot more work to do "" said FHN Financial.""Powell's communication is consistent with another quarter-point hike in March and plans for more after that "" it said. ""Of course  those plans will change if the economy unfolds differently than the Fed currently expects.""Sevens Report Research pointed out that the market no longer seems to be responding to what Fed's Powell is saying. Instead  it is responding to the underlying economic data  which are suggesting that the Fed may need to be even more aggressive if it hopes to drive inflation back to its 2% target.While inflation has been waning for six months  wages are still rising and some on Wall Street are worried that this disinflation  which Powell cited during Wednesday's press conference  might turn out to be transitory.Fed funds futures  which traders use to place bets on the direction of monetary policy  have also reflected expectations for more rate hikes this year  according to the CME's FedWatch tool.Energy:Oil prices were mixed  but were likely to be supported by Saudi Aramco's unexpected price increase.The producer raised most prices for its flagship Arab Light grade  defying expectations of a cut  ANZ Research said. Aramco also signaled it expects demand to strengthen  especially in China  which is reopening after years of Covid-19-related restrictions  it added.""The price of the barrel is finding support as the reopening of the Chinese economy  following the end of the zero-Covid policy  is expected to drive a significant increase in demand for crude this year "" said ActivTrades.""At the same time  the earthquake in Turkey forced the shutting down of a major export terminal  responsible for 1 million barrels per day  exacerbating supply side pressures and contributing to increases in oil prices."".ActivTraders noted that gains for crude prices have come alongside a bounce for the U.S. dollar. Typically a stronger dollar is a negative for commodities priced in the unit  making them more expensive to users of other currencies.Metals:Gold prices rose after Fed's Powell refrained from pushing back against expectations the Fed would ease monetary policy this year  said Oanda.However  risks of two or three more rate increases remain on the horizon  which should keep gold prices somewhat grounded  it added.Near term  gold and silver are ""likely to remain traders' markets  punctuated by spikes and troughs as consumers acclimatize to these higher levels and U.S. data either confirm or refute hopes for a turnaround in Fed policy "" said BullionVault.---Lead prices climbed on supply concerns.The Shanghai Metals Market has reported that a primary lead smelter in China's Hunan province has been closed for maintenance this week  with operations scheduled to resume next week  said ING.The output of primary lead from this smelter in February is estimated to fall by 2 000 tons  ING added  citing the SMM report.---Chinese iron-ore futures were lower  as the investor-sentiment-led rally fueled by China's reopening is fading.""With the recent ebb of market optimism  price of iron ore faces the risk of pullback in the short term "" said CSC Financial. It remains neutral in the long-run  as fundamentals are strong while regulatory risks remain.TODAY'S TOP HEADLINESJoe Biden Touts Economic Gains in State of the UnionWASHINGTON-President Biden used his State of the Union address to try to sell Americans on his economic agenda and called for renewed bipartisanship  but his appeals for unity were punctuated by Republican lawmakers' loud objections to his remarks.The annual speech  which was delivered in the House chamber before a joint session of the newly divided Congress on Tuesday  gave Mr. Biden  80  a chance to test his message in front of a large audience weeks or months before he is expected to announce his reelection bid. Recent polls show a majority of Democratic voters don't want him to run for a second term  and his approval ratings remain low.Fed's Jerome Powell Braces for Longer Inflation Fight Amid Hiring SurgeFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the labor market's surprising strength underscores why bringing inflation down will take longer and require higher interest rates than many investors have been anticipating.A government report Friday that showed hiring accelerated in January was ""certainly strong-stronger than anyone I know expected "" Mr. Powell said Tuesday during a moderated discussion before the Economic Club of Washington  D.C. ""It kind of shows you why we think this will be a process that takes a significant period of time.""European Officials Push for Joint Effort With U.S. on Green-Technology MineralsWASHINGTON-Representatives of Europe's two top economies proposed new efforts with the U.S. to strengthen supply chains for critical minerals used in electric vehicles and other green-technology products  even as they continued to press the U.S. about its clean energy legislation.Robert Habeck  German vice chancellor and minister for economic affairs and climate action  proposed Tuesday creating a ""critical minerals club"" with the U.S. during a trip to Washington where he met with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen; Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo; and Brian Deese  director of the White House National Economic Council  among others. Bruno Le Maire  French minister for finance  economy and industry  also attended the meetings.VW Says 2022 Sales and Profit in Line With ForecastsBERLIN-Volkswagen AG said Tuesday that 2022 sales and operating earnings were largely in line with forecasts  but that cash flow  a key measure for investors  fell short of expectations as supply-chain woes led to higher unsold inventory at the end of the year.VW and other auto makers have struggled over the past year with continued disruptions to supply chains in the wake of the war in Ukraine and amid a resurgence in Covid-19 infections in China that hit supply chains  making it difficult to maintain production at constant levels.Turkey  Syria Confront Earthquakes' Devastation-'I Buried My Kids Today'BELEN  Turkey-As the sun went down Tuesday over Girne Street  dozens of people  their hands and arms limned with ghostly gray dust  silently combed the wreckage of flattened apartment blocks.Ismail Parlak and his wife dug through the rubble looking for Mr. Parlak's mother  entombed  they said  somewhere under six stories of collapsed concrete and contorted metal.(MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires02-08-23 0015ET",neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,mixed,0.07,0.11,0.82,True,English,"['EMEA Morning Briefing', 'Powell Remarks', 'Shares', 'Gains', 'U.S. Federal Reserve Chair', 'U.S. central bankers', 'Washington Economics Club appearance', 'flagship Arab Light grade', 'France flash estimate', 'Italy retail sales', 'British American Tobacco', 'potential Goldilocks environment', 'Newton Investment Management', 'BRI Wealth Management', 'higher borrowing costs', 'big supply-side influx', 'strong employment report', 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'Sevens Report Research', 'funds futures markets', 'noisy economic data', 'underlying economic data', 'Fed funds futures', 'Other market analysts', 'quarter-point interest-rate rise', 'unexpected price increase', 'Fed Chair Powell', 'S&P 500', 'overnight rise', 'interest-rate hikes', 'Mizuho Bank', 'quarter-point hike', 'ANZ Research', 'significant increase', 'job creation', 'trading updates', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Societe Generale', 'Barratt Developments', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'ABN AMRO', 'Aker Solutions', 'Ashmore Group', 'Severn Trent', 'Land Securities', 'Opening Call', 'stock benchmarks', 'Treasury yields', 'European stocks', 'Wall Street', '25 basis points', 'tough spot', 'breathing room', 'greater divergence', 'financial conditions', 'profit margins', 'fourth quarter', 'prior year', 'Credit Suisse', 'mild risk', 'further hikes', 'inflationary process', 'wild card', 'key takeaway', 'FHN Financial', 'six months', 'press conference', 'monetary policy', 'FedWatch tool', 'most prices', 'Covid-19-related restrictions', 'zero-Covid policy', 'Jerome Powell', 'Jay Powell', 'MARKET WRAPS', 'market pricing', 'clear message', 'Siemens Energy', 'recent strength', 'next move', 'CME Group', ""companies' profitability"", 'commodity-hungry economy', 'Oil prices', 'Saudi Aramco', 'Chinese economy', 'disinflation comment', 'interest rates', 'Wednesday message', 'TotalEnergies', 'Sberbank', 'AkzoNobel', 'Adyen', 'Pandora', 'Equinor', 'DCC', 'Shares', 'remarks', 'Asia', 'dollar', 'Equities', 'gains', 'wake', 'comments', 'TradeStation', 'track', 'March', 'increases', 'bulls', 'bears', 'investors', 'weeks', 'expectations', 'pretzel', 'words', 'mistake', 'Bets', 'traders', 'estimates', 'Forex', 'mood', 'Sentiment', 'allusion', 'favor', 'lot', 'crosswinds', 'signs', 'fight', 'flare-up', 'reopening', 'China', 'Bonds', 'Friday', 'work', 'communication', 'plans', '2% target', 'wages', 'direction', 'producer', 'cut', 'demand', 'years', 'barrel', 'support', 'end', 'crude']",2023-02-08,2023-02-09,marketscreener.com

These animal data  together with the data from the Phase 1 CHIHUAHUA study  are intended to support the US IND filing of DSR 2.0. FDA approval of the US IND will enable the Company to start MOJAVE  its randomized  controlled  multi-center Phase 1/2a US study of DSR 2.0  planned for Q2 2023.The GLP studies were conducted on 30 healthy mice and 18 healthy sheep. Each animal study comprised of three study groups which included one control group using standard peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution and two test groups using Sequana Medical‚Äôs proprietary DSR 2.0 product. The test groups consisted of one group being given the anticipated maximum standard dose and one group being given double of the maximum dose. The mice were exposed for 30 days  resembling their average life time  and the sheep were exposed for up to 45 days.The purpose of these GLP studies was to evaluate the chronic exposure of DSR 2.0 on animal health and tissue of peritoneum  kidneys  omentum  and peritoneal cavity. Data from both studies reported that no difference in systemic and local toxic effects were observed in animals treated repeatedly with DSR 2.0  compared to animals in the control group  concluding that DSR 2.0 had consistent safety with the standard PD solution.Oliver G√∂dje  Chief Medical Officer at Sequana Medical  commented: ‚ÄúWe are pleased to see these positive animal data of our second-generation DSR product  which is designed to deliver therapeutic and safety benefits over the first-generation DSR product. We have previously reported impressive clinical results from the SAHARA study with DSR 1.0 as a potential disease-modifying heart failure therapy  and we look forward to commencing MOJAVE  the first randomized controlled multi-center study in the US using DSR 2.0.‚ÄùStory continuesOn track to start M OJAVE with DSR 2.0 in Q2 2023The Company is progressing the development of its proprietary DSR 2.0 product  a sodium-free dextrose / icodextrin solution expected to have an improved therapeutic and favourable safety profile  and robust intellectual property protection. Two ongoing Phase 1 interventional  single-centre  single-arm studies  one in Canada (YUKON) and one in Mexico (CHIHUAHUA)  are evaluating the safety  tolerability and efficacy of DSR 2.0 and are expected to each enroll up to ten stable peritoneal dialysis patients to receive a single treatment of DSR 2.0  administered through their peritoneal dialysis catheter. The choice of peritoneal dialysis patients is driven by their pre-existing peritoneal dialysis catheter. Data from the GLP animal and Phase 1 CHIHUAHUA studies are intended to support the filing of the US IND  planned for Q1 2023.Following several initial discussions with the FDA  MOJAVE  a randomized controlled Phase 1/2a US study of DSR 2.0  is on track to start in Q2 2023  assuming FDA approval of the US IND application. The intention is to enrol 30 diuretic-resistant chronic heart failure patients with persistent congestion  with 20 patients randomized to DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter on top of usual care for congestive heart failure (CHF) for up to four weeks and ten patients randomized to intravenous loop diuretic treatment as part of maximized usual care for CHF alone. Following four weeks of treatment  there will be a three-month safety follow-up period. Prior to enrolment of these 30 patients  the intention is for three additional patients to be enrolled in a non-randomized safety cohort and to receive DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter on top of CHF usual care for up to four weeks. Progression to the enrolment of the 30 randomized patients will be dependent upon DSMBiv approval following their review of the initial three patients. More details on the final study design will be announced following the FDA approval of the US IND application. Interim data of MOJAVE are expected in H2 2023 followed by top-line results in H2 2024.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)498 053579Optimum Strategic CommunicationsNick Bastin  Jonathan Edwards  Vici RabbettsE: Sequana@optimumcomms.comT: +44 (0) 208 078 4357About fluid overload in heart failure (AKA congestion)Heart failure is the leading cause of US hospitalizations in patients over 65 years old and 90% of these admissions are due to fluid overload  which is recognized as the primary driver of morbidity and hospitalization. Standard of care includes treatment with diuretic drugs  but these have well-recognized toxicity and resistance issues. Half of the heart failure patients admitted for fluid overload are discharged with no clinically relevant loss of fluid and one in four is re-admitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. It is estimated that 200 000 of US heart failure patients have drug-resistant congestion requiring repeated hospitalization  severely impacting their survival and quality of life and creating a heavy financial burden.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficult breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ‚Äúdiuretic-resistant‚Äù patient population.alfapump¬Æ and DSR¬Æ are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company has reported positive primary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  enabling the filing of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA  planned for H2 2023. Having delivered clinical proof-of-concept for DSR as a disease-modifying drug program for the treatment of heart failure  the Company is planning to commence MOJAVE  a US multi-centered randomized controlled Phase 1/2a clinical study of DSR 2.0  in Q2 2023.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

The round was led by...,"functional protein platform developer on mission to clean labels  improve plant-based foodsHAIFA  Israel   Feb. 8  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Start-up Meala FoodTech  Ltd.  the developer of a functional protein platform  announces the close of USD1.9M in pre-seed investment. The round was led by The Kitchen FoodTech Hub  part of The Strauss-Group and DSM Venturing (the corporate venture arm of the Dutch multinational Royal DSM); with participation of Milk & Honey Ventures  specializing in alt-protein investments DSM Venturing's contribution marks its third investment in the Israeli FoodTech ecosystem in 2022.Meala FoodTech founders  from right to left: Liran Gruda  Hadar Ekhoiz Razmovich  Dr. Tali Feldman SivanWhile the plant-based category continues to gain momentum  alt-protein food formulators still struggle to improve the labels and mouthfeel of their products to match traditional  animal-based counterparts. Currently  popular meat alternatives such as veggie burgers and sausages  typically contain a long list of ingredients  some with complex chemical names unfamiliar to consumers.Meala FoodTech is on a mission to revolutionize the plant-based protein industry by developing new ingredients and processes that allow the creation of cleaner  better-for-you  products.Meala's multi-functional proteins vastly improve the texture of meat alternatives to more compellingly mimic the organoleptic qualities of real meat and deliver a more full-bodied flavor. Meala's proprietary platform creates functional proteins designed to be used as binding and gelling agents thanks to their superior water retention capabilities. The platform enables formulators to boost meat analogues with better nutritional value and functional properties using a short list of ingredients as in real meat.""We are excited to complete this investment round with the support of leading investors "" notes Hadar Razmovich  CEO and Meala co-founder. ""This achievement reflects the investors' trust in our technology and R&D team of experts. ""There is a significant need in the plant-based industry to effectively reduce undesirable ingredients and clean up labels. This investment will help us get closer and faster to the market  better address the companies' specific needs and provide affordable  smarter solutions.""Story continues""It is exciting to support Meala on this important mission to improve plant-based foods  making them tastier  more nutritious  and with readily recognizable ingredients "" expresses Jonathan Berger  CEO of The Kitchen FoodTech Hub. ""This is another milestone in our quest to nourish a better tomorrow  and we are honored to have a leading entity such as DSM Venturing co-invest with us in such a promising company.""The new funding will initially go toward continuing the development of the company's platform technology and accelerate from lab to pilot scale. The start-up's core technology enables the development of functional proteins for multiple meat replacements  including burgers  sausages  nuggets with egg and fish alternatives in development.""This investment will enable us to accelerate our growth and support plant-based producers in their mission to reach new consumer segments "" states Dr. Tali Feldman Sivan  PhD  co-founder of Meala. ""We already initiated collaborations with leading plant-based CPG manufacturers to implement Meala's solution in their products. We are on track to launch products in the US and European markets in 2024.""Meala's vision for plant-based alternatives is to have a short list of simple  recognizable ""home kitchen"" ingredients while delivering the same full-bodied flavor and texture of real meat. The platform works with a versatile range of plant proteins. The Meala solution can be easily integrated into CPG products through existing manufacturing lines.About MealaMeala was founded in 2021 by product innovation specialist Hadar Ekhoiz Razmovich; Tali Feldman Sivan  PhD  a serial entrepreneur and business strategist; and Liran Gruda  CIO and culinary chef. After delving into the meat alternative category in depth  the trio joined forces on a mission to bridge the gap between processed vegan products currently available  and the perception that plant-based products are better for you  and to break down the last barriers between meat and meat analogs.About DSM VenturingDSM Venturing is the corporate venture arm of Royal DSM ‚Äìa global  purpose-led company in Health  Nutrition & Bioscience  applying science to improve the health of people  animals  and the planet.

17997,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4576365-cme-group-owning-the-house-is-not-cheap,CME Group Stock: Owning The House Is Not Cheap (NASDAQ:CME),CME Group primarily operates future and options markets across several products. It has grown consistently due to greater volume in financial markets. Read more here.,"R.M. NunesCompany overview:CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) operates markets for the trading of futures and options on contracts worldwide.CME's product offerings include:Futures and options - They offer futures and options products linked to interest rates  equity futures  foreign exchange  agric. commodities  energy  and metals  as well as fixed income products.Clearing services - This involves clearing  settling  and guaranteeing futures and options contracts  and cleared swaps products traded through its exchanges.Market data - This includes real-time and historical data services.CME's revenue split is heavily weighted towards future and options  as this is their primary operations. Interest rates are the largest derivative traded  given their importance in global markets as a hedging / liquidity tool. This is generally a sticky service for this reason  with a great amount of the trading stemming from SOFR (And other LIBOR successors) and U.S. treasuries.CME revenue breakdown (Q3 investor pack)Investors who have owned CME Group Inc. for any extend period of time have been handsomely rewarded  with continued and sustained gains into 2022. With the business essentially being the ""market"" (or at least a part of it)  this is a reflection of greater market and corporate activity over time.Data by YChartsAn interest factor to consider with CME is that they make their money from trades  which means the business has the potential to be a great hedge as markets decline. The reason for this is that volatility generally increases  which means more trading. This is what initially sparked our interest and will be an important part of this analysis. We will look to consider the quality of the business' current and forecast financial performance  alongside our view of current market conditions and any other factors impacting the exchange industry. Finally  we will look at CME's relative performance against its peers  to assess if it is an attractive investment today.Financials:CME - Financial performance (Tikr Terminal)CME's financial performance has been very strong across the last ten-years  with total revenue growing at a CAGR of 5%. The primary driving factor for this is greater average daily volume over the period. Interest rate and equity indexes are the primary growth area.Avg. daily volume by product type (Annual accounts)Our only concern is that their rate per contract (RPC) has been gradually falling in recent quarters. Management attributes this to a change in product mix and it could act as a drag on revenue should it continue. It has yet to be seen if this will continue or not.Market data revenue is up 6% on the prior year's quarter  as CME has been able to increase pricing. Although this revenue stream is far less significant  it is positive to see inflationary pressures are not impacting margins here.CME's income from ""other"" sources has increased substantially  especially investment income. They are now 29% of revenue. This is driven in large part by strategic investments in businesses  earning dividends and (un)realized gains. Although this is great  it is non-trading and in many cases  one-off in nature  thus has the ability to distort net income.Long term investments disclosure (1/2) (2021 FS) Long term investments disclosure (2/2) (2021 FS)Margins are very impressive and translate straight into free cash flow (""FCF""). In the LTM period  FCF yield stands at an eye-watering 42%. Management's policy is to pay a normal dividend  alongside a special dividend to the extent that all unrequired cash is distributed. Thus  investors are rewarded by both dividends and capital appreciation.Dividend declared (Q3 Investor pack)ROE is an attractive 10%  with much of their equity value now represented by intangibles. This is not a concern as the business does not require a significant asset base as part of its operations.The business is moderately leveraged with any debt issued repaid when possible. This gives the business scope for M&A / greenfield expansion should the opportunity arise. We like that the business has not been tempted into funding large dividend payments with debt  which many mature businesses like to do. With debt at 0.5x EBITDA  there is no real reason to reduce this further and with little in the way of capex commitments  dividends are an appropriate use of capital.Looking forward  2022 is likely to come at around $5BN in revenue  which representing 7% growth Y/Y. Markets have been fairly volatile during 2022  contributing to greater ADV. Beyond this  we believe the business can continue to grow at 3-5% indefinitely  with margins remaining consistent. The business is a market leader in the options/futures space and the barriers to entry are very high. CME can likely maintain this growth with just their current suite of products due to their importance to investors. Analyst forecasts support these assumptions.Analyst estimates (Tikr Terminal)Product innovation:As we mentioned previously  CME could easily continue its current offerings only and be highly successful. However  no sane Management would and so the business is looking to expand and develop its product offering. This includes:Development to e-mini weekly optionsGreater e-mini sector coverageEther options and Euro-denominated Bitcoin and Ether futuresEuro short-term rateTBA MBSsEvent contracts.These cover all forms of development  from incremental improvements such as the e-mini contacts to new products such as Event contracts. This allows CME to maintain its market leading status product wise  while also looking to find solutions for current problems.Mortgage and interest rates have increased significantly in 2022 and Cryptocurrencies have reached new peaks in popularity. CME expanding their offerings in these areas is a great way to align their products with areas of importance in today's market.Event contracts are more streamlined ways of accessing key futures markets globally. CME has seen strong engagement with these contracts and are attracting investors who otherwise would not use futures. This is an opportunity to increase their total addressable market and target new audiences.Macro considerations:Inflationary pressure had caused economic conditions to reverse in late 2021 / early 2022. Interest rates began to be lifted following a decade of record low levels. This was initiated in order to cool demand and ease inflation. A large portion of this inflation is derived from energy prices  which is a market materially disrupted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. For this reason  interest rates have been slow to dampening inflation. With inflation >5% in most western nations  it is likely that rates will continue to rise  with a normalization to sustainable levels in early 2024. The 10-year / 3-month yield curve inverted in Nov22 and remains so. At these levels  a recession is looks likely.10Y/3M YC (FRED)With the cost of capital increasing  valuations have contracted. Further  businesses are posting weaker LTM numbers  many of which suffering margin contractions due to supply chain issues. This has caused a re-rating in global markets  with the S&P 500 down c.20% in 2022 for example.This is neither significantly good nor bad for CME  the house wins regardless. If we look back at Q1 or Q2 2020  the peak of market hysteria during the initial days of COVID-19 in the west  CME posted better quarterly results than the year prior. If we look back at the '08 Financial Crisis  we observe a similar thing  revenues and NI up Y/Y (45% in 08'  2% in '09 and 15% in '10). With interest rates as high as they are  we are likely seeing above average levels of hedging. This is likely one of the key drivers of growth in the LTM period. For this reason  we are comfortable that CME will perform well in 2023  despite weakening market conditions. The only downside risk is if volume falls due to a stagnation in markets  but this should be mitigated by the interest rate segment of their services.Peer group analysis:Peer group analysis (Tikr Terminal)CME's peers are other exchanges  such as HKE  ICE and LSEG  as well as other financial services businesses.As a general observation  we see high levels of profits and general market leading economics. There are multiple reasons for this including:The marginal benefit from extra investor / volume is very high as the associated cost is low. These businesses have built liquid markets through volume  which drives credibility and further users.These businesses operate in the same overarching industry but generally specialize in their own area (e.g.  OTCPK:LDNXF in the UK equity market). This allows for the development of barriers to entry and aggressive pricing.From a profitability perspective  CME performs extremely well  exceeding the average of the peer group. Only HKE (OTCPK:HKXCF) and Euronext (OTCPK:EUXTF) exceeds CME on a FCF basis but lack the geographical diversification.Historic growth is difficult to compare  as many of CME's competitors have been acquisitive at much larger levels  such as LSEG with Refinitiv ($27BN). Forward-looking data suggests CME is slightly below market average.Based on this data  CME is a leading market participate. We would hesitate to suggest that they are the premier business in this group  as slightly lower margins combined with greater growth can be superior. With the strategy Management have maintained to date  sustainable moderate growth will continue.Valuation:Peer group valuation (Tikr Terminal)With attractive economics these businesses bring  it is unsurprising that they are trading at high multiples. The average is 19x / 37x  with CME slightly above average at an EBITDA level and low on a PE level.CME's dividends are only marginally higher than the average of their peers  with the optionality of a special dividend. This is a fairly attractive proposition for long-term holders looking for exposure in this market.In order to determine our fair value for CME  we considered the relative position of CME v. each of the peer group  applying a discount or premium individual. In culmination  this gives us a 20x multiple. At this level  we see an upside of around 5%. Generally  we apply a 5% margin of error and so the upside is not sufficient enough to suggest this stock is a buy at its current level.CME Group Inc. stock has seen very little in the way of re-rating during the last 10-years  meaning it could be very difficult to pick this one up at a discount. For this reason  investors seeking to hold long term can certainly achieve alpha at this price  but today  it is difficult to suggest there is a buy opportunity here.Conclusion:From a commercial perspective  CME is a fantastic business. It has cornered an incredibly large market  which is vital to global operations and will consistently grow into the long-term. Despite this  the business is showing innovation and sequential improvements. From a financial perspective  CME is incredibly disciplined. They have grown well  even during downturns  and have complete control over expenses to ensure profitability. Payouts only reflect what the business is able to distribute  with debt being a non-issue. This is clearly a fantastic choice as a low-risk component of a diversified portfolio.The problem is that a company with all these characteristics is rarely cheap  and CME Group Inc. investors today are required to pay a fair price. We rate this stock a hold for that reason but believe in its long-term growth.With market conditions weakening further  general sentiment could bring CME Group Inc. stock down into undervalued territory  regardless of performance  which is what we are banking on.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

All our efforts are focused on advancing our clinical studies and actively seeking partners for other indications. The positive and very promising results in our main development programs for cGvHD and tibial fracture repair are the main driver for our clinical teams to be able to offer as soon as possible new and effective therapeutic solutions for today's largely unmet medical needs "" said Prof. Fran√ßois Rieger  President and CEO of BioSenic.In October 2022  BioSenic issued 90 668 594 new shares.

A FAQ containing further information on the subscription rights is available on the company website (https://biosenic.com/investors).BioSenic Group anticipates having sufficient cash to carry out its business objectives until end Q1 2023. This is based on the 2022 revised cash forecast considering an operating cash burn of ‚Ç¨8 million to ‚Ç¨9 million and a financing cash burn of around ‚Ç¨1.3 million  as well as on the realization of the following relevant assumptions:‚Ä¢ The payment of a final settlement and termination amount of about EUR 1 million by Shenzhen Pregene BioPharma Co.  Ltd (""Pregene"") following the termination by Pregene of the license agreement.‚Ä¢ A negotiation of a revised RCA repayment schedule for turnover-independent reimbursements to be made under the recoverable cash advances (RCA) previously received by BioSenic.‚Ä¢ The issuance to Global Tech Opportunities 15 (""GTO 15"") of all 100 convertible bonds subscribed by it in ten separate tranches with a total nominal value of ‚Ç¨5 million  of which the first six tranches have been issued and subscribed for by GTO 15.BioSenic Group will continue to require additional financing to continue its operations in the longer term as it does currently not have sufficient working capital to meet its present requirements and cover the working capital needs for a period of at least 12 months as of the date of the Prospectus. For more information about the working capital and funding objectives of the BioSenic Group  please consult the Prospectus.The Prospectus contains pro forma financial information to illustrate the effects of the acquisition of Medsenic. The Prospectus also contains the audited financial statements in IFRS of Medsenic for the years ended 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020 and the related notes.About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company focused on (i) the development of innovative products to address high unmet needs in orthopedics and (ii) exploiting the possibilities offered by the therapeutic use of arsenic salts (mainly arsenic trioxide (ATO)) for patients with autoimmune diseases. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic‚Äôs technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAPr.

Today  Lectra‚Äôs Board of Directors  chaired by Daniel Harari  reviewed the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2022. Audit procedures have been performed by the Statutory Auditors. The certification report will be issued at the end of the Board of Director‚Äôs meeting of February 23  2023.To facilitate the analysis of the Group‚Äôs results  the financial statements are compared to those published in 2021 and to the 2021 pro forma financial statement (‚Äú2021 Pro forma‚Äù)  prepared by integrating the three acquisitions made in 2021 ‚Äì Gerber Technology (‚ÄúGerber‚Äù)  Neteven  and Gemini CAD Systems (‚ÄúGemini‚Äù) ‚Äì as if they had been consolidated from January 1  2021  whereas they have been consolidated since June 1  July 28 and September 27  2021 respectively.Story continues1. GREAT RESILIENCY IN A DEGRADED ENVIRONMENT2022 was significantly marked by the war in Ukraine and its consequences. As soon as the conflict began  the Company decided to cease its operations in Russia  by suspending the activity of its subsidiary Lectra Russia and stopping all deliveries of products or services. The Group's direct exposure to Ukraine and Russia is low; the contribution of these two countries in 2021 accounted for less than 1 percent of revenues.This war has accelerated price increases  energy shortfalls and shortages in some raw materials. However  their impact on the Group's financial statements was limited due to its low exposure to energy costs and a limited dependency on those raw materials affected the most.The Group also adjusted sale prices to compensate for the increase in its production costs in January and in July.In addition  the COVID-19 epidemic in China  involving very strict lockdowns and then  following the change in strategy  a surge in contaminations late in the year  had a negative impact on business in Asia  and particularly in China.The climate of uncertainty since the year began was intensified during the second half of the year by growing fears of recession in many countries.These situations have led some of the Group‚Äôs customers to reduce their investment budgets to cope with cost increases  shortages  or potential reductions in activity  while others have postponed purchasing decisions until their business environment and visibility improve.Finally  since the beginning of 2022  the dollar has significantly strengthened against the euro. With a yearly average exchange rate of $1.05/‚Ç¨1  the dollar was up 12% compared to 2021. This change and other currency changes mechanically increased revenues by roughly 7%.In this environment  the Group has once again demonstrated its resiliency  with strong earnings growth.2. Q4 2022In Q4 2021  the Gerber  Neteven and Gemini accounts were consolidated for the entire period. As a result  the published figures and the 2021 Pro forma figures were identical.In a particularly difficult macroeconomic environment  orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (48.7 million euros) decreased by 13% compared to Q4 2021. This decline is attributable to the decrease recorded in Asia-Pacific  particularly in China owing to the impact of COVID-19  and in the countries of Northern and Eastern Europe  which  because of their geographical situation  are more exposed to the economic and social consequences of the war in Ukraine.At the same time  orders for new software subscriptions (equivalent to 3.4 million euros in annual revenues) increased by 68%  again confirming the success and excellent adoption of these products.Q4 2022 revenues (129.9 million euros) increased by 3%. EBITDA before non-recurring items (23.5 million euros) increased by 8% and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items was 18.1% (+0.8 percentage points).Net income (8.4 million euros) was down 26% compared to Q4 2021.Free cash flow before non-recurring items came to 12.1 million euros (13.9 million euros in Q4 2021).3. 2022Acquisition of the majority of the capital of TextileGenesisOn December 8  2022  Lectra announced the signature of an agreement to acquire the majority of the capital and voting rights of the Dutch company TextileGenesis (see press release issued on that date).The transaction was finalized on January 9  2023.Revenues and earnings in line with published objectives2022 revenues (521.9 million euros) and EBITDA before non-recurring items (98.4 million euros) were in the range of the objectives published in February 2022  as fine-tuned in July and confirmed in October.Revenues increased by 35% and EBITDA before non-recurring items by 51% compared to the financial statements published in 2021. The EBITDA margin before non-recurring items was 18.8%.Income from operations before non-recurring items (68.5 million euros) was up 54%. This includes an 11.8-million-euro charge for amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisitions of Gerber  Neteven  Gemini  and of the activity of Glengo Teknoloji. After recognizing a non-recurring charge of 4.0 million euros in 2022  income from operations amounted to 64.5 million euros.Net income (43.8 million euros) was up 55%.Free cash flow before non-recurring items (43.7 million euros) was down slightly compared to 2021 due to a temporary increase in working capital requirement.Comparison to the 2021 Pro formaIn 2022 orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (202.5 million euros) were stable compared to the amount of 2021 Pro forma orders. The annual value of new software subscription orders (9.6 million euros) was up 34%  illustrating the success of the SaaS offers for Industry 4.0.Despite the negative impact of the war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 epidemic in China  revenues (521.9 million euros) increased by 12% compared to the 2021 Pro forma. Revenues from perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (208.8 million euros) increased by 10%  those from recurring contracts (168.4 million euros) by 13% and those from consumables and parts (144.7 million euros) by 12%.EBITDA before non-recurring items increased by 35% and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items by 3.2 percentage points.Balance sheet at December 31  2022At December 31  2022  the Group had a particularly robust balance sheet with a consolidated shareholders‚Äô equity of 452.2 million euros (400.8 million euros at December 31  2021) and a positive net cash position of 11.4 million euros  less than two years after the acquisition of Gerber. The working capital requirement was a negative 6.3 million euros.4. DIVIDEND INCREASED TO ‚Ç¨0.48 PER SHAREThe Board of Directors will propose to the Shareholders‚Äô Meeting of April 28  2023  the payment of a dividend at ‚Ç¨0.48 per share in respect of fiscal year 2022.5. OUTLOOKA new strategic roadmap for 2023-2025Launched in 2017  the Lectra 4.0 strategy aims to position the Lectra as a key Industry 4.0 player in its three strategic market sectors  fashion  automotive and furniture  before 2030. The strategy has been implemented up to now through two strategic roadmaps covering the periods 2017-2019  then 2020-2022.Lectra will continue to implement the Lectra 4.0 strategy over the next three years through a new strategic roadmap for 2023-2025.The Group intends to take full advantage of its change in dimension ‚Äì mainly following the acquisition of Gerber in June 2021 ‚Äì to accelerate growth  to significantly increase the volume of SaaS in its revenue  and to seize acquisition opportunities. With the commitment and engagement of employees  and recognition by customers  Lectra will be at the forefront in building a more sustainable future.To achieve these objectives  the Group has set six strategic priorities for 2023-2025:reinforce implementation of ethical  social  societal and environmental best practices both internally and for customers;leverage all synergies arising from the Gerber acquisition;accelerate the transition of software sales to the SaaS model;accelerate the transformation of the Group's customer relationship and customer engagement model;following on from the previous two roadmaps  continue to pursue external growth;prepare Lectra for the 2026-2030 period.These six strategic priorities provide the Group with a structure for the work required to achieve the ambitions of its strategic roadmap. They are detailed in the financial report on the activity and the consolidated financial statements for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022.Financial objectivesLectra's ambition is to achieve  in 2025  revenues of over 700 million euros (including 10% in SaaS revenues)  combining both organic growth and acquisitions  and an EBITDA margin before non-recurring items of over 20%. These objectives were prepared on the basis of the closing exchange rates on December 30  2022  in particular $1.07 to the euro.The Company intends to keep its attractive shareholder payment policy with dividends that over the roadmap period should represent a payout ratio of about 40% of net income  excluding non-recurring items.Free cash flow generation will also contribute to financing the Group‚Äôs internal development strategy and acquisitions  as well as the repayment of debt.Outlook for 2023In its financial report on the third quarter and first nine months of the year  which included a review of the 2020-2022 roadmap  the Group confirmed that the progress made during the period  as well as the acquisitions of 2021  and the Gerber acquisition in particular  had given the Group a new dimension and increased opportunities for continued growth.While this new status enables Lectra to look ahead with confidence at its development over the medium term  the year 2023 remains unpredictable given the degraded macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  as numerous uncertainties could continue to weigh upon the investment decisions of the Group's customers. Still  the lifting of restrictions in China that was announced at the end of 2022  and which resulted in the reopening of the country at the start of the year  is expected to have a positive impact in 2023.In a challenging context  the Group invested in 2022 to prepare for execution of its strategic roadmap for 2023-2025. By proceeding with two general salary increases during the year  it also decided to protect employees against the impact of inflation  thereby strengthening their engagement and commitment to the Group.Despite the persistent lack of visibility for 2023  Lectra  which has a particularly strong balance sheet and a proven business model featuring a very high percentage of recurring revenues  will continue to invest in order to prioritize medium-term growth.Because of an exceptionally large order backlog at January 1  2022 (4.3 million euros higher than the backlog at January 1  2023)  and the very high amount of orders booked in January 2022  before the start of the war in Ukraine  revenues for the first quarter of 2023 are expected to be slightly lower than for the first quarter of 2022. Combined with the increase in overhead costs  this decline is expected to also lead to a decrease in EBIDTA before non-recurring items.More generally  the contextual elements that affected the Group‚Äôs activity and results in 2022 were reflected heterogeneously over each quarter  making quarterly comparisons between 2023 and 2022 less relevant.Financial objectives for 2023In light of the above  Lectra has set its objectives for 2023  with revenues in the range of 522 to 576 million euros (+2% to +12% at constant exchange rates relative to 2022) and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 90 to 113 million euros (-5% to +20% at constant exchange rates relative to 2022).The Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations and the financial statements for Q4 and the fiscal year 2022 are available on lectra.com. First quarter earnings for 2023 will be published on April 27  2023.

In total  33% of patients in Cohort A and 52% of patients in Cohort B had failed treatment with 3 or more biologic drugs.Both induction cohorts of the study failed to meet the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic response for filgotinib  100mg and 200mg once daily.In the maintenance phase of the study  a statistically significant higher proportion of patients receiving filgotinib 200mg once daily achieved the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission (43.8% vs. 26.4%; p=0.0382) and endoscopic response (30.4% vs. 9.4%; p=0.0038) compared to placebo at Week 58.Story continuesThe safety observations of the study were in line with the underlying disease and were consistent with the safety profile of filgotinib in previous studies across indications.‚ÄúWhile Crohn‚Äôs disease is a difficult-to-treat condition and a large proportion of patients enrolled in DIVERSITY had high disease activity and long-standing disease with prior exposure to multiple therapies  we are disappointed with the outcome of the induction studies. However  at the same time  we are encouraged by the confirmed safety profile and the clinical efficacy signs observed in the maintenance phase ‚Äù said Prof. Dr. S√©verine Vermeire  Research Director of the Group Biomedical Sciences  University of Leuven and staff member at the Gastroenterology Department of the University Hospital Leuven  Belgium.Daniele D‚ÄôAmbrosio  MD  PhD  Therapeutic Area Head  Immunology  at Galapagos added: ‚ÄúAs filgotinib demonstrated robust late-stage clinical data in UC1 and in earlier Phase 2 clinical studies in CD  we are very disappointed with this outcome. The current topline data do not support a Marketing Authorization Application in Europe  and we will analyze the full results to gain valuable insights to guide future research efforts. Galapagos remains fully committed to filgotinib and its approved indications of RA and UC  and we are on track to initiate a Phase 3 study in patients with AxSpA later this year. We are grateful to the patients and all medical professionals who participated in this trial.‚ÄùAbout Crohn‚Äôs diseaseCrohn‚Äôs disease is an inflammatory bowel disease in which the balance of the intestinal immune system is disturbed causing a significant burden on people living with this disease. Crohn‚Äôs disease is considered to be a progressive disease and causes ulcerations that may affect any part of the digestive system from mouth to anus. The cause of the disease is unknown  with onset usually between the ages of 15 and 35. Patients suffer from abdominal pain  diarrhea (often bloody)  vomiting  fever  and weight loss. Estimates suggest there could be up to 1.6 million people living with Crohn‚Äôs disease across Europe  with up to 78 000 new cases every year.2 Despite the availability of advanced therapies  insufficient control of inflammation and loss of response over time are still a big problem for many CD patients.3About the filgotinib clinical development program in Crohn‚Äôs diseaseDIVERSITY consisted of a combined (induction and maintenance)  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial  enrolling 1 374 biologic-naive and biologic-experienced patients with moderately to severely active CD in 384 centers worldwide. The primary objectives of the trial were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of filgotinib 100mg or 200mg  once-daily oral treatment  versus placebo.The co-primary endpoints at Week 10 and Week 58 were clinical remission per Patient Reported Outcome (PRO-2) and endoscopic response per Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn‚Äôs Disease (SES-CD). Clinical remission measured by the Crohn‚Äôs Disease Activity Index (CDAI) was a key secondary endpoint in the induction and maintenance phase of the study. Additional secondary endpoints were clinical remission and endoscopic response (combined into a single endpoint on a patient level) at Week 10  clinical remission and endoscopic response (combined into a single endpoint on a patient level) at Weeks 10 and 58  sustained clinical remission and endoscopic response at Weeks 10 and 58  and 6-month corticosteroid-free clinical remission at Week 58.The results from the previous studies  Phase 2 FITZROY and Phase 2b DIVERGENCE  contributed to the long-term evaluation of filgotinib in Crohn‚Äôs disease. Full results of the FITZROY study were reported in The Lancet.4 A long-term extension study including patients who participated in DIVERSITY is currently ongoing.For DIVERSITY trial information  visit: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02914561About filgotinibFilgotinib is marketed as Jyseleca in Europe and Japan for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

The company ceased transactions with Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD) and blocked NSD accounts within its system following sanctions against the Russian clearing house in mid-2022. The move effectively made Russians unable to access their assets held within Euroclear.‚ÄúEuroclear Bank is not accepting money transfer instructions in rubles (or) any incoming ruble payments  including income and redemption events  on our closed account with ING Bank  our cash correspondent in Moscow ‚Äù Euroclear said last week.On Monday  the clearing house added that it was ‚Äúexcluding all securities denominated in rubles from all Triparty transactions with immediate effect and until further notice.‚ÄùLast month  investors from countries that Russia has classed as ‚Äúunfriendly‚Äù sold billions of rubles‚Äô worth Federal Loan Obligations (OFZ)  which are coupon-bearing loan bonds issued by the Russian government.According to a financial market source quoted by Reuters  Euroclear‚Äôs move to withdraw rubles could make it difficult to further ‚Äúlocalize‚Äù OFZs.Russia‚Äôs NSD has been trying for months to obtain permits for the release of Russian funds from Western clearing systems. In December  regulators in Belgium and Luxembourg authorized the release of ‚Äúcertain frozen funds and economic resources‚Äù belonging to non-sanctioned Russian investors  by granting a general license to the NSD. After that  the NSD and a number of other Russian brokers applied for the release of funds.However  experts say the permits do not guarantee Russian investors will see their money in the near future  as there is uncertainty around the procedure for their withdrawal.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.15,0.84,True,English,"['ruble accounts', 'Euroclear', 'euros', 'leading securities transactions company', 'Federal Loan Obligations', 'coupon-bearing loan bonds', 'central securities depository', 'National Settlement Depository', 'other Russian brokers', 'Belgium-based clearing house', 'incoming ruble payments', 'Western clearing systems', 'money transfer instructions', 'Russian clearing house', 'Russian investors‚Äô access', 'sanctioned Russian investors', 'certain frozen funds', 'Russian ruble', 'Western depositories', 'settlement currency', 'securities trades', 'Russian government', 'ruble balances', 'Triparty transactions', 'Russian funds', 'account holders', 'frozen assets', 'European exchanges', 'financial institutions', 'redemption events', 'closed account', 'cash correspondent', 'immediate effect', 'financial market', 'economic resources', 'general license', 'near future', 'business section', 'NSD accounts', 'Euroclear Bank', 'move', 'euros', 'Wednesday', 'consent', 'sanctions', 'mid-20', 'Russians', 'rubles', 'income', 'Moscow', 'Monday', 'notice', 'countries', 'billions', 'OFZ', 'Reuters', 'months', 'permits', 'release', 'December', 'regulators', 'Luxembourg', 'number', 'experts', 'uncertainty', 'procedure', 'withdrawal', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-02-09,2023-02-09,rt.com

The slight increase in costs only results from costs related to non-volume related revenue growth initiatives. Savings and synergies entirely compensate inflation and business development costs.Status update on synergies in relation to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition : ‚Ç¨ 34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies were achieved at the end of Q4 2022  thanks to restructuring efforts and the migration of the Core Data Centre. ‚Ç¨9.7 million run-rate annual synergies were delivered in Q4 2022. ‚Ç¨44.2 million of cumulated implementation costs incurred at the end of Q4 2022  of which ‚Ç¨6.3 million during Q4 2022.Next steps in the deployment of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan : Euronext upgrades its 2024 annual run - rate pre - tax synergies related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group by ‚Ç¨ 15 millon to ‚Ç¨ 115 million . Implementation costs remain unchanged. Euronext confirmed the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets onto Optiq ¬Æ in March 2023  forming the first phase of the migration  and of Borsa Italiana other markets in Q4 2023 allowing for termination of the third-party provider trading platform contract. Euronext confirmed the phases in the expansion of Euronext Clearing with the expected launch of the equity clearing offering by the end of 2023 and of derivative clearing by Q3 2024. These strategic projects are expected to reach around ‚Ç¨ 7 0 million of cumulated run-rate synergies by the end of 2023  out of the ‚Ç¨115 million targeted. In 2023  Euronext expects to maintain for cash trading an average market share greater or equal to 63%   and revenue capture a round 0.5 2 bps following the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq ¬Æ   considering current market conditions and orders size.Key achievement in the deployment of the ‚Äò Fit for 1.5 ¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy in 2022 : Euronext‚Äôs upgraded SBTi-aligned climate targets were validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative: By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based greenhouse gas emissions by 73.5% compared to 2020; By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 3 business travel emissions by at least 46.2% compared to 2019; By 2027  Euronext suppliers  representing 72% of Euronext‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions derived from purchased goods and services  must set targets on their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.The Group‚Äôs efforts to enhance diversity were recognised through the inclusion of Euronext into the Euronext Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Euronext Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices.St√©phane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:‚ÄúIn 2022  Euronext reached record revenue and income above ‚Ç¨1.4 billion notably resulting from the strong performance of our non-volume related activities  together with efficient management of revenue capture and of cash trading market share. Thanks to our trademark cost discipline  we beat our 2022 revised costs guidance. We achieved an adjusted EBITDA of ‚Ç¨861.6 million that translated into an adjusted EPS of ‚Ç¨5.21. We will propose a total dividend of ‚Ç¨236.6 million at our next annual general meeting to be held in May 2023  representing 50% of our reported net income  excluding NTI loss impact.This year has been crucial in laying the foundations for the future growth of the Group. We have successfully completed the first major milestone of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan with the migration of our Core Data Centre from the UK to Italy. At the end of 2022  we have achieved ‚Ç¨34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies related to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.This fruitful year paves the way for the next steps to be delivered in 2023. The largest single liquidity pool in Europe  operated by Euronext will significantly change dimension with the migration of Italian cash markets to Euronext‚Äôs state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq¬Æ  which will benefit local and global trading members.Euronext Clearing will become the Euronext equity clearing house of choice by the end of 2023  and the CCP for derivatives clearing in Q3 2024. These are the critical bricks to complete our presence across the integrated value chain  allowing us to innovate and shape capital markets in line with evolving client needs  and making Euronext even stronger to deliver future growth.In an inflationary environment  we will contain our costs to a slight increase in 2023  at ‚Ç¨630 million  demonstrating Euronext‚Äôs ability to maintain its cost discipline while investing to generate revenue expansion of our non-volume related activities. We expect to deliver by the end of 2023 around ‚Ç¨70 million of the synergies targeted as part of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan. Our good progress on integration led us to upgrade the total amount of targeted run-rate EBITDA synergies by the end of 2024 from ‚Ç¨100 million to ‚Ç¨115 million. This further demonstrates Euronext‚Äôs successful track record in integrating acquired companies.Our strong performance  combined with the successful ongoing delivery of the planned synergies  is supporting our deleveraging trajectory with a net debt to EBITDA ratio at 2.6x  well below 3.2x at the time of closing of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition. This leaves the Group with flexibility to further deploy capital in value generating opportunities that might arise.Lastly  we are happy to see that our ‚ÄòFit for 1.5¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy is bearing fruit  as our upgraded emission reduction targets have been validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative. We are pleased to see Euronext being included in both the Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices  demonstrating the progress we are making in striving towards more equality.‚ÄùEuronext Q4 and full year 2022 financial performanceFull year 20226In ‚Ç¨m  unless stated otherwiseThe figures in this document have not been audited or reviewed by our external auditor.

The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage by non-volume related underlying revenue ratio was at 141% in 2022  almost stable vs. 2021 (142%).2022 adjusted EBITDAUnderlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased to ‚Ç¨606.1 million  up +14.9%  reflecting the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group costs and continued cost discipline in an inflationary environment. Underlying expenses excluding D&A (‚Ç¨606.1 million) were better than 2022 guidance of ‚Ç¨612 million underlying costs excluding D&A (‚Ç¨622 million initially) thanks to strong cost discipline  project costs being capitalised and one-off positive impacts  including release of accruals and lower-than-anticipated travel and marketing expenses due to the Covid-19 pandemic.On a like-for-like basis  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased slightly by +2.7% compared to 2021  which was positively impacted by the decrease of travel and marketing expenses during the pandemic  highlighting Euronext‚Äôs ability to contain inflation in 2022. On a pro forma basis for the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group on 29 April 2021  underlying operational expenses increased slightly by +2.0%  mainly due to the return of travel and marketing expenses in 2022.Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled ‚Ç¨861.6 million and saw double digit growth  +11.7% compared to 2021.

These items can include: integration or double run costs of significant projects  restructuring costs and costs related to acquisitions that change the perimeter of the Group; one-off finance costs  gains or losses on sale of subsidiaries and impairments of investments: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets which are recognised as a result of acquisitions and mostly comprising customer relationships  brand names and software that were identified during purchase price allocation (PPA); tax related to non-underlying items.Adjusted operating profit as the operating profit adjusted for any non-underlying revenue and income and non-underlying costs  including PPA of acquired businesses;EBITDA as the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;Adjusted EBITDA as the adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation adjusted for any non-underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA  divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted net income  as the net income  share of the parent company shareholders  adjusted for any non-underlying items and related tax impact.Non-IFRS financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable IFRS measures and should be read only in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements.Non-volume related revenue definitionNon-volume related revenue includes Listing excl.

In its amended form  said article would read in its entirety as follows:‚Äú10 ¬ß The General Meeting of the Shareholders shall be held either in Espoo or in Helsinki  as decided by the Board of Directors. In addition  the Board of Directors may decide that the General Meeting of the Shareholders be held without a meeting venue so that the shareholders exercise their power of decision in full in real time during the meeting using a telecommunications connection and technical means (remote meeting).The Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders  which shall be held annually by the end of May on a date decided by the Board of Directors shall:be presented with:1) the Financial Statements  including the Consolidated Financial Statements  and the Report by the Board of Directors 2) the Auditor's Report decide on:3) the adoption of the Financial Statements and the Consolidated Financial Statements4) the use of the profits available for shareholders according to the Balance Sheet 5) discharge from liability of the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO 6) the number of the members of the Board of Directors 7) the fees payable to the members of the Board of Directors and the auditor elect:8) the members of the Board of Directors so that  in accordance with the decision by the General Meeting of the Shareholders  the person or persons getting most of the votes shall be elected 9) from among the members of the Board of Directors  the Chairman of the Board 10) the auditor  as well as tohandle:11) other issues mentioned separately in the notice to convene.‚ÄùThe proposal is based on the changes to Chapter 5 of the Finnish Companies Act  including the possibility to arrange general meetings remotely.

The Board of Directors proposes that the authorization entitles the Board to deviate from the shareholders' proportional shareholdings (directed acquisition). Own shares can be acquired at a price formed in public trading on the date of the acquisition or at a price otherwise formed on the market. The shares may be used to carry out acquisitions or other arrangements pertaining to the company's business operations  to develop the capital structure of the company  as part of the incentive plans  or to be otherwise invalidated or conveyed. In connection with the share repurchase ordinary derivative  stock lending  and other agreements may be made in the market in accordance with the laws and regulations.

This authorization shall replace all earlier authorizations of the Board of Directors pertaining to the acquisition of own shares. 17. Authorization to decide on share issue as well as to grant option rights and other special rights entitling to sharesThe Board of Directors proposes the General Meeting to authorize the Board to decide on issuance of a maximum of 3 600 000 shares and granting of a maximum of 3 600 000 of the company's own shares in one or several parts (the company currently has a total of 37 388 225 shares). The shares could be issued either against a payment or without payment on the basis of conditions set by the Board of Directors and  for the part of an issue against payment  at the price defined by the Board of Directors. The authorization also gives the Board of Directors the right to grant option rights and special rights-as defined in Chapter 10  Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act-which entitle  against payment  to new shares or company shares in the company's possession. A right may also be given to a creditor in such manner that the right includes a condition that the creditor's receivable is used to set off the subscription price (convertible loan). The subscription price of the new shares and the amount paid for the company's own shares will be added to the fund for invested unrestricted equity. The Board of Directors proposes that the authorization entitles the Board to deviate from the pre-emptive subscription rights of the existing shareholders  provided that the company has an weighty financial reason to do so  as regards the issue against payment  and that there is an especially weighty financial reason for the company and the good of the shareholders to do so  as regards the free issue. Within the limits set above  the authorization could be used  for example  to develop the capital structure  to widen the ownership base  in making a payment for an acquisition  when the company buys property related to its business operations  or incentive or reward program for employees and management at Innofactor group. New issue or transfer of own shares could also be used as a contribution in kind or when using the set-off right. In addition  the Board of Directors proposes that the authorization include also the right to decide on a share issue without payment to the company itself in such a manner that  after the issue  the number of shares in the company's possession is at the maximum one tenth of the total number of shares in the company. This number includes the shares in the possession of the company and its subsidiaries as defined in Chapter 15  Section 11  subsection 1 of the Finnish Companies Act. The Board of Directors will decide on all other matters related to the authorization. This authorization would be valid until June 30  2024. This authorization shall replace all earlier authorizations of the Board of Directors related to issuance of shares and granting of the company's own shares. 18. Closing the meeting B.

Net sales decreased by 6.0%. Net sales growth excluding the renewable energy sources business was 2.9%.Adjusted operating profit for the final quarter was EUR 9.6 million (10.1) and operating profit was EUR 12.9 million (9.9). The Group's operating profit was increased by a gain of EUR 4.3 million recognised on the sale of the share of renewable energy sources business to a newly established joint venture.L&T‚Äôs circular economy businesses  namely Environmental Services and Industrial Services  achieved a strong operating result in 2022. In Industrial Services  net sales increased by 25.6 per cent.In Facility Services in Finland and Sweden  the higher general cost level had a negative effect on profitability. Both divisions launched programmes during the review period to simplify and increase the efficiency of their operating models. These programmes will continue in 2023.Net sales for 2022 amounted to EUR 844.1 million (812.5). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 40.9 million (42.4) and operating profit was EUR 42.9 million (42.2). Earnings per share were EUR 0.83 (0.90).Net cash flow from operating activities after investments per share was EUR 1.08 (0.05).The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of EUR 0.47 per share.Outlook for the year 2023Net sales and adjusted operating profit in 2023 are estimated to be at the same level as in the previous year even though the comparison period includes net sales from the renewable energy sources business in the amount of EUR 35.4 million.PRESIDENT AND CEO EERO HAUTANIEMI:‚ÄúThe year 2022 was exceptional and the business environment changed significantly. The economic uncertainty caused by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine  the sharp rise in costs and interest rates and the significantly higher-than-usual level of sickness-related absences affected all of the company‚Äôs divisions.Story continuesThe development of net sales was positive in 2022  but adjusted operating profit declined slightly due to the weak result of Facility Services Finland and Sweden. Net cash flow from operating activities was strong  as was the company‚Äôs financial position.L&T‚Äôs circular economy businesses  namely Environmental Services and Industrial Services  achieved a good operative result in 2022.In Environmental Services  net sales growth excluding the renewable energy sources business came to 8.1 per cent. The number of corporate customers and producer responsibility organisation customers grew. The division‚Äôs environmental responsibility management and consulting capabilities and organisation were strengthened.In Industrial Services  net sales increased by 25.6 per cent  of which 6.6 per cent was organic growth. Industrial Services expanded its operations into the Swedish market and strengthened its market position in hazardous waste in Finland through an acquisition. In the environmental construction business  a number of demanding contaminated soil restoration projects were carried out for industrial customers.In Facility Services in Finland and Sweden  profitability was weighed down by the higher general cost level  worsening labour shortages  high employee turnover and sickness-related absences being significantly higher than average. The profit performance of Facility Services Sweden was weighed down not only by inflation but also the weaker-than-expected sales of additional services. Both divisions launched programmes during the review period to simplify and increase the efficiency of their operating models. These programmes will continue in 2023.L&T‚Äôs businesses are not particularly sensitive to economic cycles. Nevertheless  inflation and rising interest rates create uncertainty in the operating environment.In 2024  the Environmental Services division will focus particularly on corporate customers and producer responsibility organisations as the progress of municipalisation reduces the significance of households as customers.The Industrial Services division will continue to invest in the development of new hazardous waste recycling solutions and process cleaning methods in both Finland and Sweden.Facility Services Finland and Sweden will continue to focus on improving operational efficiency and profitability. Particularly in Finland  unprofitable customer agreements will be terminated and the scope of operations will be reassessed. In Sweden  the focus will be on simplifying the operating model.‚ÄùGROUP NET SALES AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEOctober‚ÄìDecemberLassila & Tikanoja‚Äôs net sales for the fourth quarter amounted to EUR 210.1 million (223.5)  a decrease of 6.0% year-on-year.

The Group's operating profit was increased by a gain of EUR 4.3 million recognised on the sale of the share of renewable energy sources business to a newly established joint venture.Year 2022Net sales for 2022 totalled EUR 844.1 million (812.5)  an increase of 3.9% year-on-year. Net sales growth excluding the effect of the renewable energy sources business was 7.0%. Organic growth was 3.7%. Adjusted operating profit was EUR 40.9 million (42.4)  representing 4.8% (5.2%) of net sales. Operating profit was EUR 42.9 million (42.2)  representing 5.1% (5.2%) of net sales.

Operating profit improved in Environmental Services and Industrial Services  and declined in Facility Services in Finland and Sweden.The Group‚Äôs adjusted operating profit was negatively affected by increased fuel prices and the higher general cost level. The sickness rate was exceptionally high during the review period  which had a negative impact particularly on the labour-intensive facility services business. The Group's operating profit was increased by a gain of EUR 4.3 million recognised on the sale of the share of renewable energy sources business to a newly established joint venture.Net financial expenses rose to EUR -5.8 million (-3.3) and the effective tax rate increased to 16.7 per cent (11.8 per cent).Financial summary10‚Äì12/2022 10‚Äì12/2021 Change % 1‚Äì12/2022 1‚Äì12/2021 Change % Net sales  EUR million 210.1 223.5 -6.0 844.1 812.5 3.9 Adjusted operating profit  EUR million 9.6 10.1 -5.1 40.9 42.4 -3.5 Adjusted operating margin  % 4.6 4.5 4.8 5.2 Operating profit  EUR million 12.9 9.9 30.2 42.9 42.2 1.7 Operating margin  % 6.2 4.4 5.1 5.2 EBITDA  EUR million 26.5 23.2 14.2 98.3 95.1 3.3 EBITDA  % 12.6 10.4 11.6 11.7 Profit before tax  EUR million 12.2 9.1 33.8 37.8 39.0 -3.0 Earnings per share  EUR 0.29 0.26 11.1 0.83 0.90 -8.3 Net cash flow from operating activitiesafter investments per share  EUR 1.05 0.55 92.8 1.08 0.05 2 279.1 Return on equity (ROE)  % 14.6 17.1 Capital employed  EUR million 437.2 406.0 7.7 Return on capital employed (ROCE)  % 10.4 10.8 Equity ratio  % 34.3 34.2 Gearing  % 75.9 79.4NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT BY DIVISIONEnvironmental ServicesOctober‚ÄìDecemberThe division‚Äôs net sales for the fourth quarter decreased to EUR 71.1 million (89.9). Operating profit declined to EUR 6.2 million (7.1). Excluding the renewable energy sources business  the net sales of the Environmental Services division amounted to EUR 71.1 million (71.2) and operating profit was EUR 6.2 million (6.6).Year 2022The full-year net sales of the Environmental Services division grew to EUR 321.2 million (320.5). Operating profit was EUR 30.3 million (29.8). Excluding the renewable energy sources business  the net sales of the Environmental Services division amounted to EUR 287.1 million (265.5) and operating profit was EUR 30.0 million (28.9).In Environmental Services  growth was derived particularly from corporate customers and producer responsibility organisations. The producer responsibility organisation Suomen Pakkaustuottajat Oy chose L&T as its recycling partner for consumer plastic packaging in December. The agreement covers approximately 20 000 tonnes of consumer packaging plastic waste  which corresponds to approximately half of the packaging plastic waste collected in Finland each year. From the beginning of 2023  L&T will be responsible for the intermediate storage of plastic packaging waste as well as its collection and transport to Quantafuel ASA‚Äôs mechanical and chemical recycling plants in Denmark.During the period under review  the organisational structure and operating model were reformed by assigning more commercial responsibility to the local organisation. Environmental responsibility management and consulting organisation grew  and its competencies were expanded.The ERP system and related information system renewal programme continued in the division and progressed to the implementation stage. The system is scheduled to enter the deployment stage in the first half of 2024. The total investment in the system projects under the programme is estimated at approximately EUR 16.9 million  of which approximately EUR 6.2 million were realised by the end of 2022  with expenses of EUR 1.3 million recognised in 2022.Due to the reform of the Waste Act in 2021  direct customer agreements with housing properties were transferred to municipal operators during the period under review  but the impact of these changes on net sales was compensated for by growth in the corporate customer segment.The prices of recycled raw materials increased in the first half of the year. The prices of recycled raw materials subsequently stabilised and  in the case of certain fractions  began to decrease in the latter half of the year. The market prices of recycled cardboard and paperboard falling to less than half of the level seen in the early part of the year was particularly reflected in the net sales of the Environmental Services division. The reduced level of activity in the construction industry was also reflected in declining volumes towards the end of the year.Fuel prices rose sharply at the end of February due to the war in Ukraine. The higher fuel costs were successfully passed on to customer prices through cost increases carried out in February‚ÄìApril.The merger of the Environmental Services division‚Äôs renewable energy sources business with Neova Oy‚Äôs corresponding business was approved by the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority  and the joint venture Laania Oy became operational on 1 July 2022. In the first half of the year  the net sales of the renewable energy sources business amounted to EUR 35.4 million  and the operating profit was EUR 0.3 million. In the financial year 2021  the net sales of the renewable energy sources business totalled EUR 56.9 million  and the operating profit was EUR 0.9 million. The business is no longer reported as part of the Environmental Services division after the second quarter of 2022. The net profit of the joint venture is consolidated in one line item under operating profit.Industrial ServicesOctober‚ÄìDecemberThe division‚Äôs net sales for the final quarter grew to EUR 36.3 million (28.7). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 3.1 million (1.7). Operating profit was EUR 2.3 million (1.7). Operating profit was reduced by a change of EUR 0.8 million in the fair value of the deferred consideration related to the acquisition of Sand & Vattenbl√§st i Tyringe AB (‚ÄúSVB‚Äù) recognised in the final quarter of 2022  due to the positive development of the acquired company‚Äôs business.Year 2022The full-year net sales of the Industrial Services division grew to EUR 132.0 million (105.1). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 13.6 million (9.2). Operating profit was EUR 12.7 million (9.2). Operating profit was reduced by a change of EUR 0.8 million in the fair value of the deferred consideration related to the acquisition of Sand & Vattenbl√§st i Tyringe AB (‚ÄúSVB‚Äù) recognised in the final quarter of 2022  due to the positive development of the acquired company‚Äôs business.The Industrial Services division strengthened its position in hazardous and non-hazardous waste recycling services during the period under review by acquiring Fortum‚Äôs hazardous waste SME business in Finland at the beginning of February 2022. The takeover of the business acquired from Fortum went according to plan  and the demand for hazardous waste services was strong.In the environmental construction business line  several demanding industrial soil decontamination projects were carried out. At the beginning of the year  a new material treatment center started its operations in Pori  Finland. The plant focuses particularly on processing industrial side streams.In February  Industrial Services expanded into the Swedish process cleaning services market by acquiring 70% of the shares of Sand & Vattenbl√§st i Tyringe AB (‚ÄúSVB‚Äù)  a provider of process cleaning services in Sweden. Operating in southern Sweden  SVB had net sales of approximately EUR 10 million in the previous financial year and has approximately 60 employees. The integration of the Swedish business progressed according to plan  and several successful industrial water treatment projects were carried out in the process cleaning business in Sweden. In the process cleaning business in Finland  resource allocation for annual maintenance services was successful in spite of maintenance services originally scheduled for the early part of the year being postponed to the autumn due to the COVID-19 pandemic and labour action.Fuel prices rose sharply at the end of February due to the war in Ukraine. The higher fuel costs were  for the most part  passed on to customer prices through cost increases carried out in February‚ÄìApril.Facility Services FinlandOctober‚ÄìDecemberThe division‚Äôs net sales for the final quarter grew to EUR 64.6 million (63.0). Operating profit was EUR 0.8 million (0.6).Year 2022The full-year net sales of Facility Services Finland grew to EUR 256.3 million (243.1). Operating profit declined to EUR -0.5 million (1.8).Several significant new customer accounts were acquired and started in the cleaning business  and the demand for data-driven cleaning services increased. The demand for energy efficiency services increased during the review period.The COVID-19 pandemic and other respiratory infections significantly increased sickness-related absences in the first and fourth quarters  which increased production costs in all service branches  especially in cleaning. Production costs were increased by higher fuel prices and general cost inflation. The increased production costs could not be fully passed on to customer prices.In the cleaning business  the availability of labour declined and employee turnover increased significantly  which drove costs higher. Several new projects were launched to improve the availability of labour. Co-operation with municipal employment services and government organisations was intensified to ensure that jobs offered by L&T are better known by job seekers. L&T joined forces with Staffpoint to offer jobs to Ukrainian refugees. A group of workers from the Philippines was recruited for full-time cleaning work under contracts valid until further notice. The employees in question will start work in the first quarter of 2023.Measures were taken in Facility Services Finland to improve operational efficiency and profitability throughout the period under review. Local and business line-specific change negotiations were conducted in the division in the second half of the year  leading to the termination of employment for approximately 70 white-collar employees and approximately 30 employees.Facility Services SwedenOctober‚ÄìDecemberThe division‚Äôs net sales for the final quarter decreased to EUR 39.8 million (43.8). Operating profit declined to EUR 0.5 million (1.3). Operating profit before the amortisation of purchase price allocations of acquisitions was EUR 0.8 million (1.9).Year 2022Facility Services Sweden‚Äôs full-year net sales decreased to EUR 140.4 million (149.8). Operating profit declined to EUR 0.4 million (3.9). Operating profit before the amortisation of purchase price allocations of acquisitions was EUR 2.2 million (6.0).Production costs were increased by higher fuel prices and general cost inflation from February onwards. The COVID-19 pandemic increased sickness-related absences  particularly in the first quarter. Customer agreements in the Swedish business are mostly fixed-price contracts  and the increased production costs could not be passed on to customers in the form of price increases. The profit performance of Facility Services Sweden was lowered not only by inflation but also the weaker-than-expected sales of additional services. Adaptation measures were initiated in the division in the second quarter. The effort to simplify operating models and adapt them to the rapidly changing business environment will continue in 2023.FINANCINGIn 2022  cash flow from operating activities amounted to EUR 71.8 million (65.6). Net cash flow after investments came to EUR 41.1 million (1.7). Net cash flow from operating activities after investments was reduced by acquisitions  which had a total impact of approximately EUR 13 million (approximately EUR 23 million). Net cash flow after investments was increased by the repayment of a loan receivable of EUR 16.4 million by the joint venture in the final quarter of 2022. A total of EUR 6.2 million in working capital was committed (EUR 15.1 million committed).At the end of the financial year  interest-bearing liabilities amounted to EUR 216.8 million (195.6). Net interest-bearing liabilities totalled EUR 167.3 million (167.1). The average interest rate of long-term loans  excluding lease liabilities  with interest rate hedging  was 2.5% (1.1%). Of the company‚Äôs floating rate loans totalling EUR 50 million  EUR 30 million have been converted into fixed rate loans by means of an interest rate swap.The EUR 100.0 million commercial paper programme was unused at the end of the financial year as in the comparison period. The account limit totalling EUR 10.0 million as well as the committed credit limit totalling EUR 40.0 million were not in use  as was the case in the comparison period. The Group signed a credit limit linked to responsibility targets in May 2022. The credit limit will mature in the first quarter of 2025.

The new notes will mature in the second quarter of 2028 and bear fixed annual interest at the rate of 3.375 per cent.Net financial expenses amounted to EUR -5.8 million (-3.3).

L&T‚Äôs carbon handprint reduces the customer‚Äôs carbon footprint. Our services generated emission reductions for customers through  for example  customers replacing virgin raw materials with secondary raw materials  and fossil fuels with biofuels and solid recovered fuels.The carbon handprint of the renewable energy sources business is no longer reported as part of L&T‚Äôs carbon handprint in 2022. In 2021  L&T‚Äôs total carbon handprint excluding renewable energy sources was 528 000 tCO 2 e.Recycling rate and material recovery2022 2021 Target Target to be achieved by Recycling rate of material flows managed by L&T  % 59.4 58.4 65 2026The recycling rate is the weighted average of our customers‚Äô recycling rates. It also includes materials that cannot yet be recycled. To increase our reuse and recycling rate  we actively look for new material streams whose refining rate we can increase. Reporting covers municipal waste collected from corporate customers  hazardous waste  industrial waste and construction waste in Finland. Slurry  contaminated soil and ash are excluded from reporting.Progress towards science-based emission reduction targets  using 2018 as the baseline2022 2021 Target Target to be achieved by Carbon footprint (tCO 2 e)31 70037 800Carbon footprint intensity (gCO 2 e/km)6467674762030L&T‚Äôs strategic objective is to halve the carbon footprint of its operations by 2030  using 2018 as the baseline  and to reduce the indirect emissions generated by its supply chain. The emission reduction target set by L&T has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. The achievement of this objective will be promoted by switching to zero-emission transport technologies and fuels and by opting for renewable energy at L&T‚Äôs properties. Transport operations account for 95 per cent of the emissions generated by L&T‚Äôs own operations.The fuel distribution obligation was adjusted in 2022 by reducing the biofuel component by 7.5 per cent in July. This change has not been taken into account in the emissions calculations reported in the financial statements release  as Statistics Finland has yet to update its fuel classification data in accordance with the change. Statistics Finland is expected to publish updated fuel classification data during spring 2023. L&T will subsequently calculate and report its carbon dioxide emissions for 2022 on its website using the updated emission factors. The total emissions of L&T‚Äôs own operations for 2022  calculated with the updated emission factors  are likely to be higher than those reported here.Social responsibilityOverall accident frequency2022 2021 Target Target to be achieved byOverall accident frequency (TRIF)2324192026L&T eliminates hazards and improves its own safety as well as the safety of customers and other stakeholders through effective proactive measures  such as risk assessments  safety observations  Safety Walks and occupational safety sessions.Well-being at work2022 2021 Target Target to be achieved by Occupational health rate (proportion of employees with no sickness-related absences)404557 2026Sickness-related absences (%)5.65.04.32026The objective of L&T‚Äôs personnel policies and plans is to ensure that the number  competence and retention of personnel are at the level required for effective performance.

18060,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ARTMARKET-COM-5174/news/Artmarket-com-Artmarket-com-reports-Q4-2022-revenue-growth-and-a-new-business-model-generating-42943974/?utm_medium=RSS&utm_content=20230209,Artmarket.com :  Artmarket.com reports Q4 2022 revenue growth and a new business model generating additional income from affiliate advertisers  potentially doubling Artprice's turnover.,(marketscreener.com)  After posting good revenue figures for 4Q 2022  we are proud to say that Artprice by Artmarket has got off to a dynamic start to 2023 with January's turnover showing a 17% increase versus the year-earlier period.The figures show that ‚Ä¶,"After posting good revenue figures for 4Q 2022  we are proud to say that Artprice by Artmarket has got off to a dynamic start to 2023 with January's turnover showing a 17% increase versus the year-earlier period.The figures show that since the start of 2023  Artmarket.com has been gaining market share with new customers despite the uncertain economic context stemming from very unpredictable geopolitical parameters and an inflationary dynamic that poses significant challenges for central banks  particularly for the ECB and the FED.Artprice took advantage of the Covid period to develop and deploy the most significant modification in its history  leading to a change in its business model with paying advertisers fully integrated into its databases and services. These advertisers are essentially the 6 500 Auction Houses around the world that have been affiliated with Artprice for more than two decades and today conduct 98% of their sales online.It is quite possible that the turnover generated by these 6 500 auction houses will ultimately generate more turnover than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice by Artmarket.com's turnover. By effectively responding to a long-standing request from its partner auction houses  Artprice believes it can double its turnover. A second major change in our business model relates to our decision to license our Standardized Database of Artists  today the most comprehensive in the world.Future events in 2023: annual licensing of Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists  with an entry price of ‚Ç¨7 500 per yearIn recent years  Artprice by Artmarket  which owns the largest known editorial collection of manuscripts and catalogs from 1700 to the present day (a current asset with an estimated value of ‚Ç¨16.257 million in Artprice by Artmarket.com's balance sheet)  has developed the most comprehensive database of artists in the world.At Artprice by Artmarket  we never forget that artists are what the art market revolves around; they are its primary and unique motor  and all the news  exhibitions  auctions  galleries  museums  biennials  fairs  and shows evolve around them. In short  none of it could exist without the artist.Each Artist page is created within the framework of a standardized editorial charter and a set of processes protected under France's Intellectual Property Laws  with a biography supported by certified documents from the artist and/or his/her beneficiaries that are deposited in Artprice's physical archives.Each analog/digital record has 140 referential integrity fields which are themselves relational databases.Each Artist page includes details about their various disciplines and artistic techniques  their past auction results (with photographs of the works)  their upcoming sales  their signatures and monograms  an indication of any catalog raisonn√© and/or reference work  their annual auction turnover  their auction records  the geographical distribution of their sales  their key market indices  their unsold rates  as well as all articles or dispatches from Artprice's press agency ‚ÄúArtMarket Insight‚Äù written about the artist.This allows Artprice to attribute each artist with a dedicated ID (like a business identification code) and for each of his/her works  another specific ID (like a vehicle registration document) and to ‚Äòstandardize' the art market to ensure reliable traceability  accurate indices  and comprehensive monitoring. These unique and rigorous processes are subject to multiple protection mechanisms under France's Intellectual Property Laws.A single Artist Log costs on average 270‚Ç¨ to 300‚Ç¨ to create  and  despite ultra-powerful computing  it requires human validation by a committee of editors and translation into the six languages ??of the Artprice databases  namely English  French  Spanish  German  Italian and Mandarin.In 25 years  the Artprice Artist Database has established itself as the leading standardized global database in terms of the number of artists it covers  but also in terms of the volume of information per Artist entry.To date  the only reference we have retained is the Benezit Dictionary  created in 1911 in Paris and which Artprice tried to acquire from √âditions Gr√ºnd in the early 2000s.At the time  Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists included 120 000 artists while the Benezit had 175 000. The latter was therefore the de facto global reference by its sheer number of artists. Despite a very substantial financial proposal from Artprice  the Benezit was finally sold to Oxford Art Online (see our registration document and financial report).In 2023  the online Benezit  in English  has 170 000 artists and a subscription entry cost of ¬£215 per year.Artprice's standardized artists' database now totals 803 000 artists from the 4th century to the present day  in six languages.The overall cost associated with successfully building the most comprehensive Standardized Database of Artists in the world also includes the cost of acquiring legendary companies and documentary collections such as the Enrique Mayer Guide (1962/1987)  the famous Dictionary of Art Sales by Doctor H. Mireur 1700-1900  the American leader Sound View Press with nearly 50 databases on the USA including the famous biographical collection Who Was Who in American Art (1991)  Editions Franck Van Wilder (1970)  the Swiss company Xylogic (world specialist in Art Market indices since 1985)  the Bayer Database on the Anglo-Saxon Art Market from 1700 to 1913  Signatures and Monogrammes by Caplan & Creps (USA)  a global reference work (1976)  and a whole host of other works and records.Indeed  over the past 25 years  we at Artprice have pursued a systematic policy of purchasing all manuscripts and catalogs  mainly from 1700 to 1970  from all over the world. The acquisition of this historical knowledge was an unavoidable process in ensuring that Artprice could standardize the art market with certainty and know the perfect traceability of works of art and their correct attributions.In the 20th century  the Benezit was the major reference  the Bible of the Art Market according to Le Monde newspaper. To date  it is the only serious financial and analytical referent for Artprice  notably because of its use of a comparative methodology.Nevertheless  the 803 000 artists in Artprice's Standardized Database represent a volume 472% greater than that of the Benezit Oxford University Press Dictionary (170 000 artists)  with access in six languages ??for Artprice compared with just one language for the Benezit.For Artprice  the total present-day cost in 2023 of building the most exhaustive database of artists in the world is 216 million euros (see paragraph on analytical cost). Despite being an asset in permanent growth  under International Financial Reporting Standards  the valuation of such a perennial asset is recognized in Artprice by Artmarket.com balance sheets at only a fraction of its real value (IFRS have been adopted since 2005 to harmonize the presentation of listed companies' financial and accounting statements).Indeed  the creation of the index for Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists was an extremely complex operation involving seven million hours of work by historians  researchers  editors  journalists  econometricians  and a dedicated IT department over 25 years.Now that it exists  Artprice by Artmarket is constantly being asked for licenses to use its Standardized Database of Artists  mainly by the tens of thousands of online galleries  marketplaces  Auction Houses  Experts  online auction sites  copyright companies  customs  and tax authorities  museums foundations and insurance companies that operate in this segment  but without an exhaustive standardized database of artists.Many of these players are prone to making regular attribution errors - as they themselves admit - and for the small or recently established structures  their survival depends on access to a standardized and consistent Database of Artists over the centuries.One of the main difficulties is having  on the one hand  a massive collection of auction catalogs and manuscripts  and on the other hand  proprietary algorithms that can track down and identify the numerous homonyms that exist in the field of art.Indeed  art history is full of homonyms. One of the solutions was to link the name of the artist to his place of birth as well as his connection to an ethnic group or a family or a clan.After a global market study focusing mainly on incoming requests from future clients  we calculated that the entry price for a license to use the index of Artprice's Standardized Database of 803 000 Artists  will be around ‚Ç¨7 500 per year  i.e. a monthly charge of ‚Ç¨625  which makes this operating license very affordable for small or recently-established structures.Of course  this annual operating license ‚Äì limited to the Standardized Index of Artists  does not in any way compete with Artprice or its multiple databases  as is contractually agreed with the licensee. This operating license uses an Application Programming Interface (API) provided by Artprice to connect software (or a website) to Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists.If the licensee notices that its customers request  for example  the price of works for past or future sales  indices and statistics on an artist  monograms and signatures  or any other information held by Artprice's databases  it may ask the Artprice licensor for a return API (re-routing/affiliation contract) to Artprice's paid databases where the licensee receives between 5 and 20% commission depending on the turnover achieved with Artprice on an annual subscription contracted on Artprice by Artmarket payment platforms. This allows Artprice to collect ‚Ç¨7 500/year on the one hand  and on the other hand  to greatly increase its turnover via its many licensees.Future events HI 2023: at the beginning of March Artprice will deploy its most sophisticated version of Artprice.com that will  among other things  initiate a complete change in our business model. Henceforward  our website will integrate paid advertisers into our databases and services and our Artist pages and Web 3.0.At the beginning of March 2023  Artprice by Artmarket will deploy the latest and most sophisticated version of its website in response to the numerous requests from its customers  which reflects the growth and expansion of its digital footprints. After 18 months of development  partly extended by the Covid  this large-scale deployment will affect all of Artprice's databases and services.To develop this latest version of our website  Artprice by Artmarket submitted a call for tenders at the end of 2019 and finally selected a team of very qualified and passionate external consultants to conduct an analysis followed by the development of a complete overhaul of Artprice.com. The whole process was based on a solid ‚Äòuser interface' (UI) and ‚Äòuser experience' approach  which  as their labels suggest  means that our entire website has been redesigned with an acute focus on making it easier for the user.At its core  the new website will include a very substantial change in our business model  since paying advertisers will be fully integrated into our databases and services. These advertisers are mainly the 6 500 auction houses worldwide  affiliated with Artprice for more than two decades and which now conduct 98% of their sales online. They will now  in paying advertiser mode  be able to highlight their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  depending on the search criteria of Artprice's 7.2 million customers.It should be noted that for the past half a century  the economic models of auction houses have always allocated roughly 34% of their overall costs to advertising (usually announcing details of upcoming public sales)  regardless of the country they operate in or the size of the auction house.Since auctions are now 98% advertised online  the pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2023 to promote their sales for a fee has found its best response with this new deployment. Indeed  the auction houses now believe that their communication budgets for future sales (34% of their estimated value) must be focused online  rather than on the printed media.In the past Artprice always considered online advertising to be incompatible with its databases in terms of readability and reputation. We have therefore done everything we can to satisfy demand from the auction houses while maintaining Artprice's original DNA.On the new version of the site  the 6 500 auction houses will be able to merge into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket by advertising their future sales and pushing the ‚Äúfollowed‚Äù artists selected by the 7.2 million Artprice customers and members (alerts by SMS  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  ‚Äúmy artists‚Äù page  etc.).Since 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population to facilitate development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable  and above all contextualized data.Indeed  Artprice by Artmarket's clients and members will intuitively dive into the heart of art market news and will be privileged players within a human and educational approach  which is often lacking in the world of GAFAs.Moreover  Artprice's essential and historic collaborations as World Leader in Art Market Information will become even more apparent in this new version  mainly via contributions from individual artists who have participated in this evolution.The auction houses that have been our historical partners are  of course  the other essential collaboration. Indeed  their interest in collaborating with Artprice can only increase as they highlight their future sales with discreet and effective prestige  which will ‚Äì in turn ‚Äì generate additional recurring income for Artprice via its proprietary Intranet (the primary working tool for auction houses for many years).It is quite possible that the advertising revenue generated by these 6 500 auction houses (affiliated with Artprice since 1997) will ultimately generate more income than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice's turnover. As mentioned earlier  Artprice has a clear ambition to double its turnover and  again  this initiative is a direct result of long-standing requests from our partner auction houses.In sum  after more than two years of R&D (extended by the Covid crisis)  Artprice by Artmarket is proud to be able fully to engage Artmarket.com customers  partners  and members in a new experience at the heart of the art market.This is undoubtedly one of the founding stones for the future of Artprice by Artmarket  with a fundamentally improved positioning via the referencing of images on search engines  the objective of increasing traffic to conquer new market share and to corner the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs.Thanks to Google Analytics 4  the latest generation of Analytics  the ‚ÄúCrawl budget‚Äù  a combination of Google's ‚Äúcrawl rate‚Äù and ‚Äúcrawl demand‚Äù  increased from 915 000 requests/day to a new average of 2.5 million/day since the deployment of Artprice's 803 000 Artist homepages at the end of 2022.Through this deployment  Artprice has not only remained faithful to its principle of maintaining the readability of its databases but has also responded (at last) to the continual requests from its 6 500 affiliated Auction Houses around the world to have access to paid advertisements to enhance their future sales.Since January 2023  a complete UI//UX overhaul of Artists Pages and our Web 3.0/Art NFTs allowed greater global visibility for the 803 000 artists on Artprice by Artmarket.Artmarket.com has implemented a substantial tariff increase for its subscriptions and services since the beginning of 2023. These increases will generate an increase in future income. Artmarket.com was already profitable for a decade  and the additional revenue will translate almost entirely into net income since we will still be below the ‚Ç¨90 million euros p.a. tax bracket.This tariff increase follows extensive consultation with Artprice by Artmarket customers who will continue to benefit from our databases and services  well aware that they find essential data in Artprice that they cannot find elsewhere. Enriched by over a million ultra-qualified new data every year  our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997  must now be properly and systematically monetized.Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most exhaustive in the world and this is recognized by a broad consensus of art market operators. It covers nearly 803 000 artists  all referenced with their biographies  auction results  market indices  decision-making help tools  signatures & monograms  and future sales  alongside historical information and contemporary  cultural  and market news. In total  our databases contain several tens of millions of data inputs and their combination and exploitation by our teams means that the sum of the parts is infinitely more valuable  and the whole system is protected by various intellectual property rights.Despite this substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best value compared to the offer by our competitors who have not managed to evolve and offer subscriptions with limited searches: annual professional subscriptions from the competition for 150 searches ‚Ç¨350/year  or 450 searches ‚Ç¨975/year  and  in the event of an overrun  ‚Ç¨2.45/request (as noted by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In a world of ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competition's offer is based on data of only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 803 000 artists and 6 500 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from ‚Ç¨279 to ‚Ç¨569/year  including a range of indices  decision-making tools  and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world. Indeed  Artprice would still be very competitive at substantially higher prices.Surprisingly ‚Äì given the geopolitical and economic context ‚Äì the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods during recent sales sessions  regardless of the country. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023  which are the main indicators of the art market's health.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100¬© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market. For information  the Artprice100¬© index has increased by 612% since 2000. For the year 2022  the S&P index posted a contraction of -19% versus +3% for the Artprice100¬©.In our upcoming Global Art Market Report  we plan to present a truly global analysis of the art market's activities in 2022. This report is scheduled for publication in early March 2023. It will be available free of charge online and in PDF version. The AFP will publish it first.It is clear that war in Eastern Europe and the fears of a global recession have not depressed the art market at the start of this year.At the end of 2022  the AFP posted an article with the evocative title ‚ÄúThe collection of Microsoft co-founder aims for a billion-dollar auction total in New York‚Äù and added ‚ÄúWith the late Paul G Allen's collection  Christie's is aiming for a historic art auction record  symbol of a market that is surging ahead despite a world shaken by crises.‚ÄùOur new version of Artists Homepages bolsters the primary and preferred entry points to all of Artprice's databases and services because artists are indeed the foundation on which the art market has been based since its origin. With this major overhaul  Artprice also aims to reposition artists at the heart of the art market via the production of Art NFTs  which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.The major overhaul of Artprice.com aims to provide its customers and members with a better experience  more in line with their needs. It has been implemented after several years of collecting and analyzing their needs in strict compliance with the legislation in force in Europe and the USA.The overhaul naturally integrates the arrival of Art NFTs  whose growth is exponential and which also constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's principal market-makers  including the majority of the auction houses around the world  now have NFT departments for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum industry and art galleries sphere are starting to publish their own NFTs.In addition  the major overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com finally highlights the largest proprietary collection of original manuscripts and sales catalogs printed since 1700. Owned and collected by Artprice over the last three decades  this collection acts as the fundamental core of Artprice's digital standardization of the art market and legitimizes its position as Global Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years.After the overhaul of our Artists Homepages  Artprice customers and prospects will have access to several centuries of knowledge organized over 25 years by Artprice's historians and editors. Access to this historical information has been structured in a perfectly intuitive and natural way so that users can immerse themselves in the exceptional and complex history of the art market.These new pages highlight the wealth and depth of Artmarket.com's databases and services  offering a high level of added value. The use of algorithmic AI allows access to highly relevant and personalized recommendations  allowing users to deepen their knowledge of the art market and ultimately generating more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore greater business revenue.This feature also brings Artprice by Artmarket clients and members fully into the Web 3.0 and Art NFTs sphere  giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.Ahead of our major rollout in December 2022  Artprice has listened carefully to both its historical customers and its new customers and prospects.Indeed  with cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. Accustomed to speculation and risk-taking  art enthusiasts and collectors nonetheless  have no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe.Having frequently used the services of Artprice  they have become new clients for Artmarket.com  but they made it clear they needed art prices to be added in both ETH and BTC throughout the entire Artprice databases. This major addition to our platform was completed at the end of 2022.The ultra-targeted digital campaigns on Twitter demonstrate through their returns (3 to 5%) that these new buyers respond with high-end Artprice subscriptions.In addition  Artmarket.com is pleased to have given historical preference to Ethereum which  via an operation baptized ‚ÄúThe Merge‚Äù on 15 September 2022  converted in entire blockchain from a Proof-of-work (PoW) type consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) type mechanism to move to a more environmentally friendly system.According to the Ethereum Foundation  this move was followed by an immediate drop in the total energy consumption of the Ethereum network by 99.9%.Thus  to foster the exchange and sale of Art NFTs on its Marketplace  and given the energy context  Artprice's choice for the Ethereum blockchain is fully in line with the ambitions expressed by France's Minister for the Economy  Bruno Le Maire  as announced in a previous press release:www.actusnews.com/fr/artmarket/cp/2022/10/20/artmarket_com-deja-positionnee-sur-les-nfts-avec-artprice-reagit-a-l_itw-de-bruno-le-maire-donnee-a-bfm-crypto-voulant-faire-deThis week  the French-language weekly business magazine has headlined its February issue (772) with the following title: ‚ÄúWhat if Ethereum had the keys to blockchain success? Experiencing rapid growth  the decentralized cryptocurrency platform presents itself as one of the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù options in the sector. A strategy that is convincing more and more investors and institutions‚Äù.thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com emphasizes: ""In its various annual reports on the Art Market and its regulated information it publishes as a listed company  Artprice by Artmarket.com has always said concerning NFTs that it is impossible to apprehend this new market without a perfect knowledge of the relevant Monetary & Financial Codes and Intellectual Property Codes of the countries in which the market is operating. Similarly  to appreciate the nature of this market (experiencing exponential growth)  one also needs a true understanding of Blockchain  cryptocurrencies  and their cultural origins among the Cypherpunks (period of PGP-type data encryption at the beginning of 1990)‚ÄùThese regulations have been the subject of studies  colloquia  and proposals to major French and European government bodies by Blanche Sousi and the Art & Law Institute  with whom Artprice by Artmarket has been heavily involved as a long-standing member since 1997.2023: more than ever  Artprice's eco-responsible philosophy must set an example in the world of data centers.According to thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice:‚ÄúArtprice by Artmarket.com has patiently and methodically given itself all the means to evolve in response to the needs of Art Market professionals. All the indicators are positive for the future and we project a doubling of revenue  notably by opening up to paying advertisers integrated into our services and databasesWe have also developed  since 2017  processes to optimize the use of our servers  by limiting the power required and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers by 40%. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energiesThrough its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies concerning new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ‚Äúformativity‚Äù (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a ‚Äòclimatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Server Group  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and which is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture  and the sentiments of our customers.Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

The figure‚Ä¶,"PARIS  Feb. 9  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- After posting good revenue figures for 4Q 2022  we are proud to say that Artprice by Artmarket has got off to a dynamic start to 2023 with January's turnover showing a 17% increase versus the year-earlier period.The figures show that since the start of 2023  Artmarket.com has been gaining market share with new customers despite the uncertain economic context stemming from very unpredictable geopolitical parameters and an inflationary dynamic that poses significant challenges for central banks  particularly for the ECB and the FED.Artprice took advantage of the Covid period to develop and deploy the most significant modification in its history  leading to a change in its business model with paying advertisers fully integrated into its databases and services. These advertisers are essentially the 6 500 Auction Houses around the world that have been affiliated with Artprice for more than two decades and today conduct 98% of their sales online.It is quite possible that the turnover generated by these 6 500 auction houses will ultimately generate more turnover than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice by Artmarket.com's turnover. By effectively responding to a long-standing request from its partner auction houses  Artprice believes it can double its turnover. A second major change in our business model relates to our decision to license our Standardized Database of Artists  today the most comprehensive in the world.Future events in 2023: annual licensing of Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists  with an entry price of ‚Ç¨7 500 per yearIn recent years  Artprice by Artmarket  which owns the largest known editorial collection of manuscripts and catalogs from 1700 to the present day (a current asset with an estimated value of ‚Ç¨16.257 million in Artprice by Artmarket.com's balance sheet)  has developed the most comprehensive database of artists in the world.At Artprice by Artmarket  we never forget that artists are what the art market revolves around; they are its primary and unique motor  and all the news  exhibitions  auctions  galleries  museums  biennials  fairs  and shows evolve around them. In short  none of it could exist without the artist.Each Artist page is created within the framework of a standardized editorial charter and a set of processes protected under France's Intellectual Property Laws  with a biography supported by certified documents from the artist and/or his/her beneficiaries that are deposited in Artprice's physical archives.Each analog/digital record has 140 referential integrity fields which are themselves relational databases.Each Artist page includes details about their various disciplines and artistic techniques  their past auction results (with photographs of the works)  their upcoming sales  their signatures and monograms  an indication of any catalog raisonn√© and/or reference work  their annual auction turnover  their auction records  the geographical distribution of their sales  their key market indices  their unsold rates  as well as all articles or dispatches from Artprice's press agency ""ArtMarket Insight"" written about the artist.This allows Artprice to attribute each artist with a dedicated ID (like a business identification code) and for each of his/her works  another specific ID (like a vehicle registration document) and to 'standardize' the art market to ensure reliable traceability  accurate indices  and comprehensive monitoring. These unique and rigorous processes are subject to multiple protection mechanisms under France's Intellectual Property Laws.A single Artist Log costs on average 270‚Ç¨ to 300‚Ç¨ to create  and  despite ultra-powerful computing  it requires human validation by a committee of editors and translation into the six languages of the Artprice databases  namely English  French  Spanish  German  Italian and Mandarin.In 25 years  the Artprice Artist Database has established itself as the leading standardized global database in terms of the number of artists it covers  but also in terms of the volume of information per Artist entry.To date  the only reference we have retained is the Benezit Dictionary  created in 1911 in Paris and which Artprice tried to acquire from √âditions Gr√ºnd in the early 2000s.At the time  Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists included 120 000 artists while the Benezit had 175 000. The latter was therefore the de facto global reference by its sheer number of artists. Despite a very substantial financial proposal from Artprice  the Benezit was finally sold to Oxford Art Online (see our registration document and financial report).In 2023  the online Benezit  in English  has 170 000 artists and a subscription entry cost of ¬£215 per year.Artprice's standardized artists' database now totals 803 000 artists from the 4th century to the present day  in six languages.The overall cost associated with successfully building the most comprehensive Standardized Database of Artists in the world also includes the cost of acquiring legendary companies and documentary collections such as the Enrique Mayer Guide (1962/1987)  the famous Dictionary of Art Sales by Doctor H. Mireur 1700-1900  the American leader Sound View Press with nearly 50 databases on the USA including the famous biographical collection Who Was Who in American Art (1991)  Editions Franck Van Wilder (1970)  the Swiss company Xylogic (world specialist in Art Market indices since 1985)  the Bayer Database on the Anglo-Saxon Art Market from 1700 to 1913  Signatures and Monogrammes by Caplan & Creps (USA)  a global reference work (1976)  and a whole host of other works and records.Indeed  over the past 25 years  we at Artprice have pursued a systematic policy of purchasing all manuscripts and catalogs  mainly from 1700 to 1970  from all over the world. The acquisition of this historical knowledge was an unavoidable process in ensuring that Artprice could standardize the art market with certainty and know the perfect traceability of works of art and their correct attributions.In the 20th century  the Benezit was the major reference  the Bible of the Art Market according to Le Monde newspaper. To date  it is the only serious financial and analytical referent for Artprice  notably because of its use of a comparative methodology.Nevertheless  the 803 000 artists in Artprice's Standardized Database represent a volume 472% greater than that of the Benezit Oxford University Press Dictionary (170 000 artists)  with access in six languages for Artprice compared with just one language for the Benezit.For Artprice  the total present-day cost in 2023 of building the most exhaustive database of artists in the world is 216 million euros (see paragraph on analytical cost). Despite being an asset in permanent growth  under International Financial Reporting Standards  the valuation of such a perennial asset is recognized in Artprice by Artmarket.com balance sheets at only a fraction of its real value (IFRS have been adopted since 2005 to harmonize the presentation of listed companies' financial and accounting statements).Indeed  the creation of the index for Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists was an extremely complex operation involving seven million hours of work by historians  researchers  editors  journalists  econometricians  and a dedicated IT department over 25 years.Now that it exists  Artprice by Artmarket is constantly being asked for licenses to use its Standardized Database of Artists  mainly by the tens of thousands of online galleries  marketplaces  Auction Houses  Experts  online auction sites  copyright companies  customs  and tax authorities  museums foundations and insurance companies that operate in this segment  but without an exhaustive standardized database of artists.Many of these players are prone to making regular attribution errors - as they themselves admit - and for the small or recently established structures  their survival depends on access to a standardized and consistent Database of Artists over the centuries.One of the main difficulties is having  on the one hand  a massive collection of auction catalogs and manuscripts  and on the other hand  proprietary algorithms that can track down and identify the numerous homonyms that exist in the field of art.Indeed  art history is full of homonyms. One of the solutions was to link the name of the artist to his place of birth as well as his connection to an ethnic group or a family or a clan.After a global market study focusing mainly on incoming requests from future clients  we calculated that the entry price for a license to use the index of Artprice's Standardized Database of 803 000 Artists  will be around ‚Ç¨7 500 per year  i.e. a monthly charge of ‚Ç¨625  which makes this operating license very affordable for small or recently-established structures.Of course  this annual operating license ‚Äì limited to the Standardized Index of Artists  does not in any way compete with Artprice or its multiple databases  as is contractually agreed with the licensee. This operating license uses an Application Programming Interface (API) provided by Artprice to connect software (or a website) to Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists.If the licensee notices that its customers request  for example  the price of works for past or future sales  indices and statistics on an artist  monograms and signatures  or any other information held by Artprice's databases  it may ask the Artprice licensor for a return API (re-routing/affiliation contract) to Artprice's paid databases where the licensee receives between 5 and 20% commission depending on the turnover achieved with Artprice on an annual subscription contracted on Artprice by Artmarket payment platforms. This allows Artprice to collect ‚Ç¨7 500/year on the one hand  and on the other hand  to greatly increase its turnover via its many licensees.Future events HI 2023: at the beginning of March Artprice will deploy its most sophisticated version of Artprice.com that will  among other things  initiate a complete change in our business model. Henceforward  our website will integrate paid advertisers into our databases and services and our Artist pages and Web 3.0.At the beginning of March 2023  Artprice by Artmarket will deploy the latest and most sophisticated version of its website in response to the numerous requests from its customers  which reflects the growth and expansion of its digital footprints. After 18 months of development  partly extended by the Covid  this large-scale deployment will affect all of Artprice's databases and services.To develop this latest version of our website  Artprice by Artmarket submitted a call for tenders at the end of 2019 and finally selected a team of very qualified and passionate external consultants to conduct an analysis followed by the development of a complete overhaul of Artprice.com. The whole process was based on a solid 'user interface' (UI) and 'user experience' approach  which  as their labels suggest  means that our entire website has been redesigned with an acute focus on making it easier for the user.At its core  the new website will include a very substantial change in our business model  since paying advertisers will be fully integrated into our databases and services. These advertisers are mainly the 6 500 auction houses worldwide  affiliated with Artprice for more than two decades and which now conduct 98% of their sales online. They will now  in paying advertiser mode  be able to highlight their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  depending on the search criteria of Artprice's 7.2 million customers.It should be noted that for the past half a century  the economic models of auction houses have always allocated roughly 34% of their overall costs to advertising (usually announcing details of upcoming public sales)  regardless of the country they operate in or the size of the auction house.Since auctions are now 98% advertised online  the pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2023 to promote their sales for a fee has found its best response with this new deployment. Indeed  the auction houses now believe that their communication budgets for future sales (34% of their estimated value) must be focused online  rather than on the printed media.In the past Artprice always considered online advertising to be incompatible with its databases in terms of readability and reputation. We have therefore done everything we can to satisfy demand from the auction houses while maintaining Artprice's original DNA.On the new version of the site  the 6 500 auction houses will be able to merge into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket by advertising their future sales and pushing the ""followed"" artists selected by the 7.2 million Artprice customers and members (alerts by SMS  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  ""my artists"" page  etc.).Since 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population to facilitate development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable  and above all contextualized data.Indeed  Artprice by Artmarket's clients and members will intuitively dive into the heart of art market news and will be privileged players within a human and educational approach  which is often lacking in the world of GAFAs.Moreover  Artprice's essential and historic collaborations as World Leader in Art Market Information will become even more apparent in this new version  mainly via contributions from individual artists who have participated in this evolution.The auction houses that have been our historical partners are  of course  the other essential collaboration. Indeed  their interest in collaborating with Artprice can only increase as they highlight their future sales with discreet and effective prestige  which will ‚Äì in turn ‚Äì generate additional recurring income for Artprice via its proprietary Intranet (the primary working tool for auction houses for many years).It is quite possible that the advertising revenue generated by these 6 500 auction houses (affiliated with Artprice since 1997) will ultimately generate more income than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice's turnover. As mentioned earlier  Artprice has a clear ambition to double its turnover and  again  this initiative is a direct result of long-standing requests from our partner auction houses.In sum  after more than two years of R&D (extended by the Covid crisis)  Artprice by Artmarket is proud to be able fully to engage Artmarket.com customers  partners  and members in a new experience at the heart of the art market.This is undoubtedly one of the founding stones for the future of Artprice by Artmarket  with a fundamentally improved positioning via the referencing of images on search engines  the objective of increasing traffic to conquer new market share and to corner the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs.Thanks to Google Analytics 4  the latest generation of Analytics  the ""Crawl budget""  a combination of Google's ""crawl rate"" and ""crawl demand""  increased from 915 000 requests/day to a new average of 2.5 million/day since the deployment of Artprice's 803 000 Artist homepages at the end of 2022.Through this deployment  Artprice has not only remained faithful to its principle of maintaining the readability of its databases but has also responded (at last) to the continual requests from its 6 500 affiliated Auction Houses around the world to have access to paid advertisements to enhance their future sales.Since January 2023  a complete UI//UX overhaul of Artists P ages and our Web 3.0/Art NFTs allowed greater global visibility for the 803 000 artists on Artprice by Artmarket.Artmarket.com has implemented a substantial tariff increase for its subscriptions and services since the beginning of 2023. These increases will generate an increase in future income. Artmarket.com was already profitable for a decade  and the additional revenue will translate almost entirely into net income since we will still be below the ‚Ç¨90 million euros p.a. tax bracket.This tariff increase follows extensive consultation with Artprice by Artmarket customers who will continue to benefit from our databases and services  well aware that they find essential data in Artprice that they cannot find elsewhere. Enriched by over a million ultra-qualified new data every year  our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997  must now be properly and systematically monetized.Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most exhaustive in the world and this is recognized by a broad consensus of art market operators. It covers nearly 803 000 artists  all referenced with their biographies  auction results  market indices  decision-making help tools  signatures & monograms  and future sales  alongside historical information and contemporary  cultural  and market news. In total  our databases contain several tens of millions of data inputs and their combination and exploitation by our teams means that the sum of the parts is infinitely more valuable  and the whole system is protected by various intellectual property rights.Despite this substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best value compared to the offer by our competitors who have not managed to evolve and offer subscriptions with limited searches: annual professional subscriptions from the competition for 150 searches ‚Ç¨350/year  or 450 searches ‚Ç¨975/year  and  in the event of an overrun  ‚Ç¨2.45/request (as noted by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In a world of ""unlimited"" offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competition's offer is based on data of only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 803 000 artists and 6 500 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from ‚Ç¨279 to ‚Ç¨569/year  including a range of indices  decision-making tools  and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world. Indeed  Artprice would still be very competitive at substantially higher prices.Surprisingly ‚Äì given the geopolitical and economic context ‚Äì the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods during recent sales sessions  regardless of the country. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023  which are the main indicators of the art market's health.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100¬© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market. For information  the Artprice100¬© index has increased by 612% since 2000. For the year 2022  the S&P index posted a contraction of -19% versus +3% for the Artprice100¬©.In our upcoming Global Art Market Report  we plan to present a truly global analysis of the art market's activities in 2022. This report is scheduled for publication in early March 2023. It will be available free of charge online and in PDF version. The AFP will publish it first.It is clear that war in Eastern Europe and the fears of a global recession have not depressed the art market at the start of this year.At the end of 2022  the AFP posted an article with the evocative title ""The collection of Microsoft co-founder aims for a billion-dollar auction total in New York"" and added ""With the late Paul G Allen's collection  Christie's is aiming for a historic art auction record  symbol of a market that is surging ahead despite a world shaken by crises.""Our new version of Artists Homepages bolsters the primary and preferred entry points to all of Artprice's databases and services because artists are indeed the foundation on which the art market has been based since its origin. With this major overhaul  Artprice also aims to reposition artists at the heart of the art market via the production of Art NFTs  which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.The major overhaul of Artprice.com aims to provide its customers and members with a better experience  more in line with their needs. It has been implemented after several years of collecting and analyzing their needs in strict compliance with the legislation in force in Europe and the USA.The overhaul naturally integrates the arrival of Art NFTs  whose growth is exponential and which also constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's principal market-makers  including the majority of the auction houses around the world  now have NFT departments for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum industry and art galleries sphere are starting to publish their own NFTs.In addition  the major overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com finally highlights the largest proprietary collection of original manuscripts and sales catalogs printed since 1700. Owned and collected by Artprice over the last three decades  this collection acts as the fundamental core of Artprice's digital standardization of the art market and legitimizes its position as Global Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years.After the overhaul of our Artists Homepages  Artprice customers and prospects will have access to several centuries of knowledge organized over 25 years by Artprice's historians and editors. Access to this historical information has been structured in a perfectly intuitive and natural way so that users can immerse themselves in the exceptional and complex history of the art market.These new pages highlight the wealth and depth of Artmarket.com's databases and services  offering a high level of added value. The use of algorithmic AI allows access to highly relevant and personalized recommendations  allowing users to deepen their knowledge of the art market and ultimately generating more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore greater business revenue.This feature also brings Artprice by Artmarket clients and members fully into the Web 3.0 and Art NFTs sphere  giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.Ahead of our major rollout in December 2022  Artprice has listened carefully to both its historical customers and its new customers and prospects.Indeed  with cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. Accustomed to speculation and risk-taking  art enthusiasts and collectors nonetheless  have no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe.Having frequently used the services of Artprice  they have become new clients for Artmarket.com  but they made it clear they needed art prices to be added in both ETH and BTC throughout the entire Artprice databases. This major addition to our platform was completed at the end of 2022.The ultra-targeted digital campaigns on Twitter demonstrate through their returns (3 to 5%) that these new buyers respond with high-end Artprice subscriptions.In addition  Artmarket.com is pleased to have given historical preference to Ethereum which  via an operation baptized ""The Merge"" on 15 September 2022  converted in entire blockchain from a Proof-of-work (PoW) type consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) type mechanism to move to a more environmentally friendly system.According to the Ethereum Foundation  this move was followed by an immediate drop in the total energy consumption of the Ethereum network by 99.9%.Thus  to foster the exchange and sale of Art NFTs on its Marketplace  and given the energy context  Artprice's choice for the Ethereum blockchain is fully in line with the ambitions expressed by France's Minister for the Economy  Bruno Le Maire  as announced in a previous press release:www.actusnews.com/fr/artmarket/cp/2022/10/20/artmarket_com-deja-positionnee-sur-les-nfts-avec-artprice-reagit-a-l_itw-de-bruno-le-maire-donnee-a-bfm-crypto-voulant-faire-deThis week  the French-language weekly business magazine has headlined its February issue (772) with the following title: ""What if Ethereum had the keys to blockchain success? Experiencing rapid growth  the decentralized cryptocurrency platform presents itself as one of the ""green"" options in the sector. A strategy that is convincing more and more investors and institutions"".thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com emphasizes: ""In its various annual reports on the Art Market and its regulated information it publishes as a listed company  Artprice by Artmarket.com has always said concerning NFTs that it is impossible to apprehend this new market without a perfect knowledge of the relevant Monetary & Financial Codes and Intellectual Property Codes of the countries in which the market is operating. Similarly  to appreciate the nature of this market (experiencing exponential growth)  one also needs a true understanding of Blockchain  cryptocurrencies  and their cultural origins among the Cypherpunks (period of PGP-type data encryption at the beginning of 1990)""These regulations have been the subject of studies  colloquia  and proposals to major French and European government bodies by Blanche Sousi and the Art & Law Institute  with whom Artprice by Artmarket has been heavily involved as a long-standing member since 1997.2023: more than ever  Artprice's eco-responsible philosophy must set an example in the world of data centers.According to thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice:""Artprice by Artmarket.com has patiently and methodically given itself all the means to evolve in response to the needs of Art Market professionals. All the indicators are positive for the future and we project a doubling of revenue  notably by opening up to paying advertisers integrated into our services and databasesWe have also developed  since 2017  processes to optimize the use of our servers  by limiting the power required and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers by 40%. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energiesThrough its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies concerning new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ""formativity"" (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a 'climatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Server Group  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and which is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture  and the sentiments of our customers.Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comfor your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.com Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Trading revenue grew to ‚Ç¨514.1 million (-0.8% pro forma  +10.5% reported). FX and power trading reported strong performances. The softer environment for cash trading volumes from the second semester of 2022 was offset by efficient management of yield and an uptick in market share from October 2022. Post-trade revenue (excluding NTI) grew to ‚Ç¨364.5 million (+1.5 % pro forma  +13.7% reported). Custody and Settlement revenue was ‚Ç¨243.1 million (stable pro forma  +10.9% reported) thanks to the diversified Euronext Securities business model as settlement activity stabilised. Clearing revenue increased to ‚Ç¨121.4 million (+4.5% pro forma  +19.7% reported) mainly as a result of the consolidation of revenue from Euronext Clearing (acquired on 29 April 2021) and improved product mix.

In 2022  Euronext remained the leading venue for equity listing in Europe  recording 83 new equity listings  and the leading venue for debt listing globally. Advanced Data Services revenue grew to ‚Ç¨212.1 million (+4.8% pro forma  +15.5% reported)  driven by the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group and a strong performance of both real-time and non real-time data businesses.Adjusted EBITDA 3 was at ‚Ç¨ 861.6 million ( +‚Ç¨90.6 million   -1.2 % pro forma  +11. 7 % reported ) reflecting continued cost disciplin e despite strong inflationary pressure .

The slight increase in costs only results from costs related to non-volume related revenue growth initiatives. Savings and synergies entirely compensate inflation and business development costs.Status update on synergies in relation to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition : ‚Ç¨ 34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies were achieved at the end of Q4 2022  thanks to restructuring efforts and the migration of the Core Data Centre. ‚Ç¨9.7 million run-rate annual synergies were delivered in Q4 2022. ‚Ç¨44.2 million of cumulated implementation costs incurred at the end of Q4 2022  of which ‚Ç¨6.3 million during Q4 2022.Next steps in the deployment of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan : Euronext upgrades its 2024 annual run - rate pre - tax synergies related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group by ‚Ç¨ 15 millon to ‚Ç¨ 115 million . Implementation costs remain unchanged. Euronext confirmed the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets onto Optiq ¬Æ in March 2023  forming the first phase of the migration  and of Borsa Italiana other markets in Q4 2023 allowing for termination of the third-party provider trading platform contract. Euronext confirmed the phases in the expansion of Euronext Clearing with the expected launch of the equity clearing offering by the end of 2023 and of derivative clearing by Q3 2024. These strategic projects are expected to reach around ‚Ç¨ 7 0 million of cumulated run-rate synergies by the end of 2023  out of the ‚Ç¨115 million targeted. In 2023  Euronext expects to maintain for cash trading an average market share greater or equal to 63%   and revenue capture a round 0.5 2 bps following the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq ¬Æ   considering current market conditions and orders size.Key achievement in the deployment of the ‚Äò Fit for 1.5 ¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy in 2022 : Euronext‚Äôs upgraded SBTi-aligned climate targets were validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative: By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based greenhouse gas emissions by 73.5% compared to 2020; By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 3 business travel emissions by at least 46.2% compared to 2019; By 2027  Euronext suppliers  representing 72% of Euronext‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions derived from purchased goods and services  must set targets on their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.The Group‚Äôs efforts to enhance diversity were recognised through the inclusion of Euronext into the Euronext Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Euronext Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices.St√©phane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:‚ÄúIn 2022  Euronext reached record revenue and income above ‚Ç¨1.4 billion notably resulting from the strong performance of our non-volume related activities  together with efficient management of revenue capture and of cash trading market share. Thanks to our trademark cost discipline  we beat our 2022 revised costs guidance. We achieved an adjusted EBITDA of ‚Ç¨861.6 million that translated into an adjusted EPS of ‚Ç¨5.21. We will propose a total dividend of ‚Ç¨236.6 million at our next annual general meeting to be held in May 2023  representing 50% of our reported net income  excluding NTI loss impact.This year has been crucial in laying the foundations for the future growth of the Group. We have successfully completed the first major milestone of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan with the migration of our Core Data Centre from the UK to Italy. At the end of 2022  we have achieved ‚Ç¨34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies related to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.This fruitful year paves the way for the next steps to be delivered in 2023. The largest single liquidity pool in Europe  operated by Euronext will significantly change dimension with the migration of Italian cash markets to Euronext‚Äôs state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq¬Æ  which will benefit local and global trading members.Euronext Clearing will become the Euronext equity clearing house of choice by the end of 2023  and the CCP for derivatives clearing in Q3 2024. These are the critical bricks to complete our presence across the integrated value chain  allowing us to innovate and shape capital markets in line with evolving client needs  and making Euronext even stronger to deliver future growth.In an inflationary environment  we will contain our costs to a slight increase in 2023  at ‚Ç¨630 million  demonstrating Euronext‚Äôs ability to maintain its cost discipline while investing to generate revenue expansion of our non-volume related activities. We expect to deliver by the end of 2023 around ‚Ç¨70 million of the synergies targeted as part of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan. Our good progress on integration led us to upgrade the total amount of targeted run-rate EBITDA synergies by the end of 2024 from ‚Ç¨100 million to ‚Ç¨115 million. This further demonstrates Euronext‚Äôs successful track record in integrating acquired companies.Our strong performance  combined with the successful ongoing delivery of the planned synergies  is supporting our deleveraging trajectory with a net debt to EBITDA ratio at 2.6x  well below 3.2x at the time of closing of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition. This leaves the Group with flexibility to further deploy capital in value generating opportunities that might arise.Lastly  we are happy to see that our ‚ÄòFit for 1.5¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy is bearing fruit  as our upgraded emission reduction targets have been validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative. We are pleased to see Euronext being included in both the Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices  demonstrating the progress we are making in striving towards more equality.‚ÄùEuronext Q4 and full year 2022 financial performanceFull year 20226In ‚Ç¨m  unless stated otherwiseThe figures in this document have not been audited or reviewed by our external auditor.

Trading revenue grew to ‚Ç¨514.1 million (-0.8% pro forma  +10.5% reported). FX and power trading reported strong performances. The softer environment for cash trading volumes from the second semester of 2022 was offset by efficient management of yield and an uptick in market share from October 2022. Post-trade revenue (excluding NTI) grew to ‚Ç¨364.5 million (+1.5 % pro forma  +13.7% reported). Custody and Settlement revenue was ‚Ç¨243.1 million (stable pro forma  +10.9% reported) thanks to the diversified Euronext Securities business model as settlement activity stabilised. Clearing revenue increased to ‚Ç¨121.4 million (+4.5% pro forma  +19.7% reported) mainly as a result of the consolidation of revenue from Euronext Clearing (acquired on 29 April 2021) and improved product mix.

In 2022  Euronext remained the leading venue for equity listing in Europe  recording 83 new equity listings  and the leading venue for debt listing globally. Advanced Data Services revenue grew to ‚Ç¨212.1 million (+4.8% pro forma  +15.5% reported)  driven by the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group and a strong performance of both real-time and non real-time data businesses.Adjusted EBITDA 3 was at ‚Ç¨ 861.6 million ( +‚Ç¨90.6 million   -1.2 % pro forma  +11. 7 % reported ) reflecting continued cost disciplin e despite strong inflationary pressure .

The slight increase in costs only results from costs related to non-volume related revenue growth initiatives. Savings and synergies entirely compensate inflation and business development costs.Status update on synergies in relation to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition : ‚Ç¨ 34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies were achieved at the end of Q4 2022  thanks to restructuring efforts and the migration of the Core Data Centre. ‚Ç¨9.7 million run-rate annual synergies were delivered in Q4 2022. ‚Ç¨44.2 million of cumulated implementation costs incurred at the end of Q4 2022  of which ‚Ç¨6.3 million during Q4 2022.Next steps in the deployment of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan : Euronext upgrades its 2024 annual run - rate pre - tax synergies related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group by ‚Ç¨ 15 millon to ‚Ç¨ 115 million . Implementation costs remain unchanged. Euronext confirmed the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets onto Optiq ¬Æ in March 2023  forming the first phase of the migration  and of Borsa Italiana other markets in Q4 2023 allowing for termination of the third-party provider trading platform contract. Euronext confirmed the phases in the expansion of Euronext Clearing with the expected launch of the equity clearing offering by the end of 2023 and of derivative clearing by Q3 2024. These strategic projects are expected to reach around ‚Ç¨ 7 0 million of cumulated run-rate synergies by the end of 2023  out of the ‚Ç¨115 million targeted. In 2023  Euronext expects to maintain for cash trading an average market share greater or equal to 63%   and revenue capture a round 0.5 2 bps following the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq ¬Æ   considering current market conditions and orders size.Key achievement in the deployment of the ‚Äò Fit for 1.5 ¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy in 2022 : Euronext‚Äôs upgraded SBTi-aligned climate targets were validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative: By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based greenhouse gas emissions by 73.5% compared to 2020; By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 3 business travel emissions by at least 46.2% compared to 2019; By 2027  Euronext suppliers  representing 72% of Euronext‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions derived from purchased goods and services  must set targets on their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.The Group‚Äôs efforts to enhance diversity were recognised through the inclusion of Euronext into the Euronext Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Euronext Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices.St√©phane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said: ‚ÄúIn 2022  Euronext reached record revenue and income above ‚Ç¨1.4 billion notably resulting from the strong performance of our non-volume related activities  together with efficient management of revenue capture and of cash trading market share. Thanks to our trademark cost discipline  we beat our 2022 revised costs guidance. We achieved an adjusted EBITDA of ‚Ç¨861.6 million that translated into an adjusted EPS of ‚Ç¨5.21. We will propose a total dividend of ‚Ç¨236.6 million at our next annual general meeting to be held in May 2023  representing 50% of our reported net income  excluding NTI loss impact.This year has been crucial in laying the foundations for the future growth of the Group. We have successfully completed the first major milestone of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan with the migration of our Core Data Centre from the UK to Italy. At the end of 2022  we have achieved ‚Ç¨34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies related to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.This fruitful year paves the way for the next steps to be delivered in 2023. The largest single liquidity pool in Europe  operated by Euronext will significantly change dimension with the migration of Italian cash markets to Euronext‚Äôs state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq¬Æ  which will benefit local and global trading members.Euronext Clearing will become the Euronext equity clearing house of choice by the end of 2023  and the CCP for derivatives clearing in Q3 2024. These are the critical bricks to complete our presence across the integrated value chain  allowing us to innovate and shape capital markets in line with evolving client needs  and making Euronext even stronger to deliver future growth.In an inflationary environment  we will contain our costs to a slight increase in 2023  at ‚Ç¨630 million  demonstrating Euronext‚Äôs ability to maintain its cost discipline while investing to generate revenue expansion of our non-volume related activities. We expect to deliver by the end of 2023 around ‚Ç¨70 million of the synergies targeted as part of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan. Our good progress on integration led us to upgrade the total amount of targeted run-rate EBITDA synergies by the end of 2024 from ‚Ç¨100 million to ‚Ç¨115 million. This further demonstrates Euronext‚Äôs successful track record in integrating acquired companies.Our strong performance  combined with the successful ongoing delivery of the planned synergies  is supporting our deleveraging trajectory with a net debt to EBITDA ratio at 2.6x  well below 3.2x at the time of closing of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition.

Underlying revenue and income  excluding the non-underlying  one-off loss related to the partial disposal of the Euronext Clearing portfolio  was up +13.0% in 2022  to ‚Ç¨1 467.8 million. On a like-for-like basis and at constant currencies  Euronext consolidated revenue and income was stable (-0.2%) in 2022  at ‚Ç¨1 204.4 million  compared to 2021. Pro forma the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition on 29 April 2021  underlying revenue and income were stable in 2022 compared to 2021  resulting from strong non-volume related activities  notably listing and advanced data services  very good performances for FX and power trading and a solid performance of derivatives trading. Non-volume related revenue accounted for 58% of underlying Group revenue in 2022  stable vs. 2021  reflecting the successful diversification towards non-volume related activities  good performance of non-equity related trading activities and the challenging environment for cash trading and MTS cash trading this quarter. The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage by non-volume related underlying revenue ratio was at 141% in 2022  almost stable vs. 2021 (142%). 2022 adjusted EBITDA Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased to ‚Ç¨606.1 million  up +14.9%  reflecting the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group costs and continued cost discipline in an inflationary environment. Underlying expenses excluding D&A (‚Ç¨606.1 million) were better than 2022 guidance of ‚Ç¨612 million underlying costs excluding D&A (‚Ç¨622 million initially) thanks to strong cost discipline  project costs being capitalised and one-off positive impacts  including release of accruals and lower-than-anticipated travel and marketing expenses due to the Covid-19 pandemic. On a like-for-like basis  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased slightly by +2.7% compared to 2021  which was positively impacted by the decrease of travel and marketing expenses during the pandemic  highlighting Euronext‚Äôs ability to contain inflation in 2022. On a pro forma basis for the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group on 29 April 2021  underlying operational expenses increased slightly by +2.0%  mainly due to the return of travel and marketing expenses in 2022. Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled ‚Ç¨861.6 million and saw double digit growth  +11.7% compared to 2021. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 58.7%  down -0.7 points compared to 2021. On a like-for-like basis  adjusted EBITDA for 2022 was down -2.3%  to ‚Ç¨699.3 million  and adjusted EBITDA margin was 58.1%  down -1.2 points compared to the same perimeter in 2021. 2022 net income  share of the parent company shareholders Depreciation and amortisation accounted for ‚Ç¨160.2 million in 2022  up +19.0%  mostly due to the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for ‚Ç¨83.3 million and is included in depreciation and amortisation. Adjusted operating profit was ‚Ç¨792.8 million  a strong +11.7% increase compared to 2021. On a like-for-like basis  adjusted operating profit was down -2.3% compared to 2021  at ‚Ç¨643.6 million. ‚Ç¨118.6 million of non-underlying expenses  including depreciation and amortisation  were reported in 2022  related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group  the implementation of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan and the PPA of acquired businesses. Net financing expense for 2022 was ‚Ç¨29.7 million compared to a net financing expense of ‚Ç¨31.7 million in 2021. This decrease mainly results from the elimination of costs in relation to the bridge financing of the Borsa Italiana Group in 2021  partially offset by the cost of bonds issued to finance the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. Results from equity investments amounted to ‚Ç¨18.7 million in 2022  solely representing the contribution received from LCH SA and a dividend received from Euroclear. As a reminder  in 2021  Euronext reported ‚Ç¨33.2 million in results from equity investments  reflecting two dividends received from Sicovam and two dividends received from Euroclear in addition to the contribution received from LCH SA. Income tax for 2022 was ‚Ç¨163.6 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 26.6% for 2022 (2021: ‚Ç¨158.6 million and 27.3% respectively). Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to the Borsa Italiana Group and Nord Pool amounted to ‚Ç¨12.8 million in 2022. As a result  the reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  increased by +5.9% for 2022 compared to 2021  to ‚Ç¨437.8 million  including the one-off loss due to the portfolio reallocation10 of the Euronext Clearing portfolio. This represents a reported EPS of ‚Ç¨4.10 basic and ‚Ç¨4.10 diluted in 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨4.30 basic and ‚Ç¨4.29 diluted in 2021. This decrease reflects a higher number of outstanding shares over 2022 compared to 2021. Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders was up +5.7% to ‚Ç¨555.3 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was down -4.8% in 2022  at ‚Ç¨5.21 per share  compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of ‚Ç¨5.47 per share in 2021. This decrease reflect a higher number of outstanding shares over 2022 compared to 2021. The weighted number of shares used over 2022 was 106 669 451 for the basic calculation and 106 901 306 for the diluted calculation  compared to 96 058 761 and 96 297 159 respectively over 2021. In 2022  Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of ‚Ç¨616.5 million  compared to ‚Ç¨543.7 million in 2021  resulting from higher profit before tax and higher depreciation and amortisation. Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities  net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 83.9% of EBITDA in 2022.

On a like-for-like basis and at constant currencies  Euronext consolidated revenue and income was down -6.1% in Q4 2022  to ‚Ç¨346.5 million  compared to Q4 2021. Non-volume related revenue accounted for 60% of Group revenue in Q4 2022  compared to 58% in Q4 2021  reflecting higher advanced data services and services revenue. The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage by non-volume related revenue ratio was at 130% in Q4 2022  compared to 136% in Q4 2021. Q4 2022 adjusted EBITDA Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased to ‚Ç¨159.2 million  slightly up +1.6%  reflecting strong cost discipline in an inflationary environment and higher capitalised project costs. On a like-for-like basis  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation slightly increased by +2.1% compared to Q4 2021. Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled ‚Ç¨187.9 million  down -12.0% compared to Q4 2021. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.1%  down -3.5 points compared to Q4 2021.

On a like-for-like basis  adjusted operating profit was down -13.4% compared to Q4 2021  at ‚Ç¨168.2 million. ‚Ç¨34.1 million of non-underlying expenses  including depreciation and amortisation  were reported in Q4 2022  related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group  the implementation of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan and the PPA of acquired businesses. Net financing expense for Q4 2022 was ‚Ç¨6.0 million  compared to a net financing expense of ‚Ç¨6.7 million in Q4 2021. This decrease results from higher interest income due to increased interest rates partially offset by the higher cost of issued bonds and a negative revaluation of foreign currency balances. Results from equity investments amounted to ‚Ç¨12.6 million in Q4 2022  representing the contribution received from LCH SA and a dividend received from Euroclear. As a reminder  in Q4 2021  Euronext reported ‚Ç¨7.3 million in results from equity investments  reflecting a dividend payment by Sicovam in addition to the contribution received from LCH SA. Income tax for Q4 2022 was ‚Ç¨38.5 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 27.3% for the quarter (Q4 2021: ‚Ç¨35.7 million and 23.6% respectively). Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to the Borsa Italiana Group and Nord Pool amounted to ‚Ç¨3.0 million in Q4 2022. As a result  the reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  decreased by -11.9% for Q4 2022 compared to Q4 2021  to ‚Ç¨99.3 million. This represents a reported EPS of ‚Ç¨0.93 basic and ‚Ç¨0.93 diluted in Q4 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨1.05 basic and ‚Ç¨1.05 diluted in Q4 2021. Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders was down -18.2% to ‚Ç¨118.2 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was down -18.0% in Q4 2022  at ‚Ç¨1.11 per share  compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of ‚Ç¨1.35 per share in Q4 2021. This decrease reflect a higher number of outstanding shares over the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The weighted number of shares used over 2022 was 106 669 451 for the basic calculation and 106 901 306 for the diluted calculation  compared to 96 058 761 and 96 297 159 respectively over 2021. In Q4 2022  Euronext reported a negative net cash flow from operating activities of ‚Ç¨147.1 million  compared to a positive ‚Ç¨145.6 million in Q4 2021  reflecting higher negative changes in working capital reflecting notably short-term movement in outstanding power sales customers‚Äô and suppliers‚Äô invoices related to Nord Pool CCP activities. Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities  net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 51.9% of EBITDA in Q4 2022.

Fourth quarter 2022 Cash tradingCash trading revenue decreased by -17.9% to ‚Ç¨65.1 million in Q4 2022  resulting from lower trading volumes  partially offset by an uptick in market share from October 2022. Over the fourth quarter of 2022  Euronext recorded cash trading average daily volumes of ‚Ç¨10.1 billion  a volume decrease of-17.2% compared to Q4 2021 resulting from a softer trading environment and partially offset by efficient revenue capture management. Over the fourth quarter of 2022  Euronext cash trading yield was 0.50bps  reflecting the dilutive impact of Borsa Italiana markets and larger average order size. During the fourth quarter 2022  Euronext continued to enhance its fee schemes. The latter translated into an uptick in market share from October 2022. Euronext market share on cash trading averaged 65.3% in Q4 2022. In 2023  Euronext expects to maintain for cash trading an average market share greater or equal to 63%  and revenue capture around 0.52bps following the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq¬Æ  considering current market conditions and orders size. The largest single liquidity pool in Europe operated by Euronext will significantly change dimension with the migration of Italian cash markets to Euronext‚Äôs state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq¬Æ in Q1 2023. This migration will benefit local and global trading members.

Appendix Adjustments in financial disclosure To highlight its underlying performance  since Q1 2022 Euronext has published underlying recurring costs  adjusted EBITDA and non-recurring costs. Euronext has removed the exceptional items line from its financial statements. Consequently  costs previously reported as exceptional items have from Q1 2022 been included in their respective lines within Euronext operating expenses as non-recurring items. The ‚Ç¨150 million of implementation costs to deliver on the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan targets are therefore considered as non-recurring items and have been withdrawn from the underlying recurring costs. The computation of adjusted net income and earnings per share has been adjusted accordingly. The computation of reported net income and earnings per share is not impacted. 2024 strategic plan targets remain unchanged and are not affected by this change in reporting.

These items can include: integration or double run costs of significant projects  restructuring costs and costs related to acquisitions that change the perimeter of the Group; one-off finance costs  gains or losses on sale of subsidiaries and impairments of investments: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets which are recognised as a result of acquisitions and mostly comprising customer relationships  brand names and software that were identified during purchase price allocation (PPA); tax related to non-underlying items.Adjusted operating profit as the operating profit adjusted for any non-underlying revenue and income and non-underlying costs  including PPA of acquired businesses;EBITDA as the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;Adjusted EBITDA as the adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation adjusted for any non-underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA  divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted net income  as the net income  share of the parent company shareholders  adjusted for any non-underlying items and related tax impact.

Net sales decreased by 6.0%. Net sales growth excluding the renewable energy sources business was 2.9%.Adjusted operating profit for the final quarter was EUR 9.6 million (10.1) and operating profit was EUR 12.9 million (9.9). The Group's operating profit was increased by a gain of EUR 4.3 million recognised on the sale of the share of renewable energy sources business to a newly established joint venture.L&T‚Äôs circular economy businesses  namely Environmental Services and Industrial Services  achieved a strong operating result in 2022. In Industrial Services  net sales increased by 25.6 per cent.In Facility Services in Finland and Sweden  the higher general cost level had a negative effect on profitability. Both divisions launched programmes during the review period to simplify and increase the efficiency of their operating models. These programmes will continue in 2023.Net sales for 2022 amounted to EUR 844.1 million (812.5). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 40.9 million (42.4) and operating profit was EUR 42.9 million (42.2). Earnings per share were EUR 0.83 (0.90).Net cash flow from operating activities after investments per share was EUR 1.08 (0.05).The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of EUR 0.47 per share.Outlook for the year 2023Net sales and adjusted operating profit in 2023 are estimated to be at the same level as in the previous year even though the comparison period includes net sales from the renewable energy sources business in the amount of EUR 35.4 million.PRESIDENT AND CEO EERO HAUTANIEMI:‚ÄúThe year 2022 was exceptional and the business environment changed significantly. The economic uncertainty caused by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine  the sharp rise in costs and interest rates and the significantly higher-than-usual level of sickness-related absences affected all of the company‚Äôs divisions.The development of net sales was positive in 2022  but adjusted operating profit declined slightly due to the weak result of Facility Services Finland and Sweden. Net cash flow from operating activities was strong  as was the company‚Äôs financial position.L&T‚Äôs circular economy businesses  namely Environmental Services and Industrial Services  achieved a good operative result in 2022.In Environmental Services  net sales growth excluding the renewable energy sources business came to 8.1 per cent. The number of corporate customers and producer responsibility organisation customers grew. The division‚Äôs environmental responsibility management and consulting capabilities and organisation were strengthened.In Industrial Services  net sales increased by 25.6 per cent  of which 6.6 per cent was organic growth. Industrial Services expanded its operations into the Swedish market and strengthened its market position in hazardous waste in Finland through an acquisition. In the environmental construction business  a number of demanding contaminated soil restoration projects were carried out for industrial customers.In Facility Services in Finland and Sweden  profitability was weighed down by the higher general cost level  worsening labour shortages  high employee turnover and sickness-related absences being significantly higher than average. The profit performance of Facility Services Sweden was weighed down not only by inflation but also the weaker-than-expected sales of additional services. Both divisions launched programmes during the review period to simplify and increase the efficiency of their operating models. These programmes will continue in 2023.L&T‚Äôs businesses are not particularly sensitive to economic cycles. Nevertheless  inflation and rising interest rates create uncertainty in the operating environment.In 2024  the Environmental Services division will focus particularly on corporate customers and producer responsibility organisations as the progress of municipalisation reduces the significance of households as customers.The Industrial Services division will continue to invest in the development of new hazardous waste recycling solutions and process cleaning methods in both Finland and Sweden.Facility Services Finland and Sweden will continue to focus on improving operational efficiency and profitability. Particularly in Finland  unprofitable customer agreements will be terminated and the scope of operations will be reassessed. In Sweden  the focus will be on simplifying the operating model.‚ÄùGROUP NET SALES AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEOctober‚ÄìDecemberLassila & Tikanoja‚Äôs net sales for the fourth quarter amounted to EUR 210.1 million (223.5)  a decrease of 6.0% year-on-year. Net sales growth excluding the effect of the renewable energy sources business was 2.9% and organic growth was 0.4%. Adjusted operating profit was EUR 9.6 million (10.1)  representing 4.6% (4.5%) of net sales. Operating profit was EUR 12.9 million (9.9)  representing 6.2% (4.4%) of net sales.

Operating profit improved in Industrial Services and Facility Services Finland  and declined in Environmental Services and Facility Services Sweden.The Group‚Äôs adjusted operating profit was still negatively affected by the higher general cost level. Net financial expenses rose to EUR -1.6 million (-0.8). The Group's operating profit was increased by a gain of EUR 4.3 million recognised on the sale of the share of renewable energy sources business to a newly established joint venture.Year 2022Net sales for 2022 totalled EUR 844.1 million (812.5)  an increase of 3.9% year-on-year. Net sales growth excluding the effect of the renewable energy sources business was 7.0%. Organic growth was 3.7%. Adjusted operating profit was EUR 40.9 million (42.4)  representing 4.8% (5.2%) of net sales. Operating profit was EUR 42.9 million (42.2)  representing 5.1% (5.2%) of net sales. Earnings per share were EUR 0.83 (0.90).Net sales increased in Environmental Services  Industrial Services and Facility Services Finland. Net sales decreased in Facility Services Sweden. Operating profit improved in Environmental Services and Industrial Services  and declined in Facility Services in Finland and Sweden.The Group‚Äôs adjusted operating profit was negatively affected by increased fuel prices and the higher general cost level. The sickness rate was exceptionally high during the review period  which had a negative impact particularly on the labour-intensive facility services business. The Group's operating profit was increased by a gain of EUR 4.3 million recognised on the sale of the share of renewable energy sources business to a newly established joint venture.Net financial expenses rose to EUR -5.8 million (-3.3) and the effective tax rate increased to 16.7 per cent (11.8 per cent).Financial summary10‚Äì12/2022 10‚Äì12/2021 Change % 1‚Äì12/2022 1‚Äì12/2021 Change % Net sales  EUR million 210.1 223.5 -6.0 844.1 812.5 3.9 Adjusted operating profit  EUR million 9.6 10.1 -5.1 40.9 42.4 -3.5 Adjusted operating margin  % 4.6 4.5 4.8 5.2 Operating profit  EUR million 12.9 9.9 30.2 42.9 42.2 1.7 Operating margin  % 6.2 4.4 5.1 5.2 EBITDA  EUR million 26.5 23.2 14.2 98.3 95.1 3.3 EBITDA  % 12.6 10.4 11.6 11.7 Profit before tax  EUR million 12.2 9.1 33.8 37.8 39.0 -3.0 Earnings per share  EUR 0.29 0.26 11.1 0.83 0.90 -8.3 Net cash flow from operating activitiesafter investments per share  EUR 1.05 0.55 92.8 1.08 0.05 2 279.1 Return on equity (ROE)  % 14.6 17.1 Capital employed  EUR million 437.2 406.0 7.7 Return on capital employed (ROCE)  % 10.4 10.8 Equity ratio  % 34.3 34.2 Gearing  % 75.9 79.4NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT BY DIVISIONEnvironmental ServicesOctober‚ÄìDecemberThe division‚Äôs net sales for the fourth quarter decreased to EUR 71.1 million (89.9). Operating profit declined to EUR 6.2 million (7.1). Excluding the renewable energy sources business  the net sales of the Environmental Services division amounted to EUR 71.1 million (71.2) and operating profit was EUR 6.2 million (6.6).Year 2022The full-year net sales of the Environmental Services division grew to EUR 321.2 million (320.5). Operating profit was EUR 30.3 million (29.8). Excluding the renewable energy sources business  the net sales of the Environmental Services division amounted to EUR 287.1 million (265.5) and operating profit was EUR 30.0 million (28.9).In Environmental Services  growth was derived particularly from corporate customers and producer responsibility organisations. The producer responsibility organisation Suomen Pakkaustuottajat Oy chose L&T as its recycling partner for consumer plastic packaging in December. The agreement covers approximately 20 000 tonnes of consumer packaging plastic waste  which corresponds to approximately half of the packaging plastic waste collected in Finland each year. From the beginning of 2023  L&T will be responsible for the intermediate storage of plastic packaging waste as well as its collection and transport to Quantafuel ASA‚Äôs mechanical and chemical recycling plants in Denmark.During the period under review  the organisational structure and operating model were reformed by assigning more commercial responsibility to the local organisation. Environmental responsibility management and consulting organisation grew  and its competencies were expanded.The ERP system and related information system renewal programme continued in the division and progressed to the implementation stage. The system is scheduled to enter the deployment stage in the first half of 2024. The total investment in the system projects under the programme is estimated at approximately EUR 16.9 million  of which approximately EUR 6.2 million were realised by the end of 2022  with expenses of EUR 1.3 million recognised in 2022.Due to the reform of the Waste Act in 2021  direct customer agreements with housing properties were transferred to municipal operators during the period under review  but the impact of these changes on net sales was compensated for by growth in the corporate customer segment.The prices of recycled raw materials increased in the first half of the year. The prices of recycled raw materials subsequently stabilised and  in the case of certain fractions  began to decrease in the latter half of the year. The market prices of recycled cardboard and paperboard falling to less than half of the level seen in the early part of the year was particularly reflected in the net sales of the Environmental Services division. The reduced level of activity in the construction industry was also reflected in declining volumes towards the end of the year.Fuel prices rose sharply at the end of February due to the war in Ukraine. The higher fuel costs were successfully passed on to customer prices through cost increases carried out in February‚ÄìApril.The merger of the Environmental Services division‚Äôs renewable energy sources business with Neova Oy‚Äôs corresponding business was approved by the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority  and the joint venture Laania Oy became operational on 1 July 2022. In the first half of the year  the net sales of the renewable energy sources business amounted to EUR 35.4 million  and the operating profit was EUR 0.3 million. In the financial year 2021  the net sales of the renewable energy sources business totalled EUR 56.9 million  and the operating profit was EUR 0.9 million. The business is no longer reported as part of the Environmental Services division after the second quarter of 2022. The net profit of the joint venture is consolidated in one line item under operating profit.Industrial ServicesOctober‚ÄìDecemberThe division‚Äôs net sales for the final quarter grew to EUR 36.3 million (28.7). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 3.1 million (1.7). Operating profit was EUR 2.3 million (1.7). Operating profit was reduced by a change of EUR 0.8 million in the fair value of the deferred consideration related to the acquisition of Sand & Vattenbl√§st i Tyringe AB (‚ÄúSVB‚Äù) recognised in the final quarter of 2022  due to the positive development of the acquired company‚Äôs business.Year 2022The full-year net sales of the Industrial Services division grew to EUR 132.0 million (105.1). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 13.6 million (9.2). Operating profit was EUR 12.7 million (9.2). Operating profit was reduced by a change of EUR 0.8 million in the fair value of the deferred consideration related to the acquisition of Sand & Vattenbl√§st i Tyringe AB (‚ÄúSVB‚Äù) recognised in the final quarter of 2022  due to the positive development of the acquired company‚Äôs business.The Industrial Services division strengthened its position in hazardous and non-hazardous waste recycling services during the period under review by acquiring Fortum‚Äôs hazardous waste SME business in Finland at the beginning of February 2022. The takeover of the business acquired from Fortum went according to plan  and the demand for hazardous waste services was strong.In the environmental construction business line  several demanding industrial soil decontamination projects were carried out. At the beginning of the year  a new material treatment center started its operations in Pori  Finland. The plant focuses particularly on processing industrial side streams.In February  Industrial Services expanded into the Swedish process cleaning services market by acquiring 70% of the shares of Sand & Vattenbl√§st i Tyringe AB (‚ÄúSVB‚Äù)  a provider of process cleaning services in Sweden. Operating in southern Sweden  SVB had net sales of approximately EUR 10 million in the previous financial year and has approximately 60 employees. The integration of the Swedish business progressed according to plan  and several successful industrial water treatment projects were carried out in the process cleaning business in Sweden. In the process cleaning business in Finland  resource allocation for annual maintenance services was successful in spite of maintenance services originally scheduled for the early part of the year being postponed to the autumn due to the COVID-19 pandemic and labour action.Fuel prices rose sharply at the end of February due to the war in Ukraine. The higher fuel costs were  for the most part  passed on to customer prices through cost increases carried out in February‚ÄìApril.Facility Services FinlandOctober‚ÄìDecemberThe division‚Äôs net sales for the final quarter grew to EUR 64.6 million (63.0). Operating profit was EUR 0.8 million (0.6).Year 2022The full-year net sales of Facility Services Finland grew to EUR 256.3 million (243.1). Operating profit declined to EUR -0.5 million (1.8).Several significant new customer accounts were acquired and started in the cleaning business  and the demand for data-driven cleaning services increased. The demand for energy efficiency services increased during the review period.The COVID-19 pandemic and other respiratory infections significantly increased sickness-related absences in the first and fourth quarters  which increased production costs in all service branches  especially in cleaning. Production costs were increased by higher fuel prices and general cost inflation. The increased production costs could not be fully passed on to customer prices.In the cleaning business  the availability of labour declined and employee turnover increased significantly  which drove costs higher. Several new projects were launched to improve the availability of labour. Co-operation with municipal employment services and government organisations was intensified to ensure that jobs offered by L&T are better known by job seekers. L&T joined forces with Staffpoint to offer jobs to Ukrainian refugees. A group of workers from the Philippines was recruited for full-time cleaning work under contracts valid until further notice. The employees in question will start work in the first quarter of 2023.Measures were taken in Facility Services Finland to improve operational efficiency and profitability throughout the period under review. Local and business line-specific change negotiations were conducted in the division in the second half of the year  leading to the termination of employment for approximately 70 white-collar employees and approximately 30 employees.Facility Services SwedenOctober‚ÄìDecemberThe division‚Äôs net sales for the final quarter decreased to EUR 39.8 million (43.8). Operating profit declined to EUR 0.5 million (1.3). Operating profit before the amortisation of purchase price allocations of acquisitions was EUR 0.8 million (1.9).Year 2022Facility Services Sweden‚Äôs full-year net sales decreased to EUR 140.4 million (149.8). Operating profit declined to EUR 0.4 million (3.9). Operating profit before the amortisation of purchase price allocations of acquisitions was EUR 2.2 million (6.0).Production costs were increased by higher fuel prices and general cost inflation from February onwards. The COVID-19 pandemic increased sickness-related absences  particularly in the first quarter. Customer agreements in the Swedish business are mostly fixed-price contracts  and the increased production costs could not be passed on to customers in the form of price increases. The profit performance of Facility Services Sweden was lowered not only by inflation but also the weaker-than-expected sales of additional services. Adaptation measures were initiated in the division in the second quarter. The effort to simplify operating models and adapt them to the rapidly changing business environment will continue in 2023.FINANCINGIn 2022  cash flow from operating activities amounted to EUR 71.8 million (65.6). Net cash flow after investments came to EUR 41.1 million (1.7). Net cash flow from operating activities after investments was reduced by acquisitions  which had a total impact of approximately EUR 13 million (approximately EUR 23 million). Net cash flow after investments was increased by the repayment of a loan receivable of EUR 16.4 million by the joint venture in the final quarter of 2022. A total of EUR 6.2 million in working capital was committed (EUR 15.1 million committed).At the end of the financial year  interest-bearing liabilities amounted to EUR 216.8 million (195.6). Net interest-bearing liabilities totalled EUR 167.3 million (167.1). The average interest rate of long-term loans  excluding lease liabilities  with interest rate hedging  was 2.5% (1.1%). Of the company‚Äôs floating rate loans totalling EUR 50 million  EUR 30 million have been converted into fixed rate loans by means of an interest rate swap.The EUR 100.0 million commercial paper programme was unused at the end of the financial year as in the comparison period. The account limit totalling EUR 10.0 million as well as the committed credit limit totalling EUR 40.0 million were not in use  as was the case in the comparison period. The Group signed a credit limit linked to responsibility targets in May 2022. The credit limit will mature in the first quarter of 2025. The company issued senior unsecured sustainability-linked notes in the amount of EUR 75 million in May. The new notes will mature in the second quarter of 2028 and bear fixed annual interest at the rate of 3.375 per cent.Net financial expenses amounted to EUR -5.8 million (-3.3). The increase in net financial expenses was attributable to higher interest-bearing liabilities due to acquisitions  an expense of EUR 0.3 million associated with the redemption of a bond  and the higher general interest rate level. The effect of exchange rate changes on net financial expenses was EUR -0.2 million (0.3). Net financial expenses were 0.7% (0.4%) of net sales.The equity ratio was 34.3% (34.2%) and the gearing ratio was 75.9% (79.4%). The Group‚Äôs total equity was EUR 220.4 million (210.4). Translation differences caused by the depreciation of the Swedish krona affected equity by EUR -5.6 million and changes in the fair value of hedging instruments by EUR 1.3 million. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period amounted to EUR 49.5 million (28.6). Overdue trade receivables and credit losses have not increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or the war in Ukraine.DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETSThe Annual General Meeting held on 17 March 2022 resolved that a dividend of EUR 0.46 per share  totalling EUR 17.5 million  be paid on the basis of the balance sheet that was adopted for the financial year 2021. The dividend was paid to shareholders on 28 March 2022.CAPITAL EXPENDITUREGross capital expenditure for 2022 came to EUR 58.2 million (72.3). Acquisitions accounted for approximately EUR 21 million of the capital expenditure (approximately EUR 31 million). In addition  the costs of internal work related to information system investments increased significantly compared to 2021. Other capital expenditure consisted primarily of machine and equipment purchases  as well as investments in information systems and buildings.SUSTAINABILITYEnvironmental responsibilityClimate benefits for customers created by L&T2022 2021 Target Target to be achieved by Carbon handprint (tCO 2 e)534 5001 100 000 growth faster than net salesThe carbon handprint illustrates the climate benefits of a product  process or service  i.e. the emission reduction potential for the user. L&T‚Äôs carbon handprint reduces the customer‚Äôs carbon footprint. Our services generated emission reductions for customers through  for example  customers replacing virgin raw materials with secondary raw materials  and fossil fuels with biofuels and solid recovered fuels.The carbon handprint of the renewable energy sources business is no longer reported as part of L&T‚Äôs carbon handprint in 2022. In 2021  L&T‚Äôs total carbon handprint excluding renewable energy sources was 528 000 tCO 2 e.Recycling rate and material recovery2022 2021 Target Target to be achieved by Recycling rate of material flows managed by L&T  % 59.4 58.4 65 2026The recycling rate is the weighted average of our customers‚Äô recycling rates. It also includes materials that cannot yet be recycled. To increase our reuse and recycling rate  we actively look for new material streams whose refining rate we can increase. Reporting covers municipal waste collected from corporate customers  hazardous waste  industrial waste and construction waste in Finland. Slurry  contaminated soil and ash are excluded from reporting.Progress towards science-based emission reduction targets  using 2018 as the baseline2022 2021 Target Target to be achieved by Carbon footprint (tCO 2 e)31 70037 800Carbon footprint intensity (gCO 2 e/km)6467674762030L&T‚Äôs strategic objective is to halve the carbon footprint of its operations by 2030  using 2018 as the baseline  and to reduce the indirect emissions generated by its supply chain. The emission reduction target set by L&T has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. The achievement of this objective will be promoted by switching to zero-emission transport technologies and fuels and by opting for renewable energy at L&T‚Äôs properties. Transport operations account for 95 per cent of the emissions generated by L&T‚Äôs own operations.The fuel distribution obligation was adjusted in 2022 by reducing the biofuel component by 7.5 per cent in July. This change has not been taken into account in the emissions calculations reported in the financial statements release  as Statistics Finland has yet to update its fuel classification data in accordance with the change. Statistics Finland is expected to publish updated fuel classification data during spring 2023. L&T will subsequently calculate and report its carbon dioxide emissions for 2022 on its website using the updated emission factors. The total emissions of L&T‚Äôs own operations for 2022  calculated with the updated emission factors  are likely to be higher than those reported here.Social responsibilityOverall accident frequency2022 2021 Target Target to be achieved byOverall accident frequency (TRIF)2324192026L&T eliminates hazards and improves its own safety as well as the safety of customers and other stakeholders through effective proactive measures  such as risk assessments  safety observations  Safety Walks and occupational safety sessions.Well-being at work2022 2021 Target Target to be achieved by Occupational health rate (proportion of employees with no sickness-related absences)404557 2026Sickness-related absences (%)5.65.04.32026The objective of L&T‚Äôs personnel policies and plans is to ensure that the number  competence and retention of personnel are at the level required for effective performance.

The aim of the new plans is to align the objectives of the company  shareholders and key employees in order to increase the value of the company in the long term  to retain the key employees at the company and to offer them competitive reward plans that are based on earning and accumulating the company‚Äôs shares as well as on appreciation of the share price. The Performance Share Plan 2023‚Äì2027 comprises three (3) three-year (3) performance periods covering the calendar years 2023‚Äì2025  2024‚Äì2026 and 2025‚Äì2027.During the performance period 2023‚Äì2025  the earning of rewards is based on the following performance criteria: return on capital employed (ROCE)  total shareholder return (TSR) and reduction of the carbon footprint (ESG).The target group of the Performance Share Plan during the performance period 2023‚Äì2025 consists of approximately 50 key employees  including the Group‚Äôs President and CEO and the Group Executive Board.The transitional share-based incentive scheme 2023‚Äì2026 consists of two (2) earnings periods of one (1) year each  corresponding to the calendar years 2023 and 2024.

Temporary additional costs arising from system deployments and establishing the operating model may weigh down the company‚Äôs result.Production costs may be increased by challenges related to employee turnover  labour availability and higher sickness rates.As the company has no operations or holdings in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine  and there are no significant Russian-owned companies in the customer base  the direct impacts of the war in Ukraine are expected to be minor. However  indirect impacts on overall economic activity in Finland and Sweden may have a negative impact on net sales and profit.More detailed information on Lassila & Tikanoja‚Äôs risks and risk management will be provided in the 2021 Annual Review and in the Report by the Board of Directors and the consolidated financial statements.PROPOSAL FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETSAccording to the financial statements  Lassila & Tikanoja plc‚Äôs unrestricted equity amounts to EUR 61 719 573.87  with the operating profit for the period representing EUR 11 946 564.10 of this total.

The figure‚Ä¶,"PARIS  Feb. 9  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- After posting good revenue figures for 4Q 2022  we are proud to say that Artprice by Artmarket has got off to a dynamic start to 2023 with January's turnover showing a 17% increase versus the year-earlier period.The figures show that since the start of 2023  Artmarket.com has been gaining market share with new customers despite the uncertain economic context stemming from very unpredictable geopolitical parameters and an inflationary dynamic that poses significant challenges for central banks  particularly for the ECB and the FED.Artprice took advantage of the Covid period to develop and deploy the most significant modification in its history  leading to a change in its business model with paying advertisers fully integrated into its databases and services. These advertisers are essentially the 6 500 Auction Houses around the world that have been affiliated with Artprice for more than two decades and today conduct 98% of their sales online.It is quite possible that the turnover generated by these 6 500 auction houses will ultimately generate more turnover than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice by Artmarket.com's turnover. By effectively responding to a long-standing request from its partner auction houses  Artprice believes it can double its turnover. A second major change in our business model relates to our decision to license our Standardized Database of Artists  today the most comprehensive in the world.Future events in 2023: annual licensing of Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists  with an entry price of ‚Ç¨7 500 per yearIn recent years  Artprice by Artmarket  which owns the largest known editorial collection of manuscripts and catalogs from 1700 to the present day (a current asset with an estimated value of ‚Ç¨16.257 million in Artprice by Artmarket.com's balance sheet)  has developed the most comprehensive database of artists in the world.At Artprice by Artmarket  we never forget that artists are what the art market revolves around; they are its primary and unique motor  and all the news  exhibitions  auctions  galleries  museums  biennials  fairs  and shows evolve around them. In short  none of it could exist without the artist.Each Artist page is created within the framework of a standardized editorial charter and a set of processes protected under France's Intellectual Property Laws  with a biography supported by certified documents from the artist and/or his/her beneficiaries that are deposited in Artprice's physical archives.Each analog/digital record has 140 referential integrity fields which are themselves relational databases.Each Artist page includes details about their various disciplines and artistic techniques  their past auction results (with photographs of the works)  their upcoming sales  their signatures and monograms  an indication of any catalog raisonn√© and/or reference work  their annual auction turnover  their auction records  the geographical distribution of their sales  their key market indices  their unsold rates  as well as all articles or dispatches from Artprice's press agency ""ArtMarket Insight"" written about the artist.This allows Artprice to attribute each artist with a dedicated ID (like a business identification code) and for each of his/her works  another specific ID (like a vehicle registration document) and to 'standardize' the art market to ensure reliable traceability  accurate indices  and comprehensive monitoring. These unique and rigorous processes are subject to multiple protection mechanisms under France's Intellectual Property Laws.A single Artist Log costs on average 270‚Ç¨ to 300‚Ç¨ to create  and  despite ultra-powerful computing  it requires human validation by a committee of editors and translation into the six languages of the Artprice databases  namely English  French  Spanish  German  Italian and Mandarin.In 25 years  the Artprice Artist Database has established itself as the leading standardized global database in terms of the number of artists it covers  but also in terms of the volume of information per Artist entry.To date  the only reference we have retained is the Benezit Dictionary  created in 1911 in Paris and which Artprice tried to acquire from √âditions Gr√ºnd in the early 2000s.At the time  Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists included 120 000 artists while the Benezit had 175 000. The latter was therefore the de facto global reference by its sheer number of artists. Despite a very substantial financial proposal from Artprice  the Benezit was finally sold to Oxford Art Online (see our registration document and financial report).In 2023  the online Benezit  in English  has 170 000 artists and a subscription entry cost of ¬£215 per year.Artprice's standardized artists' database now totals 803 000 artists from the 4th century to the present day  in six languages.The overall cost associated with successfully building the most comprehensive Standardized Database of Artists in the world also includes the cost of acquiring legendary companies and documentary collections such as the Enrique Mayer Guide (1962/1987)  the famous Dictionary of Art Sales by Doctor H. Mireur 1700-1900  the American leader Sound View Press with nearly 50 databases on the USA including the famous biographical collection Who Was Who in American Art (1991)  Editions Franck Van Wilder (1970)  the Swiss company Xylogic (world specialist in Art Market indices since 1985)  the Bayer Database on the Anglo-Saxon Art Market from 1700 to 1913  Signatures and Monogrammes by Caplan & Creps (USA)  a global reference work (1976)  and a whole host of other works and records.Indeed  over the past 25 years  we at Artprice have pursued a systematic policy of purchasing all manuscripts and catalogs  mainly from 1700 to 1970  from all over the world. The acquisition of this historical knowledge was an unavoidable process in ensuring that Artprice could standardize the art market with certainty and know the perfect traceability of works of art and their correct attributions.In the 20th century  the Benezit was the major reference  the Bible of the Art Market according to Le Monde newspaper. To date  it is the only serious financial and analytical referent for Artprice  notably because of its use of a comparative methodology.Nevertheless  the 803 000 artists in Artprice's Standardized Database represent a volume 472% greater than that of the Benezit Oxford University Press Dictionary (170 000 artists)  with access in six languages for Artprice compared with just one language for the Benezit.For Artprice  the total present-day cost in 2023 of building the most exhaustive database of artists in the world is 216 million euros (see paragraph on analytical cost). Despite being an asset in permanent growth  under International Financial Reporting Standards  the valuation of such a perennial asset is recognized in Artprice by Artmarket.com balance sheets at only a fraction of its real value (IFRS have been adopted since 2005 to harmonize the presentation of listed companies' financial and accounting statements).Indeed  the creation of the index for Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists was an extremely complex operation involving seven million hours of work by historians  researchers  editors  journalists  econometricians  and a dedicated IT department over 25 years.Now that it exists  Artprice by Artmarket is constantly being asked for licenses to use its Standardized Database of Artists  mainly by the tens of thousands of online galleries  marketplaces  Auction Houses  Experts  online auction sites  copyright companies  customs  and tax authorities  museums foundations and insurance companies that operate in this segment  but without an exhaustive standardized database of artists.Many of these players are prone to making regular attribution errors - as they themselves admit - and for the small or recently established structures  their survival depends on access to a standardized and consistent Database of Artists over the centuries.One of the main difficulties is having  on the one hand  a massive collection of auction catalogs and manuscripts  and on the other hand  proprietary algorithms that can track down and identify the numerous homonyms that exist in the field of art.Indeed  art history is full of homonyms. One of the solutions was to link the name of the artist to his place of birth as well as his connection to an ethnic group or a family or a clan.After a global market study focusing mainly on incoming requests from future clients  we calculated that the entry price for a license to use the index of Artprice's Standardized Database of 803 000 Artists  will be around ‚Ç¨7 500 per year  i.e. a monthly charge of ‚Ç¨625  which makes this operating license very affordable for small or recently-established structures.Of course  this annual operating license ‚Äì limited to the Standardized Index of Artists  does not in any way compete with Artprice or its multiple databases  as is contractually agreed with the licensee. This operating license uses an Application Programming Interface (API) provided by Artprice to connect software (or a website) to Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists.If the licensee notices that its customers request  for example  the price of works for past or future sales  indices and statistics on an artist  monograms and signatures  or any other information held by Artprice's databases  it may ask the Artprice licensor for a return API (re-routing/affiliation contract) to Artprice's paid databases where the licensee receives between 5 and 20% commission depending on the turnover achieved with Artprice on an annual subscription contracted on Artprice by Artmarket payment platforms. This allows Artprice to collect ‚Ç¨7 500/year on the one hand  and on the other hand  to greatly increase its turnover via its many licensees.Future events HI 2023: at the beginning of March Artprice will deploy its most sophisticated version of Artprice.com that will  among other things  initiate a complete change in our business model. Henceforward  our website will integrate paid advertisers into our databases and services and our Artist pages and Web 3.0.At the beginning of March 2023  Artprice by Artmarket will deploy the latest and most sophisticated version of its website in response to the numerous requests from its customers  which reflects the growth and expansion of its digital footprints. After 18 months of development  partly extended by the Covid  this large-scale deployment will affect all of Artprice's databases and services.To develop this latest version of our website  Artprice by Artmarket submitted a call for tenders at the end of 2019 and finally selected a team of very qualified and passionate external consultants to conduct an analysis followed by the development of a complete overhaul of Artprice.com. The whole process was based on a solid 'user interface' (UI) and 'user experience' approach  which  as their labels suggest  means that our entire website has been redesigned with an acute focus on making it easier for the user.At its core  the new website will include a very substantial change in our business model  since paying advertisers will be fully integrated into our databases and services. These advertisers are mainly the 6 500 auction houses worldwide  affiliated with Artprice for more than two decades and which now conduct 98% of their sales online. They will now  in paying advertiser mode  be able to highlight their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  depending on the search criteria of Artprice's 7.2 million customers.It should be noted that for the past half a century  the economic models of auction houses have always allocated roughly 34% of their overall costs to advertising (usually announcing details of upcoming public sales)  regardless of the country they operate in or the size of the auction house.Since auctions are now 98% advertised online  the pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2023 to promote their sales for a fee has found its best response with this new deployment. Indeed  the auction houses now believe that their communication budgets for future sales (34% of their estimated value) must be focused online  rather than on the printed media.In the past Artprice always considered online advertising to be incompatible with its databases in terms of readability and reputation. We have therefore done everything we can to satisfy demand from the auction houses while maintaining Artprice's original DNA.On the new version of the site  the 6 500 auction houses will be able to merge into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket by advertising their future sales and pushing the ""followed"" artists selected by the 7.2 million Artprice customers and members (alerts by SMS  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  ""my artists"" page  etc.).Since 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population to facilitate development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable  and above all contextualized data.Indeed  Artprice by Artmarket's clients and members will intuitively dive into the heart of art market news and will be privileged players within a human and educational approach  which is often lacking in the world of GAFAs.Moreover  Artprice's essential and historic collaborations as World Leader in Art Market Information will become even more apparent in this new version  mainly via contributions from individual artists who have participated in this evolution.The auction houses that have been our historical partners are  of course  the other essential collaboration. Indeed  their interest in collaborating with Artprice can only increase as they highlight their future sales with discreet and effective prestige  which will ‚Äì in turn ‚Äì generate additional recurring income for Artprice via its proprietary Intranet (the primary working tool for auction houses for many years).It is quite possible that the advertising revenue generated by these 6 500 auction houses (affiliated with Artprice since 1997) will ultimately generate more income than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice's turnover. As mentioned earlier  Artprice has a clear ambition to double its turnover and  again  this initiative is a direct result of long-standing requests from our partner auction houses.In sum  after more than two years of R&D (extended by the Covid crisis)  Artprice by Artmarket is proud to be able fully to engage Artmarket.com customers  partners  and members in a new experience at the heart of the art market.This is undoubtedly one of the founding stones for the future of Artprice by Artmarket  with a fundamentally improved positioning via the referencing of images on search engines  the objective of increasing traffic to conquer new market share and to corner the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs.Thanks to Google Analytics 4  the latest generation of Analytics  the ""Crawl budget""  a combination of Google's ""crawl rate"" and ""crawl demand""  increased from 915 000 requests/day to a new average of 2.5 million/day since the deployment of Artprice's 803 000 Artist homepages at the end of 2022.Through this deployment  Artprice has not only remained faithful to its principle of maintaining the readability of its databases but has also responded (at last) to the continual requests from its 6 500 affiliated Auction Houses around the world to have access to paid advertisements to enhance their future sales.Since January 2023  a complete UI//UX overhaul of Artists P ages and our Web 3.0/Art NFTs allowed greater global visibility for the 803 000 artists on Artprice by Artmarket.Artmarket.com has implemented a substantial tariff increase for its subscriptions and services since the beginning of 2023. These increases will generate an increase in future income. Artmarket.com was already profitable for a decade  and the additional revenue will translate almost entirely into net income since we will still be below the ‚Ç¨90 million euros p.a. tax bracket.This tariff increase follows extensive consultation with Artprice by Artmarket customers who will continue to benefit from our databases and services  well aware that they find essential data in Artprice that they cannot find elsewhere. Enriched by over a million ultra-qualified new data every year  our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997  must now be properly and systematically monetized.Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most exhaustive in the world and this is recognized by a broad consensus of art market operators. It covers nearly 803 000 artists  all referenced with their biographies  auction results  market indices  decision-making help tools  signatures & monograms  and future sales  alongside historical information and contemporary  cultural  and market news. In total  our databases contain several tens of millions of data inputs and their combination and exploitation by our teams means that the sum of the parts is infinitely more valuable  and the whole system is protected by various intellectual property rights.Despite this substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best value compared to the offer by our competitors who have not managed to evolve and offer subscriptions with limited searches: annual professional subscriptions from the competition for 150 searches ‚Ç¨350/year  or 450 searches ‚Ç¨975/year  and  in the event of an overrun  ‚Ç¨2.45/request (as noted by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In a world of ""unlimited"" offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competition's offer is based on data of only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 803 000 artists and 6 500 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from ‚Ç¨279 to ‚Ç¨569/year  including a range of indices  decision-making tools  and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world. Indeed  Artprice would still be very competitive at substantially higher prices.Surprisingly ‚Äì given the geopolitical and economic context ‚Äì the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods during recent sales sessions  regardless of the country. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023  which are the main indicators of the art market's health.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100¬© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market. For information  the Artprice100¬© index has increased by 612% since 2000. For the year 2022  the S&P index posted a contraction of -19% versus +3% for the Artprice100¬©.In our upcoming Global Art Market Report  we plan to present a truly global analysis of the art market's activities in 2022. This report is scheduled for publication in early March 2023. It will be available free of charge online and in PDF version. The AFP will publish it first.It is clear that war in Eastern Europe and the fears of a global recession have not depressed the art market at the start of this year.At the end of 2022  the AFP posted an article with the evocative title ""The collection of Microsoft co-founder aims for a billion-dollar auction total in New York"" and added ""With the late Paul G Allen's collection  Christie's is aiming for a historic art auction record  symbol of a market that is surging ahead despite a world shaken by crises.""Our new version of Artists Homepages bolsters the primary and preferred entry points to all of Artprice's databases and services because artists are indeed the foundation on which the art market has been based since its origin. With this major overhaul  Artprice also aims to reposition artists at the heart of the art market via the production of Art NFTs  which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.The major overhaul of Artprice.com aims to provide its customers and members with a better experience  more in line with their needs. It has been implemented after several years of collecting and analyzing their needs in strict compliance with the legislation in force in Europe and the USA.The overhaul naturally integrates the arrival of Art NFTs  whose growth is exponential and which also constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's principal market-makers  including the majority of the auction houses around the world  now have NFT departments for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum industry and art galleries sphere are starting to publish their own NFTs.In addition  the major overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com finally highlights the largest proprietary collection of original manuscripts and sales catalogs printed since 1700. Owned and collected by Artprice over the last three decades  this collection acts as the fundamental core of Artprice's digital standardization of the art market and legitimizes its position as Global Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years.After the overhaul of our Artists Homepages  Artprice customers and prospects will have access to several centuries of knowledge organized over 25 years by Artprice's historians and editors. Access to this historical information has been structured in a perfectly intuitive and natural way so that users can immerse themselves in the exceptional and complex history of the art market.These new pages highlight the wealth and depth of Artmarket.com's databases and services  offering a high level of added value. The use of algorithmic AI allows access to highly relevant and personalized recommendations  allowing users to deepen their knowledge of the art market and ultimately generating more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore greater business revenue.This feature also brings Artprice by Artmarket clients and members fully into the Web 3.0 and Art NFTs sphere  giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.Ahead of our major rollout in December 2022  Artprice has listened carefully to both its historical customers and its new customers and prospects.Indeed  with cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. Accustomed to speculation and risk-taking  art enthusiasts and collectors nonetheless  have no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe.Having frequently used the services of Artprice  they have become new clients for Artmarket.com  but they made it clear they needed art prices to be added in both ETH and BTC throughout the entire Artprice databases. This major addition to our platform was completed at the end of 2022.The ultra-targeted digital campaigns on Twitter demonstrate through their returns (3 to 5%) that these new buyers respond with high-end Artprice subscriptions.In addition  Artmarket.com is pleased to have given historical preference to Ethereum which  via an operation baptized ""The Merge"" on 15 September 2022  converted in entire blockchain from a Proof-of-work (PoW) type consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) type mechanism to move to a more environmentally friendly system.According to the Ethereum Foundation  this move was followed by an immediate drop in the total energy consumption of the Ethereum network by 99.9%.Thus  to foster the exchange and sale of Art NFTs on its Marketplace  and given the energy context  Artprice's choice for the Ethereum blockchain is fully in line with the ambitions expressed by France's Minister for the Economy  Bruno Le Maire  as announced in a previous press release:www.actusnews.com/fr/artmarket/cp/2022/10/20/artmarket_com-deja-positionnee-sur-les-nfts-avec-artprice-reagit-a-l_itw-de-bruno-le-maire-donnee-a-bfm-crypto-voulant-faire-deThis week  the French-language weekly business magazine has headlined its February issue (772) with the following title: ""What if Ethereum had the keys to blockchain success? Experiencing rapid growth  the decentralized cryptocurrency platform presents itself as one of the ""green"" options in the sector. A strategy that is convincing more and more investors and institutions"".thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com emphasizes: ""In its various annual reports on the Art Market and its regulated information it publishes as a listed company  Artprice by Artmarket.com has always said concerning NFTs that it is impossible to apprehend this new market without a perfect knowledge of the relevant Monetary & Financial Codes and Intellectual Property Codes of the countries in which the market is operating. Similarly  to appreciate the nature of this market (experiencing exponential growth)  one also needs a true understanding of Blockchain  cryptocurrencies  and their cultural origins among the Cypherpunks (period of PGP-type data encryption at the beginning of 1990)""These regulations have been the subject of studies  colloquia  and proposals to major French and European government bodies by Blanche Sousi and the Art & Law Institute  with whom Artprice by Artmarket has been heavily involved as a long-standing member since 1997.2023: more than ever  Artprice's eco-responsible philosophy must set an example in the world of data centers.According to thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice:""Artprice by Artmarket.com has patiently and methodically given itself all the means to evolve in response to the needs of Art Market professionals. All the indicators are positive for the future and we project a doubling of revenue  notably by opening up to paying advertisers integrated into our services and databasesWe have also developed  since 2017  processes to optimize the use of our servers  by limiting the power required and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers by 40%. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energiesThrough its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies concerning new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ""formativity"" (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a 'climatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Server Group  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and which is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture  and the sentiments of our customers.Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

At this time  all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. And the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation.Let me now turn the floor over to Mr. Jan Strecker.Jan StreckerWelcome  ladies and gentlemen  and thank you for joining us today to go through our preliminary 2022 results  as well as the outlook for 2023.With me are Theodor Weimer  Chief Executive Officer; and Gregor Pottmeyer  Chief Financial Officer. Theodor and Gregor will take you through the presentation. And afterwards  we will be happy to take your questions. The link to the presentation material for this call has been sent out via e-mail and they can also be downloaded from the Investor Relations section of our website. As usual  this conference call is recorded and will be available for replay afterwards.With this  let me now hand over to you  Theodor.Theodor WeimerThank you  Jan. Also welcome from my side  ladies and gentlemen. Let me start the call today with a review of the exceptional development of the year 2022. We did not only significantly overachieve our original guidance for the year  but reached already the targets we have set ourselves for this year and our Compass 2023 strategic plan.The year turned out to be quite different from what we had initially expected. Our expectation was for continued growth out of own efforts by addressing the secular trends in our industry. So steady steps towards our mid-term goals. At least it was the plan. But reality was different. Initially  it was to market volatility in the context of the terrible war in Ukraine. Throughout the year  we then saw the corresponding implications on European energy markets. And finally  spiking inflation rates have resulted in swift actions by central banks around the globe and significantly increasing interest rates.In this environment  characterized by uncertainty  we are a trusted and reliable party for our clients to manage and hedge their exposures. This has resulted in  by far  the highest level of cyclical growth we have seen in a long time. Cyclical net revenue growth contributed 14 percentage points out of the overall net revenue growth of 24%. But it was also very encouraging to see the continued secular net revenue growth  which amounted to 7%. This is really the result of the many initiatives to win new clients and market share  as well as introducing new products and services over the last couple of years.The development in 2022 also underscores the quality of our business portfolio. The strong results are not just driven by single businesses  but by double-digit net revenue growth in almost all business lines. Since the development in 2022 by far exceeded our initial expectations  we revised our initial guidance of around EUR3.8 billion upwards throughout the year and have now also exceeded the last guidance of more than EUR4.1 billion by a clear margin.The implementation of our Compass 2023 strategic plan has further improved our position and potential for ongoing sustainable growth as you can see on page two of our presentation. Consistent secular net revenue growth with a 6% CAGR  since 2019 has become the key pillar of our growth strategy. And most importantly  we have achieved this in all different kinds of market environments.We have successfully executed and integrated our M&A initiatives since 2019  and we see further opportunities in the pipeline. This has made M&A a reliable addition to our organic growth aspirations. M&A has helped to strengthen our proposition in Data & Analytics and position us as one of the top three global ESG data providers. This has also led to an increase of the share of recurring revenues to around 60%.Tokenization and digitization are very important trends for us. And we started to lay the foundation to expand into new asset classes and service offerings with a number of different initiatives. This will be accelerated by the strategic partnership with Google Cloud that we announced today.In terms of the financial progress of Compass 2023 on page three  it is fair to say that we achieved our financial targets already one year earlier than planned. As you will recall  our target was to grow net revenues and EBITDA at 10% CAGR between 2019 and 2023. But so far  the actual net revenue growth amounted to 14% CAGR and the EBITDA growth to 15% CAGR even.In terms of the different growth components  stronger-than-expected secular growth compensated to slightly lower contribution from M&A  and cyclicality became a significant tailwind we previously did not expect. As a result  we already achieved the EUR4.3 billion net revenue last year  which we had originally targeted for 2023.With that  let me hand over to you  Gregor.Gregor PottmeyerThank you  Theodor. On page four  we show the details of the preliminary results for the full-year. The financial performance throughout the year was very positive with the fourth quarter even being the strongest one from a net revenue perspective. The main drivers for the strong performance shifted somewhat during the year. In the first half  the development was driven more by market volatility  whereas in the second half  we saw increasing benefits from higher interest rates.The operating cost development during the full-year  you see on page five  has been stronger compared to our initial expectation. But we think this was due to a combination of factors that was very specific to 2022. Firstly  M&A effects contributed 4% to cost growth. They were still mainly driven by the ISS acquisition in 2021. Secondly  the FX effect from the stronger U.S. dollar resulted in a 3% operating cost increase. But at the same time  this FX effect was also beneficial to the net revenue development  particularly in Data & Analytics. This brings us to the more meaningful constant currency organic operating cost growth of 10%.On the one hand  it was driven by inflationary effects from building operations  general purchasing and higher staff costs. On the other hand  we had to continue to increase the provisions for variable and share-based compensation in light of the favorable financial development and relative share price performance. In addition  we saw higher IT and growth investments  as well as higher travel and marketing costs  compared to the depressed situation in 2021 resulting from the pandemic.This brings me to the details of the fourth quarter results on page six of the presentation. While the secular growth developed broadly in line with our expectations  cyclical tailwinds remained very strong. The cyclical growth was driven  in particular  by further increasing interest rates and the continued high levels of collaterals in our clearing houses.The M&A effects  again  had minor impact in the fourth quarter  since they were only driven by some of the smaller  more recent acquisitions. The explanation I just provided on the operating cost development for the full-year  you can generally also be applied to the fourth quarter. While the M&A impact on the operating cost has become smaller  compared to the previous quarters  the impact from the stronger U.S. dollar continued to be quite meaningful.The constant currency organic operating cost growth again  was mainly driven by inflation. This item also includes the inflation compensation bonus we paid across the group in December  amounting to around EUR20 million. The aim was to bring some of the inflationary pressure forward into 2022.The EBITDA in the fourth quarter included a negative result from financial investments  which is mainly an FX effect on the valuation of Clarity AI  compared to the third quarter and lower valuation of some of the fintech funds. Depreciation and amortization included one-off effect from smaller software impairments. And the financial result included a positive FX effect.I'm now turning to the quarterly results of the segments  starting with Data & Analytics on page seven. We continue to see very good organic net revenue growth in the segment. This was mainly driven by the continuing trend towards ESG  which resulted in higher demand for our products and services. Analytics net revenue was stronger  compared to the preceding quarters. But in Q4 ‚Äô21  we had much higher point-in-time revenues from new client contracts. The other line  which is mainly the ISS Market Intelligence business  still included some inorganic growth from the acquisition of Discovery Data.Index includes around EUR20 million relating to a volume-based license fee reimbursement from Eurex. This is a large number because it was applied retrospectively for ‚Äò21 and ‚Äò22. You can see the corresponding volume-related costs in index derivatives net revenue in the Trading & Clearing segment. So it's almost neutral from the group's perspective. Most of our direct U.S. dollar exposure is in the Data & Analytics segment  from the ISS and Axioma subsidiaries. But the constant currency net revenue growth in the fourth quarter was still very strong with around 16%.Let me turn to slide eight  the Trading & Clearing segment. We saw some normalization of market volatility in the fourth quarter. However  hedging needs in asset classes  like fixed income  gas and foreign exchange continue to be high. In financial derivatives at Eurex  the improving equity market condition resulted in some decline of demand for index derivatives. But interest rate derivatives and the OTC clearing continued to perform well. In addition  collateral levels in the clearinghouse continue to be on an elevated level  broadly in line with the third quarter.In commodities  we achieved another record quarter  because of the increased trading and hedging needs of our clients in gas products and due to the higher margin fees. While the power trading activity has somewhat recovered  compared to the second and third quarter  the high margin requirements are still a burn for our clients. In January this year  we have seen collateral levels coming down quite meaningfully. This should generally be good for volumes  in particular  in power derivatives.In the cash equity business  we continue to see headwinds from elevated levels of retail participation in 2021 and lower equity market volatility towards the end of last year  but market share levels have started to recover since December. As a result of higher currency volatility  the demand for our FX products continue to be elevated  and we again  achieved a very strong quarter.In the Fund Services segment on page nine  the continued onboarding of new clients and funds more or less offset the cyclical headwinds from the market performance compared to the very strong equity market at the end of 2021. In addition  we saw the inorganic contribution of the Kneip acquisition  which was closed at the end of March. In the operating expense base of the segment  we saw a few bigger effects in the quarter. They related to the integration of Kneip and the carve-out of the Fund Services business from Clearstream  which will be completed in 2023.Our Securities Services segment on slide 10  saw a significant acceleration of growth in the fourth quarter. Headwinds from equity market performance and lower retail participation were overcompensated by solid levels of fixed income issuance activity  some effects on assets under custody denominated in U.S. dollar and the collateral management business with a growth of more than 30%. In addition  the net interest income has increased almost ten-fold compared to last year. This was driven by much higher U.S. interest rates and increasing European interest rates. Furthermore  the cash balances have continue to increase compared to the preceding quarters.This brings me to our dividend proposal for 2022 on page 11. Our proposal combines an increase of the dividend by 13% to EUR3.60  with a further reduction of the payout ratio. We are planning to reinvest the remaining recurring free cash into the business to support our M&A strategy and thus  further improve our secular and recurring growth components.With that  let me hand back to you  Theodor  to present our outlook for 2023.Theodor WeimerThank you  Gregor. Despite an extremely strong year 2022  we expect to achieve further growth in 2023 as well. We expect the secular trends  like the move from OTC to on-exchange trend towards passive investing  or higher demand for it‚Äôs cheaper [Indiscernible] outsourcing the funds industry to continue to support our organic growth. Our diversified business model and a track record over the years gives us a lot of confidence that we will continue to deliver on the secular side of the equation.With regard to the potential cyclical development  the net interest income in Security Services is clearly expected to continue to grow quite substantially  but the comparables in Trading & Clearing are generally high  and volume and volatility patterns might be somewhat different this year. Who knows? We continue to expect to complement organic growth with M&A  and the environment has also improved slightly over the last couple of quarters. But at the same time  we are patient when it comes to finding the best solutions with regards to strategic fit and financial terms.We will manage operating costs effectively  depending on the net revenue development and thus  have some flexibility to offset potential cyclical headwinds. We will continue to invest in new technologies to improve our operating efficiency and tap into new revenue opportunities in the longer-term. We have already set new standards with our multi-cloud strategy that we started a couple of years ago. Already around 35% of our IT operations today are running in the public cloud.As we announced this morning  we have entered into a 10-year strategic partnership with Google Cloud. Google Cloud will be our preferred partner to enhance and economize our cloud adoption. We are targeting a public cloud exposure of around 70%  7-0 percent  over time. In addition  we will be launching joint projects to accelerate the development of new and innovative platforms. Examples are the acceleration of the development of our digital securities platform D7  for post-trading and the joint buildup of a completely new digital-as-a-platform for new asset classes. So we'll cover both the securities part as well as the new asset class part.Information Technology is at the core of our DNA  and to not only meet  but anticipate customer demand is key for us. But to be very clear  our core infrastructure is state-of-the-art and not affected by the partnership. And our cooperations  especially low latency trading and clearing systems will remain on-premise.In terms of effective steering  we will maintain an active portfolio management  a great further strategic optionality. One example is the new organizational setup of securities and Fund Services that will be completed this year. Overall  we are targeting net revenue of between EUR4.5 billion and EUR4.7 billion and EBITDA of between EUR2.6 billion and EUR2.8 billion for 2023. Our guidance is mainly based on continued secular growth. The range reflects different potential cyclical scenarios  including market volatility and interest rates against high comparables.Since we achieved our Compass 2023 goals already last year  we have already kicked off and started working on a new strategic plan. We plan to present our thoughts on the evaluation of our strategy at the Investor Day this year  which is scheduled for June 28. We are looking forward to welcome many of you here in Frankfurt.This concludes our presentation. We are now looking forward to your questions. Thank you.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] And first up is Haley Tam from Credit Suisse. Over to you.Haley TamHello. Thank you very much for taking my question and congratulations on a strong set of results. Can I ask a question about the 2023 revenue and EBITDA guidance you've given us? It is very clear that you've tried to think about the cyclical scenarios  as well as the secular growth? But could you help us understand the parameters of that guidance. So for example  what assumptions you might have made regarding Clearstream collateral balances for the Fed fund ECB rate pathways and the likelihood of any sharing of net interest income uplift with your users? Thank you very much.Gregor PottmeyerYes. Thanks  Haley. Obviously  for this question  everybody's interested in what are the parameters for our guidance  right? So to say it's quite simple  right? So the midpoint is roughly a 6% increase  so the EUR4.6 billion  compared to 2022. And that's basically exactly the secular growth component we expect  so that is the very easy answer.To go into the next level  there will be most probably pluses and minus from a cyclical aspect. So a big plus  obviously  we will see on our NII specifically or Clearstream  obviously. But there are some questions or the potential minus on the Trading & Clearing as we had highest volatility levels in 2022. So with volatility levels of 25 to 30  and so the current level is roughly 20. So obviously  that's less compared to last year. So most probably that will balance out from our perspective and what we basically include in our guidance.With regard to the customer cash balances  as you explicitly mentioned that for the NII calculation at Clearstream. So the good thing is that the cash balances did not reduce so far. It's still in the EUR18 billion level  and that's obviously good to see. And indeed  in our forecasting  we had assumed that the cash balances would go down a little bit  right? So this did not happen so far. That's obviously good.But doing now this forecasting  we still assume with this increased rates  and rates will continue to increase following the Fed announcement and the ECB announcement  right? There will be pressure from a customer perspective to  on the one hand side  potentially reduce the customer cash balances. On the other hand side  to -- that we share some of the revenues. Therefore  we did roughly a 20% discount in our calculation.OperatorSo now we're coming to the next questionnaire  who is Andrew Coombs from Citi.Andrew CoombsGood morning. Thank you for that. If I turn to Eurex  interested in your thoughts on the benefits from the recent repricing initiatives you've done from the 1st of January. I can see some of the pricing on the stock that's being on the future contracts. And in CME  in their recent results  they're talking about a 4% to 5% increase in aggregate. So anything you can say on pricing and what the implications are for Eurex revenues this year? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes. Thanks  Andrew. Obviously  you are perfectly right. And it's public knowledge  obviously  that we increased pricing at our Eurex product  beginning from January 1. So the impact on the Eurex revenue is roughly 3%  right? So that's obviously much more what we usually do. So our guidance overall is roughly some 1% price increase in average for Deutsche Borse group level  right?So -- and now this Eurex increase is quite close to the 1% on group level. But we use  obviously  the timing and the high inflation from 2022. And obviously  it does not disappear in 2023. So it was reasonable for us to do a little bit more  compared to things we did in the past but we do it always with market consultation. And so far  this price increase was accepted by market participants.Andrew CoombsThank you.OperatorNext up is Mike Werner from UBS.Mike WernerThank you very much for the opportunity to ask question. Just talking about the potential for M&A. Theodor  I think you mentioned in a couple  three or four months ago that from an M&A perspective  you were telling your team that you're going to hold off on doing new M&A. You thought prices  I think  were set to fall further. The bid ask spread  probably too narrow. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about M&A at the time right now? How does that bid-ask spread come in? And do you see a lot of opportunities? Are you getting a lot of incomings from potential targets? Thank you.Theodor WeimerThank you  Mike  for the question. Substantially  our stance hasn't changed dramatically to the last time we saw and the public multiples were coming down on the private side -- private capital side. We see lots of interest to talk  because people still believe they can sell off their assets at a very high multiple. And of course  people need to understand that the weighted average cost of capital has significantly increase. And therefore  we all play this in the discussions.But to be very clear  we see continued inbound calls. We have certain criteria  which we need to fulfill  right? And we are also very  very careful  right  to look into the potential acquisition targets from a very balanced point of view  strategically and financially balanced. What do I mean by this? It's very clear  our margin perfectly  EBITDA margin  which is fortunately extremely high  and we will continue to keep high margins  right? That is actually a promise on our side.On the other side  we want to grow. If you want to grow  you can grow organically or you can inorganically  leaving aside a cyclical part  right? And therefore  if you want to grow  and organically  if you want to go into deals  what we are potentially ready to do  then you have to take into consideration that whenever you do a deal  it will be per se and [Indiscernible] margin dilutive  right  margin dilutive  which is a big hurdle we have to overcome. So that is more expensive. Equity is anyway is expensive  right? And then you've got the margin dilution.Therefore  we are very careful  right  how to deal with such situations. And as I said this morning during the press conference of the presentation of the full-year numbers  for me  as soon as we are getting into larger deals or potentially larger deals  right  since the effect is so big on the financials  I need to get into -- we need to get into situations where the synergy potential is pretty high  right? That is how we approach the situation.And last but not least  right? We are completely agnostic  right? Don't get us wrong  right? We think we can go for M&A  but we are not desperate  right? And if we compare at the end of the day  right  M&A deals towards other alternatives  right  and there's a full spectrum  M&A on the one hand side  the other hand side is  I would say  share buybacks  right? So we take it completely agnostic. We want to do the best for the investors. That's our determination.Mike WernerAnd just a quick follow-up  if you don't mind. Your weighted average cost of capital internally  what is it for you guys now? And how does that compare to  let's say  back in 2021?Gregor PottmeyerYes  Mike  obviously  our WACC increased as it increased for the whole industry due to the increase. And it depends  obviously  the WACC we take  when we do for M&A  depends in which business we invest in which region  in which maturity level  right? So it's different overall. On group level  our WACC is roughly 7%.Mike WernerThank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank.Benjamin GoyYes  hi. Good afternoon. One question on ISS  please. I was wondering on the number of covered corporates  what are the plans for '23 and how this could impact the client acquisition going forward? Thank you.Theodor WeimerWe didn't quite catch it. So you mean the number of clients at ISSBenjamin GoyI noted the number of covered corporate. So will you have a...Gregor PottmeyerI understand. Okay. Now  I got it. Sorry  Benjamin. Yes  we make good progress  right? So the number increased from roughly 7 000 to 7 800  right  as we hired 100 analyst research guys in Manila. And so far  we made good progress  but we are still not there where we want to be  right? So we still need  let's say  another 800 to cover the full spectrum  what is needed  right? And therefore  we are still working on this topic in ‚Äò23 as a high priority for us. The latest  end of 2023  we have all the capabilities at our hands so that we cover our customer needs. And then we have much better opportunities to increase our market share here.With regard to the quality  customers are very satisfied  are happy with our ratings. They are even better  the quality  compared to our competitors. And so  if you have catched-up here on the number of corporate rating  I think we are very well positioned to gain additional market share.Benjamin GoyThank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Tom Mills from Jefferies.Tom MillsHi  good afternoon. I had a quick question on your Fund Services business. Obviously  you alluded to the sort of step down in profitability that you saw in 4Q. Could you say perhaps how you might expect that profitability to be impacted throughout ‚Äò23 as you go through the remainder of the carve-out of that business? And will it take the whole sort of 12 months  do you think  to be done? And if you wanted to do M&A in this space  would it sort of require completion of that carve-out before you kind of consider doing it?Gregor PottmeyerYes  Tom. Good question with regard to our Fund Services business. And it's obviously that the profitability decreased in 2022  but there are good reason for that. So first  you are aware that we carve out basically the business out of the Clearstream overall organization  due to the fact that clients are different  processes are different  systems are different. So it makes us more focused and more agile.Secondly  we've got now a new banking license  right  for that kind of business to increase our product and offer spectrum. So that is obviously an important thing. Then thirdly  we are in the process to build up a new banking account system here. So having this banking license  also having a proper contract management system here in place. So that's the reason why 2022 and 2023 is elevated from a cost perspective.In addition  we acquired the Funds Data business or the Kneip business  what was not really profitable so far. So we do also here some restructuring and reorganization. And this will take also a little bit time. So overall  I expect 2023 also due to our project work that the cost will be on an increased level.But from a top line perspective  we are quite confident that we will come back to double-digit growth or even mid-teens growth in 2023 due to our strong pipeline  what we acquired and with all the signed contracts. So we really expect coming back in 2023 with double-digit growth here in our Fund Services business. And overall  the targeted EBITDA margin  including all costs will be in the range of 55%.Tom MillsAnd just on the M&A point there  does the sort of restructuring work over the course of ‚Äò23 prevent you from doing additional M&A?Theodor WeimerThank you  Tom  for the question  right? And it's good that you're insisting here. So from a CEO point of view  the following  right? Generally speaking  the carve-out process will not limit our ability  right? We are so far progressed that we could move ahead  right  with partnering. The idea of carving out the ISS business and the Clearstream business was  at the end of the day  to enhance our ability for strategic partnerships  right?And it is  at the end of the day  an optionality for us to do something. An optionality does not necessarily mean that we take -- that we go for the option  to be very clear. This has -- we have many others -- many other dimensions  which we needed to balance. It's a strategic balance. It's a financial capability. It's the other side as always. It's a strategic fit. It's the financial fit. And so for that  I don't want to go too much in detail.But I think at the end of the day  a key driver for this year or in this company is great optionality  don't let yourself -- don't get into a situation that you feel pushed to do an M&A deal. That's always the worst thing  what can happen. And therefore  we take this very calm. And we have -- and that's a good position. We have many optionalities on the table  right  be it strategically  be it financially  right? And at the end of the day  that is what we are doing here  and that is what we can share with you.Tom MillsThanks very much  Theodor and Gregor.OperatorNext up is Gregory Simpson from BNP Paribas Exane.Gregory SimpsonHi  thank you for taking my questions. And just would like to ask about the margin fees of Eurex and EEX  which has seen a lot of growth in 2022 due to cash flow levels. Can you help frame where collateral levels are right now versus peak? What could be sustainable levels? And linked to that  is there any feedback you're hearing from participants in the EEX now energy prices have fallen? Do you think volumes can kind of grow from here as people going to come back? Any color would be great.Gregor PottmeyerYes. Thanks  Gregory. So starting with EEX. So obviously  in 2022  we have seen highest volatility  so price increases of 10 times and even more. And as a result  we asked for high margins  right? So before the crisis  we had some EUR5 billion margins in our clearinghouse. And in peak times  we had even above EUR100 billion. So on average  it was roughly EUR50 billion in 2022. And now in January  it comes back to a level of a little bit above EUR20 billion. So that's the EUR20 billion we also assume as our base case assumption for us for the full year 2023.With regard to Eurex here  we have also seen increased volatility and increased margins  but there are different reasons for this increased margins. It's not just pure volatility. It's also due to our secular growth  specifically in our interest rate for business. So therefore  we do not expect that the margins will materially go down. I would assume a little bit go down  but not as significantly as -- at EEX.Gregory SimpsonThank you. Maybe just a quick follow-up  if that's okay. What's the amount of assets under administration on the fund distribution business? I think it was less about EUR400 billion. What are we today? And also the timing of the large client win  HSBC? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerSo the assets under management in our funds business is around EUR400 billion.Gregory SimpsonAnd in HSBC that is imminent or...Gregor PottmeyerThis will obviously increase with that level when it's finalized. So it's not included in that number. It will increase.Gregory SimpsonThank you.OperatorNext up is Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley.Bruce HamiltonHi  good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions  answer the presentation. Just going back to M&A. I mean  obviously  you're in quite a good position. Just to check  I think your net debt to EBITDA now is in the low 1s  around 1.2 or 1.3  if you could just confirm. And if you could remind us  I think when you consider deals and what the credit rating will sort of give flexibility for that would allow you to go to say sort of 2.5 times. I'm just trying to understand what the existing sort of flexibility is to do deals because it seems like there's quite a lot?And then in terms of the  I guess  within your strategic growth priorities and given what's happened to pricing  is there any particular area that's kind of looking more interesting as you sit here today  be it data  Fund Services  post trade or trading? Anything in terms of perhaps the skew of what's coming across in terms of incoming that might be interesting? Thanks.Theodor WeimerSo Bruce  thanks for your question. Starting with the first one. So indeed  our rating relevant KPIs net debt to EBITDA  decreased to 1.2. And I think you are aware that the threshold for AA rating is 1.75. So if you do the math  it's more than EUR1 billion  obviously  flexibility here.But I would like to comment a little bit more general on our financial flexibility. So for an M&A transaction  so the funding  the refinancing is not a limitation for Deutsche Borse. The reason for that is  okay  of course  today  we have some even more flexibility. Then our cash generation is very  very big and very quickly. Obviously  in 2022  we have some cash flow of more than EUR2 billion  right? So that's obviously big number. And here  you can see the financial power we can create out of our increased cash flow over time.Then from an M&A perspective  we are also very open  how does the performance look like. So if we bring in an asset  so we don't have to pay additional money or to increase our debt or equity level. So we are very flexible with regard to that format  and we have already done such deals. And obviously  we have also some equity authorization from our AGM. And in my discussion with investors  they tell us if there's a good asset with good quality and if it's financially attractive and then we are also flexible to support you with additional equity. And therefore  that's in basically our summary that funding is not a limited factor in -- for an M&A deal.Secondly  or the other way around from going from the liability side to the asset side. So where do we want to invest? So our priorities are basically unchanged. So priority number one is our Data & Analytics business  where we have seen big investments over the last three to five years. This Axioma  this ISS and so on just to tell the most prominent one. And so  we are still missing some capabilities here  and we are very open to do deals in that area  again  when it makes financial leasing  when it makes from a strategic perspective and sense.The second area where you have seen M&A transaction from us  and we potentially will continue to see is in the investment Fund Services business where the customer is always the choice to connect to our platform  to outsource or even to sell the business  right? And we are very flexible with all of these three formats. And this customer decides to sell the business for us  and then we show this as an M&A transaction. And so  Fund Services is really continue to be of high interest for Deutsche Borse.Bruce HamiltonGreat. Thank you very much.OperatorThe next question comes from Philip Middleton from the Bank of America.Philip MiddletonHey  good afternoon and thank you for that call. You've talked a little bit about inflation in respect to Eurex. But I wondered  could you talk us through how you see pricing moving in the rest of your portfolio  including obviously the data businesses and beyond. What -- how much inflation can you pass through apart from the Eurex segment  please?Gregor PottmeyerYes. Thanks  Philip. Obviously  we do that in all of our business segments  right? If you see that high inflation of 8% to 10%  basically now not just for 12-months  most probably even for a longer time horizon then is natural as all the pricing increases around us that we also increase our pricing here. And basically  we did some price increases in all our business segments across the board here. And it's not always a direct price increase  so increasing some fees. It's also some volume rebates where you do some optimization and so on. So overall  it's again  it's more than 1% and price increase in closer to 2%.But looking forward  right  normalization  our general target is not to focus on price increase. Obviously  our focus is to get additional liquidity and to increase our market share. So that's by far our most important intention. And these are just temporary effects what we use as we see high inflation last year and most probably also this year.Philip MiddletonOkay  thank you very much.OperatorThe next question comes from Johannes Thormann from HSBC.Johannes ThormannGood afternoon  everybody. [Indiscernible] First of all  a follow-up question on the NII sharing with customers. We are now at a level which you previously did not ever expect to see and then probably where you would also think that customers would be unhappy about it. How much revenue sharing do we -- or should we put into our models from the next rate hikes? Should we expect that the customer gets all of the rate increases? 50%? What's your gut feeling?And then my question is mainly on the OTC clearing now. Could you -- because this is getting hidden in the fixed income derivatives business. Can you elaborate a bit more on progress on market share and especially the revenue generation in that business? And then what's your view on June 2025 when -- how do you expect the commission to decide. To prolong or to cut the clearing agreement?Gregor PottmeyerYes. Thanks  Johannes. With regard to the NII topic  I think  I covered that already  but we'll repeat it. So there's open -- so you can do some technical calculation  right? So starting with the EUR18 billion customer cash balances  50% is U.S. dollar  35% is euro  15% other currencies. So far  we did not lose any of these customer cash balances that even slightly increased. But nevertheless  as the rate starts to continue to increase  so it's a question whether these customer cash balances go down? And secondly  whether there is additional pressure with regard to revenue sharing?So far  we do not share revenues  right? And so far  the balances did not decrease. So far  so good. But you have to consider this increased pressure. And therefore  we calculated in our base case scenario  some 20% discount to the technical numbers you could calculate. And how it develops and how it contributes with regard to reduced cash balances or revenue share  we do not know. It's just a 20% discount roughly. So that would be our best guess today. So that's the first question.The second question around the euro clearing. So far  we made the progress as expected. So we have EUR31 trillion notional outstanding volume that translates in a market share of roughly 20%. The net revenue  we got from the OTC clearing space was in 2022 more than EUR90 million. So we guided some five years ago  EUR50 million to EUR70 million  and we achieved the EUR60 million  the midpoint in ‚Äò21. But in 2022  increased more than 50%  more than EUR90 million. And we are quite confident that we will continue to significantly grow that kind of business.Yes  there was a delay of the regulation by three years  unfortunately  from June 2022 to June 2025. But on the other hand side  we see clear direction from EU commission and also from ECB  so that they really expect that the euro clearing will be increasingly managed within the Eurozone office in the EU. And therefore  currently in this draft legislation  we talk about an active account  right? That it's not accepted anymore  but they just build the connectivity to the platform so that they really use it.And currently  out of our 600 customers that are onboarded at Eurex clearing  roughly 300 or 50% is inactive. And if you see here now some movements also pushed by some expectations from EU commission and ECB  that would obviously significantly help us. On top  we did this kind of activation program for some incentivation  we decided to introduce that. So there's an additional incentive for market participants to join our platform. So overall  we are quite confident that you will see continued growth already this year but also in ‚Äò24 and ‚Äò25.Johannes ThormannThank you.OperatorNext up is Kyle Voigt from KBW.Kyle VoigtHi  thank you for taking my question. With respect to the cloud partnership you announced today  can you just talk about the key revenue opportunities that you see coming from this partnership? You noted that  at a minimum  this could significantly help your data distribution?And then how quickly do you think we -- that you would be in a position to launch new products as a result of the cloud migration? Should we be thinking about that as an opportunity in year one or year two of that cloud partnership? Or even further out than that?Theodor WeimerI'll take this one  Kyle. Firstly  we have entered into this partnership with a clear path to develop the digital asset platform  right? And therefore  the new asset losses need to emerge. And as a CEO and as ExCo  we have the obligation  right  to stay ahead of the curve because we are the leading European capital market infrastructure provider  right? And I think it's our obligation to be ahead of the curve. Something is cooking out there. You see in the United States  lots of new asset classes are coming. You see  especially on the real estate side  trading and so forth  right? So it's pretty clear this is more than just noise at the far horizon.When this will emerge and how it will emerge  nobody knows. The old rule is you overestimated the effect for the first 12-months  right? You underestimate the effect for the first five years  right? That's where we stand. So we go into this partnership with Google Cloud  we will develop this IT digitized based as a platform  right? And then  right  it is -- yes  if you have the opportunity  if there is the supply there  if the product -- if the IT capability is there  then this will create demand  right? That it will create demand  right? So we are working on the product offering  and this will ultimately translate in business  right?We have not yet factored in anything for the year 2023. You will hear a little bit more about this and our plans during the Capital Market Day and the strategy  but we affected in nothing  simply nothing  right? Of course  right  taking at the end of the day  we get software development capacities  we get all the access to the Google Cloud people  right? So we are here. We will set up a new asset platform  both for the new asset classes  and we'll accelerate our already existing D7 platform  right?And what we are currently making out of D7 is a negligible number in the overall context of what we are doing. This is an investment. And we didn't go out to the investors to ask for a 3 digit million of investment  right? We went out and asked  right  how -- what can we do? How can we partner with somebody? That's how you have to perceive this situation.Kyle VoigtThank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Enrico Bolzoni from JPMorgan.Enrico BolzoniHi  thank you. Just a follow-up on M&A. I just wanted to know if you would consider  if an opportunity arises  also more transformational deals rather than just maybe bolt-on deals? I'm thinking  especially in the Fund Services business or general in the non  let's say  traditional exchange part of the business. Thank you.Theodor WeimerThank you  Enrico  for this question  right? And my apologies for not laying out our full M&A strategy here. I think that is not appropriate. But one thing is for sure  right? We do not start  we do not exclude any kind of deals per se  right? Given the situation we are in  right  given the financial constraints we are having in terms of dilution of EPS  right? There's only very few transformation leads out there  which are striking to us  right?And if you simply look into what we've done  this string of pearls  how we are doing our strategy piece by piece  right? We can do larger deals  but it also depends on what is the definition of a transformational deal  right? One thing is for sure  I'm not out there and talking about  can I do a type of a merger of equals  whatever  yes  you have in your mind stuff. That is not what we are doing.Enrico BolzoniThanks.OperatorAnd now we have Ian White from Autonomous Research on the line.Ian WhiteHi  thanks for taking the presentation. Just a few short follow-ups for me  please  if that's okay? First up  can you just share any CapEx expectations for us for 2023  please?And secondly  maybe just if I could ask a bit more detail around the thinking in relation to the Google agreement. It sounds  like you're not considering  at this stage  migrating your sort of core trading technology to the cloud. And I think some of your global peers are sort of going down that route. Could you just explain your thinking around that? Is that something that you might consider in the future? Or is it completely off the table  please?And just finally  on Axioma. Can you just explain  kind of  the outlook for that business place? I think growth has been a bit weaker in that side of the Data & Analytics business this year. Is there kind of some change you can make on the sales side or a more attractive pipeline for 2023  please? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes. So I'll start with the CapEx question  2023. So it's roughly EUR300 million. With regard to the Axioma outlook  we think in 2023  we have a reasonable chance to come back to higher growth rates. Whether it's double digit  we will see  but the pipeline so far looks quite promising.Theodor WeimerOn the Google agreement  Ian  the following. Firstly  we have coinvented with some others if I may say so  the electronification of the trading systems  right? And we have been a protagonist there. Later on  we have been a protagonist with the futurization  which is the derivative part and where we are now having a top three position at least  right  at least. And now we see  right  the next S-curve  right  if I may use this term  the next S-curve is the new asset class digitization  right? And therefore  it's very clear that is what we are going for.We will not touch the low latency situation on trading guide  why should we? We are good. We are -- quite frankly  we are top  whatever we are. At least we are ahead of the bunch  right  should I include this into this context. Others have different strategies. Others have different starting positions. Others have different business models  right? I do not care too much about others. I care about what is best fit for us  right  on this side. And we are completely convinced that this innovation part of it together with the data strategy that is the best fit for us.Ian WhiteOkay. Thanks very much.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Tobias Lukesch from Kepler Cheuvreux.Tobias LukeschYes  good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Finally  coming to cost. I was wondering  if I take your cost base this year  and you said you were quite successful actually preempting some of the costs in ‚Äò23 already in ‚Äò22 also inflation-linked  you potentially have -- will not have such a high compensation effect maybe in 2023. I was wondering if we go with the secular growth and apply kind of 6% cost growth  if you agree to come out in  let's say  1.85 space?And then in the second step  I was wondering how much of OpEx? You mentioned additional spending in the fund service space  like this year -- well ‚Äò22. How much this would potentially add? And potentially also some further investments in the technology you mentioned. So is this something which is potentially significantly above spending we have seen in earlier years? Or would you think this is more or less in line? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes  Tobias. As you can derive from our guidance  right? So our guidance on the cost base is roughly EUR1.9 billion  right? So just subtracting net revenues and EBITDA  okay? There are some financial results in between but  let's say  the EUR1.9 billion  and that's a 4% cost increase  or 4% to 5%. And so  our message is that in 2023  we will come back to the guidance we always gave. So for roughly 5% plus secular growth  we need roughly some up to 5% cost increase  and that's exactly what is included in our guidance. And so far  we are quite confident that we are able to achieve this target.And the 17% cost increase you have seen for 2022  there were really some specific effects related to year 2022. I don't want to repeat all of the reasons. And the majority or a bulk of that will disappear in 2023. So that gives us also the chance  and I gave already the number of CapEx  roughly EUR300 million that we can do reasonable investments to continue to grow with our business.Tobias LukeschYes. Thanks  Gregor. However  if I calculate basically on  let's say  a bit of a clean cost base that you see get to 8%. And I was just wondering if you this time  like potentially are a bit more vigilant on the cost side. But I understand you that a kind of EUR1.9 billion figure is something you have in focus  and it will be kind of -- sure on that. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerThat‚Äôs exactly.OperatorAnd the last question comes from Roland Pfnder from ODDO BHF.Roland PfnderYes  thank you for taking my question. I just have one last one. Could you elaborate a little bit on your cash equities business and the market share development here  what you see will change? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes. Obviously  we were not really happy about the development in 2022 as we lost some market share here. I think  I shared that it's below the 60%. And obviously  we have already reacted with the liquidity program. There's not big expenses  and market share already increased back to more than 60%. I think we are able to manage that situation and we will see better market share development in 2023.Roland PfnderThank you.Jan StreckerAll right. Thanks a lot for your participation today. There are no further questions  and we would like to close the call today.

18091,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.energyglobal.com/wind/09022023/encavis-acquires-a-german-wind-farm-after-a-repowering-from-energiekontor/,Encavis acquires a German wind farm after a repowering from Energiekontor,The two wind turbines with a combined rated output of approximately 11.2 MW will generate approximately 28.1 GWh of electricity annually from the first full year of operation.,Hamburg-based  Germany  wind and solar park operator Encavis AG  listed on the MDAX of Deutsche B√∂rse AG  is continuing its successful co-operation with SDAX-listed Energiekontor AG. The acquired wind farm Bergheim in North Rhine-Westphalia  Germany  is a repowering project that can draw on long-term historical data on wind occurrence in the region and thus offers particularly predictable yields. The two wind turbines with a combined rated output of approximately 11.2 MW will generate approximately 28.1 GWh of electricity annually from the first full year of operation. This covers the average annual electricity demand of approximately 10 000 households and saves approximately 20 000 tpy of CO 2 . The commissioning of the two wind turbines is planned for the end of 4Q23.This repowering wind farm project Bergheim  in which new wind turbines replace old ones  developed by Energiekontor  is located in the area of the towns of Bergheim and Pulheim in the Rhine-Erft district of North Rhine-Westphalia. The wind farm benefits from a state-guaranteed feed-in tariff under the renewable energy sources act (EEG) for a term of in total 20 years after commissioning. The renewable energy will be generated by two Vestas V 150-5.6 turbines with a rotor diameter of 150 m and a hub height of 166 m.‚ÄúRepowering wind projects offer particularly predictable and secure yields. Aside from the guaranteed EEG remuneration over 20 years after commissioning  the Bergheim wind farm offers additional attractive earnings potential through the possible conclusion of power purchase agreements ‚Äù said Mario Schirru  Chief Investment Officer/Chief Operating Officer of Encavis AG  welcoming the latest transaction. ‚ÄúWith Encavis and Energiekontor  two Hanseatic companies have been successfully meeting at eye level for years. Both companies are united by their passion and conviction for the economically profitable development of renewable energies ‚Äù Schirru continued.Hamburg-based Encavis AG and Bremen-based Energiekontor AG have already been working together successfully since November 2015. The newly acquired Bergheim wind farm is already the eighth wind project that Energiekontor has sold to Encavis. Both companies want to continue their good co-operation in the future. Together  they are making an important contribution to the energy transition in Germany and actively driving forward the expansion of renewable energies.‚ÄúWe are pleased to have once again successfully concluded the sale of a wind farm project with Encavis as a reliable and long-standing partner. The repowering potential in Germany is increasing with each passing year. The sale of the repowering wind farm project illustrates that we at Energiekontor will continue to consistently exploit this potential in the future and have already secured further attractive repowering projects ‚Äù said Peter Szabo  CEO of Energiekontor AG  commenting on the deal.For more news and technical articles from the global renewable industry  read the latest issue of Energy Global magazine.The Winter 2022 issue of Energy Global hosts an array of technical articles focusing on wind  solar  energy storage  geothermal  and more.

The slight increase in costs only results from costs related to non-volume related revenue growth initiatives. Savings and synergies entirely compensate inflation and business development costs.Status update on synergies in relation to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition : ‚Ç¨ 34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies were achieved at the end of Q4 2022  thanks to restructuring efforts and the migration of the Core Data Centre. ‚Ç¨9.7 million run-rate annual synergies were delivered in Q4 2022. ‚Ç¨44.2 million of cumulated implementation costs incurred at the end of Q4 2022  of which ‚Ç¨6.3 million during Q4 2022.Next steps in the deployment of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan : Euronext upgrades its 2024 annual run - rate pre - tax synergies related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group by ‚Ç¨ 15 millon to ‚Ç¨ 115 million . Implementation costs remain unchanged. Euronext confirmed the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets onto Optiq ¬Æ in March 2023  forming the first phase of the migration  and of Borsa Italiana other markets in Q4 2023 allowing for termination of the third-party provider trading platform contract. Euronext confirmed the phases in the expansion of Euronext Clearing with the expected launch of the equity clearing offering by the end of 2023 and of derivative clearing by Q3 2024. These strategic projects are expected to reach around ‚Ç¨ 7 0 million of cumulated run-rate synergies by the end of 2023  out of the ‚Ç¨115 million targeted. In 2023  Euronext expects to maintain for cash trading an average market share greater or equal to 63%   and revenue capture a round 0.5 2 bps following the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq ¬Æ   considering current market conditions and orders size.Key achievement in the deployment of the ‚Äò Fit for 1.5 ¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy in 2022 : Euronext‚Äôs upgraded SBTi-aligned climate targets were validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative: By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based greenhouse gas emissions by 73.5% compared to 2020; By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 3 business travel emissions by at least 46.2% compared to 2019; By 2027  Euronext suppliers  representing 72% of Euronext‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions derived from purchased goods and services  must set targets on their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.The Group‚Äôs efforts to enhance diversity were recognised through the inclusion of Euronext into the Euronext Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Euronext Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices.St√©phane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:‚ÄúIn 2022  Euronext reached record revenue and income above ‚Ç¨1.4 billion notably resulting from the strong performance of our non-volume related activities  together with efficient management of revenue capture and of cash trading market share. Thanks to our trademark cost discipline  we beat our 2022 revised costs guidance. We achieved an adjusted EBITDA of ‚Ç¨861.6 million that translated into an adjusted EPS of ‚Ç¨5.21. We will propose a total dividend of ‚Ç¨236.6 million at our next annual general meeting to be held in May 2023  representing 50% of our reported net income  excluding NTI loss impact.This year has been crucial in laying the foundations for the future growth of the Group. We have successfully completed the first major milestone of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan with the migration of our Core Data Centre from the UK to Italy. At the end of 2022  we have achieved ‚Ç¨34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies related to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.This fruitful year paves the way for the next steps to be delivered in 2023. The largest single liquidity pool in Europe  operated by Euronext will significantly change dimension with the migration of Italian cash markets to Euronext‚Äôs state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq¬Æ  which will benefit local and global trading members.Euronext Clearing will become the Euronext equity clearing house of choice by the end of 2023  and the CCP for derivatives clearing in Q3 2024. These are the critical bricks to complete our presence across the integrated value chain  allowing us to innovate and shape capital markets in line with evolving client needs  and making Euronext even stronger to deliver future growth.In an inflationary environment  we will contain our costs to a slight increase in 2023  at ‚Ç¨630 million  demonstrating Euronext‚Äôs ability to maintain its cost discipline while investing to generate revenue expansion of our non-volume related activities. We expect to deliver by the end of 2023 around ‚Ç¨70 million of the synergies targeted as part of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan. Our good progress on integration led us to upgrade the total amount of targeted run-rate EBITDA synergies by the end of 2024 from ‚Ç¨100 million to ‚Ç¨115 million. This further demonstrates Euronext‚Äôs successful track record in integrating acquired companies.Our strong performance  combined with the successful ongoing delivery of the planned synergies  is supporting our deleveraging trajectory with a net debt to EBITDA ratio at 2.6x  well below 3.2x at the time of closing of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition. This leaves the Group with flexibility to further deploy capital in value generating opportunities that might arise.Lastly  we are happy to see that our ‚ÄòFit for 1.5¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy is bearing fruit  as our upgraded emission reduction targets have been validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative. We are pleased to see Euronext being included in both the Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices  demonstrating the progress we are making in striving towards more equality.‚ÄùEuronext Q4 and full year 2022 financial performanceFull year 20226In ‚Ç¨m  unless stated otherwiseThe figures in this document have not been audited or reviewed by our external auditor.

The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage by non-volume related underlying revenue ratio was at 141% in 2022  almost stable vs. 2021 (142%).2022 adjusted EBITDAUnderlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased to ‚Ç¨606.1 million  up +14.9%  reflecting the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group costs and continued cost discipline in an inflationary environment. Underlying expenses excluding D&A (‚Ç¨606.1 million) were better than 2022 guidance of ‚Ç¨612 million underlying costs excluding D&A (‚Ç¨622 million initially) thanks to strong cost discipline  project costs being capitalised and one-off positive impacts  including release of accruals and lower-than-anticipated travel and marketing expenses due to the Covid-19 pandemic.On a like-for-like basis  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased slightly by +2.7% compared to 2021  which was positively impacted by the decrease of travel and marketing expenses during the pandemic  highlighting Euronext‚Äôs ability to contain inflation in 2022. On a pro forma basis for the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group on 29 April 2021  underlying operational expenses increased slightly by +2.0%  mainly due to the return of travel and marketing expenses in 2022.Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled ‚Ç¨861.6 million and saw double digit growth  +11.7% compared to 2021.

Dennis Dijkstra‚Äôs intention not to seek reappointment and the CEO succession plan was announced on 18 November 2022OutlookWhile Flow Traders remains committed to bringing onboard additional talent in growth business areas  FTEs are expected to remain broadly flat during 2023 given expected efficiency gains.

Accordingly  normalized fixed operating expenses in 2023 are expected to amount to c. ‚Ç¨175m - ‚Ç¨185m compared to ‚Ç¨161.6m in 2022Substantial progress has been made in the detailed and thorough review of Flow Traders' capital structure as announced at the time of the previous trading update and Flow Traders will remain focused on all arising opportunities to create shareholder value through systematic capital management going forwardManagement CommentsMike Kuehnel  CEO  stated:‚ÄúIn 2022 as a whole  we made considerable progress delivering on our strategic growth ambitions which has seen an even more resilient and diverse business emerge. It is encouraging to see a structural return on our recent investments in the business. Indeed  2022 saw record value traded versus last year across our three asset class pillars and we continue to grow our institutional counterparty base which now stands at more than 2 200. The successful completion of the update to our corporate holding structure means that we now have even greater trading flexibility and have laid the groundwork to undertake any potential inorganic growth activity.‚ÄúOperating expense growth moderated in the fourth quarter and 2023 will see a continued focus on increasing the underlying efficiency of the business as we seek to further leverage the investments made in prior years. We also maintained our conservative capital position while implementing this growth strategy. Remaining cognisant of our trading capital position as well as the growth opportunities ahead  we have elected to pay a ‚Ç¨0.80 per share final dividend to shareholders.‚ÄúDespite increasing competition for talent in the market  we have been successful in attracting and recruiting the best talent and have welcomed many new colleagues in the past year. Lastly  on behalf of the entire Board and ExCo  I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the professionalism  resilience  and loyalty of all our colleagues globally this past year. We are immensely grateful to our colleagues for their tremendous hard work which allowed for our considerable operational and strategic achievements and successes in 2022.‚ÄùFolkert Joling  Chief Trading Officer  added:‚ÄúHeightened levels of market activity delivered a strong trading performance in the fourth quarter with all regions contributing meaningfully. We have continued to expand and broaden our trading activities even further across different products and asset classes and this is reflected in the results achieved throughout 2022. Our robust and prudent approach to risk management meant that we were immaterially affected by the collapse of FTX in November and our status as a listed  transparent  seasoned market participant improved our overall standing with investors and other market participants. As to be expected  we reduced our overall trading capital exposure to the various crypto platforms we trade with  fully recognising the increased risks present in the broader crypto market. This trading capital was naturally deployed to other areas of the business. We retain our conviction around the long-term potential of crypto and DeFi from both a trading as well as a technological and financial markets innovation perspective.‚ÄúLooking ahead for 2023  we remain focused on executing our growth plans with respect to our business lines of Equity  Fixed Income and Crypto  Currencies and Commodities. Our achievements in 2022 have reinforced our confidence in our ability to deliver further growth going forward.‚ÄùPreliminary Financial Calendar24 February 2023 Release 2022 Annual Report31 March 2023 Start Silent Period ahead of Q123 trading update21 April 2023 Release Q123 trading update (no analyst conference call)26 April 2023 AGM28 April 2023 FY22 final dividend proposed ex-dividend date2 May 2023 FY22 final dividend proposed record date4 May 2023 FY22 final dividend proposed payment date30 June 2023 Start silent period ahead of H123 results21 July 2023 Release H123 results (inc. analyst conference call)Analyst Conference Call and WebcastThe Q422 results analyst conference call will be held at 10:00 am CET on Thursday 9 February 2023.

Meanwhile  sanctions against Russia will likely reduce the country‚Äôs oil exports.‚ÄúRight now  we‚Äôre still balanced to a surplus because China has still yet to fully rebound ‚Äù Currie tells Bloomberg. But the analyst notes that by May  the oil market could swing to a supply deficit.And that‚Äôs not all.‚ÄúAre we going to run out of spare production capacity? Potentially by 2024  you start to have a serious problem.‚ÄùDon't missGoldman Sachs says bitcoin is not investable ‚Äî this is where they think you should put 33% of your wealth instead'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile  refrigerator  or whatever' ‚Äî here are 3 better recession-proof buysYou could be the landlord of Walmart  Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Economics 101 tells us that shortages drive prices up. If Currie is right and oil prices shoot up  oil producers stand ready to benefit.Here is a look at three big oil stocks. Wall Street already sees upside in this trio.ShellHeadquartered in London  Shell (SHEL) is a multinational energy giant with operations in more than 70 countries. It produces around 3.2 barrels of oil equivalent per day  has an interest in 10 refineries  and sold 64.2 million tons of liquefied natural gas in 2021.It‚Äôs a staple for global investors  too. Shell is listed on the London Stock Exchange  Euronext Amsterdam  and the New York Stock Exchange.The company‚Äôs NYSE-listed shares are up 5% over the past year.Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd sees an opportunity in the oil and gas supermajor. The analyst has an ‚Äòoverweight‚Äô rating on Shell and a price target of $70.Story continuesConsidering that Shell trades at around $58.50 per share today  Todd‚Äôs price target implies a potential upside of 20%. The stock also offers a dividend yield of 4.0%.ChevronChevron (CVX) is another oil and gas supermajor that‚Äôs benefiting from the commodity boom.In 2022  the company reported earnings of $35.5 billion  which represented a 127% increase from 2021. Sales and other operating revenues totaled $235.7 billion for 2022  up 51% year over year.Last month  Chevron‚Äôs board approved a 6% increase to the quarterly dividend rate to $1.51 per share. That gives the company an annual dividend yield of 3.5%.Read more: Your cash is trash: 4 simple ways to protect your money against white-hot inflation (without being a stock market genius)The stock has enjoyed a nice rally too  climbing 23% in the last 12 months.In January  Barclays analyst Jeanine Wai reiterated an ‚Äòoverweight‚Äô rating on Chevron while raising the price target from $196 to $212. That implies a potential upside of 24% from the current levels.Exxon MobilCommanding a market cap of over $460 billion  Exxon Mobil (XOM) is bigger than Shell and Chevron.The company also boasts the strongest stock price performance among the three ‚Äî Exxon shares are up 36% over the past year.It‚Äôs not hard to see why investors like the stock: the oil-producing giant gushes profits and cash flow in this commodity price environment. In 2022  Exxon earned $55.7 billion in profits  a huge increase from the $23.0 billion in 2021. Free cash flow totaled $62.1 billion for the year  compared to $37.9 billion in 2021.Solid financials allow the company to return cash to investors. Exxon pays quarterly dividends of 91 cents per share  translating to an annual yield of 3.2%.Bank of America analyst Doug Leggate has a ‚Äòbuy‚Äô rating on Exxon and a price target of $140 ‚Äî around 25% above where the stock sits today.What to read nextThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

In particular  tenant sales and rent collection returned to pre-pandemic levels and we delivered consistent improvement in operating metrics across all regions.Our proactive leasing strategy yielded a higher proportion of longer-term leases at increased rents while we also benefitted from Sales Based Rents and the positive impact of indexation. In 2023  we will perform as retailers and brands optimise their store networks with us  with a focus on the most productive stores in prime locations as part of their drive-to-store strategies.Strong growth in Commercial Partnerships revenues clearly demonstrated the opportunity to generate new revenues from qualifying the audience of visitors to our centres  especially in Europe where we launched Westfield Rise  an in-house media advertising agency.Higher earnings  combined with a -‚Ç¨1.9 Bn debt reduction thanks to disposals in the US and Europe  translated into enhanced credit metrics. The Group‚Äôs robust operational performance and strong liquidity position allows us to progress our deleveraging programme in a timely and orderly manner  including the radical reduction of our US financial exposure.The Group is on track to deliver its ‚Äú2024 and beyond‚Äù strategy  which includes maximising asset value through the disciplined delivery of our committed pipeline and unlocking new development opportunities  with a focus on urban regeneration and environmental transition projects.‚ÄùFY-2022 FY-2021 Growth Like-for-like growth5 Net Rental Income (in ‚Ç¨ Mn) 2 226 1 724 29.1% 27.4%6 Shopping Centres 2 024 1 632 24.0% 21.5%7 Offices & Others 70 60 16.0% 23.2% Convention & Exhibition 132 32 n.m. n.m.

Rebasing both periods for the COVID-19 rent relief  the AREPS would have increased by +13.0%.OPERATING PERFORMANCEShopping CentresLike-for-like shopping centre NRI was up by +21.5%8 for the Group  and by +25.4% in Continental Europe  and up +12.0%8 in the US and +21.4% in the UK. All regions benefitted from higher variable income and lower doubtful debtors due to higher rent collection including 2021 rents. Performance in Continental Europe was also positively impacted by the end of COVID-19 rent discounts as well as indexation  and in the UK by lower rent relief and higher Sales Based Rents (SBR). The US benefitted from higher SBR  parking income and Commercial Partnerships  partly offset by negative MGR uplifts on short-term deals. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 rent relief  the like-for-like NRI growth would be +7.8% for the Group.2022 tenant sales9 were at 103% of 2019 levels  including 101% in Continental Europe  96% in the UK and 108% in the US  and footfall10 was at 90% of 2019 levels  including 88% in Continental Europe  89% in the UK and 94% in the US (96% excluding Westfield World Trade Center and Westfield San Francisco Centre in which footfall remains affected by work-from-home trends). Footfall is expected to continue to grow as vacancy decreases.In H2-2022  European tenant sales reached 102% of 2019 levels (vs. 98% in H1-2022). Sales performance in 2022 differed by sector in Europe. In particular  Health and Beauty was +11%  Sports +15%  while Fashion -5% and Entertainment -12% vs. 2019 levels. Entertainment saw an improvement from -14% in H1 to -10% in H2 and Fashion from -7% to -2%.In the US  tenant sales have consistently outperformed pre-COVID levels since H1-2021. Overall  2022 sales came to 108% of 2019 levels driven by Flagship assets at 117%  Regionals at 100% and partly offset by the Central Business District (‚ÄúCBD‚Äù)11 assets at 74%. The strong growth continued to be broad-based with almost all categories performing above 2019 levels  such as Luxury (+83%)  Home (+37%)  F&B (+10%) and Fashion (+3%). Entertainment saw an improvement from -25% in H1 to -12% in H2.Rent collection12 amounted to 97% for 2022 (vs. 88% at FY-2021 and 96% in H1-2022)  including 97% in Continental Europe  99% in the UK and 97% in the US  returning to pre-COVID levels. The Group continued to collect 2021 rents  leading to an improvement of 2021 rent collection from 88% to 93% between February 2022 and December 2022.URW signed ‚Ç¨441 Mn of MGR13 during 2022 (+26% compared to 2021) with an MGR uplift of +6.2% (vs. -5.2% in 2021). As market conditions improved  the proportion of long-term deals signed also increased from 61% of MGR signed in 2021 to 68% in 2022. The MGR uplift for leases longer than 36 months came to +14.4% for the Group  with Continental Europe at +8.9%  the UK at +3.6% and the US at +36.0%.SBR14  which are mainly generated in the US  increased to ‚Ç¨123.6 Mn in 2022 (6.1% of NRI) from ‚Ç¨80.2 Mn in 2021 (5.0% of NRI) of which ‚Ç¨77.7 Mn was for the US and ‚Ç¨45.9 Mn for Europe.Vacancy for Shopping Centres at a Group level decreased significantly to 6.5% at FY-2022  down from 8.9% at H1-2021 and 7.0% at FY-2021. In Continental Europe  vacancy was 3.1%  down from 4.0% in December 2021 and 5.0% in June 2021. In the UK  vacancy also decreased from 12.2% in June 2021 and 10.6% in December 2021 to 9.4% at FY-2022. In the US  the vacancy reduced to 10.4% at FY-2022 from 14.0% in June 2021 and 11.0% at FY-2021  with vacancy decreasing by -110 bps year-on-year to 8.2% in the Flagships.Indexation and inflationURW rents are indexed on a yearly basis in Continental Europe. 2022 indexation contribution to like-for-like retail NRI performance in Continental Europe was +3.6%  reflecting 2021 inflation due to the usual time lag between contractual indexation and inflation. In the UK and the US  leases are not tied to actual CPI figures but the Group benefitted from inflation through SBR.Commercial PartnershipsRevenue from Commercial Partnerships15 increased from ‚Ç¨76.2 Mn in 2021 to ‚Ç¨115.5 Mn in 2022  driven in part by the launch in Europe of Westfield Rise  an in-house media  brand experience and data partnerships agency.Total Westfield Rise activity in Europe amounted to ‚Ç¨45.5 Mn in net margin at 100% share in 2022  up +23% compared to 2019 (and +52% compared to 202116). This new division (for which figures are reported at 100%) will generate ‚Ç¨75 Mn16 in annual net margin by 2024  a +‚Ç¨45 Mn increase compared to 2021  with strong potential growth beyond 2024.Offices & OthersOffice NRI increased by +16.0%  primarily as a result of deliveries of Pullman Montparnasse and Ga√Æt√© Montparnasse offices  partly offset by 2021 and 2022 disposals  especially Solna Centrum. On a like-for-like basis  office NRI increased by +23.2%  with +44.2% in France  mainly due to leasing activity at Trinity in La D√©fense  now 74% let.Two new leases (Santarelli and Alain Afflelou) were signed for Trinity in 2022 at an average rent of c. ‚Ç¨567/sqm17  with lease incentives below the market average. In addition  33 100 sqm were leased on projects  including Lightwell in La D√©fense (80% pre-let) and Westfield Hamburg offices (29% pre-let)  both due to be delivered in 2024.Convention & ExhibitionIn 2022  Viparis hosted 617 events (including 189 exhibitions  75 congresses and 353 corporate events) compared to 236 events in 2020 and 721 events in 2018.Convention & Exhibition recurring NOI amounted to ‚Ç¨190.2 Mn compared to ‚Ç¨55.2 Mn in 2021 and ‚Ç¨164.7 Mn in 2018. This includes the ‚Ç¨25 Mn contribution from the French State to compensate closure periods in earlier years. Restated from this and triennial shows (held in 2018 and 2022)  the NOI is slightly above 2018  due to the strong recovery of activity and the shift of certain biannual shows  despite the remaining impact of COVID-19 in the first quarter.As at January 31  2023  signed and pre-booked events in Viparis venues for 2023 amounted to 86%18 of 2019 pre-bookings  the last comparable year.D ISPOSALSIn total  the Group completed disposals in Europe and in the US that represents ‚Ç¨1.8 Bn of IFRS net debt reduction.In Europe  URW completed disposals in 2022 that represents a ‚Ç¨1.2 Bn of IFRS net debt reduction at an average NIY of 5.5% and an average premium to last unaffected book value of +2.7%. Deals completed include the disposal of Solna Centrum (Stockholm region)  the building rights for two residential buildings at Westfield Hamburg (Hamburg)  a 45% interest in Westfield Carr√© S√©nart (Paris region)  Gera Arcaden (Gera)  Almere Centrum (Amsterdam region)  Carr√© S√©nart Shopping Parc (Paris region) and Villeneuve 2 (Lille region). In addition  URW‚Äôs partner in Aupark exercised its call option for the acquisition of an additional 27% stake.In total  URW has now reached ‚Ç¨3.2 Bn19 of its ‚Ç¨4.0 Bn European disposals programme representing 80%  at an average NIY of 4.9% (including 5.4% for the Shopping Centres and 3.9% for the Offices & Others)  a premium to the last unaffected appraisal of +4.9% (including +1.3% for the Shopping Centres and +12.3% for the Offices & Others). The Group expects to complete the European disposals programme during 2023.URW will continue the asset and property management for several of the assets sold  including Aupark  Westfield Carr√© S√©nart  Gera Arcaden and Carr√© S√©nart Shopping Parc  allowing the Group to earn management fees and consequently increase the return on investment for those assets.In the US  the Group also continued efforts to streamline its US Regional portfolio with the completion in 2022 of a total of $0.6 Bn of disposals20. These include the disposals of the Promenade development parcel in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles  Westfield Santa Anita  The Village at Topanga  as well as Westfield Trumbull and Westfield South Shore. These transactions were completed at a discount of -0.5% to 2021 book value. Together with the disposal of the Palisade residential building and the ownership transfer of five other regional properties in 2021  URW has made $1.3 Bn in total proceeds to date from the planned radical reduction of its financial exposure to the US.In 2023  the Group will continue to streamline its remaining US Regional asset portfolio. URW is committed to the radical reduction of its financial exposure to the US  a process that is supported by the strong operational performance of the assets and the Group‚Äôs liquidity position.DELIVERIES & PIPELINEThe Total Investment Cost (TIC)21 of URW‚Äôs development pipeline decreased by -‚Ç¨0.1 Bn to ‚Ç¨3.1 Bn  compared to December 31  2021  mainly as a result of the delivery of projects  representing ‚Ç¨0.4 Bn  new projects and increasing costs.In 2022  the Group delivered the 19 439 sqm Westfield Topanga extension  ‚ÄúRue de la Boucle‚Äù  a 10 000 sqm destination at Westfield Forum des Halles  the Ga√Æt√© Montparnasse Office project as well as Les Ateliers Ga√Æt√© shopping centre (33 364 sqm) to complete the Ga√Æt√© Montparnasse mixed-use complex  one of the most ambitious and largest urban regeneration projects in Paris. The average letting22 of these deliveries stands at 88% as at December 31  2022.Committed projects amount to ‚Ç¨2.4 Bn  of which ‚Ç¨1.2 Bn has already been invested. The two main projects are the mixed used development in Hamburg (Westfield Hamburg-√úberseequartier) and the residential project of Coppermaker Square.In 2023  URW plans to deliver the Garbera shopping centre extension project  Coppermaker Square Retail (a leisure development adjacent to Westfield Stratford City)  the renovation project of the Westfield Les 4 Temps main plaza ‚ÄúLa Clairi√®re‚Äù  CNIT Eole  a redevelopment at the CNIT shopping centre  and Fisketorvet dining area. The average pre-letting22 of these projects stands at 81%.VALUATIONThe proportionate Gross Market Value (GMV) of the Group‚Äôs assets as at December 31  2022  decreased by-4.1% to ‚Ç¨52.2 Bn from ‚Ç¨54.5 Bn as at December 31  2021  mainly as a result of disposals (-‚Ç¨1.8 Bn) and a like-for-like portfolio revaluation of -‚Ç¨1.3 Bn (-2.7%)  partly offset by CAPEX  Acquisitions and Transfers (+‚Ç¨0.9 Bn) and positive FX moves (+‚Ç¨0.4 Bn). The like-for-like shopping centres valuation was -2.6% for 2022 including-2.3% in H2 as appraisers increased their assumption of discount and exit cap rates.The EPRA Net Reinstatement Value per share came to ‚Ç¨155.70 as at December 31  2022  down -‚Ç¨3.90 (-2.4%) compared to December 31  2021  mainly driven by the revaluation of investment properties  partly offset by the retained recurring results.FINANCIAL RESOURCESAs at December 31  2022  the Group‚Äôs IFRS net financial debt decreased to ‚Ç¨20.7 Bn (from ‚Ç¨22.6 Bn as at December 31  2021) mainly driven by the disposals completed in 2022.The Group‚Äôs credit metrics improved over the period supported by strong operational performance and deleveraging progress. URW‚Äôs Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio23 decreased to 41.2% (vs. 43.3% as at December 31  2021)  Net debt/EBITDA24 ratio decreased to 9.6x (vs. 13.7x in 2021)  below its 2019 level (9.9x)  the Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) increased to 4.2x (vs. 3.3x in 2021)  and Funds from Operations to Net Financial Debt (FFO/NFD) ratio improved to 7.6% (vs. 5.0% in 2021).Over 2022  URW further strengthened its liquidity position by raising ‚Ç¨1 332 Mn (‚Ç¨1 682 Mn on a proportionate basis) of medium to long-term funds25 in the mortgage and corporate bank debt market  out of which ‚Ç¨900 Mn (‚Ç¨1 250 Mn on a proportionate basis) is sustainability-linked.The Group‚Äôs liquidity position increased by ca. +‚Ç¨0.9 Bn over the year to reach ‚Ç¨13.0 Bn and ‚Ç¨13.2 Bn on a proportionate basis including ‚Ç¨3.3 Bn of cash on hand26 (vs. ‚Ç¨2.3 Bn as at December 31  2021)  allowing the Group to fully secure its debt maturities for the next 36 months.Regarding the ‚Ç¨1.25 Bn perpetual non-call 2023 hybrid  the terms and conditions of the instrument provide for the issuer a call option27 in 2023  and annually thereafter.The decision regarding this call will be made ahead of its First Reset Date28 (i.e. October 25  2023).The Group‚Äôs average debt maturity29 stood at 8.3 years.The Group‚Äôs average cost of debt remained stable at 2.0%  representing a blended average cost of 1.5% for Euro30 denominated debt and 3.8% for USD and GBP denominated debt  thanks to both the Group‚Äôs hedging instruments in place limiting the impact of rates increases and to positive cash deposit rates.The Group‚Äôs debt is fully hedged for 2023 and the following years  limiting the impact of any rates increase on the Group‚Äôs financial expenses for 2023.ESG2022 marks another year of ESG progress for the Group under its Better Places 2030 strategy. Having achieved a -17% reduction of energy intensity since 2015 in Europe  URW set an additional target to reduce its energy intensity by -15% in 2022 compared to 2019 in Europe to support national and European efforts to address the energy crisis. Thanks to a range of proactive measures  URW was able to outperform this target  reaching -19.8%  supporting both governments efforts and mitigating costs impacts for tenants.URW is on track to meet all Better Places 2030 targets  including cutting carbon emissions by 50% between 2015 and 2030. The Group is committed to contribute to global carbon neutrality and will present a step-change update to its plan in autumn 2023  with a view to establishing new commitments.The Group‚Äôs CSR agenda was recognised by equity and debt investors as a value creation driver for its stakeholders. In 2022  URW inclusion in the main ESG indices was confirmed and the Group‚Äôs sustainability achievements were registered in ratings and awards.2023 GUIDANCEThanks to the improvement in 2022 operating performance  higher indexation  the positioning of the Group on prime and well-located assets  and retailers‚Äô drive-to-store strategies  as well as deleveraging progress  URW is well-positioned to continue to perform in what is expected to remain an uncertain macro environment in 2023.In this context  the Group forecasts its 2023 AREPS to be in the range of ‚Ç¨9.30 to ‚Ç¨9.50. The main drivers of this guidance are:Consistent performance in our retail operations versus 2022 with inflation protection through indexation and SBR;The impact of large event scheduling changes in 2022  leading to a naturally lower Convention & Exhibition activity in 2023;Full-year effect of 2022 disposals  impact of US regional streamlining and the European disposal programme;Contribution of 2022 and 2023 project deliveries;Stable cost of funding thanks to Group‚Äôs hedging programme;FX impact with the strengthening of the Euro vs. USD.This guidance does not include major disposals in the US in the context of the radical reduction of its financial exposure.The Group assumes no major energy-related restrictions  nor major deterioration to the macro-economic and geopolitical environment.DIVIDENDComplying with the deleveraging commitments made in 2021  the Group will not pay a dividend for fiscal year 2022.Given the statutory results of URW SE in 2022 (+‚Ç¨90 Mn in 2022 and cumulated negative retained earnings of -‚Ç¨2 341 Mn)  the Group has no obligation to pay a dividend in 2023 for the fiscal year 2022 under the SIIC regime and other REIT regimes it benefits from. Consequently  URW SE‚Äôs total carry forward SIIC distribution obligation  standing at ‚Ç¨1 720 Mn as at December 31  2022  will be delayed until URW SE has sufficient statutory results to meet this obligation. These statutory results do not prevent URW SE from making distributions out of its premium.EURONEXT LISTINGThe Group started discussions with Euronext in order to change its market of reference from Euronext Amsterdam to Euronext Paris as part of an initiative to simplify its structure given limited trading activity on that market. As a part of this request  the Group intends to delist the URW Stapled Shares from Euronext Amsterdam  while maintaining a single listing on Euronext Paris. The delisting from Euronext Amsterdam would not affect the liquidity of the shares nor have any impact on trading  URW‚Äôs organisation (including the stapled share principle) or the ISIN code (FR0013326246) of the Group.Subject to approval by the Euronext Listing Board  the Group expects these changes to be effective by the end of April 2023.Further information regarding this process will be communicated as appropriate.FINANCIAL SCHEDULEThe next financial events on the Group‚Äôs calendar will be:April 26  2023: Q1 trading updateMay 10  2023: AGM Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield SEJuly 27  2023: H1-2023 resultsFor further information  please contact:Investor RelationsAudrey Arnoux+33 6 61 27 07 39Audrey.Arnoux@urw.comMedia RelationsUK/Global:Cornelia Schnepf ‚Äì Finelk+44 7387 108 998Cornelia.Schnepf@finelk.euFrance:Sonia Fellmann ‚Äì PLEAD+33 6 27 84 91 30Sonia.Fellmann@plead.frUnited States:Molly Morse ‚Äì Kekst CNC+ 1 212 521 4826Molly.Morse@kekstcnc.comAbout Unibail-Rodamco-WestfieldUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield is an owner  developer and operator of sustainable  high-quality real estate assets in the most dynamic cities in Europe and the United States.The Group operates 78 shopping centres in 12 countries  including 45 which carry the iconic Westfield brand.

The slight increase in costs only results from costs related to non-volume related revenue growth initiatives. Savings and synergies entirely compensate inflation and business development costs.Status update on synergies in relation to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition : ‚Ç¨ 34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies were achieved at the end of Q4 2022  thanks to restructuring efforts and the migration of the Core Data Centre. ‚Ç¨9.7 million run-rate annual synergies were delivered in Q4 2022. ‚Ç¨44.2 million of cumulated implementation costs incurred at the end of Q4 2022  of which ‚Ç¨6.3 million during Q4 2022.Next steps in the deployment of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan : Euronext upgrades its 2024 annual run - rate pre - tax synergies related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group by ‚Ç¨ 15 millon to ‚Ç¨ 115 million . Implementation costs remain unchanged. Euronext confirmed the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets onto Optiq ¬Æ in March 2023  forming the first phase of the migration  and of Borsa Italiana other markets in Q4 2023 allowing for termination of the third-party provider trading platform contract. Euronext confirmed the phases in the expansion of Euronext Clearing with the expected launch of the equity clearing offering by the end of 2023 and of derivative clearing by Q3 2024. These strategic projects are expected to reach around ‚Ç¨ 7 0 million of cumulated run-rate synergies by the end of 2023  out of the ‚Ç¨115 million targeted. In 2023  Euronext expects to maintain for cash trading an average market share greater or equal to 63%   and revenue capture a round 0.5 2 bps following the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq ¬Æ   considering current market conditions and orders size.Key achievement in the deployment of the ‚Äò Fit for 1.5 ¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy in 2022 : Euronext‚Äôs upgraded SBTi-aligned climate targets were validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative: By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based greenhouse gas emissions by 73.5% compared to 2020; By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 3 business travel emissions by at least 46.2% compared to 2019; By 2027  Euronext suppliers  representing 72% of Euronext‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions derived from purchased goods and services  must set targets on their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.The Group‚Äôs efforts to enhance diversity were recognised through the inclusion of Euronext into the Euronext Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Euronext Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices.St√©phane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said: ‚ÄúIn 2022  Euronext reached record revenue and income above ‚Ç¨1.4 billion notably resulting from the strong performance of our non-volume related activities  together with efficient management of revenue capture and of cash trading market share. Thanks to our trademark cost discipline  we beat our 2022 revised costs guidance. We achieved an adjusted EBITDA of ‚Ç¨861.6 million that translated into an adjusted EPS of ‚Ç¨5.21. We will propose a total dividend of ‚Ç¨236.6 million at our next annual general meeting to be held in May 2023  representing 50% of our reported net income  excluding NTI loss impact.This year has been crucial in laying the foundations for the future growth of the Group. We have successfully completed the first major milestone of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan with the migration of our Core Data Centre from the UK to Italy. At the end of 2022  we have achieved ‚Ç¨34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies related to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.This fruitful year paves the way for the next steps to be delivered in 2023. The largest single liquidity pool in Europe  operated by Euronext will significantly change dimension with the migration of Italian cash markets to Euronext‚Äôs state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq¬Æ  which will benefit local and global trading members.Euronext Clearing will become the Euronext equity clearing house of choice by the end of 2023  and the CCP for derivatives clearing in Q3 2024. These are the critical bricks to complete our presence across the integrated value chain  allowing us to innovate and shape capital markets in line with evolving client needs  and making Euronext even stronger to deliver future growth.In an inflationary environment  we will contain our costs to a slight increase in 2023  at ‚Ç¨630 million  demonstrating Euronext‚Äôs ability to maintain its cost discipline while investing to generate revenue expansion of our non-volume related activities. We expect to deliver by the end of 2023 around ‚Ç¨70 million of the synergies targeted as part of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan. Our good progress on integration led us to upgrade the total amount of targeted run-rate EBITDA synergies by the end of 2024 from ‚Ç¨100 million to ‚Ç¨115 million. This further demonstrates Euronext‚Äôs successful track record in integrating acquired companies.Our strong performance  combined with the successful ongoing delivery of the planned synergies  is supporting our deleveraging trajectory with a net debt to EBITDA ratio at 2.6x  well below 3.2x at the time of closing of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition. This leaves the Group with flexibility to further deploy capital in value generating opportunities that might arise.Lastly  we are happy to see that our ‚ÄòFit for 1.5¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy is bearing fruit  as our upgraded emission reduction targets have been validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative. We are pleased to see Euronext being included in both the Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices  demonstrating the progress we are making in striving towards more equality.‚ÄùEuronext Q4 and full year 2022 financial performance Full year 20226 In ‚Ç¨m  unless stated otherwiseThe figures in this document have not been audited or reviewed by our external auditor.

Underlying revenue and income  excluding the non-underlying  one-off loss related to the partial disposal of the Euronext Clearing portfolio  was up +13.0% in 2022  to ‚Ç¨1 467.8 million. On a like-for-like basis and at constant currencies  Euronext consolidated revenue and income was stable (-0.2%) in 2022  at ‚Ç¨1 204.4 million  compared to 2021. Pro forma the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition on 29 April 2021  underlying revenue and income were stable in 2022 compared to 2021  resulting from strong non-volume related activities  notably listing and advanced data services  very good performances for FX and power trading and a solid performance of derivatives trading. Non-volume related revenue accounted for 58% of underlying Group revenue in 2022  stable vs. 2021  reflecting the successful diversification towards non-volume related activities  good performance of non-equity related trading activities and the challenging environment for cash trading and MTS cash trading this quarter. The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage by non-volume related underlying revenue ratio was at 141% in 2022  almost stable vs. 2021 (142%). 2022 adjusted EBITDA Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased to ‚Ç¨606.1 million  up +14.9%  reflecting the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group costs and continued cost discipline in an inflationary environment. Underlying expenses excluding D&A (‚Ç¨606.1 million) were better than 2022 guidance of ‚Ç¨612 million underlying costs excluding D&A (‚Ç¨622 million initially) thanks to strong cost discipline  project costs being capitalised and one-off positive impacts  including release of accruals and lower-than-anticipated travel and marketing expenses due to the Covid-19 pandemic. On a like-for-like basis  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased slightly by +2.7% compared to 2021  which was positively impacted by the decrease of travel and marketing expenses during the pandemic  highlighting Euronext‚Äôs ability to contain inflation in 2022. On a pro forma basis for the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group on 29 April 2021  underlying operational expenses increased slightly by +2.0%  mainly due to the return of travel and marketing expenses in 2022. Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled ‚Ç¨861.6 million and saw double digit growth  +11.7% compared to 2021. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 58.7%  down -0.7 points compared to 2021. On a like-for-like basis  adjusted EBITDA for 2022 was down -2.3%  to ‚Ç¨699.3 million  and adjusted EBITDA margin was 58.1%  down -1.2 points compared to the same perimeter in 2021. 2022 net income  share of the parent company shareholders Depreciation and amortisation accounted for ‚Ç¨160.2 million in 2022  up +19.0%  mostly due to the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for ‚Ç¨83.3 million and is included in depreciation and amortisation. Adjusted operating profit was ‚Ç¨792.8 million  a strong +11.7% increase compared to 2021. On a like-for-like basis  adjusted operating profit was down -2.3% compared to 2021  at ‚Ç¨643.6 million. ‚Ç¨118.6 million of non-underlying expenses  including depreciation and amortisation  were reported in 2022  related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group  the implementation of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan and the PPA of acquired businesses. Net financing expense for 2022 was ‚Ç¨29.7 million compared to a net financing expense of ‚Ç¨31.7 million in 2021. This decrease mainly results from the elimination of costs in relation to the bridge financing of the Borsa Italiana Group in 2021  partially offset by the cost of bonds issued to finance the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. Results from equity investments amounted to ‚Ç¨18.7 million in 2022  solely representing the contribution received from LCH SA and a dividend received from Euroclear. As a reminder  in 2021  Euronext reported ‚Ç¨33.2 million in results from equity investments  reflecting two dividends received from Sicovam and two dividends received from Euroclear in addition to the contribution received from LCH SA. Income tax for 2022 was ‚Ç¨163.6 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 26.6% for 2022 (2021: ‚Ç¨158.6 million and 27.3% respectively). Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to the Borsa Italiana Group and Nord Pool amounted to ‚Ç¨12.8 million in 2022. As a result  the reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  increased by +5.9% for 2022 compared to 2021  to ‚Ç¨437.8 million  including the one-off loss due to the portfolio reallocation10 of the Euronext Clearing portfolio. This represents a reported EPS of ‚Ç¨4.10 basic and ‚Ç¨4.10 diluted in 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨4.30 basic and ‚Ç¨4.29 diluted in 2021. This decrease reflects a higher number of outstanding shares over 2022 compared to 2021. Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders was up +5.7% to ‚Ç¨555.3 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was down -4.8% in 2022  at ‚Ç¨5.21 per share  compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of ‚Ç¨5.47 per share in 2021. This decrease reflect a higher number of outstanding shares over 2022 compared to 2021. The weighted number of shares used over 2022 was 106 669 451 for the basic calculation and 106 901 306 for the diluted calculation  compared to 96 058 761 and 96 297 159 respectively over 2021. In 2022  Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of ‚Ç¨616.5 million  compared to ‚Ç¨543.7 million in 2021  resulting from higher profit before tax and higher depreciation and amortisation.

On a like-for-like basis and at constant currencies  Euronext consolidated revenue and income was down -6.1% in Q4 2022  to ‚Ç¨346.5 million  compared to Q4 2021. Non-volume related revenue accounted for 60% of Group revenue in Q4 2022  compared to 58% in Q4 2021  reflecting higher advanced data services and services revenue. The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage by non-volume related revenue ratio was at 130% in Q4 2022  compared to 136% in Q4 2021. Q4 2022 adjusted EBITDA Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased to ‚Ç¨159.2 million  slightly up +1.6%  reflecting strong cost discipline in an inflationary environment and higher capitalised project costs. On a like-for-like basis  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation slightly increased by +2.1% compared to Q4 2021. Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled ‚Ç¨187.9 million  down -12.0% compared to Q4 2021. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.1%  down -3.5 points compared to Q4 2021. On a like-for-like basis  adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2022 was down -12.1%  to ‚Ç¨187.7 million  and adjusted EBITDA margin was 54.2%  down -3.7pts points compared to the same perimeter in Q4 2021. Q4 2022 net income  share of the parent company shareholders Depreciation and amortisation accounted for ‚Ç¨42.6 million in Q4 2022  -12.8% less than in Q4 2021.

Adjusted operating profit was ‚Ç¨168.4 million  a -13.3% decrease compared to Q4 2021. On a like-for-like basis  adjusted operating profit was down -13.4% compared to Q4 2021  at ‚Ç¨168.2 million. ‚Ç¨34.1 million of non-underlying expenses  including depreciation and amortisation  were reported in Q4 2022  related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group  the implementation of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan and the PPA of acquired businesses. Net financing expense for Q4 2022 was ‚Ç¨6.0 million  compared to a net financing expense of ‚Ç¨6.7 million in Q4 2021. This decrease results from higher interest income due to increased interest rates partially offset by the higher cost of issued bonds and a negative revaluation of foreign currency balances. Results from equity investments amounted to ‚Ç¨12.6 million in Q4 2022  representing the contribution received from LCH SA and a dividend received from Euroclear. As a reminder  in Q4 2021  Euronext reported ‚Ç¨7.3 million in results from equity investments  reflecting a dividend payment by Sicovam in addition to the contribution received from LCH SA. Income tax for Q4 2022 was ‚Ç¨38.5 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 27.3% for the quarter (Q4 2021: ‚Ç¨35.7 million and 23.6% respectively). Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to the Borsa Italiana Group and Nord Pool amounted to ‚Ç¨3.0 million in Q4 2022. As a result  the reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  decreased by -11.9% for Q4 2022 compared to Q4 2021  to ‚Ç¨99.3 million. This represents a reported EPS of ‚Ç¨0.93 basic and ‚Ç¨0.93 diluted in Q4 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨1.05 basic and ‚Ç¨1.05 diluted in Q4 2021. Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders was down -18.2% to ‚Ç¨118.2 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was down -18.0% in Q4 2022  at ‚Ç¨1.11 per share  compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of ‚Ç¨1.35 per share in Q4 2021. This decrease reflect a higher number of outstanding shares over the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The weighted number of shares used over 2022 was 106 669 451 for the basic calculation and 106 901 306 for the diluted calculation  compared to 96 058 761 and 96 297 159 respectively over 2021. In Q4 2022  Euronext reported a negative net cash flow from operating activities of ‚Ç¨147.1 million  compared to a positive ‚Ç¨145.6 million in Q4 2021  reflecting higher negative changes in working capital reflecting notably short-term movement in outstanding power sales customers‚Äô and suppliers‚Äô invoices related to Nord Pool CCP activities. Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities  net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 51.9% of EBITDA in Q4 2022.

Appendix Adjustments in financial disclosure To highlight its underlying performance  since Q1 2022 Euronext has published underlying recurring costs  adjusted EBITDA and non-recurring costs. Euronext has removed the exceptional items line from its financial statements. Consequently  costs previously reported as exceptional items have from Q1 2022 been included in their respective lines within Euronext operating expenses as non-recurring items. The ‚Ç¨150 million of implementation costs to deliver on the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan targets are therefore considered as non-recurring items and have been withdrawn from the underlying recurring costs. The computation of adjusted net income and earnings per share has been adjusted accordingly. The computation of reported net income and earnings per share is not impacted. 2024 strategic plan targets remain unchanged and are not affected by this change in reporting.

These items can include: integration or double run costs of significant projects  restructuring costs and costs related to acquisitions that change the perimeter of the Group; one-off finance costs  gains or losses on sale of subsidiaries and impairments of investments: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets which are recognised as a result of acquisitions and mostly comprising customer relationships  brand names and software that were identified during purchase price allocation (PPA); tax related to non-underlying items.Adjusted operating profit as the operating profit adjusted for any non-underlying revenue and income and non-underlying costs  including PPA of acquired businesses;EBITDA as the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;Adjusted EBITDA as the adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation adjusted for any non-underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA  divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted net income  as the net income  share of the parent company shareholders  adjusted for any non-underlying items and related tax impact.

Trading revenue grew to ‚Ç¨514.1 million (-0.8% pro forma  +10.5% reported). FX and power trading reported strong performances.

The slight increase in costs only results from costs related to non-volume related revenue growth initiatives. Savings and synergies entirely compensate inflation and business development costs.Status update on synergies in relation to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition : ‚Ç¨ 34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies were achieved at the end of Q4 2022  thanks to restructuring efforts and the migration of the Core Data Centre. ‚Ç¨9.7 million run-rate annual synergies were delivered in Q4 2022. ‚Ç¨44.2 million of cumulated implementation costs incurred at the end of Q4 2022  of which ‚Ç¨6.3 million during Q4 2022.Next steps in the deployment of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan : Euronext upgrades its 2024 annual run - rate pre - tax synergies related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group by ‚Ç¨ 15 millon to ‚Ç¨ 115 million . Implementation costs remain unchanged. Euronext confirmed the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets onto Optiq ¬Æ in March 2023  forming the first phase of the migration  and of Borsa Italiana other markets in Q4 2023 allowing for termination of the third-party provider trading platform contract. Euronext confirmed the phases in the expansion of Euronext Clearing with the expected launch of the equity clearing offering by the end of 2023 and of derivative clearing by Q3 2024. These strategic projects are expected to reach around ‚Ç¨ 7 0 million of cumulated run-rate synergies by the end of 2023  out of the ‚Ç¨115 million targeted. In 2023  Euronext expects to maintain for cash trading an average market share greater or equal to 63%   and revenue capture a round 0.5 2 bps following the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq ¬Æ   considering current market conditions and orders size.Key achievement in the deployment of the ‚Äò Fit for 1.5 ¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy in 2022 : Euronext‚Äôs upgraded SBTi-aligned climate targets were validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative: By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based greenhouse gas emissions by 73.5% compared to 2020; By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 3 business travel emissions by at least 46.2% compared to 2019; By 2027  Euronext suppliers  representing 72% of Euronext‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions derived from purchased goods and services  must set targets on their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.The Group‚Äôs efforts to enhance diversity were recognised through the inclusion of Euronext into the Euronext Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Euronext Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices.St√©phane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:‚ÄúIn 2022  Euronext reached record revenue and income above ‚Ç¨1.4 billion notably resulting from the strong performance of our non-volume related activities  together with efficient management of revenue capture and of cash trading market share. Thanks to our trademark cost discipline  we beat our 2022 revised costs guidance. We achieved an adjusted EBITDA of ‚Ç¨861.6 million that translated into an adjusted EPS of ‚Ç¨5.21. We will propose a total dividend of ‚Ç¨236.6 million at our next annual general meeting to be held in May 2023  representing 50% of our reported net income  excluding NTI loss impact.This year has been crucial in laying the foundations for the future growth of the Group. We have successfully completed the first major milestone of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan with the migration of our Core Data Centre from the UK to Italy. At the end of 2022  we have achieved ‚Ç¨34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies related to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.This fruitful year paves the way for the next steps to be delivered in 2023. The largest single liquidity pool in Europe  operated by Euronext will significantly change dimension with the migration of Italian cash markets to Euronext‚Äôs state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq¬Æ  which will benefit local and global trading members.Euronext Clearing will become the Euronext equity clearing house of choice by the end of 2023  and the CCP for derivatives clearing in Q3 2024. These are the critical bricks to complete our presence across the integrated value chain  allowing us to innovate and shape capital markets in line with evolving client needs  and making Euronext even stronger to deliver future growth.In an inflationary environment  we will contain our costs to a slight increase in 2023  at ‚Ç¨630 million  demonstrating Euronext‚Äôs ability to maintain its cost discipline while investing to generate revenue expansion of our non-volume related activities. We expect to deliver by the end of 2023 around ‚Ç¨70 million of the synergies targeted as part of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan. Our good progress on integration led us to upgrade the total amount of targeted run-rate EBITDA synergies by the end of 2024 from ‚Ç¨100 million to ‚Ç¨115 million. This further demonstrates Euronext‚Äôs successful track record in integrating acquired companies.Our strong performance  combined with the successful ongoing delivery of the planned synergies  is supporting our deleveraging trajectory with a net debt to EBITDA ratio at 2.6x  well below 3.2x at the time of closing of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition. This leaves the Group with flexibility to further deploy capital in value generating opportunities that might arise.Lastly  we are happy to see that our ‚ÄòFit for 1.5¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy is bearing fruit  as our upgraded emission reduction targets have been validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative. We are pleased to see Euronext being included in both the Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices  demonstrating the progress we are making in striving towards more equality.‚ÄùEuronext Q4 and full year 2022 financial performanceFull year 20226In ‚Ç¨m  unless stated otherwiseThe figures in this document have not been audited or reviewed by our external auditor.

Underlying revenue and income  excluding the non-underlying  one-off loss related to the partial disposal of the Euronext Clearing portfolio  was up +13.0% in 2022  to ‚Ç¨1 467.8 million.On a like-for-like basis and at constant currencies  Euronext consolidated revenue and income was stable (-0.2%) in 2022  at ‚Ç¨1 204.4 million  compared to 2021. Pro forma the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition on 29 April 2021  underlying revenue and income were stable in 2022 compared to 2021  resulting from strong non-volume related activities  notably listing and advanced data services  very good performances for FX and power trading and a solid performance of derivatives trading.Non-volume related revenue accounted for 58% of underlying Group revenue in 2022  stable vs. 2021  reflecting the successful diversification towards non-volume related activities  good performance of non-equity related trading activities and the challenging environment for cash trading and MTS cash trading this quarter. The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage by non-volume related underlying revenue ratio was at 141% in 2022  almost stable vs. 2021 (142%).2022 adjusted EBITDAUnderlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased to ‚Ç¨606.1 million  up +14.9%  reflecting the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group costs and continued cost discipline in an inflationary environment. Underlying expenses excluding D&A (‚Ç¨606.1 million) were better than 2022 guidance of ‚Ç¨612 million underlying costs excluding D&A (‚Ç¨622 million initially) thanks to strong cost discipline  project costs being capitalised and one-off positive impacts  including release of accruals and lower-than-anticipated travel and marketing expenses due to the Covid-19 pandemic.On a like-for-like basis  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased slightly by +2.7% compared to 2021  which was positively impacted by the decrease of travel and marketing expenses during the pandemic  highlighting Euronext‚Äôs ability to contain inflation in 2022. On a pro forma basis for the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group on 29 April 2021  underlying operational expenses increased slightly by +2.0%  mainly due to the return of travel and marketing expenses in 2022.Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled ‚Ç¨861.6 million and saw double digit growth  +11.7% compared to 2021. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 58.7%  down -0.7 points compared to 2021.

This decrease mainly results from the elimination of costs in relation to the bridge financing of the Borsa Italiana Group in 2021  partially offset by the cost of bonds issued to finance the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.Results from equity investments amounted to ‚Ç¨18.7 million in 2022  solely representing the contribution received from LCH SA and a dividend received from Euroclear.

It is encouraging to see a structural return on our recent investments in the business. Indeed  2022 saw record value traded versus last year across our three asset class pillars and we continue to grow our institutional counterparty base which now stands at more than 2 200. The successful completion of the update to our corporate holding structure means that we now have even greater trading flexibility and have laid the groundwork to undertake any potential inorganic growth activity.‚ÄúOperating expense growth moderated in the fourth quarter and 2023 will see a continued focus on increasing the underlying efficiency of the business as we seek to further leverage the investments made in prior years. We also maintained our conservative capital position while implementing this growth strategy. Remaining cognisant of our trading capital position as well as the growth opportunities ahead  we have elected to pay a ‚Ç¨0.80 per share final dividend to shareholders.‚ÄúDespite increasing competition for talent in the market  we have been successful in attracting and recruiting the best talent and have welcomed many new colleagues in the past year. Lastly  on behalf of the entire Board and ExCo  I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the professionalism  resilience  and loyalty of all our colleagues globally this past year. We are immensely grateful to our colleagues for their tremendous hard work which allowed for our considerable operational and strategic achievements and successes in 2022.‚ÄùFolkert Joling  Chief Trading Officer  added:‚ÄúHeightened levels of market activity delivered a strong trading performance in the fourth quarter with all regions contributing meaningfully. We have continued to expand and broaden our trading activities even further across different products and asset classes and this is reflected in the results achieved throughout 2022. Our robust and prudent approach to risk management meant that we were immaterially affected by the collapse of FTX in November and our status as a listed  transparent  seasoned market participant improved our overall standing with investors and other market participants. As to be expected  we reduced our overall trading capital exposure to the various crypto platforms we trade with  fully recognising the increased risks present in the broader crypto market. This trading capital was naturally deployed to other areas of the business. We retain our conviction around the long-term potential of crypto and DeFi from both a trading as well as a technological and financial markets innovation perspective.‚ÄúLooking ahead for 2023  we remain focused on executing our growth plans with respect to our business lines of Equity  Fixed Income and Crypto  Currencies and Commodities.

The increase in agricultural raw materials prices and widespread inflation weighed on the overall environment but without affecting our growth. Thanks to the depth of our ranges and the quality of our services  we have remained a benchmark for our customers  to whom we have offered competitiveness and secure supply. We were able to pass on the price increase by effectively managing our inventories. In terms of external growth  after BTN in Haas in 2021  we acquired Kabelis in 2022 to become a leader in the landscaping market in France and Europe. Despite all the challenges posed in 2022  we maintained our sales momentum  driven by the constant desire to safeguard our profitability. We are ready to take on new challenges in 2023 and continue to grow.‚ÄùContinued acceleration in Q4 2022: +28% (+21% organic) to ‚Ç¨35.4mQ4 2022 sales totalled ‚Ç¨35.4m  up a substantial 28% year on year. The Group achieved double-digit organic growth (+21%).For full-year 2022  consolidated revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨130.8m  up 21%  including the Kabelis Group companies acquired in July 2022. The Group‚Äôs consolidated revenue increased 10% on a like-for-like basis.Story continuesThe Farming Supplies business (89% of annual revenue)  whose products are marketed under the Vital Concept brand  generated revenue of ‚Ç¨116.8m in 2022  up 21% compared with 2021 (+10% organic). In 2022  WINFARM proactively succeeded in passing on the substantial price fluctuations of its products while responding to customer demand against a backdrop of shortages. Underpinned by keen anticipation and agility  this robust management enabled the Group to continue winning new business throughout 2022.Revenue from the Agronutrition business (10% of annual revenue)  marketed under the Alphatech brand  came out at ‚Ç¨12.2m  up sharply (+25% like-for-like and organic). The performance was driven by the Group‚Äôs aggressive sales policy  particularly in exports.2023: initial easing in pricesWINFARM expects prices to gradually return to a more normal level in 2023. By building up inventories consistent with its reasonable purchasing policy  the Group will be able to maintain its competitive edge with customers and reinforce its standing as a key player in the upstream agricultural sector in Europe.In the longer term  the Group is confirming its revenue target for 2025 of around ‚Ç¨200m and an EBITDA margin of around 6.5%. It expects to achieve half of this acceleration in growth through organic growth and half through external growth.About WINFARMFounded in Loud√©ac  in the heart of Brittany  in the early 1990s  WINFARM is now the French leader in distance selling for the agricultural world.

As of December 31  2022  the Group‚Äôs sales totaled ‚Ç¨753.3 million  up 2.9% from the 2021 fiscal year. This revenue includes a favorable currency effect of ‚Ç¨29.3 million  mainly due to the dollar‚Äôs appreciation over the period. At constant exchange rates (CER)  activity was down slightly by -1.1% over the year.Distribution of consolidated group revenue by quarter (IFRS)In millions of euros2022at current exchange ratesChange (%)2022at constant exchange rates1Change (%) 20211st quarter 181.1 +2.7% 177.3 +0.5% 176.3 2nd quarter 190.0 +1.7% 181.0 -3.1% 186.8 3rd quarter 198.1 +11.4% 187.0 +5.1% 177.9 4th quarter 184.1 -3.7% 178.7 -6.5% 191.1 Total 753.3 +2.9% 724.0 -1.1% 732.1[1] Constant exchange rates (CER): the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous fiscal year.In 2022  activity slowed at the Raleigh (North America) industrial site  affecting sales worldwide  mainly due to delays in the production of Optiray¬Æ and pre-filled syringes.As a reminder  the decrease in the Raleigh site‚Äôs production rates last year was due to two factors:Production line priority was given to manufacturing Elucirem TM over the fourth quarter as Guerbet awaited the FDA marketing authorization (MA)  which was obtained on September 21.As was the case with the region‚Äôs entire industrial area  the Raleigh site faced significant recruitment difficulties in the first half of 2022. Guerbet‚Äôs new organization led to a sharp upturn in hiring in the summer. However  given the time needed for training on the production lines  production rates were still not fully back to normal at the end of 2022.Story continuesGeographical distribution of consolidated group revenue (IFRS)In millions of euros at December 31  20222022at current exchange ratesChange (%)2022at constant exchange rates1Change (%) 2021Sales in EMEA 328.6 -2.3% 329.9 -1.9% 336.2 Sales in Americas 228.5 +3.7% 203.8 -7.5% 220.5 Sales in Asia 196.1 +11.8% 190.2 +8.5% 175.4 Total 753.3 +2.9% 724.0 -1.1% 732.1[1] Constant exchange rates: the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous fiscal year.In the EMEA region  the Group‚Äôs activity was down -1.9% at CER in the wake of lower volumes and slight price erosion stemming from the regulatory price reductions in France. In addition  the shutdown of commercial activity in Turkey last November had an impact on fourth quarter revenue.In the Americas  sales rose 3.7% over the year thanks to a significant currency effect (+‚Ç¨24.7 million). The decline in activity at CER (-7.5%) was entirely due to lower volumes  attributable to production delays at the Raleigh site.Activity in Asia saw vigorous annual growth (+8.5% at CER)  with an acceleration in the second half of the year. Performance in China (+45.6% in 2022) was driven by the rollout of direct distribution  which benefited nearly all of the Group‚Äôs products as of the end of 2022.Distribution of consolidated group revenue by activity (IFRS)In millions of euros at December 31  20222022at current exchange ratesChange (%)2022at constant exchange rates1Change (%) 2021Diagnostic Imaging 662.8 +1.7% 637.3 -2.2% 651.8 MRI 247.5 +5.5% 238.5 +1.7% 234.6 X-Ray 415.3 -0.5% 398.8 -4.4% 417.2 Interventional Imaging 90.4 +12.7% 86.7 +8.1% 80.2 Total 753.3 +2.9% 724.0 -1.1% 732.1[1] Constant exchange rates: the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous fiscal year.Annual revenue in Diagnostic Imaging was up 1.7% at current exchange rates and down -2.2% at CER.In MRI  annual sales rose 1.7% at CER (+5.5% at current exchange rates) owing to higher volumes. Price erosion was minimal despite the launch of generic Dotarem¬Æ in the United States.X-ray activity declined -4.4% at CER in 2022 due to the lower revenue from Optiray¬Æ. Sales of Xenetix¬Æ (+5.5%) and injection solutions (+4.8%) remained strong throughout the year.In Interventional Imaging  activity rose 12.7% at current exchange rates over the year and 8.1% at CER thanks to the remarkable momentum of Lipiodol¬Æ. Its sales accelerated considerably in the second half of the year  especially in the fourth quarter (+33.3% at CER).Confirmation of the 2022 profitability target  acceleration of activity in 2023For 2022  despite the revenue shortfall associated with the temporary drop in production in Raleigh  Guerbet confirmed its ability to generate an EBITDA margin of between 13% and 14%  excluding extraordinary costs from the optimization of the Group‚Äôs operating structure and changes in the sales model in China. In addition  following the announcements released on November 3  2022  and January 16  2023  on its new strategic orientations in Augmented Intelligence and Interventional Imaging  the Group specifies that it will record for fiscal 2022  asset impairments related to Accurate Medical Therapeutics and software developed with IBM Watson.In 2023  the Raleigh site‚Äôs production rates should return to full capacity in the first quarter  bringing the commercial activity back up to standard in the second quarter. Guerbet will therefore be in a position to take full advantage of the favorable trend in the contrast agents market in terms of both volumes and prices. The Group intends to strengthen its positions in Diagnostic Imaging with the commercial launch of EluciremTM in the United States and Europe at the end of the year  as well as in Interventional Imaging  where the very positive momentum of Lipiodol¬Æ is expected to continue.Given all these factors  despite the persistent inflationary pressures affecting its supply costs (mainly iodine)  the Group is confident for 2023. Its revenue growth target for this year is above 5% on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates.About GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

The findings were published in the journal The Lancet Haematology.CYAD-01 is the Company‚Äôs first autologous CAR T-cell candidate  based on the natural killer receptor NKG2D  assessed clinically. The completed THINK study was an open-label  dose-escalation Phase 1 study for patients with r/r AML  MDS  or MM  after at least one previous line of therapy. Patients were recruited from five hospitals in the USA and Belgium.The Lancet Haematology publication includes data from the 16 patients treated with CYAD-01 in the dose escalation segment of the study  which evaluated three dose levels of CYAD-01 using a schedule of three infusions at two-week intervals in the absence of any preconditioning chemotherapy. Overall  CYAD-01 showed favourable safety data with signs of clinical activity with three of the 12 evaluable AML/MDS patients presenting an objective response.Importantly  the THINK study is one of the first completed dose-escalation CAR T-cell studies in r/r AML/MDS. Unlike the majority of the studies evaluating CAR T-cell therapy candidates  the THINK study evaluated multiple infusions of CYAD-01 as a stand-alone product candidate (i.e.  without prior bridging or preconditioning chemotherapy). This feature is of particular interest considering the median older age and the poorer general condition of patients with r/r AML or MDS at diagnosis.Although the need to improve the anti-tumour activity is warranted  these data in a difficult-to-treat patient population potentially provide the proof-of-concept of targeting NKG2D ligands by a CAR T-cell product candidate  and support the further development of NKG2D-based CAR T-cell therapies.About Celyad OncologyCelyad Oncology is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of innovative technologies for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies. The Company is focusing on opportunities to fully harness the true potential of its proprietary technology platforms and intellectual property and support the development of next-generation CAR T candidates in solid tumors and hematological malignancies.

As of 9 January 2023  7 patients diagnosed with rrCLL (4 patients with RT) were enrolled in the study (n=4 at dose level 1 (DL1); n=3 at dose level 2 (DL2)). All patients received GLPG5201 as a fresh infusion with a median vein-to-vein time of 7 days. The dose levels that are evaluated in the Phase 1 part of the study are 35x106 (DL1)  100x106 (DL2) and 300x106 (dose level 3 (DL3)) CAR+ viable T cells.The initial results from these 7 patients that were eligible for efficacy analysis (cut-off date: 9 January 2023) indicated that a 7-day vein-to-vein time is feasible and demonstrated strong and consistent in vivo CAR-T expansion levels. Moreover  the initial efficacy results are encouraging with an objective response rate (ORR) of 100% observed. 6 out of 7 patients (86%) reached a complete response (CR) and all Richter‚Äôs patients achieved a CR. A duration of response of up to 7.9 months has been reported and follow-up is ongoing. Only 1 patient (DL1) progressed (progressive disease  PD  after partial response  PR) and had a CD19-negative relapse with confirmed Richter‚Äôs transformation.Story continuesIn the safety analysis of these 7 patients  adverse events were consistent with the known toxicities of CD19 CAR-T treatment. None of the patients experienced a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) higher than grade 2 at both dose levels and no immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) was reported. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported and the majority of grade ‚â•3 adverse events were hematological. Only one serious adverse event was reported at DL2 with a patient experiencing a CRS grade 2  but the event was resolved after 7 days.‚ÄúWe were very pleased to present strong initial data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 study of our fresh CD19 CAR-T candidate manufactured at point-of-care. This marks an important milestone in our journey to transform the lives of patients with severe blood cancers  including patients with RT  through the acceleration of innovation and breakthrough science‚Äù  said Dr. Paul Stoffels1  CEO of Galapagos. ‚ÄúWe look forward to reporting Phase 1 topline data around mid-year.‚ÄùDetails of the poster presentation:Abstract Title Authors Presentation date/time Initial Clinical Results of Euplagia-1  a Phase I/II Trial of Point-of-CareManufactured GLPG5201 in R/R CLL/SLL with or without Richter's transformationNuria Martinez-Cibrian  Sergi Betriu  Valentin Ortiz-Maldonado  Daniel Estban  Leticia Alserawan  Mercedes Montoro  Anna DD van Muyden  Maike Spoon  Margot J.

The proprietary platform consists of CellPoint‚Äôs end-to-end xCellit workflow management and monitoring software and Lonza‚Äôs Cocoon¬Æ Platform  a functionally closed  automated manufacturing platform for cell therapies.About the EUPLAGIA-1 study (EudraCT 2021-003815-25)EUPLAGIA-1 is an ongoing Phase 1/2 open-label  multi-center study evaluating the feasibility  safety  and efficacy of point-of-care manufactured GLPG5201 in patients with relapsed/refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (rrCLL) and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (rrSLL)  with or without Richter‚Äôs transformation (RT). GLPG5201 is a second generation anti-CD19/4-1BB CAR-T product candidate  administered as intravenous infusion of a fresh product candidate in a single fixed dose. Patients with CD19+ rrCLL or rrSLL with >2 lines of therapy are eligible to participate  and patients with RT are eligible regardless of prior therapy. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the study is to evaluate safety and determine the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of the study. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to assess the objective response rate (ORR) and the secondary objectives include the analysis of the complete response rate (CRR)  duration of response  progression free survival  overall survival  safety pharmacokinetic profile  and feasibility of point-of-care manufacturing.The planned dose levels that are evaluated in the Phase 1 part of the study are 35x106 (DL1)  100x106 (DL2) and 300x106 (DL3) CAR+ viable T cells. The study uses a Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design (n=15 patients) for Phase 1. Following screening and enrolment  patients will receive ibrutinib continuously until leukapheresis of mononuclear cells. During GLPG5201 manufacturing  patients receive cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2/day)/fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day) for 3 days. After a resting period of at least 2 days  GLPG5201 is administered via intravenous infusion. All patients remain hospitalized for at least 7 days and the end-of-study visit is at Week 14 post CAR-T infusion. The study is currently enrolling rrCLL/SLL patients in Europe  including patients with Richter‚Äôs transformation  and we aim to provide topline results for Phase 1 around mid-2023.About Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Small Lymphocytic LymphomaChronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is one of the chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (lymphoid neoplasms). It is characterized by a progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes  which are usually monoclonal in origin. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Small Lymphocytic Leukemia (SLL) are essentially the same type of B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)  with the only difference the location where the primary cancer occurs. CLL affects B-cells in the blood and bone marrow and SLL cancer cells are located in lymph nodes and/or the spleen2. Richter's transformation is an uncommon clinicopathological condition observed in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). It is characterized by the sudden transformation of the CLL into a significantly more aggressive form of large cell lymphoma  and occurs in approximately 2-10% of all CLL patients. CLL/SLL usually follows an indolent course and is an incurable disease. Patients who develop relapsed and refractory disease and become resistant to new agents have a dismal prognosis and a high unmet medical need for new therapeutic options such as CAR-T cells. With estimated incidence of 4.7 new cases per 100 000 individuals  CLL/SLL are the most prevalent lymphoid malignancy and are the most common adult leukemias in the US and in Europe3.About GalapagosGalapagos is a fully integrated biotechnology company focused on discovering  developing  and commercializing innovative medicines.

In particular  tenant sales and rent collection returned to pre-pandemic levels and we delivered consistent improvement in operating metrics across all regions.Our proactive leasing strategy yielded a higher proportion of longer-term leases at increased rents while we also benefitted from Sales Based Rents and the positive impact of indexation. In 2023  we will perform as retailers and brands optimise their store networks with us  with a focus on the most productive stores in prime locations as part of their drive-to-store strategies.Strong growth in Commercial Partnerships revenues clearly demonstrated the opportunity to generate new revenues from qualifying the audience of visitors to our centres  especially in Europe where we launched Westfield Rise  an in-house media advertising agency.Higher earnings  combined with a -‚Ç¨1.9 Bn debt reduction thanks to disposals in the US and Europe  translated into enhanced credit metrics. The Group‚Äôs robust operational performance and strong liquidity position allows us to progress our deleveraging programme in a timely and orderly manner  including the radical reduction of our US financial exposure.The Group is on track to deliver its ‚Äú2024 and beyond‚Äù strategy  which includes maximising asset value through the disciplined delivery of our committed pipeline and unlocking new development opportunities  with a focus on urban regeneration and environmental transition projects.‚ÄùFY-2022 FY-2021 Growth Like-for-like growth5 Net Rental Income (in ‚Ç¨ Mn) 2 226 1 724 29.1% 27.4%6 Shopping Centres 2 024 1 632 24.0% 21.5%7 Offices & Others 70 60 16.0% 23.2% Convention & Exhibition 132 32 n.m. n.m.

All regions benefitted from higher variable income and lower doubtful debtors due to higher rent collection including 2021 rents. Performance in Continental Europe was also positively impacted by the end of COVID-19 rent discounts as well as indexation  and in the UK by lower rent relief and higher Sales Based Rents (SBR). The US benefitted from higher SBR  parking income and Commercial Partnerships  partly offset by negative MGR uplifts on short-term deals. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 rent relief  the like-for-like NRI growth would be +7.8% for the Group.2022 tenant sales9 were at 103% of 2019 levels  including 101% in Continental Europe  96% in the UK and 108% in the US  and footfall10 was at 90% of 2019 levels  including 88% in Continental Europe  89% in the UK and 94% in the US (96% excluding Westfield World Trade Center and Westfield San Francisco Centre in which footfall remains affected by work-from-home trends). Footfall is expected to continue to grow as vacancy decreases.In H2-2022  European tenant sales reached 102% of 2019 levels (vs. 98% in H1-2022). Sales performance in 2022 differed by sector in Europe. In particular  Health and Beauty was +11%  Sports +15%  while Fashion -5% and Entertainment -12% vs. 2019 levels. Entertainment saw an improvement from -14% in H1 to -10% in H2 and Fashion from -7% to -2%.In the US  tenant sales have consistently outperformed pre-COVID levels since H1-2021. Overall  2022 sales came to 108% of 2019 levels driven by Flagship assets at 117%  Regionals at 100% and partly offset by the Central Business District (‚ÄúCBD‚Äù)11 assets at 74%. The strong growth continued to be broad-based with almost all categories performing above 2019 levels  such as Luxury (+83%)  Home (+37%)  F&B (+10%) and Fashion (+3%). Entertainment saw an improvement from -25% in H1 to -12% in H2.Rent collection12 amounted to 97% for 2022 (vs. 88% at FY-2021 and 96% in H1-2022)  including 97% in Continental Europe  99% in the UK and 97% in the US  returning to pre-COVID levels. The Group continued to collect 2021 rents  leading to an improvement of 2021 rent collection from 88% to 93% between February 2022 and December 2022.URW signed ‚Ç¨441 Mn of MGR13 during 2022 (+26% compared to 2021) with an MGR uplift of +6.2% (vs. -5.2% in 2021). As market conditions improved  the proportion of long-term deals signed also increased from 61% of MGR signed in 2021 to 68% in 2022. The MGR uplift for leases longer than 36 months came to +14.4% for the Group  with Continental Europe at +8.9%  the UK at +3.6% and the US at +36.0%.SBR14  which are mainly generated in the US  increased to ‚Ç¨123.6 Mn in 2022 (6.1% of NRI) from ‚Ç¨80.2 Mn in 2021 (5.0% of NRI) of which ‚Ç¨77.7 Mn was for the US and ‚Ç¨45.9 Mn for Europe.Vacancy for Shopping Centres at a Group level decreased significantly to 6.5% at FY-2022  down from 8.9% at H1-2021 and 7.0% at FY-2021. In Continental Europe  vacancy was 3.1%  down from 4.0% in December 2021 and 5.0% in June 2021. In the UK  vacancy also decreased from 12.2% in June 2021 and 10.6% in December 2021 to 9.4% at FY-2022. In the US  the vacancy reduced to 10.4% at FY-2022 from 14.0% in June 2021 and 11.0% at FY-2021  with vacancy decreasing by -110 bps year-on-year to 8.2% in the Flagships.Indexation and inflationURW rents are indexed on a yearly basis in Continental Europe. 2022 indexation contribution to like-for-like retail NRI performance in Continental Europe was +3.6%  reflecting 2021 inflation due to the usual time lag between contractual indexation and inflation. In the UK and the US  leases are not tied to actual CPI figures but the Group benefitted from inflation through SBR.Commercial PartnershipsRevenue from Commercial Partnerships15 increased from ‚Ç¨76.2 Mn in 2021 to ‚Ç¨115.5 Mn in 2022  driven in part by the launch in Europe of Westfield Rise  an in-house media  brand experience and data partnerships agency.Total Westfield Rise activity in Europe amounted to ‚Ç¨45.5 Mn in net margin at 100% share in 2022  up +23% compared to 2019 (and +52% compared to 202116). This new division (for which figures are reported at 100%) will generate ‚Ç¨75 Mn16 in annual net margin by 2024  a +‚Ç¨45 Mn increase compared to 2021  with strong potential growth beyond 2024.Offices & OthersOffice NRI increased by +16.0%  primarily as a result of deliveries of Pullman Montparnasse and Ga√Æt√© Montparnasse offices  partly offset by 2021 and 2022 disposals  especially Solna Centrum. On a like-for-like basis  office NRI increased by +23.2%  with +44.2% in France  mainly due to leasing activity at Trinity in La D√©fense  now 74% let.Two new leases (Santarelli and Alain Afflelou) were signed for Trinity in 2022 at an average rent of c. ‚Ç¨567/sqm17  with lease incentives below the market average. In addition  33 100 sqm were leased on projects  including Lightwell in La D√©fense (80% pre-let) and Westfield Hamburg offices (29% pre-let)  both due to be delivered in 2024.Convention & ExhibitionIn 2022  Viparis hosted 617 events (including 189 exhibitions  75 congresses and 353 corporate events) compared to 236 events in 2020 and 721 events in 2018.Convention & Exhibition recurring NOI amounted to ‚Ç¨190.2 Mn compared to ‚Ç¨55.2 Mn in 2021 and ‚Ç¨164.7 Mn in 2018. This includes the ‚Ç¨25 Mn contribution from the French State to compensate closure periods in earlier years. Restated from this and triennial shows (held in 2018 and 2022)  the NOI is slightly above 2018  due to the strong recovery of activity and the shift of certain biannual shows  despite the remaining impact of COVID-19 in the first quarter.As at January 31  2023  signed and pre-booked events in Viparis venues for 2023 amounted to 86%18 of 2019 pre-bookings  the last comparable year.D ISPOSALSIn total  the Group completed disposals in Europe and in the US that represents ‚Ç¨1.8 Bn of IFRS net debt reduction.In Europe  URW completed disposals in 2022 that represents a ‚Ç¨1.2 Bn of IFRS net debt reduction at an average NIY of 5.5% and an average premium to last unaffected book value of +2.7%.

In addition  URW‚Äôs partner in Aupark exercised its call option for the acquisition of an additional 27% stake.In total  URW has now reached ‚Ç¨3.2 Bn19 of its ‚Ç¨4.0 Bn European disposals programme representing 80%  at an average NIY of 4.9% (including 5.4% for the Shopping Centres and 3.9% for the Offices & Others)  a premium to the last unaffected appraisal of +4.9% (including +1.3% for the Shopping Centres and +12.3% for the Offices & Others). The Group expects to complete the European disposals programme during 2023.URW will continue the asset and property management for several of the assets sold  including Aupark  Westfield Carr√© S√©nart  Gera Arcaden and Carr√© S√©nart Shopping Parc  allowing the Group to earn management fees and consequently increase the return on investment for those assets.In the US  the Group also continued efforts to streamline its US Regional portfolio with the completion in 2022 of a total of $0.6 Bn of disposals20. These include the disposals of the Promenade development parcel in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles  Westfield Santa Anita  The Village at Topanga  as well as Westfield Trumbull and Westfield South Shore. These transactions were completed at a discount of -0.5% to 2021 book value. Together with the disposal of the Palisade residential building and the ownership transfer of five other regional properties in 2021  URW has made $1.3 Bn in total proceeds to date from the planned radical reduction of its financial exposure to the US.In 2023  the Group will continue to streamline its remaining US Regional asset portfolio. URW is committed to the radical reduction of its financial exposure to the US  a process that is supported by the strong operational performance of the assets and the Group‚Äôs liquidity position.DELIVERIES & PIPELINEThe Total Investment Cost (TIC)21 of URW‚Äôs development pipeline decreased by -‚Ç¨0.1 Bn to ‚Ç¨3.1 Bn  compared to December 31  2021  mainly as a result of the delivery of projects  representing ‚Ç¨0.4 Bn  new projects and increasing costs.In 2022  the Group delivered the 19 439 sqm Westfield Topanga extension  ‚ÄúRue de la Boucle‚Äù  a 10 000 sqm destination at Westfield Forum des Halles  the Ga√Æt√© Montparnasse Office project as well as Les Ateliers Ga√Æt√© shopping centre (33 364 sqm) to complete the Ga√Æt√© Montparnasse mixed-use complex  one of the most ambitious and largest urban regeneration projects in Paris. The average letting22 of these deliveries stands at 88% as at December 31  2022.Committed projects amount to ‚Ç¨2.4 Bn  of which ‚Ç¨1.2 Bn has already been invested. The two main projects are the mixed used development in Hamburg (Westfield Hamburg-√úberseequartier) and the residential project of Coppermaker Square.In 2023  URW plans to deliver the Garbera shopping centre extension project  Coppermaker Square Retail (a leisure development adjacent to Westfield Stratford City)  the renovation project of the Westfield Les 4 Temps main plaza ‚ÄúLa Clairi√®re‚Äù  CNIT Eole  a redevelopment at the CNIT shopping centre  and Fisketorvet dining area. The average pre-letting22 of these projects stands at 81%.VALUATIONThe proportionate Gross Market Value (GMV) of the Group‚Äôs assets as at December 31  2022  decreased by-4.1% to ‚Ç¨52.2 Bn from ‚Ç¨54.5 Bn as at December 31  2021  mainly as a result of disposals (-‚Ç¨1.8 Bn) and a like-for-like portfolio revaluation of -‚Ç¨1.3 Bn (-2.7%)  partly offset by CAPEX  Acquisitions and Transfers (+‚Ç¨0.9 Bn) and positive FX moves (+‚Ç¨0.4 Bn). The like-for-like shopping centres valuation was -2.6% for 2022 including-2.3% in H2 as appraisers increased their assumption of discount and exit cap rates.The EPRA Net Reinstatement Value per share came to ‚Ç¨155.70 as at December 31  2022  down -‚Ç¨3.90 (-2.4%) compared to December 31  2021  mainly driven by the revaluation of investment properties  partly offset by the retained recurring results.FINANCIAL RESOURCESAs at December 31  2022  the Group‚Äôs IFRS net financial debt decreased to ‚Ç¨20.7 Bn (from ‚Ç¨22.6 Bn as at December 31  2021) mainly driven by the disposals completed in 2022.The Group‚Äôs credit metrics improved over the period supported by strong operational performance and deleveraging progress. URW‚Äôs Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio23 decreased to 41.2% (vs. 43.3% as at December 31  2021)  Net debt/EBITDA24 ratio decreased to 9.6x (vs. 13.7x in 2021)  below its 2019 level (9.9x)  the Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) increased to 4.2x (vs. 3.3x in 2021)  and Funds from Operations to Net Financial Debt (FFO/NFD) ratio improved to 7.6% (vs. 5.0% in 2021).Over 2022  URW further strengthened its liquidity position by raising ‚Ç¨1 332 Mn (‚Ç¨1 682 Mn on a proportionate basis) of medium to long-term funds25 in the mortgage and corporate bank debt market  out of which ‚Ç¨900 Mn (‚Ç¨1 250 Mn on a proportionate basis) is sustainability-linked.The Group‚Äôs liquidity position increased by ca. +‚Ç¨0.9 Bn over the year to reach ‚Ç¨13.0 Bn and ‚Ç¨13.2 Bn on a proportionate basis including ‚Ç¨3.3 Bn of cash on hand26 (vs. ‚Ç¨2.3 Bn as at December 31  2021)  allowing the Group to fully secure its debt maturities for the next 36 months.Regarding the ‚Ç¨1.25 Bn perpetual non-call 2023 hybrid  the terms and conditions of the instrument provide for the issuer a call option27 in 2023  and annually thereafter.The decision regarding this call will be made ahead of its First Reset Date28 (i.e. October 25  2023).The Group‚Äôs average debt maturity29 stood at 8.3 years.The Group‚Äôs average cost of debt remained stable at 2.0%  representing a blended average cost of 1.5% for Euro30 denominated debt and 3.8% for USD and GBP denominated debt  thanks to both the Group‚Äôs hedging instruments in place limiting the impact of rates increases and to positive cash deposit rates.The Group‚Äôs debt is fully hedged for 2023 and the following years  limiting the impact of any rates increase on the Group‚Äôs financial expenses for 2023.ESG2022 marks another year of ESG progress for the Group under its Better Places 2030 strategy. Having achieved a -17% reduction of energy intensity since 2015 in Europe  URW set an additional target to reduce its energy intensity by -15% in 2022 compared to 2019 in Europe to support national and European efforts to address the energy crisis. Thanks to a range of proactive measures  URW was able to outperform this target  reaching -19.8%  supporting both governments efforts and mitigating costs impacts for tenants.URW is on track to meet all Better Places 2030 targets  including cutting carbon emissions by 50% between 2015 and 2030. The Group is committed to contribute to global carbon neutrality and will present a step-change update to its plan in autumn 2023  with a view to establishing new commitments.The Group‚Äôs CSR agenda was recognised by equity and debt investors as a value creation driver for its stakeholders. In 2022  URW inclusion in the main ESG indices was confirmed and the Group‚Äôs sustainability achievements were registered in ratings and awards.2023 GUIDANCEThanks to the improvement in 2022 operating performance  higher indexation  the positioning of the Group on prime and well-located assets  and retailers‚Äô drive-to-store strategies  as well as deleveraging progress  URW is well-positioned to continue to perform in what is expected to remain an uncertain macro environment in 2023.In this context  the Group forecasts its 2023 AREPS to be in the range of ‚Ç¨9.30 to ‚Ç¨9.50. The main drivers of this guidance are:Consistent performance in our retail operations versus 2022 with inflation protection through indexation and SBR;The impact of large event scheduling changes in 2022  leading to a naturally lower Convention & Exhibition activity in 2023;Full-year effect of 2022 disposals  impact of US regional streamlining and the European disposal programme;Contribution of 2022 and 2023 project deliveries;Stable cost of funding thanks to Group‚Äôs hedging programme;FX impact with the strengthening of the Euro vs. USD.This guidance does not include major disposals in the US in the context of the radical reduction of its financial exposure.The Group assumes no major energy-related restrictions  nor major deterioration to the macro-economic and geopolitical environment.DIVIDENDComplying with the deleveraging commitments made in 2021  the Group will not pay a dividend for fiscal year 2022.Given the statutory results of URW SE in 2022 (+‚Ç¨90 Mn in 2022 and cumulated negative retained earnings of -‚Ç¨2 341 Mn)  the Group has no obligation to pay a dividend in 2023 for the fiscal year 2022 under the SIIC regime and other REIT regimes it benefits from. Consequently  URW SE‚Äôs total carry forward SIIC distribution obligation  standing at ‚Ç¨1 720 Mn as at December 31  2022  will be delayed until URW SE has sufficient statutory results to meet this obligation. These statutory results do not prevent URW SE from making distributions out of its premium.EURONEXT LISTINGThe Group started discussions with Euronext in order to change its market of reference from Euronext Amsterdam to Euronext Paris as part of an initiative to simplify its structure given limited trading activity on that market. As a part of this request  the Group intends to delist the URW Stapled Shares from Euronext Amsterdam  while maintaining a single listing on Euronext Paris. The delisting from Euronext Amsterdam would not affect the liquidity of the shares nor have any impact on trading  URW‚Äôs organisation (including the stapled share principle) or the ISIN code (FR0013326246) of the Group.Subject to approval by the Euronext Listing Board  the Group expects these changes to be effective by the end of April 2023.Further information regarding this process will be communicated as appropriate.FINANCIAL SCHEDULEThe next financial events on the Group‚Äôs calendar will be:April 26  2023: Q1 trading updateMay 10  2023: AGM Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield SEJuly 27  2023: H1-2023 resultsFor further information  please contact:Investor RelationsAudrey Arnoux+33 6 61 27 07 39Audrey.Arnoux@urw.comMedia RelationsUK/Global:Cornelia Schnepf ‚Äì Finelk+44 7387 108 998Cornelia.Schnepf@finelk.euFrance:Sonia Fellmann ‚Äì PLEAD+33 6 27 84 91 30Sonia.Fellmann@plead.frUnited States:Molly Morse ‚Äì Kekst CNC+ 1 212 521 4826Molly.Morse@kekstcnc.comAbout Unibail-Rodamco-WestfieldUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield is an owner  developer and operator of sustainable  high-quality real estate assets in the most dynamic cities in Europe and the United States.The Group operates 78 shopping centres in 12 countries  including 45 which carry the iconic Westfield brand.

All primary endpoints were met in POSEIDON  our pivotal North American alfapump study  allowing us to prepare for PMA filing and US commercial launch planned for 2024. We believe that there is a clear need for improved treatment options for the large and growing number of patients suffering from recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. The North American market is forecast to grow between 6-7% annually reaching over 170 000 patients in 2035  representing a total addressable market for the alfapump of over US $2.5bn2.‚Äù‚ÄúOur DSR therapy demonstrated substantial long-lasting clinical benefits in decompensated heart failure patients. Top-line data from our SAHARA study showed the safe  effective and rapid elimination of persistent congestion  important improvements in cardiovascular and renal health  and the restoration of diuretic response of the kidney. We are very excited by the great potential of DSR as a disease-modifying therapy that could help the estimated 200 000 US heart failure patients suffering from diuretic-resistant congestion. We have moved swiftly with our second-generation DSR product  successfully completing GLP pre-clinical safety studies  dosing the first patients in our Phase 1 single-dose studies and we are looking forward to starting MOJAVE  our US Phase 1/2a randomized controlled multi-center study in patients with congestive heart failure in Q2 2023.‚ÄùStory continues‚ÄúAs we prepare for commercialization of the alfapump in North America  we have continued to strengthen our Board with the addition of Doug Kohrs and Alexandra Clyde  two seasoned US medtech executives who bring with them invaluable knowledge and expertise in light of the next stage of Sequana Medical‚Äôs development.‚Äù‚ÄúWe are also pleased to welcome Rosetta Capital  an experienced long-term life sciences investor  as shareholders following the purchase of the shares held by Neomed V.‚Äù202 2 h ighlightsalfapump in liver diseasePOSEIDON ‚Äì North American pivotal study of the alfa pump in patients with recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis successfully met primary endpoint data: Reported positive top-line results in October 2022 from 40 patients of the Pivotal Cohort at six months post-implantation  including primary effectiveness endpoints substantially exceeding the predefined thresholds for study success and safety in line with expectations: 100% median per-patient reduction in therapeutic paracentesis (TP) post- vs pre-implantation (p<0.001)  vs hypothesis of at least 50% reduction. 77% of patients with at least 50% reduction in number of TP post- vs pre-implantation (p<0.001)  vs hypothesis of at least 50% of patients. Six primary safety events of which three involved explants due to wound or skin erosion  and three explants due to patient-reported discomfort (all patient-reported discomfort events were adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee as moderate severity)  in line with expectations. Reported results of a preliminary interim analysis 3 of patient survival from the Roll-In Cohort in April 2022 including 70% survival rate at one year post-implantation  comparing favorably to published literature of 50% survival rate for refractory ascites patients after one year 4 . Prof. Wong presented safety  efficacy and quality of life data from the Roll-In Cohort at the AASLD The Liver Meeting¬Æ in November 2022.US patient preference study initiated: Survey study to quantify patients‚Äô preferences for the alfa pump including treatment effectiveness and risks of treatment-related adverse events.

All patients improved their NYHA 6 status by at least one class. Clinical benefits result in a 75% reduction in predicted one-year mortality pre- vs. post-intensive DSR therapy based on the Seattle Heart Failure Model 7 .Focus on Short Term DSR therapy with proprietary DSR 2.0: Based on the results of RED DESERT and SAHARA  the Company expects that an intensive treatment period of three to four weeks of DSR therapy may deliver at least twelve months of important clinical benefits. As a result of the strong  durable clinical signals observed  the Company will focus the heart failure development program on Short Term DSR with its proprietary second-generation DSR product (DSR 2.0) administered via a peritoneal catheter. DSR 2.0 is expected to have an improved therapeutic and favorable safety profile with robust intellectual property protection.MOJAVE ‚Äì US Phase 1/2a randomized controlled multi-center study of DSR 2.0 in diuretic-resistant chronic heart failure patients with persistent congestion  on track to start in Q2 2023: Good progress of DSR 2.0 in product development and GLP 8 animal studies. Approval to start two Phase 1 single-arm  open-label  single-dose studies in Canada (YUKON) and Mexico (CHIHUAHUA) to evaluate the safety  tolerability and efficacy of DSR 2.0  with first patient dosed successfully in YUKON. Data from the GLP animal and Phase 1 CHIHUAHUA studies are intended to support the US IND 9 application filing of DSR 2.0  planned for Q1 2023. Preparations ongoing to start the MOJAVE study  planned for Q2 2023  assuming FDA approval of the US IND application. The intention is to enroll 30 diuretic-resistant chronic heart failure patients with persistent congestion  with 20 patients randomized to DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter on top of usual care for congestive heart failure (CHF) for up to four weeks and ten patients randomized to usual care for CHF alone.CorporateEuropean Medical Device Regulation (MDR) certification: Received MDR certification from the Company‚Äôs Notified Body  BSI  in February 2022  confirming that its QMS 10 and alfa pump system are compliant with the latest regulatory standards required for medical devices in Europe. alfa pump is one of the first novel Class III active implantable medical devices to receive such certification.Expanding the Board of Directors with seasoned US medtech executives: Appointed two highly experienced US medtech leaders as independent Non-Executive Directors.

The Company‚Äôs ability to continue operations also depends on its ability to raise additional capital and to refinance existing debt  in order to fund operations and assure the solvency of the Company until revenues reach a level to sustain positive cash flows.The impact of macroeconomic conditions and the geopolitical situation in Ukraine on the Company‚Äôs ability to secure additional financing rounds or undertake capital market transactions remains unclear at this point in time and will remain under review by the Executive Management and the Board of Directors.The above conditions indicate the existence of material uncertainties  which may also cast significant doubt about the Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern.With the existing cash resources  the current cash runway is sufficient into mid-2023. The Company continues to evaluate equity and other financing options  including discussions with existing as well as new investors.The Executive Management and the Board of Directors remain confident about the strategic plan  which comprises additional financing measures including equity and/or other financing sources  and therefore consider the financial information in this press release on a going concern basis as appropriate.Consolidated statement of cash flowsNet cash outflow from operating activities was ‚Ç¨27.48 million in 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨23.62 million in 2021. The outflow was mainly driven by higher net loss of the period.Cash flow from investing activities resulted in a net outflow of ‚Ç¨0.65 million in 2022  compared to a net outflow of ‚Ç¨0.34 million in 2021.Cash flow from financing activities resulted in a net inflow of ‚Ç¨37.32 million in 2022  mainly as a result of the proceeds from the equity placement in H1 2022  and the ‚Ç¨10 million loan facility with Kreos Capital secured in H2 2022. In 2021  the net inflow of ‚Ç¨22.44 million was mainly a result of the February 2021 equity placement.The Company ended 2022 with a total cash and cash equivalents amount of ‚Ç¨18.88 million (2021: ‚Ç¨9.60 million).Conference Call and WebcastSequana Medical will host a conference call with live webcast presentation today at 03:00 pm CEST / 09:00 am EST.Registration webcast: please click hereRegistration conference call (only if you wish to participate in the Q&A): please click here.

Through its unique approach of combining enzymes and plastics  Carbios aims to address new consumer expectations and the challenges of a broad ecological transition by taking up a major challenge of our time: plastic and textile pollution. Carbios deconstructs any type of PET (the dominant polymer in bottles  trays  textiles made of polyester) into its basic components which can then be reused to produce new PET plastics with equivalent quality to virgin ones. This PET innovation  the first of its kind in the world  was recently recognized in a scientific paper published in front cover of the prestigious journal Nature. Carbios successfully started up its demonstration plant in Clermont-Ferrand in 2021. It has now taken another key step towards the industrialization of its process with the construction of a first-of-a-kind unit in partnership with Indorama Ventures.In 2017  Carbios and L'OreÃÅal co-founded a consortium to contribute to the industrialization of its proprietary recycling technology. Committed to developing innovative solutions for sustainable development  NestleÃÅ Waters  PepsiCo and Suntory Beverage & Food Europe joined this consortium in April 2019. In 2022  Carbios signed an agreement with On  Patagonia  PUMA  and Salomon  to develop solutions promoting the recyclability and circularity of their products.The Company has also developed an enzymatic biodegradation technology for PLA-based (a bio sourced polymer) single-use plastics. This technology can create a new generation of plastics that are 100% compostable at ambient temperatures  even in domestic conditions  integrating enzymes at the heart of the plastic product.For more information  please visit / Twitter: carbios LinkedIn: carbios Instagram: insidecarbiosCarbios (ISIN FR0011648716/ALCRB) is eligible for the PEA-PME  a government program allowing French residents investing in SMEs to benefit from income tax rebates.Translation is for information purposes only.In case of discrepancy between the French and the English version of this press release  the English version shall prevailView source version on businesswire.com:,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.94,0.06,0.01,True,English,"['Four New Board Members', 'International Expertise', 'Brand Development', 'Business Growth', 'Carbios', 'untreated, high crystallinity PET plastics', 'three new female board members', 'Mateus SCHREINER GARCEZ LOPES', 'early R&D phase', 'Italian gastronomy concept franchise', 'Leo Yaffe Teaching Award', 'first philantropic endowment fund', 'iconic French knitwear brand', 'Tier 1 Canada Research Chair', 'former Chief Executive Officer', 'several Cannes Lions Awards', 'historic French fashion brand', 'emblematic French brand', 'Clara Benson Award', 'venture fund mentoring', 'Prof. Karine AUCLAIR', 'Amandine DE SOUZA', 'LE BHV MARAIS', 'senior executive management', 'key selection factor', 'solid industry experience', 'significant scientific contributions', 'clean enzymatic depolymerization', 'Branding Executive Vice-President', 'Galeries Lafayette Group', 'McGill Tomlinson Professorship', 'McGill Fessenden Professorship', 'four new members', 'fashion department stores', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'Lacoste maison turnaround', 'numerous professional awards', 'new scientific expertise', 'strong, proven expertise', 'numerous awards', 'former CEO', 'several patents', 'new expertise', 'French retail', 'new structure', 'Executive Board', 'Group Marketing', 'McGill University', 'proven results', 'stellar professional', 'strong contribution', 'strong signal', 'strong growth', 'sustainable fashion', 'business wire', 'Regulatory News', 'biological technologies', 'life cycle', 'General Manager', 'Leisure Purchasing', 'Global Director', 'various industries', 'high-growth markets', 'biological solutions', 'CSR issues', 'strategic vision', 'CSR commitments', 'commercial plans', 'Jacqueline LECOURTIER', 'Jean FALGOUX', 'Alain CHEVALLIER', 'Jean-Claude LUMARET', 'commercial stage', 'Philippe POULETTY', 'complementary backgrounds', 'radical innovation', 'ESG criteria', 'Canadian Society', 'bioorganic chemist', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'closed-loop recycling', '100 peer-reviewed publications', 'high-impact journals', 'recognized leader', 'academic conferences', 'grant applications', 'worldwide institutions', 'moist-solid mixtures', 'plastic biorecycling', 'global businesses', 'various divisions', 'Personal Care', 'Latin America', 'Raise Sherpa', 'funding partner', 'NEO FOUNDERS', 'transformative adventure', 'beauty industries', ""Carbios' research"", 'Sandrine CONSEILLER', 'Energy Transition', ""Carbios' commitment"", 'Green Enzymes', 'impact start-ups', 'business development', ""Carbios' Board"", 'ALCRB', 'pioneer', 'industrialization', 'textiles', 'appointment', 'Directors', 'Chemistry', 'Aigle', 'Eataly', 'Home', 'DIY', 'Investments', 'Raizen', 'sectors', 'addition', 'sensitivity', 'field', 'years', 'company', 'internationalization', 'success', 'Chairman', 'passion', 'planet', 'THE', 'Antimicrobials', 'biocatalysis', 'enzymology', 'work', 'media', 'biodegradation', 'career', 'Unilever', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'Phildar', 'children', 'decoration']",2023-02-09,2023-02-09,menafn.com

Overall  WALLIX delivered year-on-year growth of 9%  naturally impacted by the economic climate but driven nonetheless by the strong momentum among medium-sized companies in all our markets. This performance illustrates the strength of the cybersecurity sector  driven by the opening up of information system  the development of mobility within organizations and interconnectivity with the world of machines: OT. The ever-present threat of cybercrime coupled with tightening regulations will continue to fuel corporate investment over the long term. WALLIX is therefore ideally placed as a new leader in Privileged Access Management (PAM) recognized by major consulting firms KuppingerCole  Gartner and Frost & Sullivan.In 2022  we made the investments required for the successful execution of our Unicorn 25 strategic plan  initially scheduled for two years' time. The Group has therefore laid the foundations for its future growth based on the enhancement of its offering with the launch of WALLIX PAM4ALL  already recognized as a leading PAM solution  and OT.security  its dedicated industrial cybersecurity solution  the consolidation of its position in Europe  and development in North America.Most of the investments having been completed  2023 will be dedicated to leveraging our assets in order to ramp up and reach critical mass in our strategic regions. WALLIX US and our industrial cybersecurity solutions are set to make a significant contribution to the Group's growth. Acceleration in 2023 will also involve consolidating our leadership in Europe  the Middle East and Africa  with a new support program dedicated to the partners in order to supply companies and their subcontractors in regulated sectors. With solutions recognized for their innovation and adaptability backed by the expertise acquired in sensitive business verticals such as industry  healthcare and MSP/MSSP  by relying on a robust and well-distributed partner network  WALLIX is ideally positioned to continue to gain market share worldwide  and to support the implementation of the NIS 2 directive in Europe from 2024.""Significant recovery in the second half  as announcedBusiness growth accelerated in the second half of the year  with turnover up 10.1% overall and up 19.2% excluding Russia. Full-year turnover was ‚Ç¨25.2 million  up 8.7%. Excluding business with Russia (down 65% to ‚Ç¨618 000)  turnover was up 14.8%.Momentum remained strong among small and medium-sized companies  with sales activity from the partner network rising sharply. Over the year as a whole  the pace of contract acquisitions remained brisk  with a total of 382 new active contracts (up 20%)  nearly 70% of which were acquired in the second half. At December 31  2022  the Group had a portfolio of nearly 2 300 active contracts. Conversely  key accounts remained cautious and were hampered by a shortage of labor  which slowed the deployment of their cybersecurity projects.Business growth by region:France saw a significant rebound in activity in the second half (+19.3% vs. +11.9% in the first half). Full-year turnover was up 14.7% to ‚Ç¨16.0 million. Business remained brisk  particularly in the most sensitive sectors such as healthcare and industry.The Russia-Ukraine conflict weighed on business in the Europe  Middle East  Africa (EMEA) segment excluding France  down 2.2% to ‚Ç¨8.3 million. Adjusted for the impact of Russia  growth accelerated significantly in the second half  with turnover up almost 27% (vs 3.5% growth in the first half)  representing a full-year increase of 12%. This growth is all the more significant as this region is undergoing a significant transition to a subscription model  which is mechanically impacting short-term turnover recognized in the accounts in return for increased recurring business.In the USA and Rest of World region  turnover rose 18.7% to ‚Ç¨0.9 million. Growth in the United States was below the estimated potential due to the delayed hiring of certain employees. The team is now in place to continue the development of the distribution network and support partners in order to optimize business activity.Continued growth in recurring businessUnaudited data  ‚Ç¨000 2021 2022 Change Licenses[1] 10 467 9 751 -6.8% Maintenance & Subscriptions[2] 11 147 13 790 +23.7% Professional services 1 554 1 638 +5.4% Consolidated turnover 23 169 25 179 +8.7% Annual recurring revenue (ARR) 12 180 14 820 +21.7% % of consolidated turnover 52.6% 58.9% +6.3 ppIn 2022  turnover from subscription contracts (licenses and managed services) was up 46% to ‚Ç¨2.8 million. Meanwhile  license sales were down 7%  impacted by key accounts' reluctance to invest but also by the successful transition of SMEs to the subscription model.As at 31 December 2022  monthly recurring revenue (MRR) totaled ‚Ç¨1.2 million  up 21.7% compared to 31 December 2021  representing ‚Ç¨14.8 million in recurring revenue on an annual basis. Hence  WALLIX begins 2023 with recurring revenue accounted for 58.9% of 2022 consolidated turnover. It compares to 52.6% a year before  an Increase of 6.3 percentage points in one year.2023 roadmap: leverage existing assetsWALLIX has succeeded in positioning itself as a world leader in Privileged Access Management (PAM) in just a few years. After being named a PAM leader by reputed consulting firms KuppingerCole and Frost & Sullivan  2022 marked the Group's entry into the PAM Leader category of the Gartner Magic Quadrant ranking compiled by one of the world's most prestigious consulting firms. 2022 was also the first year of the Unicorn 25 strategic plan  during which the necessary investments were made for its successful execution. WALLIX enhanced its offering with the launch of the WALLIX PAM4ALL and OT.security solutions and ramped up its commercial development  in particular via the new operations in the United States.With these building bricks now in place  the 2023 roadmap aims to optimize existing assets and achieve critical mass in strategic countries  while continuing to enhance solutions and innovate.WALLIX will therefore continue to consolidate its European leadership focusing on SMEs  ""critical"" sectors and industrial environments. This consolidation will be achieved by leveraging its network of over 300 partners  providing them with increased support to maximize sales of flagship product WALLIX PAM4ALL and offering them the opportunity to enhance their industrial cybersecurity expertise. WALLIX also aims to assume a key role in implementing the NIS 2 directive due to come into force in 2024. The new directive will act as a strong growth driver  as it will require 150 000 businesses and public administrations to strengthen their cybersecurity  i.e. ten times the number of organizations covered by the NIS directive in effect since 2018. WALLIX's expertise in key business verticals (healthcare and industry in particular) is a powerful asset that will allow the Group to take full advantage of the expected boom in the European cybersecurity market.In North America  the Group is now ready to return to significant growth by optimizing the performance of its partner network. By the end of 2023  the North America operation should reach critical mass and represent 10% of order intake  compared to 3% in 2022.Innovation and an enhanced offering also form an integral part of the Group's 2023 roadmap. Priority will be given to expanding the SaaS offering centered on PAM4ALL to meet market needs and attract new clients  as well as improving existing SaaS versions in order to maximize client value.Meanwhile  WALLIX will step up its development in the industrial cybersecurity market. With the increasing digitization of industrial environments involving increasingly connected and open industrial systems  the number of industrial cyberattacks has exploded  leading to major incidents such as production stoppages resulting in significant costs. The security of OT systems is therefore a critical issue  yet it lags behind information system security. With its OT.security offering launched in the second half of 2022  WALLIX is one of the few players to have developed solutions specifically dedicated to the OT environment. In 2023  the Group will work on enhancing its solutions by integrating complementary expertise  either through innovation or acquisitions. The development of the business will leverage the strength of the existing network by increasing partners' expertise in OT and by developing partnerships with distributors  resellers and integrators specializing in OT. Solutions dedicated to industrial cybersecurity are expected to account for 10% of total order intake in 2023  compared to 5% in 2022.Next publication: Full-year 2022 results  March 23  2023ABOUT WALLIXWALLIX is the European specialist in access and digital identity security and the world leader in PAM (Privileged Access Management).

London Stock Exchange Group ,"By Huw JonesLONDON (Reuters) - Euronext will not mimic rivals by shifting critical services to outside cloud computers given regulatory concerns  the pan-European exchange's chief executive Stephane Boujnah said.London Stock Exchange Group  CME and Nasdaq have all announced partnerships with cloud computing giants like Alphabet  Amazon and Microsoft  with Deutsche Boerse joining them on Thursday in a ""strategic partnership"" with Google.""One of the reasons why we are cautious about the use of data centres of Microsoft  Google and Amazon for critical parts of what we do is because our core supervisors and regulators are themselves very cautious "" Boujnah told Reuters on Thursday.Euronext only uses a cloud provider for storing historical data  he said.""When it comes to strategic applications such as real-time data and operations of the market  we do not want them to be stored and operated by the data centres of companies which have decision-making centres outside the EU  and physical infrastructure outside the EU "" Boujnah added.Euronext said earlier on Thursday it has postponed until further notice a weekly report on positions held in its commodity derivatives  as disruption from a ransomware attack on financial data firm ION Group outside the bloc continued.""We analyse very carefully the dependency on certain providers "" Boujnah said as Euronext reported full year earnings.Earlier this week  the Bank for International Settlements said a ""rethink"" is needed on regulating how finance is becoming increasingly dependent on outside parties like cloud firms  which new EU rules will address.Euronext reported record full-year 2022 revenue and income of 1.418 billion euros ($1.52 billion)  up 9.3% on 2021 due to consolidating its acquisition of Borsa Italiana.Adjusted earnings per share in 2022 was down 4.8% at 5.21 euros due to higher share count  and the company proposes to pay a dividend of 2.22 euros per share.Story continuesEuronext said it has increased its 2024 annual pre-tax savings related to integrating Borsa Italiana by 15 million euros to 115 million  with around 70 million of this achieved by the end of 2023 as implementation costs remain unchanged.The savings are nearly double what was promised at the deal's outset.""This further demonstrates Euronext's successful track record in integrating acquired companies "" Boujnah said.($1 = 0.9307 euros)(Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Alexander Smith)",neutral,0.03,0.81,0.17,mixed,0.38,0.13,0.49,True,English,"['cloud computing deal', 'Euronext', 'plans', 'rivals', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'record full-year 2022 revenue', 'successful track record', 'cloud computing giants', 'financial data firm', 'full year earnings', '2024 annual pre-tax savings', 'new EU rules', 'higher share count', 'pan-European exchange', 'cloud computers', 'cloud provider', 'cloud firms', 'data centres', 'historical data', 'real-time data', 'Huw Jones', 'critical services', 'regulatory concerns', 'chief executive', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'strategic partnership', 'critical parts', 'core supervisors', 'strategic applications', 'decision-making centres', 'physical infrastructure', 'weekly report', 'commodity derivatives', 'ransomware attack', 'International Settlements', 'Borsa Italiana', 'implementation costs', 'Alexander Smith', 'outside parties', '1.418 billion euros', '15 million euros', 'Stephane Boujnah', '5.21 euros', '2.22 euros', '0.9307 euros', 'Reuters', 'Euronext', 'rivals', 'CME', 'Nasdaq', 'partnerships', 'Alphabet', 'Amazon', 'Microsoft', 'Thursday', 'Google', 'reasons', 'use', 'regulators', 'operations', 'market', 'companies', 'positions', 'disruption', 'bloc', 'dependency', 'providers', 'Bank', 'rethink', 'finance', 'income', 'acquisition', 'company', 'Story', 'deal', 'outset', 'Editing']",2023-02-09,2023-02-09,finance.yahoo.com
