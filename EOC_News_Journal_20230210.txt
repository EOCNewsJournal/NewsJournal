The slight increase in costs only results from costs related to non-volume related revenue growth initiatives. Savings and synergies entirely compensate inflation and business development costs.Status update on synergies in relation to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition : ‚Ç¨ 34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies were achieved at the end of Q4 2022  thanks to restructuring efforts and the migration of the Core Data Centre. ‚Ç¨9.7 million run-rate annual synergies were delivered in Q4 2022. ‚Ç¨44.2 million of cumulated implementation costs incurred at the end of Q4 2022  of which ‚Ç¨6.3 million during Q4 2022.Next steps in the deployment of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan : Euronext upgrades its 2024 annual run - rate pre - tax synergies related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group by ‚Ç¨ 15 millon to ‚Ç¨ 115 million . Implementation costs remain unchanged. Euronext confirmed the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets onto Optiq ¬Æ in March 2023  forming the first phase of the migration  and of Borsa Italiana other markets in Q4 2023 allowing for termination of the third-party provider trading platform contract. Euronext confirmed the phases in the expansion of Euronext Clearing with the expected launch of the equity clearing offering by the end of 2023 and of derivative clearing by Q3 2024. These strategic projects are expected to reach around ‚Ç¨ 7 0 million of cumulated run-rate synergies by the end of 2023  out of the ‚Ç¨115 million targeted. In 2023  Euronext expects to maintain for cash trading an average market share greater or equal to 63%   and revenue capture a round 0.5 2 bps following the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq ¬Æ   considering current market conditions and orders size.Key achievement in the deployment of the ‚Äò Fit for 1.5 ¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy in 2022 : Euronext‚Äôs upgraded SBTi-aligned climate targets were validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative: By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based greenhouse gas emissions by 73.5% compared to 2020; By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 3 business travel emissions by at least 46.2% compared to 2019; By 2027  Euronext suppliers  representing 72% of Euronext‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions derived from purchased goods and services  must set targets on their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.The Group‚Äôs efforts to enhance diversity were recognised through the inclusion of Euronext into the Euronext Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Euronext Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices.St√©phane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:‚ÄúIn 2022  Euronext reached record revenue and income above ‚Ç¨1.4 billion notably resulting from the strong performance of our non-volume related activities  together with efficient management of revenue capture and of cash trading market share. Thanks to our trademark cost discipline  we beat our 2022 revised costs guidance. We achieved an adjusted EBITDA of ‚Ç¨861.6 million that translated into an adjusted EPS of ‚Ç¨5.21. We will propose a total dividend of ‚Ç¨236.6 million at our next annual general meeting to be held in May 2023  representing 50% of our reported net income  excluding NTI loss impact.This year has been crucial in laying the foundations for the future growth of the Group. We have successfully completed the first major milestone of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan with the migration of our Core Data Centre from the UK to Italy. At the end of 2022  we have achieved ‚Ç¨34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies related to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.This fruitful year paves the way for the next steps to be delivered in 2023. The largest single liquidity pool in Europe  operated by Euronext will significantly change dimension with the migration of Italian cash markets to Euronext‚Äôs state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq¬Æ  which will benefit local and global trading members.Euronext Clearing will become the Euronext equity clearing house of choice by the end of 2023  and the CCP for derivatives clearing in Q3 2024. These are the critical bricks to complete our presence across the integrated value chain  allowing us to innovate and shape capital markets in line with evolving client needs  and making Euronext even stronger to deliver future growth.In an inflationary environment  we will contain our costs to a slight increase in 2023  at ‚Ç¨630 million  demonstrating Euronext‚Äôs ability to maintain its cost discipline while investing to generate revenue expansion of our non-volume related activities. We expect to deliver by the end of 2023 around ‚Ç¨70 million of the synergies targeted as part of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan. Our good progress on integration led us to upgrade the total amount of targeted run-rate EBITDA synergies by the end of 2024 from ‚Ç¨100 million to ‚Ç¨115 million. This further demonstrates Euronext‚Äôs successful track record in integrating acquired companies.Our strong performance  combined with the successful ongoing delivery of the planned synergies  is supporting our deleveraging trajectory with a net debt to EBITDA ratio at 2.6x  well below 3.2x at the time of closing of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition. This leaves the Group with flexibility to further deploy capital in value generating opportunities that might arise.Lastly  we are happy to see that our ‚ÄòFit for 1.5¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy is bearing fruit  as our upgraded emission reduction targets have been validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative. We are pleased to see Euronext being included in both the Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices  demonstrating the progress we are making in striving towards more equality.‚ÄùEuronext Q4 and full year 2022 financial performanceFull year 20226In ‚Ç¨m  unless stated otherwiseThe figures in this document have not been audited or reviewed by our external auditor.

The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage by non-volume related underlying revenue ratio was at 141% in 2022  almost stable vs. 2021 (142%).2022 adjusted EBITDAUnderlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased to ‚Ç¨606.1 million  up +14.9%  reflecting the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group costs and continued cost discipline in an inflationary environment. Underlying expenses excluding D&A (‚Ç¨606.1 million) were better than 2022 guidance of ‚Ç¨612 million underlying costs excluding D&A (‚Ç¨622 million initially) thanks to strong cost discipline  project costs being capitalised and one-off positive impacts  including release of accruals and lower-than-anticipated travel and marketing expenses due to the Covid-19 pandemic.On a like-for-like basis  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased slightly by +2.7% compared to 2021  which was positively impacted by the decrease of travel and marketing expenses during the pandemic  highlighting Euronext‚Äôs ability to contain inflation in 2022. On a pro forma basis for the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group on 29 April 2021  underlying operational expenses increased slightly by +2.0%  mainly due to the return of travel and marketing expenses in 2022.Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled ‚Ç¨861.6 million and saw double digit growth  +11.7% compared to 2021.

These items can include: integration or double run costs of significant projects  restructuring costs and costs related to acquisitions that change the perimeter of the Group; one-off finance costs  gains or losses on sale of subsidiaries and impairments of investments: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets which are recognised as a result of acquisitions and mostly comprising customer relationships  brand names and software that were identified during purchase price allocation (PPA); tax related to non-underlying items.Adjusted operating profit as the operating profit adjusted for any non-underlying revenue and income and non-underlying costs  including PPA of acquired businesses;EBITDA as the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;Adjusted EBITDA as the adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation adjusted for any non-underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA  divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted net income  as the net income  share of the parent company shareholders  adjusted for any non-underlying items and related tax impact.Non-IFRS financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable IFRS measures and should be read only in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements.Non-volume related revenue definitionNon-volume related revenue includes Listing excl.

In its amended form  said article would read in its entirety as follows:‚Äú10 ¬ß The General Meeting of the Shareholders shall be held either in Espoo or in Helsinki  as decided by the Board of Directors. In addition  the Board of Directors may decide that the General Meeting of the Shareholders be held without a meeting venue so that the shareholders exercise their power of decision in full in real time during the meeting using a telecommunications connection and technical means (remote meeting).The Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders  which shall be held annually by the end of May on a date decided by the Board of Directors shall:be presented with:1) the Financial Statements  including the Consolidated Financial Statements  and the Report by the Board of Directors 2) the Auditor's Report decide on:3) the adoption of the Financial Statements and the Consolidated Financial Statements4) the use of the profits available for shareholders according to the Balance Sheet 5) discharge from liability of the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO 6) the number of the members of the Board of Directors 7) the fees payable to the members of the Board of Directors and the auditor elect:8) the members of the Board of Directors so that  in accordance with the decision by the General Meeting of the Shareholders  the person or persons getting most of the votes shall be elected 9) from among the members of the Board of Directors  the Chairman of the Board 10) the auditor  as well as tohandle:11) other issues mentioned separately in the notice to convene.‚ÄùThe proposal is based on the changes to Chapter 5 of the Finnish Companies Act  including the possibility to arrange general meetings remotely.

The Board of Directors proposes that the authorization entitles the Board to deviate from the shareholders' proportional shareholdings (directed acquisition). Own shares can be acquired at a price formed in public trading on the date of the acquisition or at a price otherwise formed on the market. The shares may be used to carry out acquisitions or other arrangements pertaining to the company's business operations  to develop the capital structure of the company  as part of the incentive plans  or to be otherwise invalidated or conveyed. In connection with the share repurchase ordinary derivative  stock lending  and other agreements may be made in the market in accordance with the laws and regulations.

This authorization shall replace all earlier authorizations of the Board of Directors pertaining to the acquisition of own shares. 17. Authorization to decide on share issue as well as to grant option rights and other special rights entitling to sharesThe Board of Directors proposes the General Meeting to authorize the Board to decide on issuance of a maximum of 3 600 000 shares and granting of a maximum of 3 600 000 of the company's own shares in one or several parts (the company currently has a total of 37 388 225 shares). The shares could be issued either against a payment or without payment on the basis of conditions set by the Board of Directors and  for the part of an issue against payment  at the price defined by the Board of Directors. The authorization also gives the Board of Directors the right to grant option rights and special rights-as defined in Chapter 10  Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act-which entitle  against payment  to new shares or company shares in the company's possession. A right may also be given to a creditor in such manner that the right includes a condition that the creditor's receivable is used to set off the subscription price (convertible loan). The subscription price of the new shares and the amount paid for the company's own shares will be added to the fund for invested unrestricted equity. The Board of Directors proposes that the authorization entitles the Board to deviate from the pre-emptive subscription rights of the existing shareholders  provided that the company has an weighty financial reason to do so  as regards the issue against payment  and that there is an especially weighty financial reason for the company and the good of the shareholders to do so  as regards the free issue. Within the limits set above  the authorization could be used  for example  to develop the capital structure  to widen the ownership base  in making a payment for an acquisition  when the company buys property related to its business operations  or incentive or reward program for employees and management at Innofactor group. New issue or transfer of own shares could also be used as a contribution in kind or when using the set-off right. In addition  the Board of Directors proposes that the authorization include also the right to decide on a share issue without payment to the company itself in such a manner that  after the issue  the number of shares in the company's possession is at the maximum one tenth of the total number of shares in the company. This number includes the shares in the possession of the company and its subsidiaries as defined in Chapter 15  Section 11  subsection 1 of the Finnish Companies Act. The Board of Directors will decide on all other matters related to the authorization. This authorization would be valid until June 30  2024. This authorization shall replace all earlier authorizations of the Board of Directors related to issuance of shares and granting of the company's own shares. 18. Closing the meeting B.

Net sales decreased by 6.0%. Net sales growth excluding the renewable energy sources business was 2.9%.Adjusted operating profit for the final quarter was EUR 9.6 million (10.1) and operating profit was EUR 12.9 million (9.9). The Group's operating profit was increased by a gain of EUR 4.3 million recognised on the sale of the share of renewable energy sources business to a newly established joint venture.L&T‚Äôs circular economy businesses  namely Environmental Services and Industrial Services  achieved a strong operating result in 2022. In Industrial Services  net sales increased by 25.6 per cent.In Facility Services in Finland and Sweden  the higher general cost level had a negative effect on profitability. Both divisions launched programmes during the review period to simplify and increase the efficiency of their operating models. These programmes will continue in 2023.Net sales for 2022 amounted to EUR 844.1 million (812.5). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 40.9 million (42.4) and operating profit was EUR 42.9 million (42.2). Earnings per share were EUR 0.83 (0.90).Net cash flow from operating activities after investments per share was EUR 1.08 (0.05).The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of EUR 0.47 per share.Outlook for the year 2023Net sales and adjusted operating profit in 2023 are estimated to be at the same level as in the previous year even though the comparison period includes net sales from the renewable energy sources business in the amount of EUR 35.4 million.PRESIDENT AND CEO EERO HAUTANIEMI:‚ÄúThe year 2022 was exceptional and the business environment changed significantly. The economic uncertainty caused by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine  the sharp rise in costs and interest rates and the significantly higher-than-usual level of sickness-related absences affected all of the company‚Äôs divisions.Story continuesThe development of net sales was positive in 2022  but adjusted operating profit declined slightly due to the weak result of Facility Services Finland and Sweden. Net cash flow from operating activities was strong  as was the company‚Äôs financial position.L&T‚Äôs circular economy businesses  namely Environmental Services and Industrial Services  achieved a good operative result in 2022.In Environmental Services  net sales growth excluding the renewable energy sources business came to 8.1 per cent. The number of corporate customers and producer responsibility organisation customers grew. The division‚Äôs environmental responsibility management and consulting capabilities and organisation were strengthened.In Industrial Services  net sales increased by 25.6 per cent  of which 6.6 per cent was organic growth. Industrial Services expanded its operations into the Swedish market and strengthened its market position in hazardous waste in Finland through an acquisition. In the environmental construction business  a number of demanding contaminated soil restoration projects were carried out for industrial customers.In Facility Services in Finland and Sweden  profitability was weighed down by the higher general cost level  worsening labour shortages  high employee turnover and sickness-related absences being significantly higher than average. The profit performance of Facility Services Sweden was weighed down not only by inflation but also the weaker-than-expected sales of additional services. Both divisions launched programmes during the review period to simplify and increase the efficiency of their operating models. These programmes will continue in 2023.L&T‚Äôs businesses are not particularly sensitive to economic cycles. Nevertheless  inflation and rising interest rates create uncertainty in the operating environment.In 2024  the Environmental Services division will focus particularly on corporate customers and producer responsibility organisations as the progress of municipalisation reduces the significance of households as customers.The Industrial Services division will continue to invest in the development of new hazardous waste recycling solutions and process cleaning methods in both Finland and Sweden.Facility Services Finland and Sweden will continue to focus on improving operational efficiency and profitability. Particularly in Finland  unprofitable customer agreements will be terminated and the scope of operations will be reassessed. In Sweden  the focus will be on simplifying the operating model.‚ÄùGROUP NET SALES AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEOctober‚ÄìDecemberLassila & Tikanoja‚Äôs net sales for the fourth quarter amounted to EUR 210.1 million (223.5)  a decrease of 6.0% year-on-year.

The Group's operating profit was increased by a gain of EUR 4.3 million recognised on the sale of the share of renewable energy sources business to a newly established joint venture.Year 2022Net sales for 2022 totalled EUR 844.1 million (812.5)  an increase of 3.9% year-on-year. Net sales growth excluding the effect of the renewable energy sources business was 7.0%. Organic growth was 3.7%. Adjusted operating profit was EUR 40.9 million (42.4)  representing 4.8% (5.2%) of net sales. Operating profit was EUR 42.9 million (42.2)  representing 5.1% (5.2%) of net sales.

Operating profit improved in Environmental Services and Industrial Services  and declined in Facility Services in Finland and Sweden.The Group‚Äôs adjusted operating profit was negatively affected by increased fuel prices and the higher general cost level. The sickness rate was exceptionally high during the review period  which had a negative impact particularly on the labour-intensive facility services business. The Group's operating profit was increased by a gain of EUR 4.3 million recognised on the sale of the share of renewable energy sources business to a newly established joint venture.Net financial expenses rose to EUR -5.8 million (-3.3) and the effective tax rate increased to 16.7 per cent (11.8 per cent).Financial summary10‚Äì12/2022 10‚Äì12/2021 Change % 1‚Äì12/2022 1‚Äì12/2021 Change % Net sales  EUR million 210.1 223.5 -6.0 844.1 812.5 3.9 Adjusted operating profit  EUR million 9.6 10.1 -5.1 40.9 42.4 -3.5 Adjusted operating margin  % 4.6 4.5 4.8 5.2 Operating profit  EUR million 12.9 9.9 30.2 42.9 42.2 1.7 Operating margin  % 6.2 4.4 5.1 5.2 EBITDA  EUR million 26.5 23.2 14.2 98.3 95.1 3.3 EBITDA  % 12.6 10.4 11.6 11.7 Profit before tax  EUR million 12.2 9.1 33.8 37.8 39.0 -3.0 Earnings per share  EUR 0.29 0.26 11.1 0.83 0.90 -8.3 Net cash flow from operating activitiesafter investments per share  EUR 1.05 0.55 92.8 1.08 0.05 2 279.1 Return on equity (ROE)  % 14.6 17.1 Capital employed  EUR million 437.2 406.0 7.7 Return on capital employed (ROCE)  % 10.4 10.8 Equity ratio  % 34.3 34.2 Gearing  % 75.9 79.4NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT BY DIVISIONEnvironmental ServicesOctober‚ÄìDecemberThe division‚Äôs net sales for the fourth quarter decreased to EUR 71.1 million (89.9). Operating profit declined to EUR 6.2 million (7.1). Excluding the renewable energy sources business  the net sales of the Environmental Services division amounted to EUR 71.1 million (71.2) and operating profit was EUR 6.2 million (6.6).Year 2022The full-year net sales of the Environmental Services division grew to EUR 321.2 million (320.5). Operating profit was EUR 30.3 million (29.8). Excluding the renewable energy sources business  the net sales of the Environmental Services division amounted to EUR 287.1 million (265.5) and operating profit was EUR 30.0 million (28.9).In Environmental Services  growth was derived particularly from corporate customers and producer responsibility organisations. The producer responsibility organisation Suomen Pakkaustuottajat Oy chose L&T as its recycling partner for consumer plastic packaging in December. The agreement covers approximately 20 000 tonnes of consumer packaging plastic waste  which corresponds to approximately half of the packaging plastic waste collected in Finland each year. From the beginning of 2023  L&T will be responsible for the intermediate storage of plastic packaging waste as well as its collection and transport to Quantafuel ASA‚Äôs mechanical and chemical recycling plants in Denmark.During the period under review  the organisational structure and operating model were reformed by assigning more commercial responsibility to the local organisation. Environmental responsibility management and consulting organisation grew  and its competencies were expanded.The ERP system and related information system renewal programme continued in the division and progressed to the implementation stage. The system is scheduled to enter the deployment stage in the first half of 2024. The total investment in the system projects under the programme is estimated at approximately EUR 16.9 million  of which approximately EUR 6.2 million were realised by the end of 2022  with expenses of EUR 1.3 million recognised in 2022.Due to the reform of the Waste Act in 2021  direct customer agreements with housing properties were transferred to municipal operators during the period under review  but the impact of these changes on net sales was compensated for by growth in the corporate customer segment.The prices of recycled raw materials increased in the first half of the year. The prices of recycled raw materials subsequently stabilised and  in the case of certain fractions  began to decrease in the latter half of the year. The market prices of recycled cardboard and paperboard falling to less than half of the level seen in the early part of the year was particularly reflected in the net sales of the Environmental Services division. The reduced level of activity in the construction industry was also reflected in declining volumes towards the end of the year.Fuel prices rose sharply at the end of February due to the war in Ukraine. The higher fuel costs were successfully passed on to customer prices through cost increases carried out in February‚ÄìApril.The merger of the Environmental Services division‚Äôs renewable energy sources business with Neova Oy‚Äôs corresponding business was approved by the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority  and the joint venture Laania Oy became operational on 1 July 2022. In the first half of the year  the net sales of the renewable energy sources business amounted to EUR 35.4 million  and the operating profit was EUR 0.3 million. In the financial year 2021  the net sales of the renewable energy sources business totalled EUR 56.9 million  and the operating profit was EUR 0.9 million. The business is no longer reported as part of the Environmental Services division after the second quarter of 2022. The net profit of the joint venture is consolidated in one line item under operating profit.Industrial ServicesOctober‚ÄìDecemberThe division‚Äôs net sales for the final quarter grew to EUR 36.3 million (28.7). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 3.1 million (1.7). Operating profit was EUR 2.3 million (1.7). Operating profit was reduced by a change of EUR 0.8 million in the fair value of the deferred consideration related to the acquisition of Sand & Vattenbl√§st i Tyringe AB (‚ÄúSVB‚Äù) recognised in the final quarter of 2022  due to the positive development of the acquired company‚Äôs business.Year 2022The full-year net sales of the Industrial Services division grew to EUR 132.0 million (105.1). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 13.6 million (9.2). Operating profit was EUR 12.7 million (9.2). Operating profit was reduced by a change of EUR 0.8 million in the fair value of the deferred consideration related to the acquisition of Sand & Vattenbl√§st i Tyringe AB (‚ÄúSVB‚Äù) recognised in the final quarter of 2022  due to the positive development of the acquired company‚Äôs business.The Industrial Services division strengthened its position in hazardous and non-hazardous waste recycling services during the period under review by acquiring Fortum‚Äôs hazardous waste SME business in Finland at the beginning of February 2022. The takeover of the business acquired from Fortum went according to plan  and the demand for hazardous waste services was strong.In the environmental construction business line  several demanding industrial soil decontamination projects were carried out. At the beginning of the year  a new material treatment center started its operations in Pori  Finland. The plant focuses particularly on processing industrial side streams.In February  Industrial Services expanded into the Swedish process cleaning services market by acquiring 70% of the shares of Sand & Vattenbl√§st i Tyringe AB (‚ÄúSVB‚Äù)  a provider of process cleaning services in Sweden. Operating in southern Sweden  SVB had net sales of approximately EUR 10 million in the previous financial year and has approximately 60 employees. The integration of the Swedish business progressed according to plan  and several successful industrial water treatment projects were carried out in the process cleaning business in Sweden. In the process cleaning business in Finland  resource allocation for annual maintenance services was successful in spite of maintenance services originally scheduled for the early part of the year being postponed to the autumn due to the COVID-19 pandemic and labour action.Fuel prices rose sharply at the end of February due to the war in Ukraine. The higher fuel costs were  for the most part  passed on to customer prices through cost increases carried out in February‚ÄìApril.Facility Services FinlandOctober‚ÄìDecemberThe division‚Äôs net sales for the final quarter grew to EUR 64.6 million (63.0). Operating profit was EUR 0.8 million (0.6).Year 2022The full-year net sales of Facility Services Finland grew to EUR 256.3 million (243.1). Operating profit declined to EUR -0.5 million (1.8).Several significant new customer accounts were acquired and started in the cleaning business  and the demand for data-driven cleaning services increased. The demand for energy efficiency services increased during the review period.The COVID-19 pandemic and other respiratory infections significantly increased sickness-related absences in the first and fourth quarters  which increased production costs in all service branches  especially in cleaning. Production costs were increased by higher fuel prices and general cost inflation. The increased production costs could not be fully passed on to customer prices.In the cleaning business  the availability of labour declined and employee turnover increased significantly  which drove costs higher. Several new projects were launched to improve the availability of labour. Co-operation with municipal employment services and government organisations was intensified to ensure that jobs offered by L&T are better known by job seekers. L&T joined forces with Staffpoint to offer jobs to Ukrainian refugees. A group of workers from the Philippines was recruited for full-time cleaning work under contracts valid until further notice. The employees in question will start work in the first quarter of 2023.Measures were taken in Facility Services Finland to improve operational efficiency and profitability throughout the period under review. Local and business line-specific change negotiations were conducted in the division in the second half of the year  leading to the termination of employment for approximately 70 white-collar employees and approximately 30 employees.Facility Services SwedenOctober‚ÄìDecemberThe division‚Äôs net sales for the final quarter decreased to EUR 39.8 million (43.8). Operating profit declined to EUR 0.5 million (1.3). Operating profit before the amortisation of purchase price allocations of acquisitions was EUR 0.8 million (1.9).Year 2022Facility Services Sweden‚Äôs full-year net sales decreased to EUR 140.4 million (149.8). Operating profit declined to EUR 0.4 million (3.9). Operating profit before the amortisation of purchase price allocations of acquisitions was EUR 2.2 million (6.0).Production costs were increased by higher fuel prices and general cost inflation from February onwards. The COVID-19 pandemic increased sickness-related absences  particularly in the first quarter. Customer agreements in the Swedish business are mostly fixed-price contracts  and the increased production costs could not be passed on to customers in the form of price increases. The profit performance of Facility Services Sweden was lowered not only by inflation but also the weaker-than-expected sales of additional services. Adaptation measures were initiated in the division in the second quarter. The effort to simplify operating models and adapt them to the rapidly changing business environment will continue in 2023.FINANCINGIn 2022  cash flow from operating activities amounted to EUR 71.8 million (65.6). Net cash flow after investments came to EUR 41.1 million (1.7). Net cash flow from operating activities after investments was reduced by acquisitions  which had a total impact of approximately EUR 13 million (approximately EUR 23 million). Net cash flow after investments was increased by the repayment of a loan receivable of EUR 16.4 million by the joint venture in the final quarter of 2022. A total of EUR 6.2 million in working capital was committed (EUR 15.1 million committed).At the end of the financial year  interest-bearing liabilities amounted to EUR 216.8 million (195.6). Net interest-bearing liabilities totalled EUR 167.3 million (167.1). The average interest rate of long-term loans  excluding lease liabilities  with interest rate hedging  was 2.5% (1.1%). Of the company‚Äôs floating rate loans totalling EUR 50 million  EUR 30 million have been converted into fixed rate loans by means of an interest rate swap.The EUR 100.0 million commercial paper programme was unused at the end of the financial year as in the comparison period. The account limit totalling EUR 10.0 million as well as the committed credit limit totalling EUR 40.0 million were not in use  as was the case in the comparison period. The Group signed a credit limit linked to responsibility targets in May 2022. The credit limit will mature in the first quarter of 2025.

The new notes will mature in the second quarter of 2028 and bear fixed annual interest at the rate of 3.375 per cent.Net financial expenses amounted to EUR -5.8 million (-3.3).

L&T‚Äôs carbon handprint reduces the customer‚Äôs carbon footprint. Our services generated emission reductions for customers through  for example  customers replacing virgin raw materials with secondary raw materials  and fossil fuels with biofuels and solid recovered fuels.The carbon handprint of the renewable energy sources business is no longer reported as part of L&T‚Äôs carbon handprint in 2022. In 2021  L&T‚Äôs total carbon handprint excluding renewable energy sources was 528 000 tCO 2 e.Recycling rate and material recovery2022 2021 Target Target to be achieved by Recycling rate of material flows managed by L&T  % 59.4 58.4 65 2026The recycling rate is the weighted average of our customers‚Äô recycling rates. It also includes materials that cannot yet be recycled. To increase our reuse and recycling rate  we actively look for new material streams whose refining rate we can increase. Reporting covers municipal waste collected from corporate customers  hazardous waste  industrial waste and construction waste in Finland. Slurry  contaminated soil and ash are excluded from reporting.Progress towards science-based emission reduction targets  using 2018 as the baseline2022 2021 Target Target to be achieved by Carbon footprint (tCO 2 e)31 70037 800Carbon footprint intensity (gCO 2 e/km)6467674762030L&T‚Äôs strategic objective is to halve the carbon footprint of its operations by 2030  using 2018 as the baseline  and to reduce the indirect emissions generated by its supply chain. The emission reduction target set by L&T has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. The achievement of this objective will be promoted by switching to zero-emission transport technologies and fuels and by opting for renewable energy at L&T‚Äôs properties. Transport operations account for 95 per cent of the emissions generated by L&T‚Äôs own operations.The fuel distribution obligation was adjusted in 2022 by reducing the biofuel component by 7.5 per cent in July. This change has not been taken into account in the emissions calculations reported in the financial statements release  as Statistics Finland has yet to update its fuel classification data in accordance with the change. Statistics Finland is expected to publish updated fuel classification data during spring 2023. L&T will subsequently calculate and report its carbon dioxide emissions for 2022 on its website using the updated emission factors. The total emissions of L&T‚Äôs own operations for 2022  calculated with the updated emission factors  are likely to be higher than those reported here.Social responsibilityOverall accident frequency2022 2021 Target Target to be achieved byOverall accident frequency (TRIF)2324192026L&T eliminates hazards and improves its own safety as well as the safety of customers and other stakeholders through effective proactive measures  such as risk assessments  safety observations  Safety Walks and occupational safety sessions.Well-being at work2022 2021 Target Target to be achieved by Occupational health rate (proportion of employees with no sickness-related absences)404557 2026Sickness-related absences (%)5.65.04.32026The objective of L&T‚Äôs personnel policies and plans is to ensure that the number  competence and retention of personnel are at the level required for effective performance.

18060,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ARTMARKET-COM-5174/news/Artmarket-com-Artmarket-com-reports-Q4-2022-revenue-growth-and-a-new-business-model-generating-42943974/?utm_medium=RSS&utm_content=20230209,Artmarket.com :  Artmarket.com reports Q4 2022 revenue growth and a new business model generating additional income from affiliate advertisers  potentially doubling Artprice's turnover.,(marketscreener.com)  After posting good revenue figures for 4Q 2022  we are proud to say that Artprice by Artmarket has got off to a dynamic start to 2023 with January's turnover showing a 17% increase versus the year-earlier period.The figures show that ‚Ä¶,"After posting good revenue figures for 4Q 2022  we are proud to say that Artprice by Artmarket has got off to a dynamic start to 2023 with January's turnover showing a 17% increase versus the year-earlier period.The figures show that since the start of 2023  Artmarket.com has been gaining market share with new customers despite the uncertain economic context stemming from very unpredictable geopolitical parameters and an inflationary dynamic that poses significant challenges for central banks  particularly for the ECB and the FED.Artprice took advantage of the Covid period to develop and deploy the most significant modification in its history  leading to a change in its business model with paying advertisers fully integrated into its databases and services. These advertisers are essentially the 6 500 Auction Houses around the world that have been affiliated with Artprice for more than two decades and today conduct 98% of their sales online.It is quite possible that the turnover generated by these 6 500 auction houses will ultimately generate more turnover than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice by Artmarket.com's turnover. By effectively responding to a long-standing request from its partner auction houses  Artprice believes it can double its turnover. A second major change in our business model relates to our decision to license our Standardized Database of Artists  today the most comprehensive in the world.Future events in 2023: annual licensing of Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists  with an entry price of ‚Ç¨7 500 per yearIn recent years  Artprice by Artmarket  which owns the largest known editorial collection of manuscripts and catalogs from 1700 to the present day (a current asset with an estimated value of ‚Ç¨16.257 million in Artprice by Artmarket.com's balance sheet)  has developed the most comprehensive database of artists in the world.At Artprice by Artmarket  we never forget that artists are what the art market revolves around; they are its primary and unique motor  and all the news  exhibitions  auctions  galleries  museums  biennials  fairs  and shows evolve around them. In short  none of it could exist without the artist.Each Artist page is created within the framework of a standardized editorial charter and a set of processes protected under France's Intellectual Property Laws  with a biography supported by certified documents from the artist and/or his/her beneficiaries that are deposited in Artprice's physical archives.Each analog/digital record has 140 referential integrity fields which are themselves relational databases.Each Artist page includes details about their various disciplines and artistic techniques  their past auction results (with photographs of the works)  their upcoming sales  their signatures and monograms  an indication of any catalog raisonn√© and/or reference work  their annual auction turnover  their auction records  the geographical distribution of their sales  their key market indices  their unsold rates  as well as all articles or dispatches from Artprice's press agency ‚ÄúArtMarket Insight‚Äù written about the artist.This allows Artprice to attribute each artist with a dedicated ID (like a business identification code) and for each of his/her works  another specific ID (like a vehicle registration document) and to ‚Äòstandardize' the art market to ensure reliable traceability  accurate indices  and comprehensive monitoring. These unique and rigorous processes are subject to multiple protection mechanisms under France's Intellectual Property Laws.A single Artist Log costs on average 270‚Ç¨ to 300‚Ç¨ to create  and  despite ultra-powerful computing  it requires human validation by a committee of editors and translation into the six languages ??of the Artprice databases  namely English  French  Spanish  German  Italian and Mandarin.In 25 years  the Artprice Artist Database has established itself as the leading standardized global database in terms of the number of artists it covers  but also in terms of the volume of information per Artist entry.To date  the only reference we have retained is the Benezit Dictionary  created in 1911 in Paris and which Artprice tried to acquire from √âditions Gr√ºnd in the early 2000s.At the time  Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists included 120 000 artists while the Benezit had 175 000. The latter was therefore the de facto global reference by its sheer number of artists. Despite a very substantial financial proposal from Artprice  the Benezit was finally sold to Oxford Art Online (see our registration document and financial report).In 2023  the online Benezit  in English  has 170 000 artists and a subscription entry cost of ¬£215 per year.Artprice's standardized artists' database now totals 803 000 artists from the 4th century to the present day  in six languages.The overall cost associated with successfully building the most comprehensive Standardized Database of Artists in the world also includes the cost of acquiring legendary companies and documentary collections such as the Enrique Mayer Guide (1962/1987)  the famous Dictionary of Art Sales by Doctor H. Mireur 1700-1900  the American leader Sound View Press with nearly 50 databases on the USA including the famous biographical collection Who Was Who in American Art (1991)  Editions Franck Van Wilder (1970)  the Swiss company Xylogic (world specialist in Art Market indices since 1985)  the Bayer Database on the Anglo-Saxon Art Market from 1700 to 1913  Signatures and Monogrammes by Caplan & Creps (USA)  a global reference work (1976)  and a whole host of other works and records.Indeed  over the past 25 years  we at Artprice have pursued a systematic policy of purchasing all manuscripts and catalogs  mainly from 1700 to 1970  from all over the world. The acquisition of this historical knowledge was an unavoidable process in ensuring that Artprice could standardize the art market with certainty and know the perfect traceability of works of art and their correct attributions.In the 20th century  the Benezit was the major reference  the Bible of the Art Market according to Le Monde newspaper. To date  it is the only serious financial and analytical referent for Artprice  notably because of its use of a comparative methodology.Nevertheless  the 803 000 artists in Artprice's Standardized Database represent a volume 472% greater than that of the Benezit Oxford University Press Dictionary (170 000 artists)  with access in six languages ??for Artprice compared with just one language for the Benezit.For Artprice  the total present-day cost in 2023 of building the most exhaustive database of artists in the world is 216 million euros (see paragraph on analytical cost). Despite being an asset in permanent growth  under International Financial Reporting Standards  the valuation of such a perennial asset is recognized in Artprice by Artmarket.com balance sheets at only a fraction of its real value (IFRS have been adopted since 2005 to harmonize the presentation of listed companies' financial and accounting statements).Indeed  the creation of the index for Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists was an extremely complex operation involving seven million hours of work by historians  researchers  editors  journalists  econometricians  and a dedicated IT department over 25 years.Now that it exists  Artprice by Artmarket is constantly being asked for licenses to use its Standardized Database of Artists  mainly by the tens of thousands of online galleries  marketplaces  Auction Houses  Experts  online auction sites  copyright companies  customs  and tax authorities  museums foundations and insurance companies that operate in this segment  but without an exhaustive standardized database of artists.Many of these players are prone to making regular attribution errors - as they themselves admit - and for the small or recently established structures  their survival depends on access to a standardized and consistent Database of Artists over the centuries.One of the main difficulties is having  on the one hand  a massive collection of auction catalogs and manuscripts  and on the other hand  proprietary algorithms that can track down and identify the numerous homonyms that exist in the field of art.Indeed  art history is full of homonyms. One of the solutions was to link the name of the artist to his place of birth as well as his connection to an ethnic group or a family or a clan.After a global market study focusing mainly on incoming requests from future clients  we calculated that the entry price for a license to use the index of Artprice's Standardized Database of 803 000 Artists  will be around ‚Ç¨7 500 per year  i.e. a monthly charge of ‚Ç¨625  which makes this operating license very affordable for small or recently-established structures.Of course  this annual operating license ‚Äì limited to the Standardized Index of Artists  does not in any way compete with Artprice or its multiple databases  as is contractually agreed with the licensee. This operating license uses an Application Programming Interface (API) provided by Artprice to connect software (or a website) to Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists.If the licensee notices that its customers request  for example  the price of works for past or future sales  indices and statistics on an artist  monograms and signatures  or any other information held by Artprice's databases  it may ask the Artprice licensor for a return API (re-routing/affiliation contract) to Artprice's paid databases where the licensee receives between 5 and 20% commission depending on the turnover achieved with Artprice on an annual subscription contracted on Artprice by Artmarket payment platforms. This allows Artprice to collect ‚Ç¨7 500/year on the one hand  and on the other hand  to greatly increase its turnover via its many licensees.Future events HI 2023: at the beginning of March Artprice will deploy its most sophisticated version of Artprice.com that will  among other things  initiate a complete change in our business model. Henceforward  our website will integrate paid advertisers into our databases and services and our Artist pages and Web 3.0.At the beginning of March 2023  Artprice by Artmarket will deploy the latest and most sophisticated version of its website in response to the numerous requests from its customers  which reflects the growth and expansion of its digital footprints. After 18 months of development  partly extended by the Covid  this large-scale deployment will affect all of Artprice's databases and services.To develop this latest version of our website  Artprice by Artmarket submitted a call for tenders at the end of 2019 and finally selected a team of very qualified and passionate external consultants to conduct an analysis followed by the development of a complete overhaul of Artprice.com. The whole process was based on a solid ‚Äòuser interface' (UI) and ‚Äòuser experience' approach  which  as their labels suggest  means that our entire website has been redesigned with an acute focus on making it easier for the user.At its core  the new website will include a very substantial change in our business model  since paying advertisers will be fully integrated into our databases and services. These advertisers are mainly the 6 500 auction houses worldwide  affiliated with Artprice for more than two decades and which now conduct 98% of their sales online. They will now  in paying advertiser mode  be able to highlight their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  depending on the search criteria of Artprice's 7.2 million customers.It should be noted that for the past half a century  the economic models of auction houses have always allocated roughly 34% of their overall costs to advertising (usually announcing details of upcoming public sales)  regardless of the country they operate in or the size of the auction house.Since auctions are now 98% advertised online  the pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2023 to promote their sales for a fee has found its best response with this new deployment. Indeed  the auction houses now believe that their communication budgets for future sales (34% of their estimated value) must be focused online  rather than on the printed media.In the past Artprice always considered online advertising to be incompatible with its databases in terms of readability and reputation. We have therefore done everything we can to satisfy demand from the auction houses while maintaining Artprice's original DNA.On the new version of the site  the 6 500 auction houses will be able to merge into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket by advertising their future sales and pushing the ‚Äúfollowed‚Äù artists selected by the 7.2 million Artprice customers and members (alerts by SMS  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  ‚Äúmy artists‚Äù page  etc.).Since 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population to facilitate development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable  and above all contextualized data.Indeed  Artprice by Artmarket's clients and members will intuitively dive into the heart of art market news and will be privileged players within a human and educational approach  which is often lacking in the world of GAFAs.Moreover  Artprice's essential and historic collaborations as World Leader in Art Market Information will become even more apparent in this new version  mainly via contributions from individual artists who have participated in this evolution.The auction houses that have been our historical partners are  of course  the other essential collaboration. Indeed  their interest in collaborating with Artprice can only increase as they highlight their future sales with discreet and effective prestige  which will ‚Äì in turn ‚Äì generate additional recurring income for Artprice via its proprietary Intranet (the primary working tool for auction houses for many years).It is quite possible that the advertising revenue generated by these 6 500 auction houses (affiliated with Artprice since 1997) will ultimately generate more income than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice's turnover. As mentioned earlier  Artprice has a clear ambition to double its turnover and  again  this initiative is a direct result of long-standing requests from our partner auction houses.In sum  after more than two years of R&D (extended by the Covid crisis)  Artprice by Artmarket is proud to be able fully to engage Artmarket.com customers  partners  and members in a new experience at the heart of the art market.This is undoubtedly one of the founding stones for the future of Artprice by Artmarket  with a fundamentally improved positioning via the referencing of images on search engines  the objective of increasing traffic to conquer new market share and to corner the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs.Thanks to Google Analytics 4  the latest generation of Analytics  the ‚ÄúCrawl budget‚Äù  a combination of Google's ‚Äúcrawl rate‚Äù and ‚Äúcrawl demand‚Äù  increased from 915 000 requests/day to a new average of 2.5 million/day since the deployment of Artprice's 803 000 Artist homepages at the end of 2022.Through this deployment  Artprice has not only remained faithful to its principle of maintaining the readability of its databases but has also responded (at last) to the continual requests from its 6 500 affiliated Auction Houses around the world to have access to paid advertisements to enhance their future sales.Since January 2023  a complete UI//UX overhaul of Artists Pages and our Web 3.0/Art NFTs allowed greater global visibility for the 803 000 artists on Artprice by Artmarket.Artmarket.com has implemented a substantial tariff increase for its subscriptions and services since the beginning of 2023. These increases will generate an increase in future income. Artmarket.com was already profitable for a decade  and the additional revenue will translate almost entirely into net income since we will still be below the ‚Ç¨90 million euros p.a. tax bracket.This tariff increase follows extensive consultation with Artprice by Artmarket customers who will continue to benefit from our databases and services  well aware that they find essential data in Artprice that they cannot find elsewhere. Enriched by over a million ultra-qualified new data every year  our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997  must now be properly and systematically monetized.Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most exhaustive in the world and this is recognized by a broad consensus of art market operators. It covers nearly 803 000 artists  all referenced with their biographies  auction results  market indices  decision-making help tools  signatures & monograms  and future sales  alongside historical information and contemporary  cultural  and market news. In total  our databases contain several tens of millions of data inputs and their combination and exploitation by our teams means that the sum of the parts is infinitely more valuable  and the whole system is protected by various intellectual property rights.Despite this substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best value compared to the offer by our competitors who have not managed to evolve and offer subscriptions with limited searches: annual professional subscriptions from the competition for 150 searches ‚Ç¨350/year  or 450 searches ‚Ç¨975/year  and  in the event of an overrun  ‚Ç¨2.45/request (as noted by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In a world of ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competition's offer is based on data of only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 803 000 artists and 6 500 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from ‚Ç¨279 to ‚Ç¨569/year  including a range of indices  decision-making tools  and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world. Indeed  Artprice would still be very competitive at substantially higher prices.Surprisingly ‚Äì given the geopolitical and economic context ‚Äì the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods during recent sales sessions  regardless of the country. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023  which are the main indicators of the art market's health.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100¬© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market. For information  the Artprice100¬© index has increased by 612% since 2000. For the year 2022  the S&P index posted a contraction of -19% versus +3% for the Artprice100¬©.In our upcoming Global Art Market Report  we plan to present a truly global analysis of the art market's activities in 2022. This report is scheduled for publication in early March 2023. It will be available free of charge online and in PDF version. The AFP will publish it first.It is clear that war in Eastern Europe and the fears of a global recession have not depressed the art market at the start of this year.At the end of 2022  the AFP posted an article with the evocative title ‚ÄúThe collection of Microsoft co-founder aims for a billion-dollar auction total in New York‚Äù and added ‚ÄúWith the late Paul G Allen's collection  Christie's is aiming for a historic art auction record  symbol of a market that is surging ahead despite a world shaken by crises.‚ÄùOur new version of Artists Homepages bolsters the primary and preferred entry points to all of Artprice's databases and services because artists are indeed the foundation on which the art market has been based since its origin. With this major overhaul  Artprice also aims to reposition artists at the heart of the art market via the production of Art NFTs  which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.The major overhaul of Artprice.com aims to provide its customers and members with a better experience  more in line with their needs. It has been implemented after several years of collecting and analyzing their needs in strict compliance with the legislation in force in Europe and the USA.The overhaul naturally integrates the arrival of Art NFTs  whose growth is exponential and which also constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's principal market-makers  including the majority of the auction houses around the world  now have NFT departments for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum industry and art galleries sphere are starting to publish their own NFTs.In addition  the major overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com finally highlights the largest proprietary collection of original manuscripts and sales catalogs printed since 1700. Owned and collected by Artprice over the last three decades  this collection acts as the fundamental core of Artprice's digital standardization of the art market and legitimizes its position as Global Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years.After the overhaul of our Artists Homepages  Artprice customers and prospects will have access to several centuries of knowledge organized over 25 years by Artprice's historians and editors. Access to this historical information has been structured in a perfectly intuitive and natural way so that users can immerse themselves in the exceptional and complex history of the art market.These new pages highlight the wealth and depth of Artmarket.com's databases and services  offering a high level of added value. The use of algorithmic AI allows access to highly relevant and personalized recommendations  allowing users to deepen their knowledge of the art market and ultimately generating more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore greater business revenue.This feature also brings Artprice by Artmarket clients and members fully into the Web 3.0 and Art NFTs sphere  giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.Ahead of our major rollout in December 2022  Artprice has listened carefully to both its historical customers and its new customers and prospects.Indeed  with cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. Accustomed to speculation and risk-taking  art enthusiasts and collectors nonetheless  have no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe.Having frequently used the services of Artprice  they have become new clients for Artmarket.com  but they made it clear they needed art prices to be added in both ETH and BTC throughout the entire Artprice databases. This major addition to our platform was completed at the end of 2022.The ultra-targeted digital campaigns on Twitter demonstrate through their returns (3 to 5%) that these new buyers respond with high-end Artprice subscriptions.In addition  Artmarket.com is pleased to have given historical preference to Ethereum which  via an operation baptized ‚ÄúThe Merge‚Äù on 15 September 2022  converted in entire blockchain from a Proof-of-work (PoW) type consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) type mechanism to move to a more environmentally friendly system.According to the Ethereum Foundation  this move was followed by an immediate drop in the total energy consumption of the Ethereum network by 99.9%.Thus  to foster the exchange and sale of Art NFTs on its Marketplace  and given the energy context  Artprice's choice for the Ethereum blockchain is fully in line with the ambitions expressed by France's Minister for the Economy  Bruno Le Maire  as announced in a previous press release:www.actusnews.com/fr/artmarket/cp/2022/10/20/artmarket_com-deja-positionnee-sur-les-nfts-avec-artprice-reagit-a-l_itw-de-bruno-le-maire-donnee-a-bfm-crypto-voulant-faire-deThis week  the French-language weekly business magazine has headlined its February issue (772) with the following title: ‚ÄúWhat if Ethereum had the keys to blockchain success? Experiencing rapid growth  the decentralized cryptocurrency platform presents itself as one of the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù options in the sector. A strategy that is convincing more and more investors and institutions‚Äù.thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com emphasizes: ""In its various annual reports on the Art Market and its regulated information it publishes as a listed company  Artprice by Artmarket.com has always said concerning NFTs that it is impossible to apprehend this new market without a perfect knowledge of the relevant Monetary & Financial Codes and Intellectual Property Codes of the countries in which the market is operating. Similarly  to appreciate the nature of this market (experiencing exponential growth)  one also needs a true understanding of Blockchain  cryptocurrencies  and their cultural origins among the Cypherpunks (period of PGP-type data encryption at the beginning of 1990)‚ÄùThese regulations have been the subject of studies  colloquia  and proposals to major French and European government bodies by Blanche Sousi and the Art & Law Institute  with whom Artprice by Artmarket has been heavily involved as a long-standing member since 1997.2023: more than ever  Artprice's eco-responsible philosophy must set an example in the world of data centers.According to thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice:‚ÄúArtprice by Artmarket.com has patiently and methodically given itself all the means to evolve in response to the needs of Art Market professionals. All the indicators are positive for the future and we project a doubling of revenue  notably by opening up to paying advertisers integrated into our services and databasesWe have also developed  since 2017  processes to optimize the use of our servers  by limiting the power required and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers by 40%. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energiesThrough its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies concerning new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ‚Äúformativity‚Äù (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a ‚Äòclimatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Server Group  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and which is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture  and the sentiments of our customers.Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

The figure‚Ä¶,"PARIS  Feb. 9  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- After posting good revenue figures for 4Q 2022  we are proud to say that Artprice by Artmarket has got off to a dynamic start to 2023 with January's turnover showing a 17% increase versus the year-earlier period.The figures show that since the start of 2023  Artmarket.com has been gaining market share with new customers despite the uncertain economic context stemming from very unpredictable geopolitical parameters and an inflationary dynamic that poses significant challenges for central banks  particularly for the ECB and the FED.Artprice took advantage of the Covid period to develop and deploy the most significant modification in its history  leading to a change in its business model with paying advertisers fully integrated into its databases and services. These advertisers are essentially the 6 500 Auction Houses around the world that have been affiliated with Artprice for more than two decades and today conduct 98% of their sales online.It is quite possible that the turnover generated by these 6 500 auction houses will ultimately generate more turnover than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice by Artmarket.com's turnover. By effectively responding to a long-standing request from its partner auction houses  Artprice believes it can double its turnover. A second major change in our business model relates to our decision to license our Standardized Database of Artists  today the most comprehensive in the world.Future events in 2023: annual licensing of Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists  with an entry price of ‚Ç¨7 500 per yearIn recent years  Artprice by Artmarket  which owns the largest known editorial collection of manuscripts and catalogs from 1700 to the present day (a current asset with an estimated value of ‚Ç¨16.257 million in Artprice by Artmarket.com's balance sheet)  has developed the most comprehensive database of artists in the world.At Artprice by Artmarket  we never forget that artists are what the art market revolves around; they are its primary and unique motor  and all the news  exhibitions  auctions  galleries  museums  biennials  fairs  and shows evolve around them. In short  none of it could exist without the artist.Each Artist page is created within the framework of a standardized editorial charter and a set of processes protected under France's Intellectual Property Laws  with a biography supported by certified documents from the artist and/or his/her beneficiaries that are deposited in Artprice's physical archives.Each analog/digital record has 140 referential integrity fields which are themselves relational databases.Each Artist page includes details about their various disciplines and artistic techniques  their past auction results (with photographs of the works)  their upcoming sales  their signatures and monograms  an indication of any catalog raisonn√© and/or reference work  their annual auction turnover  their auction records  the geographical distribution of their sales  their key market indices  their unsold rates  as well as all articles or dispatches from Artprice's press agency ""ArtMarket Insight"" written about the artist.This allows Artprice to attribute each artist with a dedicated ID (like a business identification code) and for each of his/her works  another specific ID (like a vehicle registration document) and to 'standardize' the art market to ensure reliable traceability  accurate indices  and comprehensive monitoring. These unique and rigorous processes are subject to multiple protection mechanisms under France's Intellectual Property Laws.A single Artist Log costs on average 270‚Ç¨ to 300‚Ç¨ to create  and  despite ultra-powerful computing  it requires human validation by a committee of editors and translation into the six languages of the Artprice databases  namely English  French  Spanish  German  Italian and Mandarin.In 25 years  the Artprice Artist Database has established itself as the leading standardized global database in terms of the number of artists it covers  but also in terms of the volume of information per Artist entry.To date  the only reference we have retained is the Benezit Dictionary  created in 1911 in Paris and which Artprice tried to acquire from √âditions Gr√ºnd in the early 2000s.At the time  Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists included 120 000 artists while the Benezit had 175 000. The latter was therefore the de facto global reference by its sheer number of artists. Despite a very substantial financial proposal from Artprice  the Benezit was finally sold to Oxford Art Online (see our registration document and financial report).In 2023  the online Benezit  in English  has 170 000 artists and a subscription entry cost of ¬£215 per year.Artprice's standardized artists' database now totals 803 000 artists from the 4th century to the present day  in six languages.The overall cost associated with successfully building the most comprehensive Standardized Database of Artists in the world also includes the cost of acquiring legendary companies and documentary collections such as the Enrique Mayer Guide (1962/1987)  the famous Dictionary of Art Sales by Doctor H. Mireur 1700-1900  the American leader Sound View Press with nearly 50 databases on the USA including the famous biographical collection Who Was Who in American Art (1991)  Editions Franck Van Wilder (1970)  the Swiss company Xylogic (world specialist in Art Market indices since 1985)  the Bayer Database on the Anglo-Saxon Art Market from 1700 to 1913  Signatures and Monogrammes by Caplan & Creps (USA)  a global reference work (1976)  and a whole host of other works and records.Indeed  over the past 25 years  we at Artprice have pursued a systematic policy of purchasing all manuscripts and catalogs  mainly from 1700 to 1970  from all over the world. The acquisition of this historical knowledge was an unavoidable process in ensuring that Artprice could standardize the art market with certainty and know the perfect traceability of works of art and their correct attributions.In the 20th century  the Benezit was the major reference  the Bible of the Art Market according to Le Monde newspaper. To date  it is the only serious financial and analytical referent for Artprice  notably because of its use of a comparative methodology.Nevertheless  the 803 000 artists in Artprice's Standardized Database represent a volume 472% greater than that of the Benezit Oxford University Press Dictionary (170 000 artists)  with access in six languages for Artprice compared with just one language for the Benezit.For Artprice  the total present-day cost in 2023 of building the most exhaustive database of artists in the world is 216 million euros (see paragraph on analytical cost). Despite being an asset in permanent growth  under International Financial Reporting Standards  the valuation of such a perennial asset is recognized in Artprice by Artmarket.com balance sheets at only a fraction of its real value (IFRS have been adopted since 2005 to harmonize the presentation of listed companies' financial and accounting statements).Indeed  the creation of the index for Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists was an extremely complex operation involving seven million hours of work by historians  researchers  editors  journalists  econometricians  and a dedicated IT department over 25 years.Now that it exists  Artprice by Artmarket is constantly being asked for licenses to use its Standardized Database of Artists  mainly by the tens of thousands of online galleries  marketplaces  Auction Houses  Experts  online auction sites  copyright companies  customs  and tax authorities  museums foundations and insurance companies that operate in this segment  but without an exhaustive standardized database of artists.Many of these players are prone to making regular attribution errors - as they themselves admit - and for the small or recently established structures  their survival depends on access to a standardized and consistent Database of Artists over the centuries.One of the main difficulties is having  on the one hand  a massive collection of auction catalogs and manuscripts  and on the other hand  proprietary algorithms that can track down and identify the numerous homonyms that exist in the field of art.Indeed  art history is full of homonyms. One of the solutions was to link the name of the artist to his place of birth as well as his connection to an ethnic group or a family or a clan.After a global market study focusing mainly on incoming requests from future clients  we calculated that the entry price for a license to use the index of Artprice's Standardized Database of 803 000 Artists  will be around ‚Ç¨7 500 per year  i.e. a monthly charge of ‚Ç¨625  which makes this operating license very affordable for small or recently-established structures.Of course  this annual operating license ‚Äì limited to the Standardized Index of Artists  does not in any way compete with Artprice or its multiple databases  as is contractually agreed with the licensee. This operating license uses an Application Programming Interface (API) provided by Artprice to connect software (or a website) to Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists.If the licensee notices that its customers request  for example  the price of works for past or future sales  indices and statistics on an artist  monograms and signatures  or any other information held by Artprice's databases  it may ask the Artprice licensor for a return API (re-routing/affiliation contract) to Artprice's paid databases where the licensee receives between 5 and 20% commission depending on the turnover achieved with Artprice on an annual subscription contracted on Artprice by Artmarket payment platforms. This allows Artprice to collect ‚Ç¨7 500/year on the one hand  and on the other hand  to greatly increase its turnover via its many licensees.Future events HI 2023: at the beginning of March Artprice will deploy its most sophisticated version of Artprice.com that will  among other things  initiate a complete change in our business model. Henceforward  our website will integrate paid advertisers into our databases and services and our Artist pages and Web 3.0.At the beginning of March 2023  Artprice by Artmarket will deploy the latest and most sophisticated version of its website in response to the numerous requests from its customers  which reflects the growth and expansion of its digital footprints. After 18 months of development  partly extended by the Covid  this large-scale deployment will affect all of Artprice's databases and services.To develop this latest version of our website  Artprice by Artmarket submitted a call for tenders at the end of 2019 and finally selected a team of very qualified and passionate external consultants to conduct an analysis followed by the development of a complete overhaul of Artprice.com. The whole process was based on a solid 'user interface' (UI) and 'user experience' approach  which  as their labels suggest  means that our entire website has been redesigned with an acute focus on making it easier for the user.At its core  the new website will include a very substantial change in our business model  since paying advertisers will be fully integrated into our databases and services. These advertisers are mainly the 6 500 auction houses worldwide  affiliated with Artprice for more than two decades and which now conduct 98% of their sales online. They will now  in paying advertiser mode  be able to highlight their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  depending on the search criteria of Artprice's 7.2 million customers.It should be noted that for the past half a century  the economic models of auction houses have always allocated roughly 34% of their overall costs to advertising (usually announcing details of upcoming public sales)  regardless of the country they operate in or the size of the auction house.Since auctions are now 98% advertised online  the pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2023 to promote their sales for a fee has found its best response with this new deployment. Indeed  the auction houses now believe that their communication budgets for future sales (34% of their estimated value) must be focused online  rather than on the printed media.In the past Artprice always considered online advertising to be incompatible with its databases in terms of readability and reputation. We have therefore done everything we can to satisfy demand from the auction houses while maintaining Artprice's original DNA.On the new version of the site  the 6 500 auction houses will be able to merge into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket by advertising their future sales and pushing the ""followed"" artists selected by the 7.2 million Artprice customers and members (alerts by SMS  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  ""my artists"" page  etc.).Since 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population to facilitate development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable  and above all contextualized data.Indeed  Artprice by Artmarket's clients and members will intuitively dive into the heart of art market news and will be privileged players within a human and educational approach  which is often lacking in the world of GAFAs.Moreover  Artprice's essential and historic collaborations as World Leader in Art Market Information will become even more apparent in this new version  mainly via contributions from individual artists who have participated in this evolution.The auction houses that have been our historical partners are  of course  the other essential collaboration. Indeed  their interest in collaborating with Artprice can only increase as they highlight their future sales with discreet and effective prestige  which will ‚Äì in turn ‚Äì generate additional recurring income for Artprice via its proprietary Intranet (the primary working tool for auction houses for many years).It is quite possible that the advertising revenue generated by these 6 500 auction houses (affiliated with Artprice since 1997) will ultimately generate more income than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice's turnover. As mentioned earlier  Artprice has a clear ambition to double its turnover and  again  this initiative is a direct result of long-standing requests from our partner auction houses.In sum  after more than two years of R&D (extended by the Covid crisis)  Artprice by Artmarket is proud to be able fully to engage Artmarket.com customers  partners  and members in a new experience at the heart of the art market.This is undoubtedly one of the founding stones for the future of Artprice by Artmarket  with a fundamentally improved positioning via the referencing of images on search engines  the objective of increasing traffic to conquer new market share and to corner the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs.Thanks to Google Analytics 4  the latest generation of Analytics  the ""Crawl budget""  a combination of Google's ""crawl rate"" and ""crawl demand""  increased from 915 000 requests/day to a new average of 2.5 million/day since the deployment of Artprice's 803 000 Artist homepages at the end of 2022.Through this deployment  Artprice has not only remained faithful to its principle of maintaining the readability of its databases but has also responded (at last) to the continual requests from its 6 500 affiliated Auction Houses around the world to have access to paid advertisements to enhance their future sales.Since January 2023  a complete UI//UX overhaul of Artists P ages and our Web 3.0/Art NFTs allowed greater global visibility for the 803 000 artists on Artprice by Artmarket.Artmarket.com has implemented a substantial tariff increase for its subscriptions and services since the beginning of 2023. These increases will generate an increase in future income. Artmarket.com was already profitable for a decade  and the additional revenue will translate almost entirely into net income since we will still be below the ‚Ç¨90 million euros p.a. tax bracket.This tariff increase follows extensive consultation with Artprice by Artmarket customers who will continue to benefit from our databases and services  well aware that they find essential data in Artprice that they cannot find elsewhere. Enriched by over a million ultra-qualified new data every year  our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997  must now be properly and systematically monetized.Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most exhaustive in the world and this is recognized by a broad consensus of art market operators. It covers nearly 803 000 artists  all referenced with their biographies  auction results  market indices  decision-making help tools  signatures & monograms  and future sales  alongside historical information and contemporary  cultural  and market news. In total  our databases contain several tens of millions of data inputs and their combination and exploitation by our teams means that the sum of the parts is infinitely more valuable  and the whole system is protected by various intellectual property rights.Despite this substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best value compared to the offer by our competitors who have not managed to evolve and offer subscriptions with limited searches: annual professional subscriptions from the competition for 150 searches ‚Ç¨350/year  or 450 searches ‚Ç¨975/year  and  in the event of an overrun  ‚Ç¨2.45/request (as noted by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In a world of ""unlimited"" offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competition's offer is based on data of only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 803 000 artists and 6 500 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from ‚Ç¨279 to ‚Ç¨569/year  including a range of indices  decision-making tools  and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world. Indeed  Artprice would still be very competitive at substantially higher prices.Surprisingly ‚Äì given the geopolitical and economic context ‚Äì the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods during recent sales sessions  regardless of the country. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023  which are the main indicators of the art market's health.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100¬© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market. For information  the Artprice100¬© index has increased by 612% since 2000. For the year 2022  the S&P index posted a contraction of -19% versus +3% for the Artprice100¬©.In our upcoming Global Art Market Report  we plan to present a truly global analysis of the art market's activities in 2022. This report is scheduled for publication in early March 2023. It will be available free of charge online and in PDF version. The AFP will publish it first.It is clear that war in Eastern Europe and the fears of a global recession have not depressed the art market at the start of this year.At the end of 2022  the AFP posted an article with the evocative title ""The collection of Microsoft co-founder aims for a billion-dollar auction total in New York"" and added ""With the late Paul G Allen's collection  Christie's is aiming for a historic art auction record  symbol of a market that is surging ahead despite a world shaken by crises.""Our new version of Artists Homepages bolsters the primary and preferred entry points to all of Artprice's databases and services because artists are indeed the foundation on which the art market has been based since its origin. With this major overhaul  Artprice also aims to reposition artists at the heart of the art market via the production of Art NFTs  which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.The major overhaul of Artprice.com aims to provide its customers and members with a better experience  more in line with their needs. It has been implemented after several years of collecting and analyzing their needs in strict compliance with the legislation in force in Europe and the USA.The overhaul naturally integrates the arrival of Art NFTs  whose growth is exponential and which also constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's principal market-makers  including the majority of the auction houses around the world  now have NFT departments for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum industry and art galleries sphere are starting to publish their own NFTs.In addition  the major overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com finally highlights the largest proprietary collection of original manuscripts and sales catalogs printed since 1700. Owned and collected by Artprice over the last three decades  this collection acts as the fundamental core of Artprice's digital standardization of the art market and legitimizes its position as Global Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years.After the overhaul of our Artists Homepages  Artprice customers and prospects will have access to several centuries of knowledge organized over 25 years by Artprice's historians and editors. Access to this historical information has been structured in a perfectly intuitive and natural way so that users can immerse themselves in the exceptional and complex history of the art market.These new pages highlight the wealth and depth of Artmarket.com's databases and services  offering a high level of added value. The use of algorithmic AI allows access to highly relevant and personalized recommendations  allowing users to deepen their knowledge of the art market and ultimately generating more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore greater business revenue.This feature also brings Artprice by Artmarket clients and members fully into the Web 3.0 and Art NFTs sphere  giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.Ahead of our major rollout in December 2022  Artprice has listened carefully to both its historical customers and its new customers and prospects.Indeed  with cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. Accustomed to speculation and risk-taking  art enthusiasts and collectors nonetheless  have no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe.Having frequently used the services of Artprice  they have become new clients for Artmarket.com  but they made it clear they needed art prices to be added in both ETH and BTC throughout the entire Artprice databases. This major addition to our platform was completed at the end of 2022.The ultra-targeted digital campaigns on Twitter demonstrate through their returns (3 to 5%) that these new buyers respond with high-end Artprice subscriptions.In addition  Artmarket.com is pleased to have given historical preference to Ethereum which  via an operation baptized ""The Merge"" on 15 September 2022  converted in entire blockchain from a Proof-of-work (PoW) type consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) type mechanism to move to a more environmentally friendly system.According to the Ethereum Foundation  this move was followed by an immediate drop in the total energy consumption of the Ethereum network by 99.9%.Thus  to foster the exchange and sale of Art NFTs on its Marketplace  and given the energy context  Artprice's choice for the Ethereum blockchain is fully in line with the ambitions expressed by France's Minister for the Economy  Bruno Le Maire  as announced in a previous press release:www.actusnews.com/fr/artmarket/cp/2022/10/20/artmarket_com-deja-positionnee-sur-les-nfts-avec-artprice-reagit-a-l_itw-de-bruno-le-maire-donnee-a-bfm-crypto-voulant-faire-deThis week  the French-language weekly business magazine has headlined its February issue (772) with the following title: ""What if Ethereum had the keys to blockchain success? Experiencing rapid growth  the decentralized cryptocurrency platform presents itself as one of the ""green"" options in the sector. A strategy that is convincing more and more investors and institutions"".thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com emphasizes: ""In its various annual reports on the Art Market and its regulated information it publishes as a listed company  Artprice by Artmarket.com has always said concerning NFTs that it is impossible to apprehend this new market without a perfect knowledge of the relevant Monetary & Financial Codes and Intellectual Property Codes of the countries in which the market is operating. Similarly  to appreciate the nature of this market (experiencing exponential growth)  one also needs a true understanding of Blockchain  cryptocurrencies  and their cultural origins among the Cypherpunks (period of PGP-type data encryption at the beginning of 1990)""These regulations have been the subject of studies  colloquia  and proposals to major French and European government bodies by Blanche Sousi and the Art & Law Institute  with whom Artprice by Artmarket has been heavily involved as a long-standing member since 1997.2023: more than ever  Artprice's eco-responsible philosophy must set an example in the world of data centers.According to thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice:""Artprice by Artmarket.com has patiently and methodically given itself all the means to evolve in response to the needs of Art Market professionals. All the indicators are positive for the future and we project a doubling of revenue  notably by opening up to paying advertisers integrated into our services and databasesWe have also developed  since 2017  processes to optimize the use of our servers  by limiting the power required and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers by 40%. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energiesThrough its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies concerning new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ""formativity"" (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a 'climatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Server Group  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and which is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture  and the sentiments of our customers.Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comfor your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.com Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Trading revenue grew to ‚Ç¨514.1 million (-0.8% pro forma  +10.5% reported). FX and power trading reported strong performances. The softer environment for cash trading volumes from the second semester of 2022 was offset by efficient management of yield and an uptick in market share from October 2022. Post-trade revenue (excluding NTI) grew to ‚Ç¨364.5 million (+1.5 % pro forma  +13.7% reported). Custody and Settlement revenue was ‚Ç¨243.1 million (stable pro forma  +10.9% reported) thanks to the diversified Euronext Securities business model as settlement activity stabilised. Clearing revenue increased to ‚Ç¨121.4 million (+4.5% pro forma  +19.7% reported) mainly as a result of the consolidation of revenue from Euronext Clearing (acquired on 29 April 2021) and improved product mix.

In 2022  Euronext remained the leading venue for equity listing in Europe  recording 83 new equity listings  and the leading venue for debt listing globally. Advanced Data Services revenue grew to ‚Ç¨212.1 million (+4.8% pro forma  +15.5% reported)  driven by the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group and a strong performance of both real-time and non real-time data businesses.Adjusted EBITDA 3 was at ‚Ç¨ 861.6 million ( +‚Ç¨90.6 million   -1.2 % pro forma  +11. 7 % reported ) reflecting continued cost disciplin e despite strong inflationary pressure .

The slight increase in costs only results from costs related to non-volume related revenue growth initiatives. Savings and synergies entirely compensate inflation and business development costs.Status update on synergies in relation to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition : ‚Ç¨ 34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies were achieved at the end of Q4 2022  thanks to restructuring efforts and the migration of the Core Data Centre. ‚Ç¨9.7 million run-rate annual synergies were delivered in Q4 2022. ‚Ç¨44.2 million of cumulated implementation costs incurred at the end of Q4 2022  of which ‚Ç¨6.3 million during Q4 2022.Next steps in the deployment of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan : Euronext upgrades its 2024 annual run - rate pre - tax synergies related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group by ‚Ç¨ 15 millon to ‚Ç¨ 115 million . Implementation costs remain unchanged. Euronext confirmed the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets onto Optiq ¬Æ in March 2023  forming the first phase of the migration  and of Borsa Italiana other markets in Q4 2023 allowing for termination of the third-party provider trading platform contract. Euronext confirmed the phases in the expansion of Euronext Clearing with the expected launch of the equity clearing offering by the end of 2023 and of derivative clearing by Q3 2024. These strategic projects are expected to reach around ‚Ç¨ 7 0 million of cumulated run-rate synergies by the end of 2023  out of the ‚Ç¨115 million targeted. In 2023  Euronext expects to maintain for cash trading an average market share greater or equal to 63%   and revenue capture a round 0.5 2 bps following the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq ¬Æ   considering current market conditions and orders size.Key achievement in the deployment of the ‚Äò Fit for 1.5 ¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy in 2022 : Euronext‚Äôs upgraded SBTi-aligned climate targets were validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative: By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based greenhouse gas emissions by 73.5% compared to 2020; By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 3 business travel emissions by at least 46.2% compared to 2019; By 2027  Euronext suppliers  representing 72% of Euronext‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions derived from purchased goods and services  must set targets on their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.The Group‚Äôs efforts to enhance diversity were recognised through the inclusion of Euronext into the Euronext Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Euronext Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices.St√©phane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:‚ÄúIn 2022  Euronext reached record revenue and income above ‚Ç¨1.4 billion notably resulting from the strong performance of our non-volume related activities  together with efficient management of revenue capture and of cash trading market share. Thanks to our trademark cost discipline  we beat our 2022 revised costs guidance. We achieved an adjusted EBITDA of ‚Ç¨861.6 million that translated into an adjusted EPS of ‚Ç¨5.21. We will propose a total dividend of ‚Ç¨236.6 million at our next annual general meeting to be held in May 2023  representing 50% of our reported net income  excluding NTI loss impact.This year has been crucial in laying the foundations for the future growth of the Group. We have successfully completed the first major milestone of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan with the migration of our Core Data Centre from the UK to Italy. At the end of 2022  we have achieved ‚Ç¨34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies related to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.This fruitful year paves the way for the next steps to be delivered in 2023. The largest single liquidity pool in Europe  operated by Euronext will significantly change dimension with the migration of Italian cash markets to Euronext‚Äôs state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq¬Æ  which will benefit local and global trading members.Euronext Clearing will become the Euronext equity clearing house of choice by the end of 2023  and the CCP for derivatives clearing in Q3 2024. These are the critical bricks to complete our presence across the integrated value chain  allowing us to innovate and shape capital markets in line with evolving client needs  and making Euronext even stronger to deliver future growth.In an inflationary environment  we will contain our costs to a slight increase in 2023  at ‚Ç¨630 million  demonstrating Euronext‚Äôs ability to maintain its cost discipline while investing to generate revenue expansion of our non-volume related activities. We expect to deliver by the end of 2023 around ‚Ç¨70 million of the synergies targeted as part of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan. Our good progress on integration led us to upgrade the total amount of targeted run-rate EBITDA synergies by the end of 2024 from ‚Ç¨100 million to ‚Ç¨115 million. This further demonstrates Euronext‚Äôs successful track record in integrating acquired companies.Our strong performance  combined with the successful ongoing delivery of the planned synergies  is supporting our deleveraging trajectory with a net debt to EBITDA ratio at 2.6x  well below 3.2x at the time of closing of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition. This leaves the Group with flexibility to further deploy capital in value generating opportunities that might arise.Lastly  we are happy to see that our ‚ÄòFit for 1.5¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy is bearing fruit  as our upgraded emission reduction targets have been validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative. We are pleased to see Euronext being included in both the Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices  demonstrating the progress we are making in striving towards more equality.‚ÄùEuronext Q4 and full year 2022 financial performanceFull year 20226In ‚Ç¨m  unless stated otherwiseThe figures in this document have not been audited or reviewed by our external auditor.

Trading revenue grew to ‚Ç¨514.1 million (-0.8% pro forma  +10.5% reported). FX and power trading reported strong performances. The softer environment for cash trading volumes from the second semester of 2022 was offset by efficient management of yield and an uptick in market share from October 2022. Post-trade revenue (excluding NTI) grew to ‚Ç¨364.5 million (+1.5 % pro forma  +13.7% reported). Custody and Settlement revenue was ‚Ç¨243.1 million (stable pro forma  +10.9% reported) thanks to the diversified Euronext Securities business model as settlement activity stabilised. Clearing revenue increased to ‚Ç¨121.4 million (+4.5% pro forma  +19.7% reported) mainly as a result of the consolidation of revenue from Euronext Clearing (acquired on 29 April 2021) and improved product mix.

In 2022  Euronext remained the leading venue for equity listing in Europe  recording 83 new equity listings  and the leading venue for debt listing globally. Advanced Data Services revenue grew to ‚Ç¨212.1 million (+4.8% pro forma  +15.5% reported)  driven by the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group and a strong performance of both real-time and non real-time data businesses.Adjusted EBITDA 3 was at ‚Ç¨ 861.6 million ( +‚Ç¨90.6 million   -1.2 % pro forma  +11. 7 % reported ) reflecting continued cost disciplin e despite strong inflationary pressure .

The slight increase in costs only results from costs related to non-volume related revenue growth initiatives. Savings and synergies entirely compensate inflation and business development costs.Status update on synergies in relation to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition : ‚Ç¨ 34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies were achieved at the end of Q4 2022  thanks to restructuring efforts and the migration of the Core Data Centre. ‚Ç¨9.7 million run-rate annual synergies were delivered in Q4 2022. ‚Ç¨44.2 million of cumulated implementation costs incurred at the end of Q4 2022  of which ‚Ç¨6.3 million during Q4 2022.Next steps in the deployment of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan : Euronext upgrades its 2024 annual run - rate pre - tax synergies related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group by ‚Ç¨ 15 millon to ‚Ç¨ 115 million . Implementation costs remain unchanged. Euronext confirmed the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets onto Optiq ¬Æ in March 2023  forming the first phase of the migration  and of Borsa Italiana other markets in Q4 2023 allowing for termination of the third-party provider trading platform contract. Euronext confirmed the phases in the expansion of Euronext Clearing with the expected launch of the equity clearing offering by the end of 2023 and of derivative clearing by Q3 2024. These strategic projects are expected to reach around ‚Ç¨ 7 0 million of cumulated run-rate synergies by the end of 2023  out of the ‚Ç¨115 million targeted. In 2023  Euronext expects to maintain for cash trading an average market share greater or equal to 63%   and revenue capture a round 0.5 2 bps following the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq ¬Æ   considering current market conditions and orders size.Key achievement in the deployment of the ‚Äò Fit for 1.5 ¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy in 2022 : Euronext‚Äôs upgraded SBTi-aligned climate targets were validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative: By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based greenhouse gas emissions by 73.5% compared to 2020; By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 3 business travel emissions by at least 46.2% compared to 2019; By 2027  Euronext suppliers  representing 72% of Euronext‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions derived from purchased goods and services  must set targets on their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.The Group‚Äôs efforts to enhance diversity were recognised through the inclusion of Euronext into the Euronext Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Euronext Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices.St√©phane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said: ‚ÄúIn 2022  Euronext reached record revenue and income above ‚Ç¨1.4 billion notably resulting from the strong performance of our non-volume related activities  together with efficient management of revenue capture and of cash trading market share. Thanks to our trademark cost discipline  we beat our 2022 revised costs guidance. We achieved an adjusted EBITDA of ‚Ç¨861.6 million that translated into an adjusted EPS of ‚Ç¨5.21. We will propose a total dividend of ‚Ç¨236.6 million at our next annual general meeting to be held in May 2023  representing 50% of our reported net income  excluding NTI loss impact.This year has been crucial in laying the foundations for the future growth of the Group. We have successfully completed the first major milestone of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan with the migration of our Core Data Centre from the UK to Italy. At the end of 2022  we have achieved ‚Ç¨34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies related to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.This fruitful year paves the way for the next steps to be delivered in 2023. The largest single liquidity pool in Europe  operated by Euronext will significantly change dimension with the migration of Italian cash markets to Euronext‚Äôs state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq¬Æ  which will benefit local and global trading members.Euronext Clearing will become the Euronext equity clearing house of choice by the end of 2023  and the CCP for derivatives clearing in Q3 2024. These are the critical bricks to complete our presence across the integrated value chain  allowing us to innovate and shape capital markets in line with evolving client needs  and making Euronext even stronger to deliver future growth.In an inflationary environment  we will contain our costs to a slight increase in 2023  at ‚Ç¨630 million  demonstrating Euronext‚Äôs ability to maintain its cost discipline while investing to generate revenue expansion of our non-volume related activities. We expect to deliver by the end of 2023 around ‚Ç¨70 million of the synergies targeted as part of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan. Our good progress on integration led us to upgrade the total amount of targeted run-rate EBITDA synergies by the end of 2024 from ‚Ç¨100 million to ‚Ç¨115 million. This further demonstrates Euronext‚Äôs successful track record in integrating acquired companies.Our strong performance  combined with the successful ongoing delivery of the planned synergies  is supporting our deleveraging trajectory with a net debt to EBITDA ratio at 2.6x  well below 3.2x at the time of closing of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition.

Underlying revenue and income  excluding the non-underlying  one-off loss related to the partial disposal of the Euronext Clearing portfolio  was up +13.0% in 2022  to ‚Ç¨1 467.8 million. On a like-for-like basis and at constant currencies  Euronext consolidated revenue and income was stable (-0.2%) in 2022  at ‚Ç¨1 204.4 million  compared to 2021. Pro forma the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition on 29 April 2021  underlying revenue and income were stable in 2022 compared to 2021  resulting from strong non-volume related activities  notably listing and advanced data services  very good performances for FX and power trading and a solid performance of derivatives trading. Non-volume related revenue accounted for 58% of underlying Group revenue in 2022  stable vs. 2021  reflecting the successful diversification towards non-volume related activities  good performance of non-equity related trading activities and the challenging environment for cash trading and MTS cash trading this quarter. The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage by non-volume related underlying revenue ratio was at 141% in 2022  almost stable vs. 2021 (142%). 2022 adjusted EBITDA Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased to ‚Ç¨606.1 million  up +14.9%  reflecting the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group costs and continued cost discipline in an inflationary environment. Underlying expenses excluding D&A (‚Ç¨606.1 million) were better than 2022 guidance of ‚Ç¨612 million underlying costs excluding D&A (‚Ç¨622 million initially) thanks to strong cost discipline  project costs being capitalised and one-off positive impacts  including release of accruals and lower-than-anticipated travel and marketing expenses due to the Covid-19 pandemic. On a like-for-like basis  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased slightly by +2.7% compared to 2021  which was positively impacted by the decrease of travel and marketing expenses during the pandemic  highlighting Euronext‚Äôs ability to contain inflation in 2022. On a pro forma basis for the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group on 29 April 2021  underlying operational expenses increased slightly by +2.0%  mainly due to the return of travel and marketing expenses in 2022. Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled ‚Ç¨861.6 million and saw double digit growth  +11.7% compared to 2021. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 58.7%  down -0.7 points compared to 2021. On a like-for-like basis  adjusted EBITDA for 2022 was down -2.3%  to ‚Ç¨699.3 million  and adjusted EBITDA margin was 58.1%  down -1.2 points compared to the same perimeter in 2021. 2022 net income  share of the parent company shareholders Depreciation and amortisation accounted for ‚Ç¨160.2 million in 2022  up +19.0%  mostly due to the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for ‚Ç¨83.3 million and is included in depreciation and amortisation. Adjusted operating profit was ‚Ç¨792.8 million  a strong +11.7% increase compared to 2021. On a like-for-like basis  adjusted operating profit was down -2.3% compared to 2021  at ‚Ç¨643.6 million. ‚Ç¨118.6 million of non-underlying expenses  including depreciation and amortisation  were reported in 2022  related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group  the implementation of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan and the PPA of acquired businesses. Net financing expense for 2022 was ‚Ç¨29.7 million compared to a net financing expense of ‚Ç¨31.7 million in 2021. This decrease mainly results from the elimination of costs in relation to the bridge financing of the Borsa Italiana Group in 2021  partially offset by the cost of bonds issued to finance the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. Results from equity investments amounted to ‚Ç¨18.7 million in 2022  solely representing the contribution received from LCH SA and a dividend received from Euroclear. As a reminder  in 2021  Euronext reported ‚Ç¨33.2 million in results from equity investments  reflecting two dividends received from Sicovam and two dividends received from Euroclear in addition to the contribution received from LCH SA. Income tax for 2022 was ‚Ç¨163.6 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 26.6% for 2022 (2021: ‚Ç¨158.6 million and 27.3% respectively). Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to the Borsa Italiana Group and Nord Pool amounted to ‚Ç¨12.8 million in 2022. As a result  the reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  increased by +5.9% for 2022 compared to 2021  to ‚Ç¨437.8 million  including the one-off loss due to the portfolio reallocation10 of the Euronext Clearing portfolio. This represents a reported EPS of ‚Ç¨4.10 basic and ‚Ç¨4.10 diluted in 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨4.30 basic and ‚Ç¨4.29 diluted in 2021. This decrease reflects a higher number of outstanding shares over 2022 compared to 2021. Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders was up +5.7% to ‚Ç¨555.3 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was down -4.8% in 2022  at ‚Ç¨5.21 per share  compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of ‚Ç¨5.47 per share in 2021. This decrease reflect a higher number of outstanding shares over 2022 compared to 2021. The weighted number of shares used over 2022 was 106 669 451 for the basic calculation and 106 901 306 for the diluted calculation  compared to 96 058 761 and 96 297 159 respectively over 2021. In 2022  Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of ‚Ç¨616.5 million  compared to ‚Ç¨543.7 million in 2021  resulting from higher profit before tax and higher depreciation and amortisation. Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities  net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 83.9% of EBITDA in 2022.

On a like-for-like basis and at constant currencies  Euronext consolidated revenue and income was down -6.1% in Q4 2022  to ‚Ç¨346.5 million  compared to Q4 2021. Non-volume related revenue accounted for 60% of Group revenue in Q4 2022  compared to 58% in Q4 2021  reflecting higher advanced data services and services revenue. The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage by non-volume related revenue ratio was at 130% in Q4 2022  compared to 136% in Q4 2021. Q4 2022 adjusted EBITDA Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased to ‚Ç¨159.2 million  slightly up +1.6%  reflecting strong cost discipline in an inflationary environment and higher capitalised project costs. On a like-for-like basis  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation slightly increased by +2.1% compared to Q4 2021. Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled ‚Ç¨187.9 million  down -12.0% compared to Q4 2021. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.1%  down -3.5 points compared to Q4 2021.

On a like-for-like basis  adjusted operating profit was down -13.4% compared to Q4 2021  at ‚Ç¨168.2 million. ‚Ç¨34.1 million of non-underlying expenses  including depreciation and amortisation  were reported in Q4 2022  related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group  the implementation of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan and the PPA of acquired businesses. Net financing expense for Q4 2022 was ‚Ç¨6.0 million  compared to a net financing expense of ‚Ç¨6.7 million in Q4 2021. This decrease results from higher interest income due to increased interest rates partially offset by the higher cost of issued bonds and a negative revaluation of foreign currency balances. Results from equity investments amounted to ‚Ç¨12.6 million in Q4 2022  representing the contribution received from LCH SA and a dividend received from Euroclear. As a reminder  in Q4 2021  Euronext reported ‚Ç¨7.3 million in results from equity investments  reflecting a dividend payment by Sicovam in addition to the contribution received from LCH SA. Income tax for Q4 2022 was ‚Ç¨38.5 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 27.3% for the quarter (Q4 2021: ‚Ç¨35.7 million and 23.6% respectively). Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to the Borsa Italiana Group and Nord Pool amounted to ‚Ç¨3.0 million in Q4 2022. As a result  the reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  decreased by -11.9% for Q4 2022 compared to Q4 2021  to ‚Ç¨99.3 million. This represents a reported EPS of ‚Ç¨0.93 basic and ‚Ç¨0.93 diluted in Q4 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨1.05 basic and ‚Ç¨1.05 diluted in Q4 2021. Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders was down -18.2% to ‚Ç¨118.2 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was down -18.0% in Q4 2022  at ‚Ç¨1.11 per share  compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of ‚Ç¨1.35 per share in Q4 2021. This decrease reflect a higher number of outstanding shares over the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The weighted number of shares used over 2022 was 106 669 451 for the basic calculation and 106 901 306 for the diluted calculation  compared to 96 058 761 and 96 297 159 respectively over 2021. In Q4 2022  Euronext reported a negative net cash flow from operating activities of ‚Ç¨147.1 million  compared to a positive ‚Ç¨145.6 million in Q4 2021  reflecting higher negative changes in working capital reflecting notably short-term movement in outstanding power sales customers‚Äô and suppliers‚Äô invoices related to Nord Pool CCP activities. Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities  net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 51.9% of EBITDA in Q4 2022.

Fourth quarter 2022 Cash tradingCash trading revenue decreased by -17.9% to ‚Ç¨65.1 million in Q4 2022  resulting from lower trading volumes  partially offset by an uptick in market share from October 2022. Over the fourth quarter of 2022  Euronext recorded cash trading average daily volumes of ‚Ç¨10.1 billion  a volume decrease of-17.2% compared to Q4 2021 resulting from a softer trading environment and partially offset by efficient revenue capture management. Over the fourth quarter of 2022  Euronext cash trading yield was 0.50bps  reflecting the dilutive impact of Borsa Italiana markets and larger average order size. During the fourth quarter 2022  Euronext continued to enhance its fee schemes. The latter translated into an uptick in market share from October 2022. Euronext market share on cash trading averaged 65.3% in Q4 2022. In 2023  Euronext expects to maintain for cash trading an average market share greater or equal to 63%  and revenue capture around 0.52bps following the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq¬Æ  considering current market conditions and orders size. The largest single liquidity pool in Europe operated by Euronext will significantly change dimension with the migration of Italian cash markets to Euronext‚Äôs state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq¬Æ in Q1 2023. This migration will benefit local and global trading members.

Appendix Adjustments in financial disclosure To highlight its underlying performance  since Q1 2022 Euronext has published underlying recurring costs  adjusted EBITDA and non-recurring costs. Euronext has removed the exceptional items line from its financial statements. Consequently  costs previously reported as exceptional items have from Q1 2022 been included in their respective lines within Euronext operating expenses as non-recurring items. The ‚Ç¨150 million of implementation costs to deliver on the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan targets are therefore considered as non-recurring items and have been withdrawn from the underlying recurring costs. The computation of adjusted net income and earnings per share has been adjusted accordingly. The computation of reported net income and earnings per share is not impacted. 2024 strategic plan targets remain unchanged and are not affected by this change in reporting.

These items can include: integration or double run costs of significant projects  restructuring costs and costs related to acquisitions that change the perimeter of the Group; one-off finance costs  gains or losses on sale of subsidiaries and impairments of investments: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets which are recognised as a result of acquisitions and mostly comprising customer relationships  brand names and software that were identified during purchase price allocation (PPA); tax related to non-underlying items.Adjusted operating profit as the operating profit adjusted for any non-underlying revenue and income and non-underlying costs  including PPA of acquired businesses;EBITDA as the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;Adjusted EBITDA as the adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation adjusted for any non-underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA  divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted net income  as the net income  share of the parent company shareholders  adjusted for any non-underlying items and related tax impact.

Net sales decreased by 6.0%. Net sales growth excluding the renewable energy sources business was 2.9%.Adjusted operating profit for the final quarter was EUR 9.6 million (10.1) and operating profit was EUR 12.9 million (9.9). The Group's operating profit was increased by a gain of EUR 4.3 million recognised on the sale of the share of renewable energy sources business to a newly established joint venture.L&T‚Äôs circular economy businesses  namely Environmental Services and Industrial Services  achieved a strong operating result in 2022. In Industrial Services  net sales increased by 25.6 per cent.In Facility Services in Finland and Sweden  the higher general cost level had a negative effect on profitability. Both divisions launched programmes during the review period to simplify and increase the efficiency of their operating models. These programmes will continue in 2023.Net sales for 2022 amounted to EUR 844.1 million (812.5). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 40.9 million (42.4) and operating profit was EUR 42.9 million (42.2). Earnings per share were EUR 0.83 (0.90).Net cash flow from operating activities after investments per share was EUR 1.08 (0.05).The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of EUR 0.47 per share.Outlook for the year 2023Net sales and adjusted operating profit in 2023 are estimated to be at the same level as in the previous year even though the comparison period includes net sales from the renewable energy sources business in the amount of EUR 35.4 million.PRESIDENT AND CEO EERO HAUTANIEMI:‚ÄúThe year 2022 was exceptional and the business environment changed significantly. The economic uncertainty caused by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine  the sharp rise in costs and interest rates and the significantly higher-than-usual level of sickness-related absences affected all of the company‚Äôs divisions.The development of net sales was positive in 2022  but adjusted operating profit declined slightly due to the weak result of Facility Services Finland and Sweden. Net cash flow from operating activities was strong  as was the company‚Äôs financial position.L&T‚Äôs circular economy businesses  namely Environmental Services and Industrial Services  achieved a good operative result in 2022.In Environmental Services  net sales growth excluding the renewable energy sources business came to 8.1 per cent. The number of corporate customers and producer responsibility organisation customers grew. The division‚Äôs environmental responsibility management and consulting capabilities and organisation were strengthened.In Industrial Services  net sales increased by 25.6 per cent  of which 6.6 per cent was organic growth. Industrial Services expanded its operations into the Swedish market and strengthened its market position in hazardous waste in Finland through an acquisition. In the environmental construction business  a number of demanding contaminated soil restoration projects were carried out for industrial customers.In Facility Services in Finland and Sweden  profitability was weighed down by the higher general cost level  worsening labour shortages  high employee turnover and sickness-related absences being significantly higher than average. The profit performance of Facility Services Sweden was weighed down not only by inflation but also the weaker-than-expected sales of additional services. Both divisions launched programmes during the review period to simplify and increase the efficiency of their operating models. These programmes will continue in 2023.L&T‚Äôs businesses are not particularly sensitive to economic cycles. Nevertheless  inflation and rising interest rates create uncertainty in the operating environment.In 2024  the Environmental Services division will focus particularly on corporate customers and producer responsibility organisations as the progress of municipalisation reduces the significance of households as customers.The Industrial Services division will continue to invest in the development of new hazardous waste recycling solutions and process cleaning methods in both Finland and Sweden.Facility Services Finland and Sweden will continue to focus on improving operational efficiency and profitability. Particularly in Finland  unprofitable customer agreements will be terminated and the scope of operations will be reassessed. In Sweden  the focus will be on simplifying the operating model.‚ÄùGROUP NET SALES AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEOctober‚ÄìDecemberLassila & Tikanoja‚Äôs net sales for the fourth quarter amounted to EUR 210.1 million (223.5)  a decrease of 6.0% year-on-year. Net sales growth excluding the effect of the renewable energy sources business was 2.9% and organic growth was 0.4%. Adjusted operating profit was EUR 9.6 million (10.1)  representing 4.6% (4.5%) of net sales. Operating profit was EUR 12.9 million (9.9)  representing 6.2% (4.4%) of net sales. Earnings per share were EUR 0.29 (0.26).Net sales increased in Industrial Services and Facility Services Finland. Net sales decreased in Environmental Services and Facility Services Sweden. Operating profit improved in Industrial Services and Facility Services Finland  and declined in Environmental Services and Facility Services Sweden.The Group‚Äôs adjusted operating profit was still negatively affected by the higher general cost level. Net financial expenses rose to EUR -1.6 million (-0.8). The Group's operating profit was increased by a gain of EUR 4.3 million recognised on the sale of the share of renewable energy sources business to a newly established joint venture.Year 2022Net sales for 2022 totalled EUR 844.1 million (812.5)  an increase of 3.9% year-on-year. Net sales growth excluding the effect of the renewable energy sources business was 7.0%. Organic growth was 3.7%. Adjusted operating profit was EUR 40.9 million (42.4)  representing 4.8% (5.2%) of net sales. Operating profit was EUR 42.9 million (42.2)  representing 5.1% (5.2%) of net sales. Earnings per share were EUR 0.83 (0.90).Net sales increased in Environmental Services  Industrial Services and Facility Services Finland. Net sales decreased in Facility Services Sweden. Operating profit improved in Environmental Services and Industrial Services  and declined in Facility Services in Finland and Sweden.The Group‚Äôs adjusted operating profit was negatively affected by increased fuel prices and the higher general cost level. The sickness rate was exceptionally high during the review period  which had a negative impact particularly on the labour-intensive facility services business. The Group's operating profit was increased by a gain of EUR 4.3 million recognised on the sale of the share of renewable energy sources business to a newly established joint venture.Net financial expenses rose to EUR -5.8 million (-3.3) and the effective tax rate increased to 16.7 per cent (11.8 per cent).Financial summary10‚Äì12/2022 10‚Äì12/2021 Change % 1‚Äì12/2022 1‚Äì12/2021 Change % Net sales  EUR million 210.1 223.5 -6.0 844.1 812.5 3.9 Adjusted operating profit  EUR million 9.6 10.1 -5.1 40.9 42.4 -3.5 Adjusted operating margin  % 4.6 4.5 4.8 5.2 Operating profit  EUR million 12.9 9.9 30.2 42.9 42.2 1.7 Operating margin  % 6.2 4.4 5.1 5.2 EBITDA  EUR million 26.5 23.2 14.2 98.3 95.1 3.3 EBITDA  % 12.6 10.4 11.6 11.7 Profit before tax  EUR million 12.2 9.1 33.8 37.8 39.0 -3.0 Earnings per share  EUR 0.29 0.26 11.1 0.83 0.90 -8.3 Net cash flow from operating activitiesafter investments per share  EUR 1.05 0.55 92.8 1.08 0.05 2 279.1 Return on equity (ROE)  % 14.6 17.1 Capital employed  EUR million 437.2 406.0 7.7 Return on capital employed (ROCE)  % 10.4 10.8 Equity ratio  % 34.3 34.2 Gearing  % 75.9 79.4NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT BY DIVISIONEnvironmental ServicesOctober‚ÄìDecemberThe division‚Äôs net sales for the fourth quarter decreased to EUR 71.1 million (89.9). Operating profit declined to EUR 6.2 million (7.1). Excluding the renewable energy sources business  the net sales of the Environmental Services division amounted to EUR 71.1 million (71.2) and operating profit was EUR 6.2 million (6.6).Year 2022The full-year net sales of the Environmental Services division grew to EUR 321.2 million (320.5). Operating profit was EUR 30.3 million (29.8). Excluding the renewable energy sources business  the net sales of the Environmental Services division amounted to EUR 287.1 million (265.5) and operating profit was EUR 30.0 million (28.9).In Environmental Services  growth was derived particularly from corporate customers and producer responsibility organisations. The producer responsibility organisation Suomen Pakkaustuottajat Oy chose L&T as its recycling partner for consumer plastic packaging in December. The agreement covers approximately 20 000 tonnes of consumer packaging plastic waste  which corresponds to approximately half of the packaging plastic waste collected in Finland each year. From the beginning of 2023  L&T will be responsible for the intermediate storage of plastic packaging waste as well as its collection and transport to Quantafuel ASA‚Äôs mechanical and chemical recycling plants in Denmark.During the period under review  the organisational structure and operating model were reformed by assigning more commercial responsibility to the local organisation. Environmental responsibility management and consulting organisation grew  and its competencies were expanded.The ERP system and related information system renewal programme continued in the division and progressed to the implementation stage. The system is scheduled to enter the deployment stage in the first half of 2024. The total investment in the system projects under the programme is estimated at approximately EUR 16.9 million  of which approximately EUR 6.2 million were realised by the end of 2022  with expenses of EUR 1.3 million recognised in 2022.Due to the reform of the Waste Act in 2021  direct customer agreements with housing properties were transferred to municipal operators during the period under review  but the impact of these changes on net sales was compensated for by growth in the corporate customer segment.The prices of recycled raw materials increased in the first half of the year. The prices of recycled raw materials subsequently stabilised and  in the case of certain fractions  began to decrease in the latter half of the year. The market prices of recycled cardboard and paperboard falling to less than half of the level seen in the early part of the year was particularly reflected in the net sales of the Environmental Services division. The reduced level of activity in the construction industry was also reflected in declining volumes towards the end of the year.Fuel prices rose sharply at the end of February due to the war in Ukraine. The higher fuel costs were successfully passed on to customer prices through cost increases carried out in February‚ÄìApril.The merger of the Environmental Services division‚Äôs renewable energy sources business with Neova Oy‚Äôs corresponding business was approved by the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority  and the joint venture Laania Oy became operational on 1 July 2022. In the first half of the year  the net sales of the renewable energy sources business amounted to EUR 35.4 million  and the operating profit was EUR 0.3 million. In the financial year 2021  the net sales of the renewable energy sources business totalled EUR 56.9 million  and the operating profit was EUR 0.9 million. The business is no longer reported as part of the Environmental Services division after the second quarter of 2022. The net profit of the joint venture is consolidated in one line item under operating profit.Industrial ServicesOctober‚ÄìDecemberThe division‚Äôs net sales for the final quarter grew to EUR 36.3 million (28.7). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 3.1 million (1.7). Operating profit was EUR 2.3 million (1.7). Operating profit was reduced by a change of EUR 0.8 million in the fair value of the deferred consideration related to the acquisition of Sand & Vattenbl√§st i Tyringe AB (‚ÄúSVB‚Äù) recognised in the final quarter of 2022  due to the positive development of the acquired company‚Äôs business.Year 2022The full-year net sales of the Industrial Services division grew to EUR 132.0 million (105.1). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 13.6 million (9.2). Operating profit was EUR 12.7 million (9.2). Operating profit was reduced by a change of EUR 0.8 million in the fair value of the deferred consideration related to the acquisition of Sand & Vattenbl√§st i Tyringe AB (‚ÄúSVB‚Äù) recognised in the final quarter of 2022  due to the positive development of the acquired company‚Äôs business.The Industrial Services division strengthened its position in hazardous and non-hazardous waste recycling services during the period under review by acquiring Fortum‚Äôs hazardous waste SME business in Finland at the beginning of February 2022. The takeover of the business acquired from Fortum went according to plan  and the demand for hazardous waste services was strong.In the environmental construction business line  several demanding industrial soil decontamination projects were carried out. At the beginning of the year  a new material treatment center started its operations in Pori  Finland. The plant focuses particularly on processing industrial side streams.In February  Industrial Services expanded into the Swedish process cleaning services market by acquiring 70% of the shares of Sand & Vattenbl√§st i Tyringe AB (‚ÄúSVB‚Äù)  a provider of process cleaning services in Sweden. Operating in southern Sweden  SVB had net sales of approximately EUR 10 million in the previous financial year and has approximately 60 employees. The integration of the Swedish business progressed according to plan  and several successful industrial water treatment projects were carried out in the process cleaning business in Sweden. In the process cleaning business in Finland  resource allocation for annual maintenance services was successful in spite of maintenance services originally scheduled for the early part of the year being postponed to the autumn due to the COVID-19 pandemic and labour action.Fuel prices rose sharply at the end of February due to the war in Ukraine. The higher fuel costs were  for the most part  passed on to customer prices through cost increases carried out in February‚ÄìApril.Facility Services FinlandOctober‚ÄìDecemberThe division‚Äôs net sales for the final quarter grew to EUR 64.6 million (63.0). Operating profit was EUR 0.8 million (0.6).Year 2022The full-year net sales of Facility Services Finland grew to EUR 256.3 million (243.1). Operating profit declined to EUR -0.5 million (1.8).Several significant new customer accounts were acquired and started in the cleaning business  and the demand for data-driven cleaning services increased. The demand for energy efficiency services increased during the review period.The COVID-19 pandemic and other respiratory infections significantly increased sickness-related absences in the first and fourth quarters  which increased production costs in all service branches  especially in cleaning. Production costs were increased by higher fuel prices and general cost inflation. The increased production costs could not be fully passed on to customer prices.In the cleaning business  the availability of labour declined and employee turnover increased significantly  which drove costs higher. Several new projects were launched to improve the availability of labour. Co-operation with municipal employment services and government organisations was intensified to ensure that jobs offered by L&T are better known by job seekers. L&T joined forces with Staffpoint to offer jobs to Ukrainian refugees. A group of workers from the Philippines was recruited for full-time cleaning work under contracts valid until further notice. The employees in question will start work in the first quarter of 2023.Measures were taken in Facility Services Finland to improve operational efficiency and profitability throughout the period under review. Local and business line-specific change negotiations were conducted in the division in the second half of the year  leading to the termination of employment for approximately 70 white-collar employees and approximately 30 employees.Facility Services SwedenOctober‚ÄìDecemberThe division‚Äôs net sales for the final quarter decreased to EUR 39.8 million (43.8). Operating profit declined to EUR 0.5 million (1.3). Operating profit before the amortisation of purchase price allocations of acquisitions was EUR 0.8 million (1.9).Year 2022Facility Services Sweden‚Äôs full-year net sales decreased to EUR 140.4 million (149.8). Operating profit declined to EUR 0.4 million (3.9). Operating profit before the amortisation of purchase price allocations of acquisitions was EUR 2.2 million (6.0).Production costs were increased by higher fuel prices and general cost inflation from February onwards. The COVID-19 pandemic increased sickness-related absences  particularly in the first quarter. Customer agreements in the Swedish business are mostly fixed-price contracts  and the increased production costs could not be passed on to customers in the form of price increases. The profit performance of Facility Services Sweden was lowered not only by inflation but also the weaker-than-expected sales of additional services. Adaptation measures were initiated in the division in the second quarter. The effort to simplify operating models and adapt them to the rapidly changing business environment will continue in 2023.FINANCINGIn 2022  cash flow from operating activities amounted to EUR 71.8 million (65.6). Net cash flow after investments came to EUR 41.1 million (1.7). Net cash flow from operating activities after investments was reduced by acquisitions  which had a total impact of approximately EUR 13 million (approximately EUR 23 million). Net cash flow after investments was increased by the repayment of a loan receivable of EUR 16.4 million by the joint venture in the final quarter of 2022. A total of EUR 6.2 million in working capital was committed (EUR 15.1 million committed).At the end of the financial year  interest-bearing liabilities amounted to EUR 216.8 million (195.6). Net interest-bearing liabilities totalled EUR 167.3 million (167.1). The average interest rate of long-term loans  excluding lease liabilities  with interest rate hedging  was 2.5% (1.1%). Of the company‚Äôs floating rate loans totalling EUR 50 million  EUR 30 million have been converted into fixed rate loans by means of an interest rate swap.The EUR 100.0 million commercial paper programme was unused at the end of the financial year as in the comparison period. The account limit totalling EUR 10.0 million as well as the committed credit limit totalling EUR 40.0 million were not in use  as was the case in the comparison period. The Group signed a credit limit linked to responsibility targets in May 2022. The credit limit will mature in the first quarter of 2025. The company issued senior unsecured sustainability-linked notes in the amount of EUR 75 million in May. The new notes will mature in the second quarter of 2028 and bear fixed annual interest at the rate of 3.375 per cent.Net financial expenses amounted to EUR -5.8 million (-3.3). The increase in net financial expenses was attributable to higher interest-bearing liabilities due to acquisitions  an expense of EUR 0.3 million associated with the redemption of a bond  and the higher general interest rate level. The effect of exchange rate changes on net financial expenses was EUR -0.2 million (0.3). Net financial expenses were 0.7% (0.4%) of net sales.The equity ratio was 34.3% (34.2%) and the gearing ratio was 75.9% (79.4%). The Group‚Äôs total equity was EUR 220.4 million (210.4). Translation differences caused by the depreciation of the Swedish krona affected equity by EUR -5.6 million and changes in the fair value of hedging instruments by EUR 1.3 million. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period amounted to EUR 49.5 million (28.6). Overdue trade receivables and credit losses have not increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or the war in Ukraine.DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETSThe Annual General Meeting held on 17 March 2022 resolved that a dividend of EUR 0.46 per share  totalling EUR 17.5 million  be paid on the basis of the balance sheet that was adopted for the financial year 2021. The dividend was paid to shareholders on 28 March 2022.CAPITAL EXPENDITUREGross capital expenditure for 2022 came to EUR 58.2 million (72.3). Acquisitions accounted for approximately EUR 21 million of the capital expenditure (approximately EUR 31 million). In addition  the costs of internal work related to information system investments increased significantly compared to 2021. Other capital expenditure consisted primarily of machine and equipment purchases  as well as investments in information systems and buildings.SUSTAINABILITYEnvironmental responsibilityClimate benefits for customers created by L&T2022 2021 Target Target to be achieved by Carbon handprint (tCO 2 e)534 5001 100 000 growth faster than net salesThe carbon handprint illustrates the climate benefits of a product  process or service  i.e. the emission reduction potential for the user. L&T‚Äôs carbon handprint reduces the customer‚Äôs carbon footprint. Our services generated emission reductions for customers through  for example  customers replacing virgin raw materials with secondary raw materials  and fossil fuels with biofuels and solid recovered fuels.The carbon handprint of the renewable energy sources business is no longer reported as part of L&T‚Äôs carbon handprint in 2022. In 2021  L&T‚Äôs total carbon handprint excluding renewable energy sources was 528 000 tCO 2 e.Recycling rate and material recovery2022 2021 Target Target to be achieved by Recycling rate of material flows managed by L&T  % 59.4 58.4 65 2026The recycling rate is the weighted average of our customers‚Äô recycling rates. It also includes materials that cannot yet be recycled. To increase our reuse and recycling rate  we actively look for new material streams whose refining rate we can increase. Reporting covers municipal waste collected from corporate customers  hazardous waste  industrial waste and construction waste in Finland. Slurry  contaminated soil and ash are excluded from reporting.Progress towards science-based emission reduction targets  using 2018 as the baseline2022 2021 Target Target to be achieved by Carbon footprint (tCO 2 e)31 70037 800Carbon footprint intensity (gCO 2 e/km)6467674762030L&T‚Äôs strategic objective is to halve the carbon footprint of its operations by 2030  using 2018 as the baseline  and to reduce the indirect emissions generated by its supply chain. The emission reduction target set by L&T has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. The achievement of this objective will be promoted by switching to zero-emission transport technologies and fuels and by opting for renewable energy at L&T‚Äôs properties. Transport operations account for 95 per cent of the emissions generated by L&T‚Äôs own operations.The fuel distribution obligation was adjusted in 2022 by reducing the biofuel component by 7.5 per cent in July. This change has not been taken into account in the emissions calculations reported in the financial statements release  as Statistics Finland has yet to update its fuel classification data in accordance with the change. Statistics Finland is expected to publish updated fuel classification data during spring 2023. L&T will subsequently calculate and report its carbon dioxide emissions for 2022 on its website using the updated emission factors. The total emissions of L&T‚Äôs own operations for 2022  calculated with the updated emission factors  are likely to be higher than those reported here.Social responsibilityOverall accident frequency2022 2021 Target Target to be achieved byOverall accident frequency (TRIF)2324192026L&T eliminates hazards and improves its own safety as well as the safety of customers and other stakeholders through effective proactive measures  such as risk assessments  safety observations  Safety Walks and occupational safety sessions.Well-being at work2022 2021 Target Target to be achieved by Occupational health rate (proportion of employees with no sickness-related absences)404557 2026Sickness-related absences (%)5.65.04.32026The objective of L&T‚Äôs personnel policies and plans is to ensure that the number  competence and retention of personnel are at the level required for effective performance.

The aim of the new plans is to align the objectives of the company  shareholders and key employees in order to increase the value of the company in the long term  to retain the key employees at the company and to offer them competitive reward plans that are based on earning and accumulating the company‚Äôs shares as well as on appreciation of the share price. The Performance Share Plan 2023‚Äì2027 comprises three (3) three-year (3) performance periods covering the calendar years 2023‚Äì2025  2024‚Äì2026 and 2025‚Äì2027.During the performance period 2023‚Äì2025  the earning of rewards is based on the following performance criteria: return on capital employed (ROCE)  total shareholder return (TSR) and reduction of the carbon footprint (ESG).The target group of the Performance Share Plan during the performance period 2023‚Äì2025 consists of approximately 50 key employees  including the Group‚Äôs President and CEO and the Group Executive Board.The transitional share-based incentive scheme 2023‚Äì2026 consists of two (2) earnings periods of one (1) year each  corresponding to the calendar years 2023 and 2024.

Temporary additional costs arising from system deployments and establishing the operating model may weigh down the company‚Äôs result.Production costs may be increased by challenges related to employee turnover  labour availability and higher sickness rates.As the company has no operations or holdings in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine  and there are no significant Russian-owned companies in the customer base  the direct impacts of the war in Ukraine are expected to be minor. However  indirect impacts on overall economic activity in Finland and Sweden may have a negative impact on net sales and profit.More detailed information on Lassila & Tikanoja‚Äôs risks and risk management will be provided in the 2021 Annual Review and in the Report by the Board of Directors and the consolidated financial statements.PROPOSAL FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETSAccording to the financial statements  Lassila & Tikanoja plc‚Äôs unrestricted equity amounts to EUR 61 719 573.87  with the operating profit for the period representing EUR 11 946 564.10 of this total.

The figure‚Ä¶,"PARIS  Feb. 9  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- After posting good revenue figures for 4Q 2022  we are proud to say that Artprice by Artmarket has got off to a dynamic start to 2023 with January's turnover showing a 17% increase versus the year-earlier period.The figures show that since the start of 2023  Artmarket.com has been gaining market share with new customers despite the uncertain economic context stemming from very unpredictable geopolitical parameters and an inflationary dynamic that poses significant challenges for central banks  particularly for the ECB and the FED.Artprice took advantage of the Covid period to develop and deploy the most significant modification in its history  leading to a change in its business model with paying advertisers fully integrated into its databases and services. These advertisers are essentially the 6 500 Auction Houses around the world that have been affiliated with Artprice for more than two decades and today conduct 98% of their sales online.It is quite possible that the turnover generated by these 6 500 auction houses will ultimately generate more turnover than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice by Artmarket.com's turnover. By effectively responding to a long-standing request from its partner auction houses  Artprice believes it can double its turnover. A second major change in our business model relates to our decision to license our Standardized Database of Artists  today the most comprehensive in the world.Future events in 2023: annual licensing of Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists  with an entry price of ‚Ç¨7 500 per yearIn recent years  Artprice by Artmarket  which owns the largest known editorial collection of manuscripts and catalogs from 1700 to the present day (a current asset with an estimated value of ‚Ç¨16.257 million in Artprice by Artmarket.com's balance sheet)  has developed the most comprehensive database of artists in the world.At Artprice by Artmarket  we never forget that artists are what the art market revolves around; they are its primary and unique motor  and all the news  exhibitions  auctions  galleries  museums  biennials  fairs  and shows evolve around them. In short  none of it could exist without the artist.Each Artist page is created within the framework of a standardized editorial charter and a set of processes protected under France's Intellectual Property Laws  with a biography supported by certified documents from the artist and/or his/her beneficiaries that are deposited in Artprice's physical archives.Each analog/digital record has 140 referential integrity fields which are themselves relational databases.Each Artist page includes details about their various disciplines and artistic techniques  their past auction results (with photographs of the works)  their upcoming sales  their signatures and monograms  an indication of any catalog raisonn√© and/or reference work  their annual auction turnover  their auction records  the geographical distribution of their sales  their key market indices  their unsold rates  as well as all articles or dispatches from Artprice's press agency ""ArtMarket Insight"" written about the artist.This allows Artprice to attribute each artist with a dedicated ID (like a business identification code) and for each of his/her works  another specific ID (like a vehicle registration document) and to 'standardize' the art market to ensure reliable traceability  accurate indices  and comprehensive monitoring. These unique and rigorous processes are subject to multiple protection mechanisms under France's Intellectual Property Laws.A single Artist Log costs on average 270‚Ç¨ to 300‚Ç¨ to create  and  despite ultra-powerful computing  it requires human validation by a committee of editors and translation into the six languages of the Artprice databases  namely English  French  Spanish  German  Italian and Mandarin.In 25 years  the Artprice Artist Database has established itself as the leading standardized global database in terms of the number of artists it covers  but also in terms of the volume of information per Artist entry.To date  the only reference we have retained is the Benezit Dictionary  created in 1911 in Paris and which Artprice tried to acquire from √âditions Gr√ºnd in the early 2000s.At the time  Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists included 120 000 artists while the Benezit had 175 000. The latter was therefore the de facto global reference by its sheer number of artists. Despite a very substantial financial proposal from Artprice  the Benezit was finally sold to Oxford Art Online (see our registration document and financial report).In 2023  the online Benezit  in English  has 170 000 artists and a subscription entry cost of ¬£215 per year.Artprice's standardized artists' database now totals 803 000 artists from the 4th century to the present day  in six languages.The overall cost associated with successfully building the most comprehensive Standardized Database of Artists in the world also includes the cost of acquiring legendary companies and documentary collections such as the Enrique Mayer Guide (1962/1987)  the famous Dictionary of Art Sales by Doctor H. Mireur 1700-1900  the American leader Sound View Press with nearly 50 databases on the USA including the famous biographical collection Who Was Who in American Art (1991)  Editions Franck Van Wilder (1970)  the Swiss company Xylogic (world specialist in Art Market indices since 1985)  the Bayer Database on the Anglo-Saxon Art Market from 1700 to 1913  Signatures and Monogrammes by Caplan & Creps (USA)  a global reference work (1976)  and a whole host of other works and records.Indeed  over the past 25 years  we at Artprice have pursued a systematic policy of purchasing all manuscripts and catalogs  mainly from 1700 to 1970  from all over the world. The acquisition of this historical knowledge was an unavoidable process in ensuring that Artprice could standardize the art market with certainty and know the perfect traceability of works of art and their correct attributions.In the 20th century  the Benezit was the major reference  the Bible of the Art Market according to Le Monde newspaper. To date  it is the only serious financial and analytical referent for Artprice  notably because of its use of a comparative methodology.Nevertheless  the 803 000 artists in Artprice's Standardized Database represent a volume 472% greater than that of the Benezit Oxford University Press Dictionary (170 000 artists)  with access in six languages for Artprice compared with just one language for the Benezit.For Artprice  the total present-day cost in 2023 of building the most exhaustive database of artists in the world is 216 million euros (see paragraph on analytical cost). Despite being an asset in permanent growth  under International Financial Reporting Standards  the valuation of such a perennial asset is recognized in Artprice by Artmarket.com balance sheets at only a fraction of its real value (IFRS have been adopted since 2005 to harmonize the presentation of listed companies' financial and accounting statements).Indeed  the creation of the index for Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists was an extremely complex operation involving seven million hours of work by historians  researchers  editors  journalists  econometricians  and a dedicated IT department over 25 years.Now that it exists  Artprice by Artmarket is constantly being asked for licenses to use its Standardized Database of Artists  mainly by the tens of thousands of online galleries  marketplaces  Auction Houses  Experts  online auction sites  copyright companies  customs  and tax authorities  museums foundations and insurance companies that operate in this segment  but without an exhaustive standardized database of artists.Many of these players are prone to making regular attribution errors - as they themselves admit - and for the small or recently established structures  their survival depends on access to a standardized and consistent Database of Artists over the centuries.One of the main difficulties is having  on the one hand  a massive collection of auction catalogs and manuscripts  and on the other hand  proprietary algorithms that can track down and identify the numerous homonyms that exist in the field of art.Indeed  art history is full of homonyms. One of the solutions was to link the name of the artist to his place of birth as well as his connection to an ethnic group or a family or a clan.After a global market study focusing mainly on incoming requests from future clients  we calculated that the entry price for a license to use the index of Artprice's Standardized Database of 803 000 Artists  will be around ‚Ç¨7 500 per year  i.e. a monthly charge of ‚Ç¨625  which makes this operating license very affordable for small or recently-established structures.Of course  this annual operating license ‚Äì limited to the Standardized Index of Artists  does not in any way compete with Artprice or its multiple databases  as is contractually agreed with the licensee. This operating license uses an Application Programming Interface (API) provided by Artprice to connect software (or a website) to Artprice's Standardized Database of Artists.If the licensee notices that its customers request  for example  the price of works for past or future sales  indices and statistics on an artist  monograms and signatures  or any other information held by Artprice's databases  it may ask the Artprice licensor for a return API (re-routing/affiliation contract) to Artprice's paid databases where the licensee receives between 5 and 20% commission depending on the turnover achieved with Artprice on an annual subscription contracted on Artprice by Artmarket payment platforms. This allows Artprice to collect ‚Ç¨7 500/year on the one hand  and on the other hand  to greatly increase its turnover via its many licensees.Future events HI 2023: at the beginning of March Artprice will deploy its most sophisticated version of Artprice.com that will  among other things  initiate a complete change in our business model. Henceforward  our website will integrate paid advertisers into our databases and services and our Artist pages and Web 3.0.At the beginning of March 2023  Artprice by Artmarket will deploy the latest and most sophisticated version of its website in response to the numerous requests from its customers  which reflects the growth and expansion of its digital footprints. After 18 months of development  partly extended by the Covid  this large-scale deployment will affect all of Artprice's databases and services.To develop this latest version of our website  Artprice by Artmarket submitted a call for tenders at the end of 2019 and finally selected a team of very qualified and passionate external consultants to conduct an analysis followed by the development of a complete overhaul of Artprice.com. The whole process was based on a solid 'user interface' (UI) and 'user experience' approach  which  as their labels suggest  means that our entire website has been redesigned with an acute focus on making it easier for the user.At its core  the new website will include a very substantial change in our business model  since paying advertisers will be fully integrated into our databases and services. These advertisers are mainly the 6 500 auction houses worldwide  affiliated with Artprice for more than two decades and which now conduct 98% of their sales online. They will now  in paying advertiser mode  be able to highlight their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  depending on the search criteria of Artprice's 7.2 million customers.It should be noted that for the past half a century  the economic models of auction houses have always allocated roughly 34% of their overall costs to advertising (usually announcing details of upcoming public sales)  regardless of the country they operate in or the size of the auction house.Since auctions are now 98% advertised online  the pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2023 to promote their sales for a fee has found its best response with this new deployment. Indeed  the auction houses now believe that their communication budgets for future sales (34% of their estimated value) must be focused online  rather than on the printed media.In the past Artprice always considered online advertising to be incompatible with its databases in terms of readability and reputation. We have therefore done everything we can to satisfy demand from the auction houses while maintaining Artprice's original DNA.On the new version of the site  the 6 500 auction houses will be able to merge into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket by advertising their future sales and pushing the ""followed"" artists selected by the 7.2 million Artprice customers and members (alerts by SMS  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  ""my artists"" page  etc.).Since 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population to facilitate development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable  and above all contextualized data.Indeed  Artprice by Artmarket's clients and members will intuitively dive into the heart of art market news and will be privileged players within a human and educational approach  which is often lacking in the world of GAFAs.Moreover  Artprice's essential and historic collaborations as World Leader in Art Market Information will become even more apparent in this new version  mainly via contributions from individual artists who have participated in this evolution.The auction houses that have been our historical partners are  of course  the other essential collaboration. Indeed  their interest in collaborating with Artprice can only increase as they highlight their future sales with discreet and effective prestige  which will ‚Äì in turn ‚Äì generate additional recurring income for Artprice via its proprietary Intranet (the primary working tool for auction houses for many years).It is quite possible that the advertising revenue generated by these 6 500 auction houses (affiliated with Artprice since 1997) will ultimately generate more income than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice's turnover. As mentioned earlier  Artprice has a clear ambition to double its turnover and  again  this initiative is a direct result of long-standing requests from our partner auction houses.In sum  after more than two years of R&D (extended by the Covid crisis)  Artprice by Artmarket is proud to be able fully to engage Artmarket.com customers  partners  and members in a new experience at the heart of the art market.This is undoubtedly one of the founding stones for the future of Artprice by Artmarket  with a fundamentally improved positioning via the referencing of images on search engines  the objective of increasing traffic to conquer new market share and to corner the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs.Thanks to Google Analytics 4  the latest generation of Analytics  the ""Crawl budget""  a combination of Google's ""crawl rate"" and ""crawl demand""  increased from 915 000 requests/day to a new average of 2.5 million/day since the deployment of Artprice's 803 000 Artist homepages at the end of 2022.Through this deployment  Artprice has not only remained faithful to its principle of maintaining the readability of its databases but has also responded (at last) to the continual requests from its 6 500 affiliated Auction Houses around the world to have access to paid advertisements to enhance their future sales.Since January 2023  a complete UI//UX overhaul of Artists P ages and our Web 3.0/Art NFTs allowed greater global visibility for the 803 000 artists on Artprice by Artmarket.Artmarket.com has implemented a substantial tariff increase for its subscriptions and services since the beginning of 2023. These increases will generate an increase in future income. Artmarket.com was already profitable for a decade  and the additional revenue will translate almost entirely into net income since we will still be below the ‚Ç¨90 million euros p.a. tax bracket.This tariff increase follows extensive consultation with Artprice by Artmarket customers who will continue to benefit from our databases and services  well aware that they find essential data in Artprice that they cannot find elsewhere. Enriched by over a million ultra-qualified new data every year  our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997  must now be properly and systematically monetized.Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most exhaustive in the world and this is recognized by a broad consensus of art market operators. It covers nearly 803 000 artists  all referenced with their biographies  auction results  market indices  decision-making help tools  signatures & monograms  and future sales  alongside historical information and contemporary  cultural  and market news. In total  our databases contain several tens of millions of data inputs and their combination and exploitation by our teams means that the sum of the parts is infinitely more valuable  and the whole system is protected by various intellectual property rights.Despite this substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best value compared to the offer by our competitors who have not managed to evolve and offer subscriptions with limited searches: annual professional subscriptions from the competition for 150 searches ‚Ç¨350/year  or 450 searches ‚Ç¨975/year  and  in the event of an overrun  ‚Ç¨2.45/request (as noted by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In a world of ""unlimited"" offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competition's offer is based on data of only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 803 000 artists and 6 500 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from ‚Ç¨279 to ‚Ç¨569/year  including a range of indices  decision-making tools  and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world. Indeed  Artprice would still be very competitive at substantially higher prices.Surprisingly ‚Äì given the geopolitical and economic context ‚Äì the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods during recent sales sessions  regardless of the country. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023  which are the main indicators of the art market's health.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100¬© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market. For information  the Artprice100¬© index has increased by 612% since 2000. For the year 2022  the S&P index posted a contraction of -19% versus +3% for the Artprice100¬©.In our upcoming Global Art Market Report  we plan to present a truly global analysis of the art market's activities in 2022. This report is scheduled for publication in early March 2023. It will be available free of charge online and in PDF version. The AFP will publish it first.It is clear that war in Eastern Europe and the fears of a global recession have not depressed the art market at the start of this year.At the end of 2022  the AFP posted an article with the evocative title ""The collection of Microsoft co-founder aims for a billion-dollar auction total in New York"" and added ""With the late Paul G Allen's collection  Christie's is aiming for a historic art auction record  symbol of a market that is surging ahead despite a world shaken by crises.""Our new version of Artists Homepages bolsters the primary and preferred entry points to all of Artprice's databases and services because artists are indeed the foundation on which the art market has been based since its origin. With this major overhaul  Artprice also aims to reposition artists at the heart of the art market via the production of Art NFTs  which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.The major overhaul of Artprice.com aims to provide its customers and members with a better experience  more in line with their needs. It has been implemented after several years of collecting and analyzing their needs in strict compliance with the legislation in force in Europe and the USA.The overhaul naturally integrates the arrival of Art NFTs  whose growth is exponential and which also constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's principal market-makers  including the majority of the auction houses around the world  now have NFT departments for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum industry and art galleries sphere are starting to publish their own NFTs.In addition  the major overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com finally highlights the largest proprietary collection of original manuscripts and sales catalogs printed since 1700. Owned and collected by Artprice over the last three decades  this collection acts as the fundamental core of Artprice's digital standardization of the art market and legitimizes its position as Global Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years.After the overhaul of our Artists Homepages  Artprice customers and prospects will have access to several centuries of knowledge organized over 25 years by Artprice's historians and editors. Access to this historical information has been structured in a perfectly intuitive and natural way so that users can immerse themselves in the exceptional and complex history of the art market.These new pages highlight the wealth and depth of Artmarket.com's databases and services  offering a high level of added value. The use of algorithmic AI allows access to highly relevant and personalized recommendations  allowing users to deepen their knowledge of the art market and ultimately generating more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore greater business revenue.This feature also brings Artprice by Artmarket clients and members fully into the Web 3.0 and Art NFTs sphere  giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.Ahead of our major rollout in December 2022  Artprice has listened carefully to both its historical customers and its new customers and prospects.Indeed  with cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. Accustomed to speculation and risk-taking  art enthusiasts and collectors nonetheless  have no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe.Having frequently used the services of Artprice  they have become new clients for Artmarket.com  but they made it clear they needed art prices to be added in both ETH and BTC throughout the entire Artprice databases. This major addition to our platform was completed at the end of 2022.The ultra-targeted digital campaigns on Twitter demonstrate through their returns (3 to 5%) that these new buyers respond with high-end Artprice subscriptions.In addition  Artmarket.com is pleased to have given historical preference to Ethereum which  via an operation baptized ""The Merge"" on 15 September 2022  converted in entire blockchain from a Proof-of-work (PoW) type consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) type mechanism to move to a more environmentally friendly system.According to the Ethereum Foundation  this move was followed by an immediate drop in the total energy consumption of the Ethereum network by 99.9%.Thus  to foster the exchange and sale of Art NFTs on its Marketplace  and given the energy context  Artprice's choice for the Ethereum blockchain is fully in line with the ambitions expressed by France's Minister for the Economy  Bruno Le Maire  as announced in a previous press release:www.actusnews.com/fr/artmarket/cp/2022/10/20/artmarket_com-deja-positionnee-sur-les-nfts-avec-artprice-reagit-a-l_itw-de-bruno-le-maire-donnee-a-bfm-crypto-voulant-faire-deThis week  the French-language weekly business magazine has headlined its February issue (772) with the following title: ""What if Ethereum had the keys to blockchain success? Experiencing rapid growth  the decentralized cryptocurrency platform presents itself as one of the ""green"" options in the sector. A strategy that is convincing more and more investors and institutions"".thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com emphasizes: ""In its various annual reports on the Art Market and its regulated information it publishes as a listed company  Artprice by Artmarket.com has always said concerning NFTs that it is impossible to apprehend this new market without a perfect knowledge of the relevant Monetary & Financial Codes and Intellectual Property Codes of the countries in which the market is operating. Similarly  to appreciate the nature of this market (experiencing exponential growth)  one also needs a true understanding of Blockchain  cryptocurrencies  and their cultural origins among the Cypherpunks (period of PGP-type data encryption at the beginning of 1990)""These regulations have been the subject of studies  colloquia  and proposals to major French and European government bodies by Blanche Sousi and the Art & Law Institute  with whom Artprice by Artmarket has been heavily involved as a long-standing member since 1997.2023: more than ever  Artprice's eco-responsible philosophy must set an example in the world of data centers.According to thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice:""Artprice by Artmarket.com has patiently and methodically given itself all the means to evolve in response to the needs of Art Market professionals. All the indicators are positive for the future and we project a doubling of revenue  notably by opening up to paying advertisers integrated into our services and databasesWe have also developed  since 2017  processes to optimize the use of our servers  by limiting the power required and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers by 40%. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energiesThrough its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies concerning new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ""formativity"" (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a 'climatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Server Group  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and which is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture  and the sentiments of our customers.Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

18077,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,http://www.adexchanger.com/ad-exchange-news/big-village-and-emx-file-for-bankruptcy/,Big Village And EMX File For Bankruptcy,Digital ad marketplace EMX (ENGINE Media Exchange)  ad agency Trailer Park Group and their New York-based parent company  Big Village  have filed for bankruptcy.The post Big Village And EMX File For Bankruptcy appeared first on AdExchanger.,Digital ad marketplace EMX (ENGINE Media Exchange) and its New York-based parent company  Big Village  have filed for bankruptcy.Big Village filed a Chapter 11 petition alongside its affiliate  EMX Digital Inc. on Wednesday.AdExchanger has learned that EMX shut down most operations and let go almost all of its employees as of Thursday  according to a source familiar with the matter who asked to remain anonymous.A small skeleton crew remains employed at EMX  but it is unclear whether the company will continue business in some capacity as it navigates through the bankruptcy process.EMX failed to pay its publisher partners  possibly as far back as January 2022  the source said.

At this time  all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. And the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation.Let me now turn the floor over to Mr. Jan Strecker.Jan StreckerWelcome  ladies and gentlemen  and thank you for joining us today to go through our preliminary 2022 results  as well as the outlook for 2023.With me are Theodor Weimer  Chief Executive Officer; and Gregor Pottmeyer  Chief Financial Officer. Theodor and Gregor will take you through the presentation. And afterwards  we will be happy to take your questions. The link to the presentation material for this call has been sent out via e-mail and they can also be downloaded from the Investor Relations section of our website. As usual  this conference call is recorded and will be available for replay afterwards.With this  let me now hand over to you  Theodor.Theodor WeimerThank you  Jan. Also welcome from my side  ladies and gentlemen. Let me start the call today with a review of the exceptional development of the year 2022. We did not only significantly overachieve our original guidance for the year  but reached already the targets we have set ourselves for this year and our Compass 2023 strategic plan.The year turned out to be quite different from what we had initially expected. Our expectation was for continued growth out of own efforts by addressing the secular trends in our industry. So steady steps towards our mid-term goals. At least it was the plan. But reality was different. Initially  it was to market volatility in the context of the terrible war in Ukraine. Throughout the year  we then saw the corresponding implications on European energy markets. And finally  spiking inflation rates have resulted in swift actions by central banks around the globe and significantly increasing interest rates.In this environment  characterized by uncertainty  we are a trusted and reliable party for our clients to manage and hedge their exposures. This has resulted in  by far  the highest level of cyclical growth we have seen in a long time. Cyclical net revenue growth contributed 14 percentage points out of the overall net revenue growth of 24%. But it was also very encouraging to see the continued secular net revenue growth  which amounted to 7%. This is really the result of the many initiatives to win new clients and market share  as well as introducing new products and services over the last couple of years.The development in 2022 also underscores the quality of our business portfolio. The strong results are not just driven by single businesses  but by double-digit net revenue growth in almost all business lines. Since the development in 2022 by far exceeded our initial expectations  we revised our initial guidance of around EUR3.8 billion upwards throughout the year and have now also exceeded the last guidance of more than EUR4.1 billion by a clear margin.The implementation of our Compass 2023 strategic plan has further improved our position and potential for ongoing sustainable growth as you can see on page two of our presentation. Consistent secular net revenue growth with a 6% CAGR  since 2019 has become the key pillar of our growth strategy. And most importantly  we have achieved this in all different kinds of market environments.We have successfully executed and integrated our M&A initiatives since 2019  and we see further opportunities in the pipeline. This has made M&A a reliable addition to our organic growth aspirations. M&A has helped to strengthen our proposition in Data & Analytics and position us as one of the top three global ESG data providers. This has also led to an increase of the share of recurring revenues to around 60%.Tokenization and digitization are very important trends for us. And we started to lay the foundation to expand into new asset classes and service offerings with a number of different initiatives. This will be accelerated by the strategic partnership with Google Cloud that we announced today.In terms of the financial progress of Compass 2023 on page three  it is fair to say that we achieved our financial targets already one year earlier than planned. As you will recall  our target was to grow net revenues and EBITDA at 10% CAGR between 2019 and 2023. But so far  the actual net revenue growth amounted to 14% CAGR and the EBITDA growth to 15% CAGR even.In terms of the different growth components  stronger-than-expected secular growth compensated to slightly lower contribution from M&A  and cyclicality became a significant tailwind we previously did not expect. As a result  we already achieved the EUR4.3 billion net revenue last year  which we had originally targeted for 2023.With that  let me hand over to you  Gregor.Gregor PottmeyerThank you  Theodor. On page four  we show the details of the preliminary results for the full-year. The financial performance throughout the year was very positive with the fourth quarter even being the strongest one from a net revenue perspective. The main drivers for the strong performance shifted somewhat during the year. In the first half  the development was driven more by market volatility  whereas in the second half  we saw increasing benefits from higher interest rates.The operating cost development during the full-year  you see on page five  has been stronger compared to our initial expectation. But we think this was due to a combination of factors that was very specific to 2022. Firstly  M&A effects contributed 4% to cost growth. They were still mainly driven by the ISS acquisition in 2021. Secondly  the FX effect from the stronger U.S. dollar resulted in a 3% operating cost increase. But at the same time  this FX effect was also beneficial to the net revenue development  particularly in Data & Analytics. This brings us to the more meaningful constant currency organic operating cost growth of 10%.On the one hand  it was driven by inflationary effects from building operations  general purchasing and higher staff costs. On the other hand  we had to continue to increase the provisions for variable and share-based compensation in light of the favorable financial development and relative share price performance. In addition  we saw higher IT and growth investments  as well as higher travel and marketing costs  compared to the depressed situation in 2021 resulting from the pandemic.This brings me to the details of the fourth quarter results on page six of the presentation. While the secular growth developed broadly in line with our expectations  cyclical tailwinds remained very strong. The cyclical growth was driven  in particular  by further increasing interest rates and the continued high levels of collaterals in our clearing houses.The M&A effects  again  had minor impact in the fourth quarter  since they were only driven by some of the smaller  more recent acquisitions. The explanation I just provided on the operating cost development for the full-year  you can generally also be applied to the fourth quarter. While the M&A impact on the operating cost has become smaller  compared to the previous quarters  the impact from the stronger U.S. dollar continued to be quite meaningful.The constant currency organic operating cost growth again  was mainly driven by inflation. This item also includes the inflation compensation bonus we paid across the group in December  amounting to around EUR20 million. The aim was to bring some of the inflationary pressure forward into 2022.The EBITDA in the fourth quarter included a negative result from financial investments  which is mainly an FX effect on the valuation of Clarity AI  compared to the third quarter and lower valuation of some of the fintech funds. Depreciation and amortization included one-off effect from smaller software impairments. And the financial result included a positive FX effect.I'm now turning to the quarterly results of the segments  starting with Data & Analytics on page seven. We continue to see very good organic net revenue growth in the segment. This was mainly driven by the continuing trend towards ESG  which resulted in higher demand for our products and services. Analytics net revenue was stronger  compared to the preceding quarters. But in Q4 ‚Äô21  we had much higher point-in-time revenues from new client contracts. The other line  which is mainly the ISS Market Intelligence business  still included some inorganic growth from the acquisition of Discovery Data.Index includes around EUR20 million relating to a volume-based license fee reimbursement from Eurex. This is a large number because it was applied retrospectively for ‚Äò21 and ‚Äò22. You can see the corresponding volume-related costs in index derivatives net revenue in the Trading & Clearing segment. So it's almost neutral from the group's perspective. Most of our direct U.S. dollar exposure is in the Data & Analytics segment  from the ISS and Axioma subsidiaries. But the constant currency net revenue growth in the fourth quarter was still very strong with around 16%.Let me turn to slide eight  the Trading & Clearing segment. We saw some normalization of market volatility in the fourth quarter. However  hedging needs in asset classes  like fixed income  gas and foreign exchange continue to be high. In financial derivatives at Eurex  the improving equity market condition resulted in some decline of demand for index derivatives. But interest rate derivatives and the OTC clearing continued to perform well. In addition  collateral levels in the clearinghouse continue to be on an elevated level  broadly in line with the third quarter.In commodities  we achieved another record quarter  because of the increased trading and hedging needs of our clients in gas products and due to the higher margin fees. While the power trading activity has somewhat recovered  compared to the second and third quarter  the high margin requirements are still a burn for our clients. In January this year  we have seen collateral levels coming down quite meaningfully. This should generally be good for volumes  in particular  in power derivatives.In the cash equity business  we continue to see headwinds from elevated levels of retail participation in 2021 and lower equity market volatility towards the end of last year  but market share levels have started to recover since December. As a result of higher currency volatility  the demand for our FX products continue to be elevated  and we again  achieved a very strong quarter.In the Fund Services segment on page nine  the continued onboarding of new clients and funds more or less offset the cyclical headwinds from the market performance compared to the very strong equity market at the end of 2021. In addition  we saw the inorganic contribution of the Kneip acquisition  which was closed at the end of March. In the operating expense base of the segment  we saw a few bigger effects in the quarter. They related to the integration of Kneip and the carve-out of the Fund Services business from Clearstream  which will be completed in 2023.Our Securities Services segment on slide 10  saw a significant acceleration of growth in the fourth quarter. Headwinds from equity market performance and lower retail participation were overcompensated by solid levels of fixed income issuance activity  some effects on assets under custody denominated in U.S. dollar and the collateral management business with a growth of more than 30%. In addition  the net interest income has increased almost ten-fold compared to last year. This was driven by much higher U.S. interest rates and increasing European interest rates. Furthermore  the cash balances have continue to increase compared to the preceding quarters.This brings me to our dividend proposal for 2022 on page 11. Our proposal combines an increase of the dividend by 13% to EUR3.60  with a further reduction of the payout ratio. We are planning to reinvest the remaining recurring free cash into the business to support our M&A strategy and thus  further improve our secular and recurring growth components.With that  let me hand back to you  Theodor  to present our outlook for 2023.Theodor WeimerThank you  Gregor. Despite an extremely strong year 2022  we expect to achieve further growth in 2023 as well. We expect the secular trends  like the move from OTC to on-exchange trend towards passive investing  or higher demand for it‚Äôs cheaper [Indiscernible] outsourcing the funds industry to continue to support our organic growth. Our diversified business model and a track record over the years gives us a lot of confidence that we will continue to deliver on the secular side of the equation.With regard to the potential cyclical development  the net interest income in Security Services is clearly expected to continue to grow quite substantially  but the comparables in Trading & Clearing are generally high  and volume and volatility patterns might be somewhat different this year. Who knows? We continue to expect to complement organic growth with M&A  and the environment has also improved slightly over the last couple of quarters. But at the same time  we are patient when it comes to finding the best solutions with regards to strategic fit and financial terms.We will manage operating costs effectively  depending on the net revenue development and thus  have some flexibility to offset potential cyclical headwinds. We will continue to invest in new technologies to improve our operating efficiency and tap into new revenue opportunities in the longer-term. We have already set new standards with our multi-cloud strategy that we started a couple of years ago. Already around 35% of our IT operations today are running in the public cloud.As we announced this morning  we have entered into a 10-year strategic partnership with Google Cloud. Google Cloud will be our preferred partner to enhance and economize our cloud adoption. We are targeting a public cloud exposure of around 70%  7-0 percent  over time. In addition  we will be launching joint projects to accelerate the development of new and innovative platforms. Examples are the acceleration of the development of our digital securities platform D7  for post-trading and the joint buildup of a completely new digital-as-a-platform for new asset classes. So we'll cover both the securities part as well as the new asset class part.Information Technology is at the core of our DNA  and to not only meet  but anticipate customer demand is key for us. But to be very clear  our core infrastructure is state-of-the-art and not affected by the partnership. And our cooperations  especially low latency trading and clearing systems will remain on-premise.In terms of effective steering  we will maintain an active portfolio management  a great further strategic optionality. One example is the new organizational setup of securities and Fund Services that will be completed this year. Overall  we are targeting net revenue of between EUR4.5 billion and EUR4.7 billion and EBITDA of between EUR2.6 billion and EUR2.8 billion for 2023. Our guidance is mainly based on continued secular growth. The range reflects different potential cyclical scenarios  including market volatility and interest rates against high comparables.Since we achieved our Compass 2023 goals already last year  we have already kicked off and started working on a new strategic plan. We plan to present our thoughts on the evaluation of our strategy at the Investor Day this year  which is scheduled for June 28. We are looking forward to welcome many of you here in Frankfurt.This concludes our presentation. We are now looking forward to your questions. Thank you.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] And first up is Haley Tam from Credit Suisse. Over to you.Haley TamHello. Thank you very much for taking my question and congratulations on a strong set of results. Can I ask a question about the 2023 revenue and EBITDA guidance you've given us? It is very clear that you've tried to think about the cyclical scenarios  as well as the secular growth? But could you help us understand the parameters of that guidance. So for example  what assumptions you might have made regarding Clearstream collateral balances for the Fed fund ECB rate pathways and the likelihood of any sharing of net interest income uplift with your users? Thank you very much.Gregor PottmeyerYes. Thanks  Haley. Obviously  for this question  everybody's interested in what are the parameters for our guidance  right? So to say it's quite simple  right? So the midpoint is roughly a 6% increase  so the EUR4.6 billion  compared to 2022. And that's basically exactly the secular growth component we expect  so that is the very easy answer.To go into the next level  there will be most probably pluses and minus from a cyclical aspect. So a big plus  obviously  we will see on our NII specifically or Clearstream  obviously. But there are some questions or the potential minus on the Trading & Clearing as we had highest volatility levels in 2022. So with volatility levels of 25 to 30  and so the current level is roughly 20. So obviously  that's less compared to last year. So most probably that will balance out from our perspective and what we basically include in our guidance.With regard to the customer cash balances  as you explicitly mentioned that for the NII calculation at Clearstream. So the good thing is that the cash balances did not reduce so far. It's still in the EUR18 billion level  and that's obviously good to see. And indeed  in our forecasting  we had assumed that the cash balances would go down a little bit  right? So this did not happen so far. That's obviously good.But doing now this forecasting  we still assume with this increased rates  and rates will continue to increase following the Fed announcement and the ECB announcement  right? There will be pressure from a customer perspective to  on the one hand side  potentially reduce the customer cash balances. On the other hand side  to -- that we share some of the revenues. Therefore  we did roughly a 20% discount in our calculation.OperatorSo now we're coming to the next questionnaire  who is Andrew Coombs from Citi.Andrew CoombsGood morning. Thank you for that. If I turn to Eurex  interested in your thoughts on the benefits from the recent repricing initiatives you've done from the 1st of January. I can see some of the pricing on the stock that's being on the future contracts. And in CME  in their recent results  they're talking about a 4% to 5% increase in aggregate. So anything you can say on pricing and what the implications are for Eurex revenues this year? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes. Thanks  Andrew. Obviously  you are perfectly right. And it's public knowledge  obviously  that we increased pricing at our Eurex product  beginning from January 1. So the impact on the Eurex revenue is roughly 3%  right? So that's obviously much more what we usually do. So our guidance overall is roughly some 1% price increase in average for Deutsche Borse group level  right?So -- and now this Eurex increase is quite close to the 1% on group level. But we use  obviously  the timing and the high inflation from 2022. And obviously  it does not disappear in 2023. So it was reasonable for us to do a little bit more  compared to things we did in the past but we do it always with market consultation. And so far  this price increase was accepted by market participants.Andrew CoombsThank you.OperatorNext up is Mike Werner from UBS.Mike WernerThank you very much for the opportunity to ask question. Just talking about the potential for M&A. Theodor  I think you mentioned in a couple  three or four months ago that from an M&A perspective  you were telling your team that you're going to hold off on doing new M&A. You thought prices  I think  were set to fall further. The bid ask spread  probably too narrow. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about M&A at the time right now? How does that bid-ask spread come in? And do you see a lot of opportunities? Are you getting a lot of incomings from potential targets? Thank you.Theodor WeimerThank you  Mike  for the question. Substantially  our stance hasn't changed dramatically to the last time we saw and the public multiples were coming down on the private side -- private capital side. We see lots of interest to talk  because people still believe they can sell off their assets at a very high multiple. And of course  people need to understand that the weighted average cost of capital has significantly increase. And therefore  we all play this in the discussions.But to be very clear  we see continued inbound calls. We have certain criteria  which we need to fulfill  right? And we are also very  very careful  right  to look into the potential acquisition targets from a very balanced point of view  strategically and financially balanced. What do I mean by this? It's very clear  our margin perfectly  EBITDA margin  which is fortunately extremely high  and we will continue to keep high margins  right? That is actually a promise on our side.On the other side  we want to grow. If you want to grow  you can grow organically or you can inorganically  leaving aside a cyclical part  right? And therefore  if you want to grow  and organically  if you want to go into deals  what we are potentially ready to do  then you have to take into consideration that whenever you do a deal  it will be per se and [Indiscernible] margin dilutive  right  margin dilutive  which is a big hurdle we have to overcome. So that is more expensive. Equity is anyway is expensive  right? And then you've got the margin dilution.Therefore  we are very careful  right  how to deal with such situations. And as I said this morning during the press conference of the presentation of the full-year numbers  for me  as soon as we are getting into larger deals or potentially larger deals  right  since the effect is so big on the financials  I need to get into -- we need to get into situations where the synergy potential is pretty high  right? That is how we approach the situation.And last but not least  right? We are completely agnostic  right? Don't get us wrong  right? We think we can go for M&A  but we are not desperate  right? And if we compare at the end of the day  right  M&A deals towards other alternatives  right  and there's a full spectrum  M&A on the one hand side  the other hand side is  I would say  share buybacks  right? So we take it completely agnostic. We want to do the best for the investors. That's our determination.Mike WernerAnd just a quick follow-up  if you don't mind. Your weighted average cost of capital internally  what is it for you guys now? And how does that compare to  let's say  back in 2021?Gregor PottmeyerYes  Mike  obviously  our WACC increased as it increased for the whole industry due to the increase. And it depends  obviously  the WACC we take  when we do for M&A  depends in which business we invest in which region  in which maturity level  right? So it's different overall. On group level  our WACC is roughly 7%.Mike WernerThank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank.Benjamin GoyYes  hi. Good afternoon. One question on ISS  please. I was wondering on the number of covered corporates  what are the plans for '23 and how this could impact the client acquisition going forward? Thank you.Theodor WeimerWe didn't quite catch it. So you mean the number of clients at ISSBenjamin GoyI noted the number of covered corporate. So will you have a...Gregor PottmeyerI understand. Okay. Now  I got it. Sorry  Benjamin. Yes  we make good progress  right? So the number increased from roughly 7 000 to 7 800  right  as we hired 100 analyst research guys in Manila. And so far  we made good progress  but we are still not there where we want to be  right? So we still need  let's say  another 800 to cover the full spectrum  what is needed  right? And therefore  we are still working on this topic in ‚Äò23 as a high priority for us. The latest  end of 2023  we have all the capabilities at our hands so that we cover our customer needs. And then we have much better opportunities to increase our market share here.With regard to the quality  customers are very satisfied  are happy with our ratings. They are even better  the quality  compared to our competitors. And so  if you have catched-up here on the number of corporate rating  I think we are very well positioned to gain additional market share.Benjamin GoyThank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Tom Mills from Jefferies.Tom MillsHi  good afternoon. I had a quick question on your Fund Services business. Obviously  you alluded to the sort of step down in profitability that you saw in 4Q. Could you say perhaps how you might expect that profitability to be impacted throughout ‚Äò23 as you go through the remainder of the carve-out of that business? And will it take the whole sort of 12 months  do you think  to be done? And if you wanted to do M&A in this space  would it sort of require completion of that carve-out before you kind of consider doing it?Gregor PottmeyerYes  Tom. Good question with regard to our Fund Services business. And it's obviously that the profitability decreased in 2022  but there are good reason for that. So first  you are aware that we carve out basically the business out of the Clearstream overall organization  due to the fact that clients are different  processes are different  systems are different. So it makes us more focused and more agile.Secondly  we've got now a new banking license  right  for that kind of business to increase our product and offer spectrum. So that is obviously an important thing. Then thirdly  we are in the process to build up a new banking account system here. So having this banking license  also having a proper contract management system here in place. So that's the reason why 2022 and 2023 is elevated from a cost perspective.In addition  we acquired the Funds Data business or the Kneip business  what was not really profitable so far. So we do also here some restructuring and reorganization. And this will take also a little bit time. So overall  I expect 2023 also due to our project work that the cost will be on an increased level.But from a top line perspective  we are quite confident that we will come back to double-digit growth or even mid-teens growth in 2023 due to our strong pipeline  what we acquired and with all the signed contracts. So we really expect coming back in 2023 with double-digit growth here in our Fund Services business. And overall  the targeted EBITDA margin  including all costs will be in the range of 55%.Tom MillsAnd just on the M&A point there  does the sort of restructuring work over the course of ‚Äò23 prevent you from doing additional M&A?Theodor WeimerThank you  Tom  for the question  right? And it's good that you're insisting here. So from a CEO point of view  the following  right? Generally speaking  the carve-out process will not limit our ability  right? We are so far progressed that we could move ahead  right  with partnering. The idea of carving out the ISS business and the Clearstream business was  at the end of the day  to enhance our ability for strategic partnerships  right?And it is  at the end of the day  an optionality for us to do something. An optionality does not necessarily mean that we take -- that we go for the option  to be very clear. This has -- we have many others -- many other dimensions  which we needed to balance. It's a strategic balance. It's a financial capability. It's the other side as always. It's a strategic fit. It's the financial fit. And so for that  I don't want to go too much in detail.But I think at the end of the day  a key driver for this year or in this company is great optionality  don't let yourself -- don't get into a situation that you feel pushed to do an M&A deal. That's always the worst thing  what can happen. And therefore  we take this very calm. And we have -- and that's a good position. We have many optionalities on the table  right  be it strategically  be it financially  right? And at the end of the day  that is what we are doing here  and that is what we can share with you.Tom MillsThanks very much  Theodor and Gregor.OperatorNext up is Gregory Simpson from BNP Paribas Exane.Gregory SimpsonHi  thank you for taking my questions. And just would like to ask about the margin fees of Eurex and EEX  which has seen a lot of growth in 2022 due to cash flow levels. Can you help frame where collateral levels are right now versus peak? What could be sustainable levels? And linked to that  is there any feedback you're hearing from participants in the EEX now energy prices have fallen? Do you think volumes can kind of grow from here as people going to come back? Any color would be great.Gregor PottmeyerYes. Thanks  Gregory. So starting with EEX. So obviously  in 2022  we have seen highest volatility  so price increases of 10 times and even more. And as a result  we asked for high margins  right? So before the crisis  we had some EUR5 billion margins in our clearinghouse. And in peak times  we had even above EUR100 billion. So on average  it was roughly EUR50 billion in 2022. And now in January  it comes back to a level of a little bit above EUR20 billion. So that's the EUR20 billion we also assume as our base case assumption for us for the full year 2023.With regard to Eurex here  we have also seen increased volatility and increased margins  but there are different reasons for this increased margins. It's not just pure volatility. It's also due to our secular growth  specifically in our interest rate for business. So therefore  we do not expect that the margins will materially go down. I would assume a little bit go down  but not as significantly as -- at EEX.Gregory SimpsonThank you. Maybe just a quick follow-up  if that's okay. What's the amount of assets under administration on the fund distribution business? I think it was less about EUR400 billion. What are we today? And also the timing of the large client win  HSBC? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerSo the assets under management in our funds business is around EUR400 billion.Gregory SimpsonAnd in HSBC that is imminent or...Gregor PottmeyerThis will obviously increase with that level when it's finalized. So it's not included in that number. It will increase.Gregory SimpsonThank you.OperatorNext up is Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley.Bruce HamiltonHi  good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions  answer the presentation. Just going back to M&A. I mean  obviously  you're in quite a good position. Just to check  I think your net debt to EBITDA now is in the low 1s  around 1.2 or 1.3  if you could just confirm. And if you could remind us  I think when you consider deals and what the credit rating will sort of give flexibility for that would allow you to go to say sort of 2.5 times. I'm just trying to understand what the existing sort of flexibility is to do deals because it seems like there's quite a lot?And then in terms of the  I guess  within your strategic growth priorities and given what's happened to pricing  is there any particular area that's kind of looking more interesting as you sit here today  be it data  Fund Services  post trade or trading? Anything in terms of perhaps the skew of what's coming across in terms of incoming that might be interesting? Thanks.Theodor WeimerSo Bruce  thanks for your question. Starting with the first one. So indeed  our rating relevant KPIs net debt to EBITDA  decreased to 1.2. And I think you are aware that the threshold for AA rating is 1.75. So if you do the math  it's more than EUR1 billion  obviously  flexibility here.But I would like to comment a little bit more general on our financial flexibility. So for an M&A transaction  so the funding  the refinancing is not a limitation for Deutsche Borse. The reason for that is  okay  of course  today  we have some even more flexibility. Then our cash generation is very  very big and very quickly. Obviously  in 2022  we have some cash flow of more than EUR2 billion  right? So that's obviously big number. And here  you can see the financial power we can create out of our increased cash flow over time.Then from an M&A perspective  we are also very open  how does the performance look like. So if we bring in an asset  so we don't have to pay additional money or to increase our debt or equity level. So we are very flexible with regard to that format  and we have already done such deals. And obviously  we have also some equity authorization from our AGM. And in my discussion with investors  they tell us if there's a good asset with good quality and if it's financially attractive and then we are also flexible to support you with additional equity. And therefore  that's in basically our summary that funding is not a limited factor in -- for an M&A deal.Secondly  or the other way around from going from the liability side to the asset side. So where do we want to invest? So our priorities are basically unchanged. So priority number one is our Data & Analytics business  where we have seen big investments over the last three to five years. This Axioma  this ISS and so on just to tell the most prominent one. And so  we are still missing some capabilities here  and we are very open to do deals in that area  again  when it makes financial leasing  when it makes from a strategic perspective and sense.The second area where you have seen M&A transaction from us  and we potentially will continue to see is in the investment Fund Services business where the customer is always the choice to connect to our platform  to outsource or even to sell the business  right? And we are very flexible with all of these three formats. And this customer decides to sell the business for us  and then we show this as an M&A transaction. And so  Fund Services is really continue to be of high interest for Deutsche Borse.Bruce HamiltonGreat. Thank you very much.OperatorThe next question comes from Philip Middleton from the Bank of America.Philip MiddletonHey  good afternoon and thank you for that call. You've talked a little bit about inflation in respect to Eurex. But I wondered  could you talk us through how you see pricing moving in the rest of your portfolio  including obviously the data businesses and beyond. What -- how much inflation can you pass through apart from the Eurex segment  please?Gregor PottmeyerYes. Thanks  Philip. Obviously  we do that in all of our business segments  right? If you see that high inflation of 8% to 10%  basically now not just for 12-months  most probably even for a longer time horizon then is natural as all the pricing increases around us that we also increase our pricing here. And basically  we did some price increases in all our business segments across the board here. And it's not always a direct price increase  so increasing some fees. It's also some volume rebates where you do some optimization and so on. So overall  it's again  it's more than 1% and price increase in closer to 2%.But looking forward  right  normalization  our general target is not to focus on price increase. Obviously  our focus is to get additional liquidity and to increase our market share. So that's by far our most important intention. And these are just temporary effects what we use as we see high inflation last year and most probably also this year.Philip MiddletonOkay  thank you very much.OperatorThe next question comes from Johannes Thormann from HSBC.Johannes ThormannGood afternoon  everybody. [Indiscernible] First of all  a follow-up question on the NII sharing with customers. We are now at a level which you previously did not ever expect to see and then probably where you would also think that customers would be unhappy about it. How much revenue sharing do we -- or should we put into our models from the next rate hikes? Should we expect that the customer gets all of the rate increases? 50%? What's your gut feeling?And then my question is mainly on the OTC clearing now. Could you -- because this is getting hidden in the fixed income derivatives business. Can you elaborate a bit more on progress on market share and especially the revenue generation in that business? And then what's your view on June 2025 when -- how do you expect the commission to decide. To prolong or to cut the clearing agreement?Gregor PottmeyerYes. Thanks  Johannes. With regard to the NII topic  I think  I covered that already  but we'll repeat it. So there's open -- so you can do some technical calculation  right? So starting with the EUR18 billion customer cash balances  50% is U.S. dollar  35% is euro  15% other currencies. So far  we did not lose any of these customer cash balances that even slightly increased. But nevertheless  as the rate starts to continue to increase  so it's a question whether these customer cash balances go down? And secondly  whether there is additional pressure with regard to revenue sharing?So far  we do not share revenues  right? And so far  the balances did not decrease. So far  so good. But you have to consider this increased pressure. And therefore  we calculated in our base case scenario  some 20% discount to the technical numbers you could calculate. And how it develops and how it contributes with regard to reduced cash balances or revenue share  we do not know. It's just a 20% discount roughly. So that would be our best guess today. So that's the first question.The second question around the euro clearing. So far  we made the progress as expected. So we have EUR31 trillion notional outstanding volume that translates in a market share of roughly 20%. The net revenue  we got from the OTC clearing space was in 2022 more than EUR90 million. So we guided some five years ago  EUR50 million to EUR70 million  and we achieved the EUR60 million  the midpoint in ‚Äò21. But in 2022  increased more than 50%  more than EUR90 million. And we are quite confident that we will continue to significantly grow that kind of business.Yes  there was a delay of the regulation by three years  unfortunately  from June 2022 to June 2025. But on the other hand side  we see clear direction from EU commission and also from ECB  so that they really expect that the euro clearing will be increasingly managed within the Eurozone office in the EU. And therefore  currently in this draft legislation  we talk about an active account  right? That it's not accepted anymore  but they just build the connectivity to the platform so that they really use it.And currently  out of our 600 customers that are onboarded at Eurex clearing  roughly 300 or 50% is inactive. And if you see here now some movements also pushed by some expectations from EU commission and ECB  that would obviously significantly help us. On top  we did this kind of activation program for some incentivation  we decided to introduce that. So there's an additional incentive for market participants to join our platform. So overall  we are quite confident that you will see continued growth already this year but also in ‚Äò24 and ‚Äò25.Johannes ThormannThank you.OperatorNext up is Kyle Voigt from KBW.Kyle VoigtHi  thank you for taking my question. With respect to the cloud partnership you announced today  can you just talk about the key revenue opportunities that you see coming from this partnership? You noted that  at a minimum  this could significantly help your data distribution?And then how quickly do you think we -- that you would be in a position to launch new products as a result of the cloud migration? Should we be thinking about that as an opportunity in year one or year two of that cloud partnership? Or even further out than that?Theodor WeimerI'll take this one  Kyle. Firstly  we have entered into this partnership with a clear path to develop the digital asset platform  right? And therefore  the new asset losses need to emerge. And as a CEO and as ExCo  we have the obligation  right  to stay ahead of the curve because we are the leading European capital market infrastructure provider  right? And I think it's our obligation to be ahead of the curve. Something is cooking out there. You see in the United States  lots of new asset classes are coming. You see  especially on the real estate side  trading and so forth  right? So it's pretty clear this is more than just noise at the far horizon.When this will emerge and how it will emerge  nobody knows. The old rule is you overestimated the effect for the first 12-months  right? You underestimate the effect for the first five years  right? That's where we stand. So we go into this partnership with Google Cloud  we will develop this IT digitized based as a platform  right? And then  right  it is -- yes  if you have the opportunity  if there is the supply there  if the product -- if the IT capability is there  then this will create demand  right? That it will create demand  right? So we are working on the product offering  and this will ultimately translate in business  right?We have not yet factored in anything for the year 2023. You will hear a little bit more about this and our plans during the Capital Market Day and the strategy  but we affected in nothing  simply nothing  right? Of course  right  taking at the end of the day  we get software development capacities  we get all the access to the Google Cloud people  right? So we are here. We will set up a new asset platform  both for the new asset classes  and we'll accelerate our already existing D7 platform  right?And what we are currently making out of D7 is a negligible number in the overall context of what we are doing. This is an investment. And we didn't go out to the investors to ask for a 3 digit million of investment  right? We went out and asked  right  how -- what can we do? How can we partner with somebody? That's how you have to perceive this situation.Kyle VoigtThank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Enrico Bolzoni from JPMorgan.Enrico BolzoniHi  thank you. Just a follow-up on M&A. I just wanted to know if you would consider  if an opportunity arises  also more transformational deals rather than just maybe bolt-on deals? I'm thinking  especially in the Fund Services business or general in the non  let's say  traditional exchange part of the business. Thank you.Theodor WeimerThank you  Enrico  for this question  right? And my apologies for not laying out our full M&A strategy here. I think that is not appropriate. But one thing is for sure  right? We do not start  we do not exclude any kind of deals per se  right? Given the situation we are in  right  given the financial constraints we are having in terms of dilution of EPS  right? There's only very few transformation leads out there  which are striking to us  right?And if you simply look into what we've done  this string of pearls  how we are doing our strategy piece by piece  right? We can do larger deals  but it also depends on what is the definition of a transformational deal  right? One thing is for sure  I'm not out there and talking about  can I do a type of a merger of equals  whatever  yes  you have in your mind stuff. That is not what we are doing.Enrico BolzoniThanks.OperatorAnd now we have Ian White from Autonomous Research on the line.Ian WhiteHi  thanks for taking the presentation. Just a few short follow-ups for me  please  if that's okay? First up  can you just share any CapEx expectations for us for 2023  please?And secondly  maybe just if I could ask a bit more detail around the thinking in relation to the Google agreement. It sounds  like you're not considering  at this stage  migrating your sort of core trading technology to the cloud. And I think some of your global peers are sort of going down that route. Could you just explain your thinking around that? Is that something that you might consider in the future? Or is it completely off the table  please?And just finally  on Axioma. Can you just explain  kind of  the outlook for that business place? I think growth has been a bit weaker in that side of the Data & Analytics business this year. Is there kind of some change you can make on the sales side or a more attractive pipeline for 2023  please? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes. So I'll start with the CapEx question  2023. So it's roughly EUR300 million. With regard to the Axioma outlook  we think in 2023  we have a reasonable chance to come back to higher growth rates. Whether it's double digit  we will see  but the pipeline so far looks quite promising.Theodor WeimerOn the Google agreement  Ian  the following. Firstly  we have coinvented with some others if I may say so  the electronification of the trading systems  right? And we have been a protagonist there. Later on  we have been a protagonist with the futurization  which is the derivative part and where we are now having a top three position at least  right  at least. And now we see  right  the next S-curve  right  if I may use this term  the next S-curve is the new asset class digitization  right? And therefore  it's very clear that is what we are going for.We will not touch the low latency situation on trading guide  why should we? We are good. We are -- quite frankly  we are top  whatever we are. At least we are ahead of the bunch  right  should I include this into this context. Others have different strategies. Others have different starting positions. Others have different business models  right? I do not care too much about others. I care about what is best fit for us  right  on this side. And we are completely convinced that this innovation part of it together with the data strategy that is the best fit for us.Ian WhiteOkay. Thanks very much.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Tobias Lukesch from Kepler Cheuvreux.Tobias LukeschYes  good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Finally  coming to cost. I was wondering  if I take your cost base this year  and you said you were quite successful actually preempting some of the costs in ‚Äò23 already in ‚Äò22 also inflation-linked  you potentially have -- will not have such a high compensation effect maybe in 2023. I was wondering if we go with the secular growth and apply kind of 6% cost growth  if you agree to come out in  let's say  1.85 space?And then in the second step  I was wondering how much of OpEx? You mentioned additional spending in the fund service space  like this year -- well ‚Äò22. How much this would potentially add? And potentially also some further investments in the technology you mentioned. So is this something which is potentially significantly above spending we have seen in earlier years? Or would you think this is more or less in line? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes  Tobias. As you can derive from our guidance  right? So our guidance on the cost base is roughly EUR1.9 billion  right? So just subtracting net revenues and EBITDA  okay? There are some financial results in between but  let's say  the EUR1.9 billion  and that's a 4% cost increase  or 4% to 5%. And so  our message is that in 2023  we will come back to the guidance we always gave. So for roughly 5% plus secular growth  we need roughly some up to 5% cost increase  and that's exactly what is included in our guidance. And so far  we are quite confident that we are able to achieve this target.And the 17% cost increase you have seen for 2022  there were really some specific effects related to year 2022. I don't want to repeat all of the reasons. And the majority or a bulk of that will disappear in 2023. So that gives us also the chance  and I gave already the number of CapEx  roughly EUR300 million that we can do reasonable investments to continue to grow with our business.Tobias LukeschYes. Thanks  Gregor. However  if I calculate basically on  let's say  a bit of a clean cost base that you see get to 8%. And I was just wondering if you this time  like potentially are a bit more vigilant on the cost side. But I understand you that a kind of EUR1.9 billion figure is something you have in focus  and it will be kind of -- sure on that. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerThat‚Äôs exactly.OperatorAnd the last question comes from Roland Pfnder from ODDO BHF.Roland PfnderYes  thank you for taking my question. I just have one last one. Could you elaborate a little bit on your cash equities business and the market share development here  what you see will change? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes. Obviously  we were not really happy about the development in 2022 as we lost some market share here. I think  I shared that it's below the 60%. And obviously  we have already reacted with the liquidity program. There's not big expenses  and market share already increased back to more than 60%. I think we are able to manage that situation and we will see better market share development in 2023.Roland PfnderThank you.Jan StreckerAll right. Thanks a lot for your participation today. There are no further questions  and we would like to close the call today.

The slight increase in costs only results from costs related to non-volume related revenue growth initiatives. Savings and synergies entirely compensate inflation and business development costs.Status update on synergies in relation to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition : ‚Ç¨ 34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies were achieved at the end of Q4 2022  thanks to restructuring efforts and the migration of the Core Data Centre. ‚Ç¨9.7 million run-rate annual synergies were delivered in Q4 2022. ‚Ç¨44.2 million of cumulated implementation costs incurred at the end of Q4 2022  of which ‚Ç¨6.3 million during Q4 2022.Next steps in the deployment of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan : Euronext upgrades its 2024 annual run - rate pre - tax synergies related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group by ‚Ç¨ 15 millon to ‚Ç¨ 115 million . Implementation costs remain unchanged. Euronext confirmed the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets onto Optiq ¬Æ in March 2023  forming the first phase of the migration  and of Borsa Italiana other markets in Q4 2023 allowing for termination of the third-party provider trading platform contract. Euronext confirmed the phases in the expansion of Euronext Clearing with the expected launch of the equity clearing offering by the end of 2023 and of derivative clearing by Q3 2024. These strategic projects are expected to reach around ‚Ç¨ 7 0 million of cumulated run-rate synergies by the end of 2023  out of the ‚Ç¨115 million targeted. In 2023  Euronext expects to maintain for cash trading an average market share greater or equal to 63%   and revenue capture a round 0.5 2 bps following the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq ¬Æ   considering current market conditions and orders size.Key achievement in the deployment of the ‚Äò Fit for 1.5 ¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy in 2022 : Euronext‚Äôs upgraded SBTi-aligned climate targets were validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative: By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based greenhouse gas emissions by 73.5% compared to 2020; By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 3 business travel emissions by at least 46.2% compared to 2019; By 2027  Euronext suppliers  representing 72% of Euronext‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions derived from purchased goods and services  must set targets on their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.The Group‚Äôs efforts to enhance diversity were recognised through the inclusion of Euronext into the Euronext Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Euronext Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices.St√©phane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:‚ÄúIn 2022  Euronext reached record revenue and income above ‚Ç¨1.4 billion notably resulting from the strong performance of our non-volume related activities  together with efficient management of revenue capture and of cash trading market share. Thanks to our trademark cost discipline  we beat our 2022 revised costs guidance. We achieved an adjusted EBITDA of ‚Ç¨861.6 million that translated into an adjusted EPS of ‚Ç¨5.21. We will propose a total dividend of ‚Ç¨236.6 million at our next annual general meeting to be held in May 2023  representing 50% of our reported net income  excluding NTI loss impact.This year has been crucial in laying the foundations for the future growth of the Group. We have successfully completed the first major milestone of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan with the migration of our Core Data Centre from the UK to Italy. At the end of 2022  we have achieved ‚Ç¨34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies related to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.This fruitful year paves the way for the next steps to be delivered in 2023. The largest single liquidity pool in Europe  operated by Euronext will significantly change dimension with the migration of Italian cash markets to Euronext‚Äôs state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq¬Æ  which will benefit local and global trading members.Euronext Clearing will become the Euronext equity clearing house of choice by the end of 2023  and the CCP for derivatives clearing in Q3 2024. These are the critical bricks to complete our presence across the integrated value chain  allowing us to innovate and shape capital markets in line with evolving client needs  and making Euronext even stronger to deliver future growth.In an inflationary environment  we will contain our costs to a slight increase in 2023  at ‚Ç¨630 million  demonstrating Euronext‚Äôs ability to maintain its cost discipline while investing to generate revenue expansion of our non-volume related activities. We expect to deliver by the end of 2023 around ‚Ç¨70 million of the synergies targeted as part of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan. Our good progress on integration led us to upgrade the total amount of targeted run-rate EBITDA synergies by the end of 2024 from ‚Ç¨100 million to ‚Ç¨115 million. This further demonstrates Euronext‚Äôs successful track record in integrating acquired companies.Our strong performance  combined with the successful ongoing delivery of the planned synergies  is supporting our deleveraging trajectory with a net debt to EBITDA ratio at 2.6x  well below 3.2x at the time of closing of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition. This leaves the Group with flexibility to further deploy capital in value generating opportunities that might arise.Lastly  we are happy to see that our ‚ÄòFit for 1.5¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy is bearing fruit  as our upgraded emission reduction targets have been validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative. We are pleased to see Euronext being included in both the Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices  demonstrating the progress we are making in striving towards more equality.‚ÄùEuronext Q4 and full year 2022 financial performanceFull year 20226In ‚Ç¨m  unless stated otherwiseThe figures in this document have not been audited or reviewed by our external auditor.

The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage by non-volume related underlying revenue ratio was at 141% in 2022  almost stable vs. 2021 (142%).2022 adjusted EBITDAUnderlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased to ‚Ç¨606.1 million  up +14.9%  reflecting the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group costs and continued cost discipline in an inflationary environment. Underlying expenses excluding D&A (‚Ç¨606.1 million) were better than 2022 guidance of ‚Ç¨612 million underlying costs excluding D&A (‚Ç¨622 million initially) thanks to strong cost discipline  project costs being capitalised and one-off positive impacts  including release of accruals and lower-than-anticipated travel and marketing expenses due to the Covid-19 pandemic.On a like-for-like basis  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased slightly by +2.7% compared to 2021  which was positively impacted by the decrease of travel and marketing expenses during the pandemic  highlighting Euronext‚Äôs ability to contain inflation in 2022. On a pro forma basis for the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group on 29 April 2021  underlying operational expenses increased slightly by +2.0%  mainly due to the return of travel and marketing expenses in 2022.Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled ‚Ç¨861.6 million and saw double digit growth  +11.7% compared to 2021.

Dennis Dijkstra‚Äôs intention not to seek reappointment and the CEO succession plan was announced on 18 November 2022OutlookWhile Flow Traders remains committed to bringing onboard additional talent in growth business areas  FTEs are expected to remain broadly flat during 2023 given expected efficiency gains.

Accordingly  normalized fixed operating expenses in 2023 are expected to amount to c. ‚Ç¨175m - ‚Ç¨185m compared to ‚Ç¨161.6m in 2022Substantial progress has been made in the detailed and thorough review of Flow Traders' capital structure as announced at the time of the previous trading update and Flow Traders will remain focused on all arising opportunities to create shareholder value through systematic capital management going forwardManagement CommentsMike Kuehnel  CEO  stated:‚ÄúIn 2022 as a whole  we made considerable progress delivering on our strategic growth ambitions which has seen an even more resilient and diverse business emerge. It is encouraging to see a structural return on our recent investments in the business. Indeed  2022 saw record value traded versus last year across our three asset class pillars and we continue to grow our institutional counterparty base which now stands at more than 2 200. The successful completion of the update to our corporate holding structure means that we now have even greater trading flexibility and have laid the groundwork to undertake any potential inorganic growth activity.‚ÄúOperating expense growth moderated in the fourth quarter and 2023 will see a continued focus on increasing the underlying efficiency of the business as we seek to further leverage the investments made in prior years. We also maintained our conservative capital position while implementing this growth strategy. Remaining cognisant of our trading capital position as well as the growth opportunities ahead  we have elected to pay a ‚Ç¨0.80 per share final dividend to shareholders.‚ÄúDespite increasing competition for talent in the market  we have been successful in attracting and recruiting the best talent and have welcomed many new colleagues in the past year. Lastly  on behalf of the entire Board and ExCo  I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the professionalism  resilience  and loyalty of all our colleagues globally this past year. We are immensely grateful to our colleagues for their tremendous hard work which allowed for our considerable operational and strategic achievements and successes in 2022.‚ÄùFolkert Joling  Chief Trading Officer  added:‚ÄúHeightened levels of market activity delivered a strong trading performance in the fourth quarter with all regions contributing meaningfully. We have continued to expand and broaden our trading activities even further across different products and asset classes and this is reflected in the results achieved throughout 2022. Our robust and prudent approach to risk management meant that we were immaterially affected by the collapse of FTX in November and our status as a listed  transparent  seasoned market participant improved our overall standing with investors and other market participants. As to be expected  we reduced our overall trading capital exposure to the various crypto platforms we trade with  fully recognising the increased risks present in the broader crypto market. This trading capital was naturally deployed to other areas of the business. We retain our conviction around the long-term potential of crypto and DeFi from both a trading as well as a technological and financial markets innovation perspective.‚ÄúLooking ahead for 2023  we remain focused on executing our growth plans with respect to our business lines of Equity  Fixed Income and Crypto  Currencies and Commodities. Our achievements in 2022 have reinforced our confidence in our ability to deliver further growth going forward.‚ÄùPreliminary Financial Calendar24 February 2023 Release 2022 Annual Report31 March 2023 Start Silent Period ahead of Q123 trading update21 April 2023 Release Q123 trading update (no analyst conference call)26 April 2023 AGM28 April 2023 FY22 final dividend proposed ex-dividend date2 May 2023 FY22 final dividend proposed record date4 May 2023 FY22 final dividend proposed payment date30 June 2023 Start silent period ahead of H123 results21 July 2023 Release H123 results (inc. analyst conference call)Analyst Conference Call and WebcastThe Q422 results analyst conference call will be held at 10:00 am CET on Thursday 9 February 2023.

In particular  tenant sales and rent collection returned to pre-pandemic levels and we delivered consistent improvement in operating metrics across all regions.Our proactive leasing strategy yielded a higher proportion of longer-term leases at increased rents while we also benefitted from Sales Based Rents and the positive impact of indexation. In 2023  we will perform as retailers and brands optimise their store networks with us  with a focus on the most productive stores in prime locations as part of their drive-to-store strategies.Strong growth in Commercial Partnerships revenues clearly demonstrated the opportunity to generate new revenues from qualifying the audience of visitors to our centres  especially in Europe where we launched Westfield Rise  an in-house media advertising agency.Higher earnings  combined with a -‚Ç¨1.9 Bn debt reduction thanks to disposals in the US and Europe  translated into enhanced credit metrics. The Group‚Äôs robust operational performance and strong liquidity position allows us to progress our deleveraging programme in a timely and orderly manner  including the radical reduction of our US financial exposure.The Group is on track to deliver its ‚Äú2024 and beyond‚Äù strategy  which includes maximising asset value through the disciplined delivery of our committed pipeline and unlocking new development opportunities  with a focus on urban regeneration and environmental transition projects.‚ÄùFY-2022 FY-2021 Growth Like-for-like growth5 Net Rental Income (in ‚Ç¨ Mn) 2 226 1 724 29.1% 27.4%6 Shopping Centres 2 024 1 632 24.0% 21.5%7 Offices & Others 70 60 16.0% 23.2% Convention & Exhibition 132 32 n.m. n.m.

Rebasing both periods for the COVID-19 rent relief  the AREPS would have increased by +13.0%.OPERATING PERFORMANCEShopping CentresLike-for-like shopping centre NRI was up by +21.5%8 for the Group  and by +25.4% in Continental Europe  and up +12.0%8 in the US and +21.4% in the UK. All regions benefitted from higher variable income and lower doubtful debtors due to higher rent collection including 2021 rents. Performance in Continental Europe was also positively impacted by the end of COVID-19 rent discounts as well as indexation  and in the UK by lower rent relief and higher Sales Based Rents (SBR). The US benefitted from higher SBR  parking income and Commercial Partnerships  partly offset by negative MGR uplifts on short-term deals. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 rent relief  the like-for-like NRI growth would be +7.8% for the Group.2022 tenant sales9 were at 103% of 2019 levels  including 101% in Continental Europe  96% in the UK and 108% in the US  and footfall10 was at 90% of 2019 levels  including 88% in Continental Europe  89% in the UK and 94% in the US (96% excluding Westfield World Trade Center and Westfield San Francisco Centre in which footfall remains affected by work-from-home trends). Footfall is expected to continue to grow as vacancy decreases.In H2-2022  European tenant sales reached 102% of 2019 levels (vs. 98% in H1-2022). Sales performance in 2022 differed by sector in Europe. In particular  Health and Beauty was +11%  Sports +15%  while Fashion -5% and Entertainment -12% vs. 2019 levels. Entertainment saw an improvement from -14% in H1 to -10% in H2 and Fashion from -7% to -2%.In the US  tenant sales have consistently outperformed pre-COVID levels since H1-2021. Overall  2022 sales came to 108% of 2019 levels driven by Flagship assets at 117%  Regionals at 100% and partly offset by the Central Business District (‚ÄúCBD‚Äù)11 assets at 74%. The strong growth continued to be broad-based with almost all categories performing above 2019 levels  such as Luxury (+83%)  Home (+37%)  F&B (+10%) and Fashion (+3%). Entertainment saw an improvement from -25% in H1 to -12% in H2.Rent collection12 amounted to 97% for 2022 (vs. 88% at FY-2021 and 96% in H1-2022)  including 97% in Continental Europe  99% in the UK and 97% in the US  returning to pre-COVID levels. The Group continued to collect 2021 rents  leading to an improvement of 2021 rent collection from 88% to 93% between February 2022 and December 2022.URW signed ‚Ç¨441 Mn of MGR13 during 2022 (+26% compared to 2021) with an MGR uplift of +6.2% (vs. -5.2% in 2021). As market conditions improved  the proportion of long-term deals signed also increased from 61% of MGR signed in 2021 to 68% in 2022. The MGR uplift for leases longer than 36 months came to +14.4% for the Group  with Continental Europe at +8.9%  the UK at +3.6% and the US at +36.0%.SBR14  which are mainly generated in the US  increased to ‚Ç¨123.6 Mn in 2022 (6.1% of NRI) from ‚Ç¨80.2 Mn in 2021 (5.0% of NRI) of which ‚Ç¨77.7 Mn was for the US and ‚Ç¨45.9 Mn for Europe.Vacancy for Shopping Centres at a Group level decreased significantly to 6.5% at FY-2022  down from 8.9% at H1-2021 and 7.0% at FY-2021. In Continental Europe  vacancy was 3.1%  down from 4.0% in December 2021 and 5.0% in June 2021. In the UK  vacancy also decreased from 12.2% in June 2021 and 10.6% in December 2021 to 9.4% at FY-2022. In the US  the vacancy reduced to 10.4% at FY-2022 from 14.0% in June 2021 and 11.0% at FY-2021  with vacancy decreasing by -110 bps year-on-year to 8.2% in the Flagships.Indexation and inflationURW rents are indexed on a yearly basis in Continental Europe. 2022 indexation contribution to like-for-like retail NRI performance in Continental Europe was +3.6%  reflecting 2021 inflation due to the usual time lag between contractual indexation and inflation. In the UK and the US  leases are not tied to actual CPI figures but the Group benefitted from inflation through SBR.Commercial PartnershipsRevenue from Commercial Partnerships15 increased from ‚Ç¨76.2 Mn in 2021 to ‚Ç¨115.5 Mn in 2022  driven in part by the launch in Europe of Westfield Rise  an in-house media  brand experience and data partnerships agency.Total Westfield Rise activity in Europe amounted to ‚Ç¨45.5 Mn in net margin at 100% share in 2022  up +23% compared to 2019 (and +52% compared to 202116). This new division (for which figures are reported at 100%) will generate ‚Ç¨75 Mn16 in annual net margin by 2024  a +‚Ç¨45 Mn increase compared to 2021  with strong potential growth beyond 2024.Offices & OthersOffice NRI increased by +16.0%  primarily as a result of deliveries of Pullman Montparnasse and Ga√Æt√© Montparnasse offices  partly offset by 2021 and 2022 disposals  especially Solna Centrum. On a like-for-like basis  office NRI increased by +23.2%  with +44.2% in France  mainly due to leasing activity at Trinity in La D√©fense  now 74% let.Two new leases (Santarelli and Alain Afflelou) were signed for Trinity in 2022 at an average rent of c. ‚Ç¨567/sqm17  with lease incentives below the market average. In addition  33 100 sqm were leased on projects  including Lightwell in La D√©fense (80% pre-let) and Westfield Hamburg offices (29% pre-let)  both due to be delivered in 2024.Convention & ExhibitionIn 2022  Viparis hosted 617 events (including 189 exhibitions  75 congresses and 353 corporate events) compared to 236 events in 2020 and 721 events in 2018.Convention & Exhibition recurring NOI amounted to ‚Ç¨190.2 Mn compared to ‚Ç¨55.2 Mn in 2021 and ‚Ç¨164.7 Mn in 2018. This includes the ‚Ç¨25 Mn contribution from the French State to compensate closure periods in earlier years. Restated from this and triennial shows (held in 2018 and 2022)  the NOI is slightly above 2018  due to the strong recovery of activity and the shift of certain biannual shows  despite the remaining impact of COVID-19 in the first quarter.As at January 31  2023  signed and pre-booked events in Viparis venues for 2023 amounted to 86%18 of 2019 pre-bookings  the last comparable year.D ISPOSALSIn total  the Group completed disposals in Europe and in the US that represents ‚Ç¨1.8 Bn of IFRS net debt reduction.In Europe  URW completed disposals in 2022 that represents a ‚Ç¨1.2 Bn of IFRS net debt reduction at an average NIY of 5.5% and an average premium to last unaffected book value of +2.7%. Deals completed include the disposal of Solna Centrum (Stockholm region)  the building rights for two residential buildings at Westfield Hamburg (Hamburg)  a 45% interest in Westfield Carr√© S√©nart (Paris region)  Gera Arcaden (Gera)  Almere Centrum (Amsterdam region)  Carr√© S√©nart Shopping Parc (Paris region) and Villeneuve 2 (Lille region). In addition  URW‚Äôs partner in Aupark exercised its call option for the acquisition of an additional 27% stake.In total  URW has now reached ‚Ç¨3.2 Bn19 of its ‚Ç¨4.0 Bn European disposals programme representing 80%  at an average NIY of 4.9% (including 5.4% for the Shopping Centres and 3.9% for the Offices & Others)  a premium to the last unaffected appraisal of +4.9% (including +1.3% for the Shopping Centres and +12.3% for the Offices & Others). The Group expects to complete the European disposals programme during 2023.URW will continue the asset and property management for several of the assets sold  including Aupark  Westfield Carr√© S√©nart  Gera Arcaden and Carr√© S√©nart Shopping Parc  allowing the Group to earn management fees and consequently increase the return on investment for those assets.In the US  the Group also continued efforts to streamline its US Regional portfolio with the completion in 2022 of a total of $0.6 Bn of disposals20. These include the disposals of the Promenade development parcel in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles  Westfield Santa Anita  The Village at Topanga  as well as Westfield Trumbull and Westfield South Shore. These transactions were completed at a discount of -0.5% to 2021 book value. Together with the disposal of the Palisade residential building and the ownership transfer of five other regional properties in 2021  URW has made $1.3 Bn in total proceeds to date from the planned radical reduction of its financial exposure to the US.In 2023  the Group will continue to streamline its remaining US Regional asset portfolio. URW is committed to the radical reduction of its financial exposure to the US  a process that is supported by the strong operational performance of the assets and the Group‚Äôs liquidity position.DELIVERIES & PIPELINEThe Total Investment Cost (TIC)21 of URW‚Äôs development pipeline decreased by -‚Ç¨0.1 Bn to ‚Ç¨3.1 Bn  compared to December 31  2021  mainly as a result of the delivery of projects  representing ‚Ç¨0.4 Bn  new projects and increasing costs.In 2022  the Group delivered the 19 439 sqm Westfield Topanga extension  ‚ÄúRue de la Boucle‚Äù  a 10 000 sqm destination at Westfield Forum des Halles  the Ga√Æt√© Montparnasse Office project as well as Les Ateliers Ga√Æt√© shopping centre (33 364 sqm) to complete the Ga√Æt√© Montparnasse mixed-use complex  one of the most ambitious and largest urban regeneration projects in Paris.

The average pre-letting22 of these projects stands at 81%.VALUATIONThe proportionate Gross Market Value (GMV) of the Group‚Äôs assets as at December 31  2022  decreased by-4.1% to ‚Ç¨52.2 Bn from ‚Ç¨54.5 Bn as at December 31  2021  mainly as a result of disposals (-‚Ç¨1.8 Bn) and a like-for-like portfolio revaluation of -‚Ç¨1.3 Bn (-2.7%)  partly offset by CAPEX  Acquisitions and Transfers (+‚Ç¨0.9 Bn) and positive FX moves (+‚Ç¨0.4 Bn). The like-for-like shopping centres valuation was -2.6% for 2022 including-2.3% in H2 as appraisers increased their assumption of discount and exit cap rates.The EPRA Net Reinstatement Value per share came to ‚Ç¨155.70 as at December 31  2022  down -‚Ç¨3.90 (-2.4%) compared to December 31  2021  mainly driven by the revaluation of investment properties  partly offset by the retained recurring results.FINANCIAL RESOURCESAs at December 31  2022  the Group‚Äôs IFRS net financial debt decreased to ‚Ç¨20.7 Bn (from ‚Ç¨22.6 Bn as at December 31  2021) mainly driven by the disposals completed in 2022.The Group‚Äôs credit metrics improved over the period supported by strong operational performance and deleveraging progress. URW‚Äôs Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio23 decreased to 41.2% (vs. 43.3% as at December 31  2021)  Net debt/EBITDA24 ratio decreased to 9.6x (vs. 13.7x in 2021)  below its 2019 level (9.9x)  the Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) increased to 4.2x (vs. 3.3x in 2021)  and Funds from Operations to Net Financial Debt (FFO/NFD) ratio improved to 7.6% (vs. 5.0% in 2021).Over 2022  URW further strengthened its liquidity position by raising ‚Ç¨1 332 Mn (‚Ç¨1 682 Mn on a proportionate basis) of medium to long-term funds25 in the mortgage and corporate bank debt market  out of which ‚Ç¨900 Mn (‚Ç¨1 250 Mn on a proportionate basis) is sustainability-linked.The Group‚Äôs liquidity position increased by ca. +‚Ç¨0.9 Bn over the year to reach ‚Ç¨13.0 Bn and ‚Ç¨13.2 Bn on a proportionate basis including ‚Ç¨3.3 Bn of cash on hand26 (vs. ‚Ç¨2.3 Bn as at December 31  2021)  allowing the Group to fully secure its debt maturities for the next 36 months.Regarding the ‚Ç¨1.25 Bn perpetual non-call 2023 hybrid  the terms and conditions of the instrument provide for the issuer a call option27 in 2023  and annually thereafter.The decision regarding this call will be made ahead of its First Reset Date28 (i.e. October 25  2023).The Group‚Äôs average debt maturity29 stood at 8.3 years.The Group‚Äôs average cost of debt remained stable at 2.0%  representing a blended average cost of 1.5% for Euro30 denominated debt and 3.8% for USD and GBP denominated debt  thanks to both the Group‚Äôs hedging instruments in place limiting the impact of rates increases and to positive cash deposit rates.The Group‚Äôs debt is fully hedged for 2023 and the following years  limiting the impact of any rates increase on the Group‚Äôs financial expenses for 2023.ESG2022 marks another year of ESG progress for the Group under its Better Places 2030 strategy. Having achieved a -17% reduction of energy intensity since 2015 in Europe  URW set an additional target to reduce its energy intensity by -15% in 2022 compared to 2019 in Europe to support national and European efforts to address the energy crisis. Thanks to a range of proactive measures  URW was able to outperform this target  reaching -19.8%  supporting both governments efforts and mitigating costs impacts for tenants.URW is on track to meet all Better Places 2030 targets  including cutting carbon emissions by 50% between 2015 and 2030. The Group is committed to contribute to global carbon neutrality and will present a step-change update to its plan in autumn 2023  with a view to establishing new commitments.The Group‚Äôs CSR agenda was recognised by equity and debt investors as a value creation driver for its stakeholders. In 2022  URW inclusion in the main ESG indices was confirmed and the Group‚Äôs sustainability achievements were registered in ratings and awards.2023 GUIDANCEThanks to the improvement in 2022 operating performance  higher indexation  the positioning of the Group on prime and well-located assets  and retailers‚Äô drive-to-store strategies  as well as deleveraging progress  URW is well-positioned to continue to perform in what is expected to remain an uncertain macro environment in 2023.In this context  the Group forecasts its 2023 AREPS to be in the range of ‚Ç¨9.30 to ‚Ç¨9.50. The main drivers of this guidance are:Consistent performance in our retail operations versus 2022 with inflation protection through indexation and SBR;The impact of large event scheduling changes in 2022  leading to a naturally lower Convention & Exhibition activity in 2023;Full-year effect of 2022 disposals  impact of US regional streamlining and the European disposal programme;Contribution of 2022 and 2023 project deliveries;Stable cost of funding thanks to Group‚Äôs hedging programme;FX impact with the strengthening of the Euro vs. USD.This guidance does not include major disposals in the US in the context of the radical reduction of its financial exposure.The Group assumes no major energy-related restrictions  nor major deterioration to the macro-economic and geopolitical environment.DIVIDENDComplying with the deleveraging commitments made in 2021  the Group will not pay a dividend for fiscal year 2022.Given the statutory results of URW SE in 2022 (+‚Ç¨90 Mn in 2022 and cumulated negative retained earnings of -‚Ç¨2 341 Mn)  the Group has no obligation to pay a dividend in 2023 for the fiscal year 2022 under the SIIC regime and other REIT regimes it benefits from. Consequently  URW SE‚Äôs total carry forward SIIC distribution obligation  standing at ‚Ç¨1 720 Mn as at December 31  2022  will be delayed until URW SE has sufficient statutory results to meet this obligation. These statutory results do not prevent URW SE from making distributions out of its premium.EURONEXT LISTINGThe Group started discussions with Euronext in order to change its market of reference from Euronext Amsterdam to Euronext Paris as part of an initiative to simplify its structure given limited trading activity on that market. As a part of this request  the Group intends to delist the URW Stapled Shares from Euronext Amsterdam  while maintaining a single listing on Euronext Paris. The delisting from Euronext Amsterdam would not affect the liquidity of the shares nor have any impact on trading  URW‚Äôs organisation (including the stapled share principle) or the ISIN code (FR0013326246) of the Group.Subject to approval by the Euronext Listing Board  the Group expects these changes to be effective by the end of April 2023.Further information regarding this process will be communicated as appropriate.FINANCIAL SCHEDULEThe next financial events on the Group‚Äôs calendar will be:April 26  2023: Q1 trading updateMay 10  2023: AGM Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield SEJuly 27  2023: H1-2023 resultsFor further information  please contact:Investor RelationsAudrey Arnoux+33 6 61 27 07 39Audrey.Arnoux@urw.comMedia RelationsUK/Global:Cornelia Schnepf ‚Äì Finelk+44 7387 108 998Cornelia.Schnepf@finelk.euFrance:Sonia Fellmann ‚Äì PLEAD+33 6 27 84 91 30Sonia.Fellmann@plead.frUnited States:Molly Morse ‚Äì Kekst CNC+ 1 212 521 4826Molly.Morse@kekstcnc.comAbout Unibail-Rodamco-WestfieldUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield is an owner  developer and operator of sustainable  high-quality real estate assets in the most dynamic cities in Europe and the United States.The Group operates 78 shopping centres in 12 countries  including 45 which carry the iconic Westfield brand.

Trading revenue grew to ‚Ç¨514.1 million (-0.8% pro forma  +10.5% reported). FX and power trading reported strong performances.

Custody and Settlement revenue was ‚Ç¨243.1 million (stable pro forma  +10.9% reported) thanks to the diversified Euronext Securities business model as settlement activity stabilised.

In 2022  Euronext remained the leading venue for equity listing in Europe  recording 83 new equity listings  and the leading venue for debt listing globally. Advanced Data Services revenue grew to ‚Ç¨212.1 million (+4.8% pro forma  +15.5% reported)  driven by the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group and a strong performance of both real-time and non real-time data businesses.Adjusted EBITDA 3 was at ‚Ç¨ 861.6 million ( +‚Ç¨90.6 million   -1.2 % pro forma  +11. 7 % reported ) reflecting continued cost disciplin e despite strong inflationary pressure .

The slight increase in costs only results from costs related to non-volume related revenue growth initiatives. Savings and synergies entirely compensate inflation and business development costs.Status update on synergies in relation to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition : ‚Ç¨ 34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies were achieved at the end of Q4 2022  thanks to restructuring efforts and the migration of the Core Data Centre. ‚Ç¨9.7 million run-rate annual synergies were delivered in Q4 2022. ‚Ç¨44.2 million of cumulated implementation costs incurred at the end of Q4 2022  of which ‚Ç¨6.3 million during Q4 2022.Next steps in the deployment of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan : Euronext upgrades its 2024 annual run - rate pre - tax synergies related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group by ‚Ç¨ 15 millon to ‚Ç¨ 115 million . Implementation costs remain unchanged. Euronext confirmed the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets onto Optiq ¬Æ in March 2023  forming the first phase of the migration  and of Borsa Italiana other markets in Q4 2023 allowing for termination of the third-party provider trading platform contract. Euronext confirmed the phases in the expansion of Euronext Clearing with the expected launch of the equity clearing offering by the end of 2023 and of derivative clearing by Q3 2024. These strategic projects are expected to reach around ‚Ç¨ 7 0 million of cumulated run-rate synergies by the end of 2023  out of the ‚Ç¨115 million targeted. In 2023  Euronext expects to maintain for cash trading an average market share greater or equal to 63%   and revenue capture a round 0.5 2 bps following the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq ¬Æ   considering current market conditions and orders size.Key achievement in the deployment of the ‚Äò Fit for 1.5 ¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy in 2022 : Euronext‚Äôs upgraded SBTi-aligned climate targets were validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative: By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based greenhouse gas emissions by 73.5% compared to 2020; By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 3 business travel emissions by at least 46.2% compared to 2019; By 2027  Euronext suppliers  representing 72% of Euronext‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions derived from purchased goods and services  must set targets on their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.The Group‚Äôs efforts to enhance diversity were recognised through the inclusion of Euronext into the Euronext Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Euronext Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices.St√©phane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said: ‚ÄúIn 2022  Euronext reached record revenue and income above ‚Ç¨1.4 billion notably resulting from the strong performance of our non-volume related activities  together with efficient management of revenue capture and of cash trading market share. Thanks to our trademark cost discipline  we beat our 2022 revised costs guidance. We achieved an adjusted EBITDA of ‚Ç¨861.6 million that translated into an adjusted EPS of ‚Ç¨5.21. We will propose a total dividend of ‚Ç¨236.6 million at our next annual general meeting to be held in May 2023  representing 50% of our reported net income  excluding NTI loss impact.This year has been crucial in laying the foundations for the future growth of the Group. We have successfully completed the first major milestone of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan with the migration of our Core Data Centre from the UK to Italy. At the end of 2022  we have achieved ‚Ç¨34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies related to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.This fruitful year paves the way for the next steps to be delivered in 2023. The largest single liquidity pool in Europe  operated by Euronext will significantly change dimension with the migration of Italian cash markets to Euronext‚Äôs state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq¬Æ  which will benefit local and global trading members.Euronext Clearing will become the Euronext equity clearing house of choice by the end of 2023  and the CCP for derivatives clearing in Q3 2024. These are the critical bricks to complete our presence across the integrated value chain  allowing us to innovate and shape capital markets in line with evolving client needs  and making Euronext even stronger to deliver future growth.In an inflationary environment  we will contain our costs to a slight increase in 2023  at ‚Ç¨630 million  demonstrating Euronext‚Äôs ability to maintain its cost discipline while investing to generate revenue expansion of our non-volume related activities. We expect to deliver by the end of 2023 around ‚Ç¨70 million of the synergies targeted as part of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan. Our good progress on integration led us to upgrade the total amount of targeted run-rate EBITDA synergies by the end of 2024 from ‚Ç¨100 million to ‚Ç¨115 million. This further demonstrates Euronext‚Äôs successful track record in integrating acquired companies.Our strong performance  combined with the successful ongoing delivery of the planned synergies  is supporting our deleveraging trajectory with a net debt to EBITDA ratio at 2.6x  well below 3.2x at the time of closing of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition. This leaves the Group with flexibility to further deploy capital in value generating opportunities that might arise.Lastly  we are happy to see that our ‚ÄòFit for 1.5¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy is bearing fruit  as our upgraded emission reduction targets have been validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative. We are pleased to see Euronext being included in both the Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices  demonstrating the progress we are making in striving towards more equality.‚ÄùEuronext Q4 and full year 2022 financial performance Full year 20226 In ‚Ç¨m  unless stated otherwiseThe figures in this document have not been audited or reviewed by our external auditor.

Underlying revenue and income  excluding the non-underlying  one-off loss related to the partial disposal of the Euronext Clearing portfolio  was up +13.0% in 2022  to ‚Ç¨1 467.8 million. On a like-for-like basis and at constant currencies  Euronext consolidated revenue and income was stable (-0.2%) in 2022  at ‚Ç¨1 204.4 million  compared to 2021. Pro forma the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition on 29 April 2021  underlying revenue and income were stable in 2022 compared to 2021  resulting from strong non-volume related activities  notably listing and advanced data services  very good performances for FX and power trading and a solid performance of derivatives trading. Non-volume related revenue accounted for 58% of underlying Group revenue in 2022  stable vs. 2021  reflecting the successful diversification towards non-volume related activities  good performance of non-equity related trading activities and the challenging environment for cash trading and MTS cash trading this quarter. The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage by non-volume related underlying revenue ratio was at 141% in 2022  almost stable vs. 2021 (142%). 2022 adjusted EBITDA Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased to ‚Ç¨606.1 million  up +14.9%  reflecting the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group costs and continued cost discipline in an inflationary environment. Underlying expenses excluding D&A (‚Ç¨606.1 million) were better than 2022 guidance of ‚Ç¨612 million underlying costs excluding D&A (‚Ç¨622 million initially) thanks to strong cost discipline  project costs being capitalised and one-off positive impacts  including release of accruals and lower-than-anticipated travel and marketing expenses due to the Covid-19 pandemic. On a like-for-like basis  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased slightly by +2.7% compared to 2021  which was positively impacted by the decrease of travel and marketing expenses during the pandemic  highlighting Euronext‚Äôs ability to contain inflation in 2022. On a pro forma basis for the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group on 29 April 2021  underlying operational expenses increased slightly by +2.0%  mainly due to the return of travel and marketing expenses in 2022. Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled ‚Ç¨861.6 million and saw double digit growth  +11.7% compared to 2021. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 58.7%  down -0.7 points compared to 2021. On a like-for-like basis  adjusted EBITDA for 2022 was down -2.3%  to ‚Ç¨699.3 million  and adjusted EBITDA margin was 58.1%  down -1.2 points compared to the same perimeter in 2021. 2022 net income  share of the parent company shareholders Depreciation and amortisation accounted for ‚Ç¨160.2 million in 2022  up +19.0%  mostly due to the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for ‚Ç¨83.3 million and is included in depreciation and amortisation. Adjusted operating profit was ‚Ç¨792.8 million  a strong +11.7% increase compared to 2021. On a like-for-like basis  adjusted operating profit was down -2.3% compared to 2021  at ‚Ç¨643.6 million. ‚Ç¨118.6 million of non-underlying expenses  including depreciation and amortisation  were reported in 2022  related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group  the implementation of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan and the PPA of acquired businesses. Net financing expense for 2022 was ‚Ç¨29.7 million compared to a net financing expense of ‚Ç¨31.7 million in 2021. This decrease mainly results from the elimination of costs in relation to the bridge financing of the Borsa Italiana Group in 2021  partially offset by the cost of bonds issued to finance the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. Results from equity investments amounted to ‚Ç¨18.7 million in 2022  solely representing the contribution received from LCH SA and a dividend received from Euroclear. As a reminder  in 2021  Euronext reported ‚Ç¨33.2 million in results from equity investments  reflecting two dividends received from Sicovam and two dividends received from Euroclear in addition to the contribution received from LCH SA. Income tax for 2022 was ‚Ç¨163.6 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 26.6% for 2022 (2021: ‚Ç¨158.6 million and 27.3% respectively). Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to the Borsa Italiana Group and Nord Pool amounted to ‚Ç¨12.8 million in 2022. As a result  the reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  increased by +5.9% for 2022 compared to 2021  to ‚Ç¨437.8 million  including the one-off loss due to the portfolio reallocation10 of the Euronext Clearing portfolio. This represents a reported EPS of ‚Ç¨4.10 basic and ‚Ç¨4.10 diluted in 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨4.30 basic and ‚Ç¨4.29 diluted in 2021. This decrease reflects a higher number of outstanding shares over 2022 compared to 2021. Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders was up +5.7% to ‚Ç¨555.3 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was down -4.8% in 2022  at ‚Ç¨5.21 per share  compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of ‚Ç¨5.47 per share in 2021. This decrease reflect a higher number of outstanding shares over 2022 compared to 2021. The weighted number of shares used over 2022 was 106 669 451 for the basic calculation and 106 901 306 for the diluted calculation  compared to 96 058 761 and 96 297 159 respectively over 2021. In 2022  Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of ‚Ç¨616.5 million  compared to ‚Ç¨543.7 million in 2021  resulting from higher profit before tax and higher depreciation and amortisation. Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities  net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 83.9% of EBITDA in 2022.

On a like-for-like basis and at constant currencies  Euronext consolidated revenue and income was down -6.1% in Q4 2022  to ‚Ç¨346.5 million  compared to Q4 2021. Non-volume related revenue accounted for 60% of Group revenue in Q4 2022  compared to 58% in Q4 2021  reflecting higher advanced data services and services revenue. The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage by non-volume related revenue ratio was at 130% in Q4 2022  compared to 136% in Q4 2021. Q4 2022 adjusted EBITDA Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased to ‚Ç¨159.2 million  slightly up +1.6%  reflecting strong cost discipline in an inflationary environment and higher capitalised project costs. On a like-for-like basis  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation slightly increased by +2.1% compared to Q4 2021. Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled ‚Ç¨187.9 million  down -12.0% compared to Q4 2021. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.1%  down -3.5 points compared to Q4 2021.

Net financing expense for Q4 2022 was ‚Ç¨6.0 million  compared to a net financing expense of ‚Ç¨6.7 million in Q4 2021. This decrease results from higher interest income due to increased interest rates partially offset by the higher cost of issued bonds and a negative revaluation of foreign currency balances. Results from equity investments amounted to ‚Ç¨12.6 million in Q4 2022  representing the contribution received from LCH SA and a dividend received from Euroclear. As a reminder  in Q4 2021  Euronext reported ‚Ç¨7.3 million in results from equity investments  reflecting a dividend payment by Sicovam in addition to the contribution received from LCH SA. Income tax for Q4 2022 was ‚Ç¨38.5 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 27.3% for the quarter (Q4 2021: ‚Ç¨35.7 million and 23.6% respectively).

As a result  the reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  decreased by -11.9% for Q4 2022 compared to Q4 2021  to ‚Ç¨99.3 million. This represents a reported EPS of ‚Ç¨0.93 basic and ‚Ç¨0.93 diluted in Q4 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨1.05 basic and ‚Ç¨1.05 diluted in Q4 2021. Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders was down -18.2% to ‚Ç¨118.2 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was down -18.0% in Q4 2022  at ‚Ç¨1.11 per share  compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of ‚Ç¨1.35 per share in Q4 2021.

In Q4 2022  Euronext reported a negative net cash flow from operating activities of ‚Ç¨147.1 million  compared to a positive ‚Ç¨145.6 million in Q4 2021  reflecting higher negative changes in working capital reflecting notably short-term movement in outstanding power sales customers‚Äô and suppliers‚Äô invoices related to Nord Pool CCP activities.

Fourth quarter 2022 Cash tradingCash trading revenue decreased by -17.9% to ‚Ç¨65.1 million in Q4 2022  resulting from lower trading volumes  partially offset by an uptick in market share from October 2022. Over the fourth quarter of 2022  Euronext recorded cash trading average daily volumes of ‚Ç¨10.1 billion  a volume decrease of-17.2% compared to Q4 2021 resulting from a softer trading environment and partially offset by efficient revenue capture management. Over the fourth quarter of 2022  Euronext cash trading yield was 0.50bps  reflecting the dilutive impact of Borsa Italiana markets and larger average order size. During the fourth quarter 2022  Euronext continued to enhance its fee schemes. The latter translated into an uptick in market share from October 2022. Euronext market share on cash trading averaged 65.3% in Q4 2022. In 2023  Euronext expects to maintain for cash trading an average market share greater or equal to 63%  and revenue capture around 0.52bps following the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq¬Æ  considering current market conditions and orders size.

Appendix Adjustments in financial disclosure To highlight its underlying performance  since Q1 2022 Euronext has published underlying recurring costs  adjusted EBITDA and non-recurring costs. Euronext has removed the exceptional items line from its financial statements.

The ‚Ç¨150 million of implementation costs to deliver on the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan targets are therefore considered as non-recurring items and have been withdrawn from the underlying recurring costs. The computation of adjusted net income and earnings per share has been adjusted accordingly.

These items can include: integration or double run costs of significant projects  restructuring costs and costs related to acquisitions that change the perimeter of the Group; one-off finance costs  gains or losses on sale of subsidiaries and impairments of investments: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets which are recognised as a result of acquisitions and mostly comprising customer relationships  brand names and software that were identified during purchase price allocation (PPA); tax related to non-underlying items.Adjusted operating profit as the operating profit adjusted for any non-underlying revenue and income and non-underlying costs  including PPA of acquired businesses;EBITDA as the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;Adjusted EBITDA as the adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation adjusted for any non-underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA  divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted net income  as the net income  share of the parent company shareholders  adjusted for any non-underlying items and related tax impact.

Trading revenue grew to ‚Ç¨514.1 million (-0.8% pro forma  +10.5% reported). FX and power trading reported strong performances.

The slight increase in costs only results from costs related to non-volume related revenue growth initiatives. Savings and synergies entirely compensate inflation and business development costs.Status update on synergies in relation to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition : ‚Ç¨ 34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies were achieved at the end of Q4 2022  thanks to restructuring efforts and the migration of the Core Data Centre. ‚Ç¨9.7 million run-rate annual synergies were delivered in Q4 2022. ‚Ç¨44.2 million of cumulated implementation costs incurred at the end of Q4 2022  of which ‚Ç¨6.3 million during Q4 2022.Next steps in the deployment of the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan : Euronext upgrades its 2024 annual run - rate pre - tax synergies related to the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group by ‚Ç¨ 15 millon to ‚Ç¨ 115 million . Implementation costs remain unchanged. Euronext confirmed the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets onto Optiq ¬Æ in March 2023  forming the first phase of the migration  and of Borsa Italiana other markets in Q4 2023 allowing for termination of the third-party provider trading platform contract. Euronext confirmed the phases in the expansion of Euronext Clearing with the expected launch of the equity clearing offering by the end of 2023 and of derivative clearing by Q3 2024. These strategic projects are expected to reach around ‚Ç¨ 7 0 million of cumulated run-rate synergies by the end of 2023  out of the ‚Ç¨115 million targeted. In 2023  Euronext expects to maintain for cash trading an average market share greater or equal to 63%   and revenue capture a round 0.5 2 bps following the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq ¬Æ   considering current market conditions and orders size.Key achievement in the deployment of the ‚Äò Fit for 1.5 ¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy in 2022 : Euronext‚Äôs upgraded SBTi-aligned climate targets were validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative: By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based greenhouse gas emissions by 73.5% compared to 2020; By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 3 business travel emissions by at least 46.2% compared to 2019; By 2027  Euronext suppliers  representing 72% of Euronext‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions derived from purchased goods and services  must set targets on their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.The Group‚Äôs efforts to enhance diversity were recognised through the inclusion of Euronext into the Euronext Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Euronext Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices.St√©phane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:‚ÄúIn 2022  Euronext reached record revenue and income above ‚Ç¨1.4 billion notably resulting from the strong performance of our non-volume related activities  together with efficient management of revenue capture and of cash trading market share. Thanks to our trademark cost discipline  we beat our 2022 revised costs guidance. We achieved an adjusted EBITDA of ‚Ç¨861.6 million that translated into an adjusted EPS of ‚Ç¨5.21. We will propose a total dividend of ‚Ç¨236.6 million at our next annual general meeting to be held in May 2023  representing 50% of our reported net income  excluding NTI loss impact.This year has been crucial in laying the foundations for the future growth of the Group. We have successfully completed the first major milestone of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan with the migration of our Core Data Centre from the UK to Italy. At the end of 2022  we have achieved ‚Ç¨34.1 million of cumulated run-rate annual synergies related to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.This fruitful year paves the way for the next steps to be delivered in 2023. The largest single liquidity pool in Europe  operated by Euronext will significantly change dimension with the migration of Italian cash markets to Euronext‚Äôs state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq¬Æ  which will benefit local and global trading members.Euronext Clearing will become the Euronext equity clearing house of choice by the end of 2023  and the CCP for derivatives clearing in Q3 2024. These are the critical bricks to complete our presence across the integrated value chain  allowing us to innovate and shape capital markets in line with evolving client needs  and making Euronext even stronger to deliver future growth.In an inflationary environment  we will contain our costs to a slight increase in 2023  at ‚Ç¨630 million  demonstrating Euronext‚Äôs ability to maintain its cost discipline while investing to generate revenue expansion of our non-volume related activities. We expect to deliver by the end of 2023 around ‚Ç¨70 million of the synergies targeted as part of our ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan. Our good progress on integration led us to upgrade the total amount of targeted run-rate EBITDA synergies by the end of 2024 from ‚Ç¨100 million to ‚Ç¨115 million. This further demonstrates Euronext‚Äôs successful track record in integrating acquired companies.Our strong performance  combined with the successful ongoing delivery of the planned synergies  is supporting our deleveraging trajectory with a net debt to EBITDA ratio at 2.6x  well below 3.2x at the time of closing of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition. This leaves the Group with flexibility to further deploy capital in value generating opportunities that might arise.Lastly  we are happy to see that our ‚ÄòFit for 1.5¬∞‚Äô ESG strategy is bearing fruit  as our upgraded emission reduction targets have been validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative. We are pleased to see Euronext being included in both the Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Equileap Gender Equality France 40 indices  demonstrating the progress we are making in striving towards more equality.‚ÄùEuronext Q4 and full year 2022 financial performanceFull year 20226In ‚Ç¨m  unless stated otherwiseThe figures in this document have not been audited or reviewed by our external auditor.

The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage by non-volume related underlying revenue ratio was at 141% in 2022  almost stable vs. 2021 (142%).2022 adjusted EBITDAUnderlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased to ‚Ç¨606.1 million  up +14.9%  reflecting the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group costs and continued cost discipline in an inflationary environment. Underlying expenses excluding D&A (‚Ç¨606.1 million) were better than 2022 guidance of ‚Ç¨612 million underlying costs excluding D&A (‚Ç¨622 million initially) thanks to strong cost discipline  project costs being capitalised and one-off positive impacts  including release of accruals and lower-than-anticipated travel and marketing expenses due to the Covid-19 pandemic.On a like-for-like basis  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased slightly by +2.7% compared to 2021  which was positively impacted by the decrease of travel and marketing expenses during the pandemic  highlighting Euronext‚Äôs ability to contain inflation in 2022. On a pro forma basis for the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group on 29 April 2021  underlying operational expenses increased slightly by +2.0%  mainly due to the return of travel and marketing expenses in 2022.Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled ‚Ç¨861.6 million and saw double digit growth  +11.7% compared to 2021.

Consequently  costs previously reported as exceptional items have from Q1 2022 been included in their respective lines within Euronext operating expenses as non-recurring items.The ‚Ç¨150 million of implementation costs to deliver on the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan targets are therefore considered as non-recurring items and have been withdrawn from the underlying recurring costs.The computation of adjusted net income and earnings per share has been adjusted accordingly. The computation of reported net income and earnings per share is not impacted.2024 strategic plan targets remain unchanged and are not affected by this change in reporting.The new non-IFRS indicators are defined below.Non-IFRS financial measuresFor comparative purposes  the company provides unaudited non-IFRS measures including:Operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA  EBITDA margin  adjusted EBITDA  adjusted EBITDA margin.Non-IFRS measures are defined as follows:Operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation as the total of salary and employee benefits  and other operational expenses;Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation as the total of salary and employee benefits  and other operational expenses  excluding non-recurring costs;Underlying revenue and income as the total of revenue and income  excluding non-recurring revenue and income;Non-underlying items as items of revenue  income and expense that are material by their size and/or that are infrequent and unusual by their nature or incidence are not considered to be recurring in the normal course of business and are classified as non-underlying items on the face of the income statement within their relevant category in order to provide further understanding of the ongoing sustainable performance of the Group. These items can include: integration or double run costs of significant projects  restructuring costs and costs related to acquisitions that change the perimeter of the Group; one-off finance costs  gains or losses on sale of subsidiaries and impairments of investments: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets which are recognised as a result of acquisitions and mostly comprising customer relationships  brand names and software that were identified during purchase price allocation (PPA); tax related to non-underlying items.Adjusted operating profit as the operating profit adjusted for any non-underlying revenue and income and non-underlying costs  including PPA of acquired businesses;EBITDA as the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;Adjusted EBITDA as the adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation adjusted for any non-underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA  divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted net income  as the net income  share of the parent company shareholders  adjusted for any non-underlying items and related tax impact.Non-IFRS financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable IFRS measures and should be read only in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements.Non-volume related revenue definitionNon-volume related revenue includes Listing excl.

Accordingly  normalized fixed operating expenses in 2023 are expected to amount to c. ‚Ç¨175m - ‚Ç¨185m compared to ‚Ç¨161.6m in 2022Substantial progress has been made in the detailed and thorough review of Flow Traders' capital structure as announced at the time of the previous trading update and Flow Traders will remain focused on all arising opportunities to create shareholder value through systematic capital management going forwardManagement CommentsMike Kuehnel  CEO  stated:‚ÄúIn 2022 as a whole  we made considerable progress delivering on our strategic growth ambitions which has seen an even more resilient and diverse business emerge. It is encouraging to see a structural return on our recent investments in the business. Indeed  2022 saw record value traded versus last year across our three asset class pillars and we continue to grow our institutional counterparty base which now stands at more than 2 200. The successful completion of the update to our corporate holding structure means that we now have even greater trading flexibility and have laid the groundwork to undertake any potential inorganic growth activity.‚ÄúOperating expense growth moderated in the fourth quarter and 2023 will see a continued focus on increasing the underlying efficiency of the business as we seek to further leverage the investments made in prior years. We also maintained our conservative capital position while implementing this growth strategy. Remaining cognisant of our trading capital position as well as the growth opportunities ahead  we have elected to pay a ‚Ç¨0.80 per share final dividend to shareholders.‚ÄúDespite increasing competition for talent in the market  we have been successful in attracting and recruiting the best talent and have welcomed many new colleagues in the past year. Lastly  on behalf of the entire Board and ExCo  I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the professionalism  resilience  and loyalty of all our colleagues globally this past year. We are immensely grateful to our colleagues for their tremendous hard work which allowed for our considerable operational and strategic achievements and successes in 2022.‚ÄùFolkert Joling  Chief Trading Officer  added:‚ÄúHeightened levels of market activity delivered a strong trading performance in the fourth quarter with all regions contributing meaningfully. We have continued to expand and broaden our trading activities even further across different products and asset classes and this is reflected in the results achieved throughout 2022. Our robust and prudent approach to risk management meant that we were immaterially affected by the collapse of FTX in November and our status as a listed  transparent  seasoned market participant improved our overall standing with investors and other market participants. As to be expected  we reduced our overall trading capital exposure to the various crypto platforms we trade with  fully recognising the increased risks present in the broader crypto market. This trading capital was naturally deployed to other areas of the business. We retain our conviction around the long-term potential of crypto and DeFi from both a trading as well as a technological and financial markets innovation perspective.‚ÄúLooking ahead for 2023  we remain focused on executing our growth plans with respect to our business lines of Equity  Fixed Income and Crypto  Currencies and Commodities. Our achievements in 2022 have reinforced our confidence in our ability to deliver further growth going forward.‚ÄùPreliminary Financial Calendar24 February 2023 Release 2022 Annual Report31 March 2023 Start Silent Period ahead of Q123 trading update21 April 2023 Release Q123 trading update (no analyst conference call)26 April 2023 AGM28 April 2023 FY22 final dividend proposed ex-dividend date2 May 2023 FY22 final dividend proposed record date4 May 2023 FY22 final dividend proposed payment date30 June 2023 Start silent period ahead of H123 results21 July 2023 Release H123 results (inc. analyst conference call)Analyst Conference Call and WebcastThe Q422 results analyst conference call will be held at 10:00 am CET on Thursday 9 February 2023.

The increase in agricultural raw materials prices and widespread inflation weighed on the overall environment but without affecting our growth. Thanks to the depth of our ranges and the quality of our services  we have remained a benchmark for our customers  to whom we have offered competitiveness and secure supply. We were able to pass on the price increase by effectively managing our inventories. In terms of external growth  after BTN in Haas in 2021  we acquired Kabelis in 2022 to become a leader in the landscaping market in France and Europe. Despite all the challenges posed in 2022  we maintained our sales momentum  driven by the constant desire to safeguard our profitability. We are ready to take on new challenges in 2023 and continue to grow.‚ÄùContinued acceleration in Q4 2022: +28% (+21% organic) to ‚Ç¨35.4mQ4 2022 sales totalled ‚Ç¨35.4m  up a substantial 28% year on year. The Group achieved double-digit organic growth (+21%).For full-year 2022  consolidated revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨130.8m  up 21%  including the Kabelis Group companies acquired in July 2022. The Group‚Äôs consolidated revenue increased 10% on a like-for-like basis.Story continuesThe Farming Supplies business (89% of annual revenue)  whose products are marketed under the Vital Concept brand  generated revenue of ‚Ç¨116.8m in 2022  up 21% compared with 2021 (+10% organic). In 2022  WINFARM proactively succeeded in passing on the substantial price fluctuations of its products while responding to customer demand against a backdrop of shortages. Underpinned by keen anticipation and agility  this robust management enabled the Group to continue winning new business throughout 2022.Revenue from the Agronutrition business (10% of annual revenue)  marketed under the Alphatech brand  came out at ‚Ç¨12.2m  up sharply (+25% like-for-like and organic). The performance was driven by the Group‚Äôs aggressive sales policy  particularly in exports.2023: initial easing in pricesWINFARM expects prices to gradually return to a more normal level in 2023. By building up inventories consistent with its reasonable purchasing policy  the Group will be able to maintain its competitive edge with customers and reinforce its standing as a key player in the upstream agricultural sector in Europe.In the longer term  the Group is confirming its revenue target for 2025 of around ‚Ç¨200m and an EBITDA margin of around 6.5%. It expects to achieve half of this acceleration in growth through organic growth and half through external growth.About WINFARMFounded in Loud√©ac  in the heart of Brittany  in the early 1990s  WINFARM is now the French leader in distance selling for the agricultural world.

As of December 31  2022  the Group‚Äôs sales totaled ‚Ç¨753.3 million  up 2.9% from the 2021 fiscal year. This revenue includes a favorable currency effect of ‚Ç¨29.3 million  mainly due to the dollar‚Äôs appreciation over the period. At constant exchange rates (CER)  activity was down slightly by -1.1% over the year.Distribution of consolidated group revenue by quarter (IFRS)In millions of euros2022at current exchange ratesChange (%)2022at constant exchange rates1Change (%) 20211st quarter 181.1 +2.7% 177.3 +0.5% 176.3 2nd quarter 190.0 +1.7% 181.0 -3.1% 186.8 3rd quarter 198.1 +11.4% 187.0 +5.1% 177.9 4th quarter 184.1 -3.7% 178.7 -6.5% 191.1 Total 753.3 +2.9% 724.0 -1.1% 732.1[1] Constant exchange rates (CER): the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous fiscal year.In 2022  activity slowed at the Raleigh (North America) industrial site  affecting sales worldwide  mainly due to delays in the production of Optiray¬Æ and pre-filled syringes.As a reminder  the decrease in the Raleigh site‚Äôs production rates last year was due to two factors:Production line priority was given to manufacturing Elucirem TM over the fourth quarter as Guerbet awaited the FDA marketing authorization (MA)  which was obtained on September 21.As was the case with the region‚Äôs entire industrial area  the Raleigh site faced significant recruitment difficulties in the first half of 2022. Guerbet‚Äôs new organization led to a sharp upturn in hiring in the summer. However  given the time needed for training on the production lines  production rates were still not fully back to normal at the end of 2022.Story continuesGeographical distribution of consolidated group revenue (IFRS)In millions of euros at December 31  20222022at current exchange ratesChange (%)2022at constant exchange rates1Change (%) 2021Sales in EMEA 328.6 -2.3% 329.9 -1.9% 336.2 Sales in Americas 228.5 +3.7% 203.8 -7.5% 220.5 Sales in Asia 196.1 +11.8% 190.2 +8.5% 175.4 Total 753.3 +2.9% 724.0 -1.1% 732.1[1] Constant exchange rates: the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous fiscal year.In the EMEA region  the Group‚Äôs activity was down -1.9% at CER in the wake of lower volumes and slight price erosion stemming from the regulatory price reductions in France. In addition  the shutdown of commercial activity in Turkey last November had an impact on fourth quarter revenue.In the Americas  sales rose 3.7% over the year thanks to a significant currency effect (+‚Ç¨24.7 million). The decline in activity at CER (-7.5%) was entirely due to lower volumes  attributable to production delays at the Raleigh site.Activity in Asia saw vigorous annual growth (+8.5% at CER)  with an acceleration in the second half of the year. Performance in China (+45.6% in 2022) was driven by the rollout of direct distribution  which benefited nearly all of the Group‚Äôs products as of the end of 2022.Distribution of consolidated group revenue by activity (IFRS)In millions of euros at December 31  20222022at current exchange ratesChange (%)2022at constant exchange rates1Change (%) 2021Diagnostic Imaging 662.8 +1.7% 637.3 -2.2% 651.8 MRI 247.5 +5.5% 238.5 +1.7% 234.6 X-Ray 415.3 -0.5% 398.8 -4.4% 417.2 Interventional Imaging 90.4 +12.7% 86.7 +8.1% 80.2 Total 753.3 +2.9% 724.0 -1.1% 732.1[1] Constant exchange rates: the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous fiscal year.Annual revenue in Diagnostic Imaging was up 1.7% at current exchange rates and down -2.2% at CER.In MRI  annual sales rose 1.7% at CER (+5.5% at current exchange rates) owing to higher volumes. Price erosion was minimal despite the launch of generic Dotarem¬Æ in the United States.X-ray activity declined -4.4% at CER in 2022 due to the lower revenue from Optiray¬Æ. Sales of Xenetix¬Æ (+5.5%) and injection solutions (+4.8%) remained strong throughout the year.In Interventional Imaging  activity rose 12.7% at current exchange rates over the year and 8.1% at CER thanks to the remarkable momentum of Lipiodol¬Æ. Its sales accelerated considerably in the second half of the year  especially in the fourth quarter (+33.3% at CER).Confirmation of the 2022 profitability target  acceleration of activity in 2023For 2022  despite the revenue shortfall associated with the temporary drop in production in Raleigh  Guerbet confirmed its ability to generate an EBITDA margin of between 13% and 14%  excluding extraordinary costs from the optimization of the Group‚Äôs operating structure and changes in the sales model in China. In addition  following the announcements released on November 3  2022  and January 16  2023  on its new strategic orientations in Augmented Intelligence and Interventional Imaging  the Group specifies that it will record for fiscal 2022  asset impairments related to Accurate Medical Therapeutics and software developed with IBM Watson.In 2023  the Raleigh site‚Äôs production rates should return to full capacity in the first quarter  bringing the commercial activity back up to standard in the second quarter. Guerbet will therefore be in a position to take full advantage of the favorable trend in the contrast agents market in terms of both volumes and prices. The Group intends to strengthen its positions in Diagnostic Imaging with the commercial launch of EluciremTM in the United States and Europe at the end of the year  as well as in Interventional Imaging  where the very positive momentum of Lipiodol¬Æ is expected to continue.Given all these factors  despite the persistent inflationary pressures affecting its supply costs (mainly iodine)  the Group is confident for 2023. Its revenue growth target for this year is above 5% on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates.About GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

The findings were published in the journal The Lancet Haematology.CYAD-01 is the Company‚Äôs first autologous CAR T-cell candidate  based on the natural killer receptor NKG2D  assessed clinically. The completed THINK study was an open-label  dose-escalation Phase 1 study for patients with r/r AML  MDS  or MM  after at least one previous line of therapy. Patients were recruited from five hospitals in the USA and Belgium.The Lancet Haematology publication includes data from the 16 patients treated with CYAD-01 in the dose escalation segment of the study  which evaluated three dose levels of CYAD-01 using a schedule of three infusions at two-week intervals in the absence of any preconditioning chemotherapy. Overall  CYAD-01 showed favourable safety data with signs of clinical activity with three of the 12 evaluable AML/MDS patients presenting an objective response.Importantly  the THINK study is one of the first completed dose-escalation CAR T-cell studies in r/r AML/MDS. Unlike the majority of the studies evaluating CAR T-cell therapy candidates  the THINK study evaluated multiple infusions of CYAD-01 as a stand-alone product candidate (i.e.  without prior bridging or preconditioning chemotherapy). This feature is of particular interest considering the median older age and the poorer general condition of patients with r/r AML or MDS at diagnosis.Although the need to improve the anti-tumour activity is warranted  these data in a difficult-to-treat patient population potentially provide the proof-of-concept of targeting NKG2D ligands by a CAR T-cell product candidate  and support the further development of NKG2D-based CAR T-cell therapies.About Celyad OncologyCelyad Oncology is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of innovative technologies for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies. The Company is focusing on opportunities to fully harness the true potential of its proprietary technology platforms and intellectual property and support the development of next-generation CAR T candidates in solid tumors and hematological malignancies.

As of 9 January 2023  7 patients diagnosed with rrCLL (4 patients with RT) were enrolled in the study (n=4 at dose level 1 (DL1); n=3 at dose level 2 (DL2)). All patients received GLPG5201 as a fresh infusion with a median vein-to-vein time of 7 days. The dose levels that are evaluated in the Phase 1 part of the study are 35x106 (DL1)  100x106 (DL2) and 300x106 (dose level 3 (DL3)) CAR+ viable T cells.The initial results from these 7 patients that were eligible for efficacy analysis (cut-off date: 9 January 2023) indicated that a 7-day vein-to-vein time is feasible and demonstrated strong and consistent in vivo CAR-T expansion levels. Moreover  the initial efficacy results are encouraging with an objective response rate (ORR) of 100% observed. 6 out of 7 patients (86%) reached a complete response (CR) and all Richter‚Äôs patients achieved a CR. A duration of response of up to 7.9 months has been reported and follow-up is ongoing. Only 1 patient (DL1) progressed (progressive disease  PD  after partial response  PR) and had a CD19-negative relapse with confirmed Richter‚Äôs transformation.Story continuesIn the safety analysis of these 7 patients  adverse events were consistent with the known toxicities of CD19 CAR-T treatment. None of the patients experienced a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) higher than grade 2 at both dose levels and no immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) was reported. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported and the majority of grade ‚â•3 adverse events were hematological. Only one serious adverse event was reported at DL2 with a patient experiencing a CRS grade 2  but the event was resolved after 7 days.‚ÄúWe were very pleased to present strong initial data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 study of our fresh CD19 CAR-T candidate manufactured at point-of-care. This marks an important milestone in our journey to transform the lives of patients with severe blood cancers  including patients with RT  through the acceleration of innovation and breakthrough science‚Äù  said Dr. Paul Stoffels1  CEO of Galapagos. ‚ÄúWe look forward to reporting Phase 1 topline data around mid-year.‚ÄùDetails of the poster presentation:Abstract Title Authors Presentation date/time Initial Clinical Results of Euplagia-1  a Phase I/II Trial of Point-of-CareManufactured GLPG5201 in R/R CLL/SLL with or without Richter's transformationNuria Martinez-Cibrian  Sergi Betriu  Valentin Ortiz-Maldonado  Daniel Estban  Leticia Alserawan  Mercedes Montoro  Anna DD van Muyden  Maike Spoon  Margot J.

The proprietary platform consists of CellPoint‚Äôs end-to-end xCellit workflow management and monitoring software and Lonza‚Äôs Cocoon¬Æ Platform  a functionally closed  automated manufacturing platform for cell therapies.About the EUPLAGIA-1 study (EudraCT 2021-003815-25)EUPLAGIA-1 is an ongoing Phase 1/2 open-label  multi-center study evaluating the feasibility  safety  and efficacy of point-of-care manufactured GLPG5201 in patients with relapsed/refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (rrCLL) and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (rrSLL)  with or without Richter‚Äôs transformation (RT). GLPG5201 is a second generation anti-CD19/4-1BB CAR-T product candidate  administered as intravenous infusion of a fresh product candidate in a single fixed dose. Patients with CD19+ rrCLL or rrSLL with >2 lines of therapy are eligible to participate  and patients with RT are eligible regardless of prior therapy. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the study is to evaluate safety and determine the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of the study. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to assess the objective response rate (ORR) and the secondary objectives include the analysis of the complete response rate (CRR)  duration of response  progression free survival  overall survival  safety pharmacokinetic profile  and feasibility of point-of-care manufacturing.The planned dose levels that are evaluated in the Phase 1 part of the study are 35x106 (DL1)  100x106 (DL2) and 300x106 (DL3) CAR+ viable T cells. The study uses a Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design (n=15 patients) for Phase 1. Following screening and enrolment  patients will receive ibrutinib continuously until leukapheresis of mononuclear cells. During GLPG5201 manufacturing  patients receive cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2/day)/fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day) for 3 days. After a resting period of at least 2 days  GLPG5201 is administered via intravenous infusion. All patients remain hospitalized for at least 7 days and the end-of-study visit is at Week 14 post CAR-T infusion. The study is currently enrolling rrCLL/SLL patients in Europe  including patients with Richter‚Äôs transformation  and we aim to provide topline results for Phase 1 around mid-2023.About Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Small Lymphocytic LymphomaChronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is one of the chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (lymphoid neoplasms). It is characterized by a progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes  which are usually monoclonal in origin. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Small Lymphocytic Leukemia (SLL) are essentially the same type of B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)  with the only difference the location where the primary cancer occurs. CLL affects B-cells in the blood and bone marrow and SLL cancer cells are located in lymph nodes and/or the spleen2. Richter's transformation is an uncommon clinicopathological condition observed in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). It is characterized by the sudden transformation of the CLL into a significantly more aggressive form of large cell lymphoma  and occurs in approximately 2-10% of all CLL patients. CLL/SLL usually follows an indolent course and is an incurable disease. Patients who develop relapsed and refractory disease and become resistant to new agents have a dismal prognosis and a high unmet medical need for new therapeutic options such as CAR-T cells. With estimated incidence of 4.7 new cases per 100 000 individuals  CLL/SLL are the most prevalent lymphoid malignancy and are the most common adult leukemias in the US and in Europe3.About GalapagosGalapagos is a fully integrated biotechnology company focused on discovering  developing  and commercializing innovative medicines.

In particular  tenant sales and rent collection returned to pre-pandemic levels and we delivered consistent improvement in operating metrics across all regions.Our proactive leasing strategy yielded a higher proportion of longer-term leases at increased rents while we also benefitted from Sales Based Rents and the positive impact of indexation. In 2023  we will perform as retailers and brands optimise their store networks with us  with a focus on the most productive stores in prime locations as part of their drive-to-store strategies.Strong growth in Commercial Partnerships revenues clearly demonstrated the opportunity to generate new revenues from qualifying the audience of visitors to our centres  especially in Europe where we launched Westfield Rise  an in-house media advertising agency.Higher earnings  combined with a -‚Ç¨1.9 Bn debt reduction thanks to disposals in the US and Europe  translated into enhanced credit metrics. The Group‚Äôs robust operational performance and strong liquidity position allows us to progress our deleveraging programme in a timely and orderly manner  including the radical reduction of our US financial exposure.The Group is on track to deliver its ‚Äú2024 and beyond‚Äù strategy  which includes maximising asset value through the disciplined delivery of our committed pipeline and unlocking new development opportunities  with a focus on urban regeneration and environmental transition projects.‚ÄùFY-2022 FY-2021 Growth Like-for-like growth5 Net Rental Income (in ‚Ç¨ Mn) 2 226 1 724 29.1% 27.4%6 Shopping Centres 2 024 1 632 24.0% 21.5%7 Offices & Others 70 60 16.0% 23.2% Convention & Exhibition 132 32 n.m. n.m.

All regions benefitted from higher variable income and lower doubtful debtors due to higher rent collection including 2021 rents. Performance in Continental Europe was also positively impacted by the end of COVID-19 rent discounts as well as indexation  and in the UK by lower rent relief and higher Sales Based Rents (SBR). The US benefitted from higher SBR  parking income and Commercial Partnerships  partly offset by negative MGR uplifts on short-term deals. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 rent relief  the like-for-like NRI growth would be +7.8% for the Group.2022 tenant sales9 were at 103% of 2019 levels  including 101% in Continental Europe  96% in the UK and 108% in the US  and footfall10 was at 90% of 2019 levels  including 88% in Continental Europe  89% in the UK and 94% in the US (96% excluding Westfield World Trade Center and Westfield San Francisco Centre in which footfall remains affected by work-from-home trends). Footfall is expected to continue to grow as vacancy decreases.In H2-2022  European tenant sales reached 102% of 2019 levels (vs. 98% in H1-2022). Sales performance in 2022 differed by sector in Europe. In particular  Health and Beauty was +11%  Sports +15%  while Fashion -5% and Entertainment -12% vs. 2019 levels. Entertainment saw an improvement from -14% in H1 to -10% in H2 and Fashion from -7% to -2%.In the US  tenant sales have consistently outperformed pre-COVID levels since H1-2021. Overall  2022 sales came to 108% of 2019 levels driven by Flagship assets at 117%  Regionals at 100% and partly offset by the Central Business District (‚ÄúCBD‚Äù)11 assets at 74%. The strong growth continued to be broad-based with almost all categories performing above 2019 levels  such as Luxury (+83%)  Home (+37%)  F&B (+10%) and Fashion (+3%). Entertainment saw an improvement from -25% in H1 to -12% in H2.Rent collection12 amounted to 97% for 2022 (vs. 88% at FY-2021 and 96% in H1-2022)  including 97% in Continental Europe  99% in the UK and 97% in the US  returning to pre-COVID levels. The Group continued to collect 2021 rents  leading to an improvement of 2021 rent collection from 88% to 93% between February 2022 and December 2022.URW signed ‚Ç¨441 Mn of MGR13 during 2022 (+26% compared to 2021) with an MGR uplift of +6.2% (vs. -5.2% in 2021). As market conditions improved  the proportion of long-term deals signed also increased from 61% of MGR signed in 2021 to 68% in 2022. The MGR uplift for leases longer than 36 months came to +14.4% for the Group  with Continental Europe at +8.9%  the UK at +3.6% and the US at +36.0%.SBR14  which are mainly generated in the US  increased to ‚Ç¨123.6 Mn in 2022 (6.1% of NRI) from ‚Ç¨80.2 Mn in 2021 (5.0% of NRI) of which ‚Ç¨77.7 Mn was for the US and ‚Ç¨45.9 Mn for Europe.Vacancy for Shopping Centres at a Group level decreased significantly to 6.5% at FY-2022  down from 8.9% at H1-2021 and 7.0% at FY-2021. In Continental Europe  vacancy was 3.1%  down from 4.0% in December 2021 and 5.0% in June 2021. In the UK  vacancy also decreased from 12.2% in June 2021 and 10.6% in December 2021 to 9.4% at FY-2022. In the US  the vacancy reduced to 10.4% at FY-2022 from 14.0% in June 2021 and 11.0% at FY-2021  with vacancy decreasing by -110 bps year-on-year to 8.2% in the Flagships.Indexation and inflationURW rents are indexed on a yearly basis in Continental Europe. 2022 indexation contribution to like-for-like retail NRI performance in Continental Europe was +3.6%  reflecting 2021 inflation due to the usual time lag between contractual indexation and inflation. In the UK and the US  leases are not tied to actual CPI figures but the Group benefitted from inflation through SBR.Commercial PartnershipsRevenue from Commercial Partnerships15 increased from ‚Ç¨76.2 Mn in 2021 to ‚Ç¨115.5 Mn in 2022  driven in part by the launch in Europe of Westfield Rise  an in-house media  brand experience and data partnerships agency.Total Westfield Rise activity in Europe amounted to ‚Ç¨45.5 Mn in net margin at 100% share in 2022  up +23% compared to 2019 (and +52% compared to 202116). This new division (for which figures are reported at 100%) will generate ‚Ç¨75 Mn16 in annual net margin by 2024  a +‚Ç¨45 Mn increase compared to 2021  with strong potential growth beyond 2024.Offices & OthersOffice NRI increased by +16.0%  primarily as a result of deliveries of Pullman Montparnasse and Ga√Æt√© Montparnasse offices  partly offset by 2021 and 2022 disposals  especially Solna Centrum. On a like-for-like basis  office NRI increased by +23.2%  with +44.2% in France  mainly due to leasing activity at Trinity in La D√©fense  now 74% let.Two new leases (Santarelli and Alain Afflelou) were signed for Trinity in 2022 at an average rent of c. ‚Ç¨567/sqm17  with lease incentives below the market average. In addition  33 100 sqm were leased on projects  including Lightwell in La D√©fense (80% pre-let) and Westfield Hamburg offices (29% pre-let)  both due to be delivered in 2024.Convention & ExhibitionIn 2022  Viparis hosted 617 events (including 189 exhibitions  75 congresses and 353 corporate events) compared to 236 events in 2020 and 721 events in 2018.Convention & Exhibition recurring NOI amounted to ‚Ç¨190.2 Mn compared to ‚Ç¨55.2 Mn in 2021 and ‚Ç¨164.7 Mn in 2018. This includes the ‚Ç¨25 Mn contribution from the French State to compensate closure periods in earlier years. Restated from this and triennial shows (held in 2018 and 2022)  the NOI is slightly above 2018  due to the strong recovery of activity and the shift of certain biannual shows  despite the remaining impact of COVID-19 in the first quarter.As at January 31  2023  signed and pre-booked events in Viparis venues for 2023 amounted to 86%18 of 2019 pre-bookings  the last comparable year.D ISPOSALSIn total  the Group completed disposals in Europe and in the US that represents ‚Ç¨1.8 Bn of IFRS net debt reduction.In Europe  URW completed disposals in 2022 that represents a ‚Ç¨1.2 Bn of IFRS net debt reduction at an average NIY of 5.5% and an average premium to last unaffected book value of +2.7%.

In addition  URW‚Äôs partner in Aupark exercised its call option for the acquisition of an additional 27% stake.In total  URW has now reached ‚Ç¨3.2 Bn19 of its ‚Ç¨4.0 Bn European disposals programme representing 80%  at an average NIY of 4.9% (including 5.4% for the Shopping Centres and 3.9% for the Offices & Others)  a premium to the last unaffected appraisal of +4.9% (including +1.3% for the Shopping Centres and +12.3% for the Offices & Others). The Group expects to complete the European disposals programme during 2023.URW will continue the asset and property management for several of the assets sold  including Aupark  Westfield Carr√© S√©nart  Gera Arcaden and Carr√© S√©nart Shopping Parc  allowing the Group to earn management fees and consequently increase the return on investment for those assets.In the US  the Group also continued efforts to streamline its US Regional portfolio with the completion in 2022 of a total of $0.6 Bn of disposals20. These include the disposals of the Promenade development parcel in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles  Westfield Santa Anita  The Village at Topanga  as well as Westfield Trumbull and Westfield South Shore. These transactions were completed at a discount of -0.5% to 2021 book value. Together with the disposal of the Palisade residential building and the ownership transfer of five other regional properties in 2021  URW has made $1.3 Bn in total proceeds to date from the planned radical reduction of its financial exposure to the US.In 2023  the Group will continue to streamline its remaining US Regional asset portfolio. URW is committed to the radical reduction of its financial exposure to the US  a process that is supported by the strong operational performance of the assets and the Group‚Äôs liquidity position.DELIVERIES & PIPELINEThe Total Investment Cost (TIC)21 of URW‚Äôs development pipeline decreased by -‚Ç¨0.1 Bn to ‚Ç¨3.1 Bn  compared to December 31  2021  mainly as a result of the delivery of projects  representing ‚Ç¨0.4 Bn  new projects and increasing costs.In 2022  the Group delivered the 19 439 sqm Westfield Topanga extension  ‚ÄúRue de la Boucle‚Äù  a 10 000 sqm destination at Westfield Forum des Halles  the Ga√Æt√© Montparnasse Office project as well as Les Ateliers Ga√Æt√© shopping centre (33 364 sqm) to complete the Ga√Æt√© Montparnasse mixed-use complex  one of the most ambitious and largest urban regeneration projects in Paris. The average letting22 of these deliveries stands at 88% as at December 31  2022.Committed projects amount to ‚Ç¨2.4 Bn  of which ‚Ç¨1.2 Bn has already been invested. The two main projects are the mixed used development in Hamburg (Westfield Hamburg-√úberseequartier) and the residential project of Coppermaker Square.In 2023  URW plans to deliver the Garbera shopping centre extension project  Coppermaker Square Retail (a leisure development adjacent to Westfield Stratford City)  the renovation project of the Westfield Les 4 Temps main plaza ‚ÄúLa Clairi√®re‚Äù  CNIT Eole  a redevelopment at the CNIT shopping centre  and Fisketorvet dining area. The average pre-letting22 of these projects stands at 81%.VALUATIONThe proportionate Gross Market Value (GMV) of the Group‚Äôs assets as at December 31  2022  decreased by-4.1% to ‚Ç¨52.2 Bn from ‚Ç¨54.5 Bn as at December 31  2021  mainly as a result of disposals (-‚Ç¨1.8 Bn) and a like-for-like portfolio revaluation of -‚Ç¨1.3 Bn (-2.7%)  partly offset by CAPEX  Acquisitions and Transfers (+‚Ç¨0.9 Bn) and positive FX moves (+‚Ç¨0.4 Bn). The like-for-like shopping centres valuation was -2.6% for 2022 including-2.3% in H2 as appraisers increased their assumption of discount and exit cap rates.The EPRA Net Reinstatement Value per share came to ‚Ç¨155.70 as at December 31  2022  down -‚Ç¨3.90 (-2.4%) compared to December 31  2021  mainly driven by the revaluation of investment properties  partly offset by the retained recurring results.FINANCIAL RESOURCESAs at December 31  2022  the Group‚Äôs IFRS net financial debt decreased to ‚Ç¨20.7 Bn (from ‚Ç¨22.6 Bn as at December 31  2021) mainly driven by the disposals completed in 2022.The Group‚Äôs credit metrics improved over the period supported by strong operational performance and deleveraging progress. URW‚Äôs Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio23 decreased to 41.2% (vs. 43.3% as at December 31  2021)  Net debt/EBITDA24 ratio decreased to 9.6x (vs. 13.7x in 2021)  below its 2019 level (9.9x)  the Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) increased to 4.2x (vs. 3.3x in 2021)  and Funds from Operations to Net Financial Debt (FFO/NFD) ratio improved to 7.6% (vs. 5.0% in 2021).Over 2022  URW further strengthened its liquidity position by raising ‚Ç¨1 332 Mn (‚Ç¨1 682 Mn on a proportionate basis) of medium to long-term funds25 in the mortgage and corporate bank debt market  out of which ‚Ç¨900 Mn (‚Ç¨1 250 Mn on a proportionate basis) is sustainability-linked.The Group‚Äôs liquidity position increased by ca. +‚Ç¨0.9 Bn over the year to reach ‚Ç¨13.0 Bn and ‚Ç¨13.2 Bn on a proportionate basis including ‚Ç¨3.3 Bn of cash on hand26 (vs. ‚Ç¨2.3 Bn as at December 31  2021)  allowing the Group to fully secure its debt maturities for the next 36 months.Regarding the ‚Ç¨1.25 Bn perpetual non-call 2023 hybrid  the terms and conditions of the instrument provide for the issuer a call option27 in 2023  and annually thereafter.The decision regarding this call will be made ahead of its First Reset Date28 (i.e. October 25  2023).The Group‚Äôs average debt maturity29 stood at 8.3 years.The Group‚Äôs average cost of debt remained stable at 2.0%  representing a blended average cost of 1.5% for Euro30 denominated debt and 3.8% for USD and GBP denominated debt  thanks to both the Group‚Äôs hedging instruments in place limiting the impact of rates increases and to positive cash deposit rates.The Group‚Äôs debt is fully hedged for 2023 and the following years  limiting the impact of any rates increase on the Group‚Äôs financial expenses for 2023.ESG2022 marks another year of ESG progress for the Group under its Better Places 2030 strategy. Having achieved a -17% reduction of energy intensity since 2015 in Europe  URW set an additional target to reduce its energy intensity by -15% in 2022 compared to 2019 in Europe to support national and European efforts to address the energy crisis. Thanks to a range of proactive measures  URW was able to outperform this target  reaching -19.8%  supporting both governments efforts and mitigating costs impacts for tenants.URW is on track to meet all Better Places 2030 targets  including cutting carbon emissions by 50% between 2015 and 2030. The Group is committed to contribute to global carbon neutrality and will present a step-change update to its plan in autumn 2023  with a view to establishing new commitments.The Group‚Äôs CSR agenda was recognised by equity and debt investors as a value creation driver for its stakeholders. In 2022  URW inclusion in the main ESG indices was confirmed and the Group‚Äôs sustainability achievements were registered in ratings and awards.2023 GUIDANCEThanks to the improvement in 2022 operating performance  higher indexation  the positioning of the Group on prime and well-located assets  and retailers‚Äô drive-to-store strategies  as well as deleveraging progress  URW is well-positioned to continue to perform in what is expected to remain an uncertain macro environment in 2023.In this context  the Group forecasts its 2023 AREPS to be in the range of ‚Ç¨9.30 to ‚Ç¨9.50. The main drivers of this guidance are:Consistent performance in our retail operations versus 2022 with inflation protection through indexation and SBR;The impact of large event scheduling changes in 2022  leading to a naturally lower Convention & Exhibition activity in 2023;Full-year effect of 2022 disposals  impact of US regional streamlining and the European disposal programme;Contribution of 2022 and 2023 project deliveries;Stable cost of funding thanks to Group‚Äôs hedging programme;FX impact with the strengthening of the Euro vs. USD.This guidance does not include major disposals in the US in the context of the radical reduction of its financial exposure.The Group assumes no major energy-related restrictions  nor major deterioration to the macro-economic and geopolitical environment.DIVIDENDComplying with the deleveraging commitments made in 2021  the Group will not pay a dividend for fiscal year 2022.Given the statutory results of URW SE in 2022 (+‚Ç¨90 Mn in 2022 and cumulated negative retained earnings of -‚Ç¨2 341 Mn)  the Group has no obligation to pay a dividend in 2023 for the fiscal year 2022 under the SIIC regime and other REIT regimes it benefits from. Consequently  URW SE‚Äôs total carry forward SIIC distribution obligation  standing at ‚Ç¨1 720 Mn as at December 31  2022  will be delayed until URW SE has sufficient statutory results to meet this obligation. These statutory results do not prevent URW SE from making distributions out of its premium.EURONEXT LISTINGThe Group started discussions with Euronext in order to change its market of reference from Euronext Amsterdam to Euronext Paris as part of an initiative to simplify its structure given limited trading activity on that market. As a part of this request  the Group intends to delist the URW Stapled Shares from Euronext Amsterdam  while maintaining a single listing on Euronext Paris. The delisting from Euronext Amsterdam would not affect the liquidity of the shares nor have any impact on trading  URW‚Äôs organisation (including the stapled share principle) or the ISIN code (FR0013326246) of the Group.Subject to approval by the Euronext Listing Board  the Group expects these changes to be effective by the end of April 2023.Further information regarding this process will be communicated as appropriate.FINANCIAL SCHEDULEThe next financial events on the Group‚Äôs calendar will be:April 26  2023: Q1 trading updateMay 10  2023: AGM Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield SEJuly 27  2023: H1-2023 resultsFor further information  please contact:Investor RelationsAudrey Arnoux+33 6 61 27 07 39Audrey.Arnoux@urw.comMedia RelationsUK/Global:Cornelia Schnepf ‚Äì Finelk+44 7387 108 998Cornelia.Schnepf@finelk.euFrance:Sonia Fellmann ‚Äì PLEAD+33 6 27 84 91 30Sonia.Fellmann@plead.frUnited States:Molly Morse ‚Äì Kekst CNC+ 1 212 521 4826Molly.Morse@kekstcnc.comAbout Unibail-Rodamco-WestfieldUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield is an owner  developer and operator of sustainable  high-quality real estate assets in the most dynamic cities in Europe and the United States.The Group operates 78 shopping centres in 12 countries  including 45 which carry the iconic Westfield brand.

All primary endpoints were met in POSEIDON  our pivotal North American alfapump study  allowing us to prepare for PMA filing and US commercial launch planned for 2024. We believe that there is a clear need for improved treatment options for the large and growing number of patients suffering from recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. The North American market is forecast to grow between 6-7% annually reaching over 170 000 patients in 2035  representing a total addressable market for the alfapump of over US $2.5bn2.‚Äù‚ÄúOur DSR therapy demonstrated substantial long-lasting clinical benefits in decompensated heart failure patients. Top-line data from our SAHARA study showed the safe  effective and rapid elimination of persistent congestion  important improvements in cardiovascular and renal health  and the restoration of diuretic response of the kidney. We are very excited by the great potential of DSR as a disease-modifying therapy that could help the estimated 200 000 US heart failure patients suffering from diuretic-resistant congestion. We have moved swiftly with our second-generation DSR product  successfully completing GLP pre-clinical safety studies  dosing the first patients in our Phase 1 single-dose studies and we are looking forward to starting MOJAVE  our US Phase 1/2a randomized controlled multi-center study in patients with congestive heart failure in Q2 2023.‚ÄùStory continues‚ÄúAs we prepare for commercialization of the alfapump in North America  we have continued to strengthen our Board with the addition of Doug Kohrs and Alexandra Clyde  two seasoned US medtech executives who bring with them invaluable knowledge and expertise in light of the next stage of Sequana Medical‚Äôs development.‚Äù‚ÄúWe are also pleased to welcome Rosetta Capital  an experienced long-term life sciences investor  as shareholders following the purchase of the shares held by Neomed V.‚Äù202 2 h ighlightsalfapump in liver diseasePOSEIDON ‚Äì North American pivotal study of the alfa pump in patients with recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis successfully met primary endpoint data: Reported positive top-line results in October 2022 from 40 patients of the Pivotal Cohort at six months post-implantation  including primary effectiveness endpoints substantially exceeding the predefined thresholds for study success and safety in line with expectations: 100% median per-patient reduction in therapeutic paracentesis (TP) post- vs pre-implantation (p<0.001)  vs hypothesis of at least 50% reduction. 77% of patients with at least 50% reduction in number of TP post- vs pre-implantation (p<0.001)  vs hypothesis of at least 50% of patients. Six primary safety events of which three involved explants due to wound or skin erosion  and three explants due to patient-reported discomfort (all patient-reported discomfort events were adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee as moderate severity)  in line with expectations. Reported results of a preliminary interim analysis 3 of patient survival from the Roll-In Cohort in April 2022 including 70% survival rate at one year post-implantation  comparing favorably to published literature of 50% survival rate for refractory ascites patients after one year 4 . Prof. Wong presented safety  efficacy and quality of life data from the Roll-In Cohort at the AASLD The Liver Meeting¬Æ in November 2022.US patient preference study initiated: Survey study to quantify patients‚Äô preferences for the alfa pump including treatment effectiveness and risks of treatment-related adverse events.

All patients improved their NYHA 6 status by at least one class. Clinical benefits result in a 75% reduction in predicted one-year mortality pre- vs. post-intensive DSR therapy based on the Seattle Heart Failure Model 7 .Focus on Short Term DSR therapy with proprietary DSR 2.0: Based on the results of RED DESERT and SAHARA  the Company expects that an intensive treatment period of three to four weeks of DSR therapy may deliver at least twelve months of important clinical benefits. As a result of the strong  durable clinical signals observed  the Company will focus the heart failure development program on Short Term DSR with its proprietary second-generation DSR product (DSR 2.0) administered via a peritoneal catheter. DSR 2.0 is expected to have an improved therapeutic and favorable safety profile with robust intellectual property protection.MOJAVE ‚Äì US Phase 1/2a randomized controlled multi-center study of DSR 2.0 in diuretic-resistant chronic heart failure patients with persistent congestion  on track to start in Q2 2023: Good progress of DSR 2.0 in product development and GLP 8 animal studies. Approval to start two Phase 1 single-arm  open-label  single-dose studies in Canada (YUKON) and Mexico (CHIHUAHUA) to evaluate the safety  tolerability and efficacy of DSR 2.0  with first patient dosed successfully in YUKON. Data from the GLP animal and Phase 1 CHIHUAHUA studies are intended to support the US IND 9 application filing of DSR 2.0  planned for Q1 2023. Preparations ongoing to start the MOJAVE study  planned for Q2 2023  assuming FDA approval of the US IND application. The intention is to enroll 30 diuretic-resistant chronic heart failure patients with persistent congestion  with 20 patients randomized to DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter on top of usual care for congestive heart failure (CHF) for up to four weeks and ten patients randomized to usual care for CHF alone.CorporateEuropean Medical Device Regulation (MDR) certification: Received MDR certification from the Company‚Äôs Notified Body  BSI  in February 2022  confirming that its QMS 10 and alfa pump system are compliant with the latest regulatory standards required for medical devices in Europe. alfa pump is one of the first novel Class III active implantable medical devices to receive such certification.Expanding the Board of Directors with seasoned US medtech executives: Appointed two highly experienced US medtech leaders as independent Non-Executive Directors.

The Company‚Äôs ability to continue operations also depends on its ability to raise additional capital and to refinance existing debt  in order to fund operations and assure the solvency of the Company until revenues reach a level to sustain positive cash flows.The impact of macroeconomic conditions and the geopolitical situation in Ukraine on the Company‚Äôs ability to secure additional financing rounds or undertake capital market transactions remains unclear at this point in time and will remain under review by the Executive Management and the Board of Directors.The above conditions indicate the existence of material uncertainties  which may also cast significant doubt about the Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern.With the existing cash resources  the current cash runway is sufficient into mid-2023. The Company continues to evaluate equity and other financing options  including discussions with existing as well as new investors.The Executive Management and the Board of Directors remain confident about the strategic plan  which comprises additional financing measures including equity and/or other financing sources  and therefore consider the financial information in this press release on a going concern basis as appropriate.Consolidated statement of cash flowsNet cash outflow from operating activities was ‚Ç¨27.48 million in 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨23.62 million in 2021. The outflow was mainly driven by higher net loss of the period.Cash flow from investing activities resulted in a net outflow of ‚Ç¨0.65 million in 2022  compared to a net outflow of ‚Ç¨0.34 million in 2021.Cash flow from financing activities resulted in a net inflow of ‚Ç¨37.32 million in 2022  mainly as a result of the proceeds from the equity placement in H1 2022  and the ‚Ç¨10 million loan facility with Kreos Capital secured in H2 2022. In 2021  the net inflow of ‚Ç¨22.44 million was mainly a result of the February 2021 equity placement.The Company ended 2022 with a total cash and cash equivalents amount of ‚Ç¨18.88 million (2021: ‚Ç¨9.60 million).Conference Call and WebcastSequana Medical will host a conference call with live webcast presentation today at 03:00 pm CEST / 09:00 am EST.Registration webcast: please click hereRegistration conference call (only if you wish to participate in the Q&A): please click here.

Furthermore  ¬ß¬ß 11-12 would be abolished (as the substantive contents would be incorporate into the revised ¬ß 10.The amended paragraphs of the Articles of Association would read as follows:‚ÄúArticle 10The notice convening a General Meeting of shareholders must be delivered to the shareholders by publishing the notice on the company‚Äôs website no more than three (3) months and no less than three (3) weeks prior to the General Meeting of shareholders  however  in any case  at least nine (9) days prior to the record date of the General Meeting of shareholders  as referred to in the Finnish Companies Act.

The legislative changes are based on the premise that  irrespective of the chosen general meeting format  shareholders' rights must not be compromised and that all participating shareholders can exercise their shareholder rights in full in real time  including the right to present questions and vote. The possibility to organise general meetings remotely enables the Company to prepare for rapid changes in the Company's operating environment and society in general  which may be caused  for example  by pandemics.

Underwriting profit amounted to EUR 1 314 million (1 282)  representing year-on-year growth of 2 per cent or 13 per cent adjusted for COVID-19 effects reported in 2021. The Group combined ratio was solid at 82.1 per cent (81.4)  supported by excellent performance in Nordic P&C and benefits from higher discount rates. Excluding the reported COVID-19 effects in 2021  the combined ratio would have improved by 1.0 percentage points year-on-year. Gross written premiums increased by 6 per cent to EUR 8 136 million (7 644)  driven by strong renewals  high retention and disciplined pricing. Sampo targets mid-single digit per cent underwriting profit growth on average and a combined ratio below 86 per cent for 2021-2023.If P&C‚Äôs underwriting profit increased 11 per cent to EUR 985 million (891) and the combined ratio improved to 80.3 per cent (81.3). The result was driven by a 7.2 per cent currency adjusted premium growth and continued strong underlying performance. Premium development was supported by broad-based growth across all business areas  with Industrial and the Baltics seeing the most notable positive development. In the largest business area  Private  currency adjusted premium growth remained solid at 3.5 per cent despite a decline in Nordic new car sales. The adjusted risk ratio improved by approximately 0.5 percentage points year-on-year. In addition to the strong underwriting development  the significant changes in the interest rate environment during 2022 increased If‚Äôs fixed income running yield to 3.2 per cent (1.5). Profit before taxes increased to EUR 1 217 million (1 077).Topdanmark‚Äôs profit before taxes for 2022 in Sampo Group‚Äôs profit and loss account decreased to EUR 220 million (346)  as the investment result was affected by the adverse market environment. The sale of Topdanmark life insurance business in the fourth quarter of 2022 supported the result by EUR 72 million. The combined ratio stood at 83.1 per cent (82.3).Hastings reported solid top-line growth with resilient margins in a challenging UK motor insurance market  in which the claims inflation remained elevated throughout the year. Gross written premiums grew by 15 per cent on a currency adjusted basis in 2022  supported by high retention and disciplined pricing. Live customer policies increased 2 per cent year-on-year to over 3.2 million  driven by a 33 per cent growth in home insurance  while motor policy count was stable. Hastings‚Äô operating ratio increased to 89.7 per cent (80.3). Profit before taxes amounted to EUR 73 million (127)  or EUR 131 million (168) excluding the non-operational depreciation and amortisation.The Mandatum segment‚Äôs profit before taxes for 2022 decreased to EUR 207 million (291)  reflecting lower realised gains and an increase in the group contribution to Sampo plc to EUR 29 million (15). Mandatum‚Äôs net flows in third-party assets remained positive in every quarter  but were outweighed by the decline in market values  leading to assets under management of EUR 10.3 billion at the end of 2022  down from EUR 11.1 billion at the year-end 2021. Mandatum Life‚Äôs Solvency II ratio increased to 248 per cent (190)  driven by higher interest rates and lower solvency capital requirement.The profit before taxes of EUR 1 863 million (3 171) for 2022 includes accounting effects of EUR 138 million (982) defined as extraordinary items in accordance with Sampo Group‚Äôs dividend policy. Of the total amount  EUR 103 million related to the sale of Nordea shares  EUR 72 million to the sale of Topdanmark Life and EUR -37 million to the reclassification of Nordax from an associated company to fair value investment. Excluding these items  the profit before taxes declined to EUR 1 725 million (2 189)  mainly as a result of Nordea no longer being consolidated as an associate. The total comprehensive income  which takes changes in the market values of assets into account  was affected by the adverse capital markets environment and amounted to EUR -26 million (3 448).Sampo Group‚Äôs year-end 2022 Solvency II ratio stood at 210 per cent  up from 185 per cent at the year-end 2021  but down from 256 per cent at the end of the third quarter. The decrease over the third quarter was primarily driven by the inclusion of the dividend proposal and the planned new buyback programme. Sampo targets a solvency ratio of 170‚Äì190 per cent.Sampo Group‚Äôs financial leverage was 25.6 per cent at the end of 2022  up from 23.8 per cent at the end of 2021  but slightly down from 25.9 per cent at the end of the third quarter. Sampo targets a financial leverage ratio below 30 per cent.Sampo plc‚Äôs Board of Directors proposes a dividend of EUR 2.60 per share for the 2022 financial year to the Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 May 2023. This consists of a regular dividend (formerly known as the insurance dividend as introduced at the 2021 CMD) of EUR 1.80 per share (1.70)  representing growth of 6 per cent  and an extra dividend of EUR 0.80 per share. In addition to the dividend  management is to propose to the Board a new EUR 400 million buyback programme.The implementation of IFRS 17 and 9 on 1 January 2023 will bring asset and liability side mark-to-market effects into Sampo‚Äôs reported net income. As a result  the Sampo Board has decided to adjust the Group‚Äôs dividend policy  such that the payout ratio is measured against a newly defined operational result rather than net profit excluding items defined as extraordinary  as previously. The change is not expected to have any significant effect on the size and trajectory of dividends. The adjusted dividend policy is described in the section Dividend proposal.On 7 December 2022  Sampo plc announced that the Board of Directors had decided to undertake a strategic review of Mandatum in line with Sampo‚Äôs strategic focus on P&C insurance. The Board continues to review a number of different options  with the aim to evaluate whether a separation of Mandatum could create shareholder value. Sampo expects to provide a further update on the strategic review by the end of the first quarter of 2023.In 2022  Sampo repurchased its own shares through three buyback programmes. Of the latest buyback programme of EUR 1 billion  launched on 9 June 2022  EUR 845 million had been executed at year-end 2022. The programme was completed on 8 February 2023. In total  Sampo repurchased 32 million shares for a total of EUR 1.4 billion in 2022.FOURTH QUARTER 2022 IN BRIEFIn October-December 2022  Sampo Group reported profit before taxes of EUR 390 million (1 197). Excluding accounting effects treated as extraordinary items in accordance with Sampo Group‚Äôs dividend policy  profit before taxes amounted to EUR 355 million (452). Earnings per share amounted to EUR 0.50 (1.89)  or EUR 0.41 (0.55) excluding extraordinary items. Total comprehensive income  which takes changes in the market values of assets into account  amounted to EUR 448 million (1 269).Group underwriting profit increased to EUR 304 million (297). Excluding COVID-19 effects reported in the comparison period  underwriting profit grew by 12 per cent. The Group combined ratio amounted to 83.7 per cent (83.0).If P&C reported profit before taxes of EUR 285 million (260) and underwriting profit of EUR 229 million (210). The combined ratio was 81.7 per cent (82.9) and gross written premium growth 7.8 per cent on a currency adjusted basis. The adjusted risk ratio  which excludes the impact of large losses  severe weather  reported COVID-19 effects and prior year development  improved by 0.2 percentage points year-on-year.Topdanmark‚Äôs profit before taxes amounted to EUR 128 million (89) and combined ratio was 82.1 per cent (80.6).Hastings profit before taxes amounted to EUR 7 million (11). The operating ratio deteriorated to 94.0 per cent (87.9)  driven by increased claims frequency due to harsh weather conditions particularly in December. Gross written premiums increased by 31 per cent year-on-year on a currency adjusted basis. Live customer policy count remained stable  supported by continued strong growth in home insurance.The Mandatum segment‚Äôs profit before taxes amounted to EUR 18 million (91)  net of a profit contribution to Sampo plc of EUR 29 million (15). Excluding the profit contribution  profit before taxes stood at EUR 47 million (106). Mandatum‚Äôs third-party assets under management increased to EUR 10.3 billion from EUR 10.1 billion at the end of the third quarter  supported by strong net flows of EUR 213 million during the quarter.GROUP CEO‚ÄôS COMMENTSampo‚Äôs fourth quarter was characterised by strong operational execution  robust financial results and further steps on our strategic agenda. As we conclude a successful year  I am delighted that we are announcing EUR 1.7 billion (EUR 3.40 per share) of planned capital returns to shareholders.Sampo‚Äôs P&C insurance operations delivered excellent fourth quarter underwriting results of EUR 304 million  representing 13 per cent year-on-year growth  after adjusting for COVID-19 effects in the prior year. Notably  this result was achieved despite adverse weather in the form of heavy snowfall and cold weather. As always  our focus has been on assisting affected customers through superior service  which is a cornerstone of our strategy and instrumental in securing high retention rates over the long term.The result was driven mainly by our Nordic P&C business  where If grew underwriting profit excluding COVID-19 effects by 23 per cent  supported by an excellent fourth quarter combined ratio of 81.7 per cent and currency adjusted premium growth of 7.8 per cent. Importantly  our Nordic customer retention has remained high as we continue to cover claims inflation of 4‚Äì5 per cent with rate increases. The strongest pricing momentum is observed in Industrial  but fourth quarter premium growth also benefited from a stabilisation of new cars sales  albeit at a relatively low level  including support from high electric vehicle sales.In the UK  market conditions remained challenging  but Hastings achieved premium growth of 15 per cent over 2022 as it implemented significant rate increases to cover claims inflation of 12 per cent. Adverse weather had a negative impact on Hastings‚Äô operating ratio  pushing this to 89.7 per cent for 2022 as a whole. Although above our annual 88 per cent target  Hastings has delivered a relatively resilient result in what has been a challenging year for the UK motor market. I believe this reflects skilful operational execution and the company‚Äôs strong positioning and capabilities  which I expect will enable attractive profit growth as market conditions improve.In the capital markets  the fourth quarter saw further increases in interest rates and positive development in equity markets. Due to the short duration of our fixed income portfolio  we were able to continue to rapidly increase our running yield. Over 2022  higher running yields have added roughly EUR 230 million to Sampo‚Äôs annual pre-tax earning power  with the largest contribution coming from If P&C  which has more than doubled its running yield to 3.2 per cent (1.5).In December  Sampo‚Äôs Board of Directors launched a strategic review of Mandatum to evaluate whether separating the entity from the Group could add shareholder value. As a pure P&C insurer  Sampo could deliver higher and more resilient returns on capital  while an independent Mandatum would enjoy greater strategic flexibility to invest in growth. On the other hand  Mandatum makes an attractive contribution to the Group‚Äôs cash flow that supports value creation over time. We expect to provide an update on the review by the end of the first quarter of 2023.Turning to capital management  Sampo remains committed to capital discipline with a EUR 2.60 per share dividend proposal for 2022 and a EUR 400 million share buyback programme  which management is to propose. Adjusting for these actions  the Group retains EUR 2 per share of excess capital above the needs of the insurance operations  most of which is tied into private equity investments held in Sampo plc.Torbj√∂rn MagnussonGroup CEOOUTLOOKOutlook for 2023Sampo Group‚Äôs P&C insurance operations are expected to achieve underwriting margins that meet the annual targets set for 2021‚Äì2023. At Group level  Sampo targets a combined ratio of below 86 per cent  while the target for its largest subsidiary  If P&C  is below 85 per cent. Hastings targets an operating ratio of below 88 per cent.The combined and operating ratios of Sampo Group‚Äôs P&C insurance operations are subject to volatility driven by  among other factors  seasonal weather patterns  large claims and prior year development. These effects are particularly relevant for individual segments and business areas  such as the Danish and UK operations.The mark-to-market component of the net financial result will be significantly influenced by capital markets‚Äô developments  particularly in life insurance.With regard to Topdanmark  reference is made to the profit forecast model that the company publishes on a quarterly basis.The major risks and uncertainties for the Group in the near-termIn its current day-to-day business activities Sampo Group is exposed to various risks and uncertainties  mainly through its major business units.Major risks affecting the Group companies‚Äô profitability and its variation are market  credit  insurance and operational risks. At the Group level  sources of risks are the same  although they are not directly additive due to the effects of diversification.Uncertainties in the form of major unforeseen events may have an immediate impact on the Group‚Äôs profitability. The identification of unforeseen events is easier than the estimation of their probabilities  timing  and potential outcomes. During 2022 the global economy was hit by the war in Ukraine and at the same time  inflation pressures intensified and broadened forcing central banks to raise interest rates sharply. This may lead to both a further significant slowdown in economic growth and a deterioration in the debt service capacity of businesses  households and governments. Furthermore  the re-alignment of energy supplies in Europe takes time and the energy crisis could continue for several years. These developments are currently causing significant uncertainties in economic and capital market development. At the same time rapidly evolving hybrid threats create new challenges for states and businesses. There are also a number of widely identified macroeconomic  political and other sources of uncertainty which can  in various ways  affect the financial services industry in a negative manner.Other sources of uncertainty are unforeseen structural changes in the business environment and already identified trends and potential wide-impact events. These external drivers may have a long-term impact on how Sampo Group‚Äôs business will be conducted. Examples of identified trends are demographic changes  sustainability issues  and technological developments in areas such as artificial intelligence and digitalisation including threats posed by cybercrime.DIVIDEND PROPOSALDividendUnder Sampo Group‚Äôs capital management framework  Sampo will return ongoing surplus capital generation from its insurance operations through a regular dividend. Other forms of surplus capital generation  including possible proceeds from disposals of financial investments  are returned through additional dividends and/or buybacks  to the extent that the funds are not utilised to support business development. Sampo targets a Solvency II ratio of 170‚Äì190 per cent and financial leverage below 30 per cent.According to Sampo plc‚Äôs Dividend Policy applied for distribution of 2022 earnings  total annual dividends paid shall represent at least 70 per cent of Sampo Group‚Äôs net profit for the year (excluding extraordinary items). In 2022  accounting items related to the sale of Nordea shares  the sale of Topdanmark life insurance operations and the reclassification of Nordax from an associated company to fair value investment have been defined as extraordinary in accordance with Sampo‚Äôs dividend policy.The parent company‚Äôs distributable capital and reserves totalled EUR 6 716 million of which profit for the financial year 2022 was EUR 1 780 million. Based on the policies outlined above  the Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a total dividend of EUR 2.60 per share be paid to all shares except for the shares held by Sampo plc on the dividend record date of 22 May 2023. The total dividend includes a regular dividend of EUR 1.80 per share as well as an extra dividend of EUR 0.80 per share.As earnings per share excluding extraordinary items amounted to EUR 2.41 per share  the payout ratio for the total dividend equates to 108 per cent. The remainder of the distributable funds are left in the company‚Äôs equity capital. After adjusting for the proposed dividend  Sampo Group‚Äôs 2022 year-end distributable funds amounted to EUR 5 378 million  Group Solvency II ratio to 210 per cent and financial leverage to 28.6 per cent.Dividend paymentThe dividend is proposed to be paid to the shareholders registered in the register of shareholders held by Euroclear Finland Oy as at the record date of 22 May 2023. The Board proposes that the dividends be paid on 31 May 2023.The issuer of the Swedish depository receipts shall ensure that the dividend is paid to the depository receipt holders registered in the securities depository and settlement register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB as at the record date of 22 May 2023  which payment shall be made in Swedish kronor.Financial positionNo significant changes have taken place in the company's financial position since the end of the financial year. The company's liquidity position is good and in the view of the Board  the proposed distributions do not jeopardise the company's ability to fulfil its obligations.Adjustment to Sampo Group‚Äôs dividend policyThe implementation of IFRS 17 and 9 on 1 January 2023 will bring asset and liability side mark-to-market effects into Sampo‚Äôs reported net income. As a result  the Sampo Board has decided to adjust the Group‚Äôs dividend policy  such that the minimum payout ratio of 70 per cent is measured against a newly defined operational result rather than net profit excluding items defined as extraordinary  as previously. The change is not expected to have any significant effect on the size and trajectory of dividends. The adjustment is effective to payouts made in respect of the 2023 and later financial years‚Äô.According to the updated dividend policy  Sampo is to pay a stable and sustainable regular dividend that grows in line with the Group‚Äôs earnings over time. Total annual dividends paid will be at least 70 per cent of Group‚Äôs operational result.The operational result is similar to net profit excluding items defined as extraordinary used under IFRS 4  with the main differences being that it excludes all result effects from discount rate changes as well as non-operational amortisation in Sampo‚Äôs P&C operations  and that Mandatum‚Äôs profit is replaced with the dividend stream that it provides to Sampo plc. The full definition of the operational result can be found at www.sampo.com/dividend .Sampo is committed to operating a strong and efficient balance sheet  as defined by the Group‚Äôs capital management framework. To enable this  regular dividends can be complemented with distributions of excess capital via share buybacks and/or extra dividends.OTHER DEVELOPMENTSStrategic review of MandatumOn 7 December 2022  Sampo plc announced that the Board of Directors had decided to undertake a strategic review of Mandatum in line with Sampo‚Äôs strategic focus on P&C insurance. The Board continues to review a number of different options  with the aim to evaluate whether a separation of Mandatum could create shareholder value.The Board of Directors of Sampo plc is content with the current Group structure as it offers diversification in terms of business exposures as well as capital and cash generation. Sampo expects to provide a further update on the strategic review by the end of the first quarter of 2023.EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODShare buyback programmeSampo‚Äôs share buyback programme of EUR 1 billion announced on 9 June 2022 continued after the end of the reporting period. The buyback programme was completed on 8 February 2023  when at market close  the company held  after cancellation of the own shares on 8 December 2022  in total 5.4 million Sampo A shares representing 1.05 per cent of the total number of shares in Sampo plc. Sampo had bought altogether 22.1 million A shares under the share buyback programme between 10 June 2022 and 8 February 2023  of which 16.7 million shares were cancelled on 8 December 2022.

The complete report is attached to this release and is also available at www.sanoma.com/en/investors .Q4 2022The Group‚Äôs net sales grew to EUR 260 million (2021: 252). The positive impact of the acquisition of Pearson Italy and Germany was partially offset by lower advertising sales. The Group‚Äôs comparable growth was ‚Äë3% (2021: 6%).Operational EBIT excl. PPA was seasonally negative and amounted to EUR -2 million (2021: -5).EBIT was EUR -21 million (2021: -19). Items affecting comparability (IACs) increased to EUR -8 million (2021: -5) and were mainly related to recent acquisitions in Learning. Purchase price allocation adjustments and amortisations (PPAs) grew to EUR 11 million (2021: 8) as a result of the acquisition of the Italian and German business.Operational EPS was EUR -0.07 (2021: -0.06).EPS was EUR -0.13 (2021: -0.09).On 16 December 2022  Sanoma received a payment decision regarding tax audits for 2019‚àí2021 concerning the VAT treatment of magazine distribution in Media Finland  from which it will appeal. Based on the decision received  Sanoma paid EUR 11 million of VAT  penalties and interests at year end 2022 in order to avoid further interest accumulation. For dividend calculation purposes  the Group‚Äôs free cash flow will be adjusted for the prepayment.On 7 November 2022  Sanoma signed a EUR 300 million syndicated revolving credit facility replacing its earlier facility of the same size  and syndicated its EUR 250 million 4-year term loan used for the acquisition of Pearson Italy and Germany with a group of ten relationship banks.On 26 October  the Board of Directors decided the record date and payment date of the second dividend instalment of EUR 0.27 per share. The dividend record date was 28 October and the payment date 4 November.On 4 October  Sanoma divested Eduarte  a Dutch student administration system provider for vocational education  in line with the strategy to harmonise its digital offering across the learning business.FY 2022The Group‚Äôs net sales grew to EUR 1 298 million (2021: 1 252) mainly driven by the acquisition of the Italian and German learning business from Pearson. The Group‚Äôs comparable net sales growth was 1% (2021: 7%).Operational EBIT excl. PPA declined to EUR 189 million (2021: 197)  corresponding to a margin of 14.6% (2021: 15.8%). Earnings were stable in Learning and declined in Media Finland mainly due to lower advertising sales and higher paper costs.EBIT was EUR 112 million (2021: 142). IACs increased to EUR -38 million (2021: -16) mainly due to transaction and integration costs of recent acquisitions as well as impairments in Learning. PPAs were EUR 39 million (2021: 39).Operational EPS was EUR 0.65 (2021: 0.69).EPS was EUR 0.47 (2021: 0.62).Free cash flow declined to EUR 112 million (2021: 140) mainly due to lower earnings  as well as higher working capital  investments and taxes. It includes a significant positive contribution from the working capital of the acquired Italian and German businesses due to the timing of the acquisition.Net debt/Adj. EBITDA increased to 3.2 (2021: 2.4) mainly as a result of the acquisition in Italy and Germany.On 31 August  Sanoma completed the acquisition of Pearson‚Äôs local K12 learning content business in Italy and its small exam preparation business in Germany.On 7 June  Sanoma announced its strategic growth ambition to increase the Group‚Äôs net sales to over EUR 2 billion by 2030  with at least 75% coming from the learning business.The Board proposes a dividend of 0.37 ‚Ç¨ per share (2021: 0.54)  corresponding to 93% of the underlying free cash flow. The dividend will be paid in three instalments  EUR 0.13 on 28 April  EUR 0.13 in September and EUR 0.11 in November.Outlook for 2023In 2023  Sanoma expects that the Group‚Äôs reported net sales will be EUR 1.35‚Äí1.4 billion (2022: 1.3). The Group‚Äôs operational EBIT excl. PPA is expected to be EUR 150‚àí180 million (2022: 189).Regarding the operating environment  Sanoma expects that:The economies in the Group‚Äôs operating countries  particularly in Finland  will experience a mild recession.The advertising market in Finland will decline slightly  with most of the decline during the first half of the year.President and CEO Susan Duinhoven:‚ÄùIn light of the significant changes in the world around us  2022 was another solid year of transformation for Sanoma ‚Äìalthough being very different from what we expected twelve months ago  just coming out of the coronavirus pandemic. In Learning  one of the highlights in 2022 was the acquisition of two established learning businesses in Italy and Germany from Pearson. We were happy to welcome these strong teams to Sanoma at the end of August. The acquired businesses fit well in our learning portfolio and strategy  and the acquisition had already a modest positive contribution to our net sales growth and operational EBIT  and due to the timing of the acquisition also a significant one to the free cash flow. The integration has started according to our plans and playbook and we expect the separation from Pearson and integration into Sanoma to be a sizable project over the next 18‚àí24 months.Net sales of Learning grew by 7% driven by the acquired Italian and German businesses. Organic growth was good across our operating countries except ‚Äì in line with our expectations ‚Äì in Poland  where the latest curriculum renewal ended in 2021. In Spain  the implementation of the major educational reform and curriculum renewal  LOMLOE  started a bit more fragmented than we had anticipated. However  it created solid growth in the demand for learning content in 2022  which is expected to continue also in 2023 extending most likely even into 2024. The inflationary cost increases impacted the earnings in Learning  as we typically can set our prices only once a year. Now for 2023  we have been able to adapt the prices for our products and services and we expect that it will take 1‚àí2 years to fully mitigate the cost increases in most of our markets. Especially the higher personnel costs that in most of our businesses will impact us only from 2023 onwards  will take some time to mitigate. Despite the inflationary cost increases  the operational earnings remained stable in most of our businesses. The main exception was the Dutch distribution business that suffered during the summer period from labour shortage and related sharp increase in hiring costs  delays due to supply chain issues with our main supplier and the general inflationary cost pressures.In Media Finland  net sales were stable  while operational earnings declined driven by lower advertising sales and significantly higher paper costs. The active cost containment by the teams across fixed cost categories was not able to fully offset the adverse inflationary impact on Media Finland‚Äôs operational earnings. One of the highlights of the year was the clear growth in the number of visits to all our digital news platforms  especially Ilta-Sanomat  as well as solid growth in the digitally active subscription base of both Helsingin Sanomat and the regional news media titles. Subscription sales were stable  while the total number of subscribers declined slightly towards the end of the year reflecting the weakening consumer confidence in Finland. During the second half of the year  advertising sales declined year-on-year compared to the strong demand in 2021 that was driven by the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.Sustainability is at the core of both our learning and media business. During the year  we continued our actions towards our targets by focusing on improving diversity  equality and inclusion across Sanoma and sending our climate targets for validation to the Science-Based Targets initiative. Our progressive and holistic approach to sustainability was reflected in continued improvement in key ESG ratings and inclusion into the Nasdaq OMX Sustainability Finland Index. We were delighted to also see that our Employee Experience Index remained stable at the good level of 7.3  even in a year that put quite some challenges and hardship for our teams  and we continued to exceed the European benchmark that was 7.1.Compared to last year  our free cash flow declined significantly. The main reasons for this were higher investments in digital development in Learning  adaptation of our offices to the hybrid way of working as well as lower EBITDA and costs related to the recent acquisition in Learning. This was mostly compensated by the working capital that came with the acquired businesses due to the timing of the acquisition. Without a similar benefit from the Italian and German acquisition as seen in 2022  we expect the Group‚Äôs 2023 free cash flow to temporarily decline  being impacted by the lower earnings expected in our Finnish media business  continued investments in our digital platforms and integration of the recently acquired businesses together with significantly higher financial expenses.The Board proposes a dividend of EUR 0.37 (2021: 0.54)  corresponding to a yield of 3.8% on the end of 2022 share price and 93% of the underlying free cash flow. This proposal balances the capital use between the dividend and our continuing investments in growing the business further.We expect the challenging operating environment to continue  leading to a mild recession in most of our operating countries. This will be impacting our performance in 2023  and thus our Outlook for 2023 shows growth in net sales with slightly lower operational EBIT. In 2023  we will focus on further building the long-term strengths of our businesses around learning content  harmonisation of digital learning platforms and leading offering in digital news and entertainment  and thus coming out of the recession even stronger than we went in. At the same time  we will intensify our thoughtful cost management and highly selective approach to growth investments. We remain fully committed to our growth strategy as well as our long-term financial targets. We are aiming for the Group net sales to be above EUR 2 billion  with at least 75% coming from the learning business  which we aim to achieve through organic growth and further acquisitions within K12 learning services. Also in the shorter term  we continue to be interested in value creating acquisitions in K12 learning content  especially in-market acquisitions  even though our main focus this year will be on integrations and gaining the scale benefits that our European portfolio can offer.I would like to extend my great thanks to all Sanoma employees for their excellent work  tenacity and strong commitment to supporting our customers in these more challenging times. Thanks to our teams  we were able to continue our growth  operational development and solid financial performance throughout the year 2022. I also want to thank our customers and shareholders for their continued support and interest in selecting Sanoma as their partner and investment respectively. Together we will continue on our strategic path with an aim to grow and further strengthen our positions and improve our performance in the years ahead.‚Äô‚ÄôKey indicators for continuing operationsEUR million Q4 2022 Q4 2021 Change FY 2022 FY 2021 Change Net sales 259.5 252.4 3% 1 298.3 1 251.6 4% Operational EBITDA 1) 45.3 42.1 7% 355.4 361.0 -2% Margin 1) 17.4% 16.7% 27.4% 28.8% Operational EBIT excl.

Furthermore  ¬ß¬ß 11-12 would be abolished (as the substantive contents would be incorporate into the revised ¬ß 10.The amended paragraphs of the Articles of Association would read as follows:‚ÄúArticle 10The notice convening a General Meeting of shareholders must be delivered to the shareholders by publishing the notice on the company‚Äôs website no more than three (3) months and no less than three (3) weeks prior to the General Meeting of shareholders  however  in any case  at least nine (9) days prior to the record date of the General Meeting of shareholders  as referred to in the Finnish Companies Act.

The legislative changes are based on the premise that  irrespective of the chosen general meeting format  shareholders' rights must not be compromised and that all participating shareholders can exercise their shareholder rights in full in real time  including the right to present questions and vote. The possibility to organise general meetings remotely enables the Company to prepare for rapid changes in the Company's operating environment and society in general  which may be caused  for example  by pandemics. It is important that the Company has the necessary means to offer its shareholders the possibility to exercise their shareholder rights and resolve on any matters that are presented in a general meeting under any circumstances.20.

In particular  the financial information included in this stock exchange release has been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in Finland  which may not be comparable to the financial statements or financial information of U.S. companies. The Tender Offer is made to Caverion's shareholders resident in the United States on the same terms and conditions as those made to all other shareholders of Caverion to whom an offer is made. Any informational documents  including this stock exchange release  are being disseminated to U.S. shareholders on a basis comparable to the method that such documents are provided to Caverion's other shareholders.As permitted under the Tier I Exemption  the settlement of the Tender Offer is based on the applicable Finnish law provisions  which differ from the settlement procedures customary in the United States  particularly as regards to the time when payment of the consideration is rendered. The Tender Offer  which is subject to Finnish law  is being made to the U.S. shareholders in accordance with the applicable U.S. securities laws  and applicable exemptions thereunder  in particular the Tier I Exemption and the 802 Exemption. To the extent the Tender Offer is subject to U.S. securities laws  those laws only apply to U.S. shareholders and will not give rise to claims on the part of any other person. U.S. shareholders should consider that (whether paid initially in cash or upon redemption of any Alternative Consideration Instruments) the offer price for the Tender Offer is being paid in EUR and that no adjustment will be made based on any changes in the exchange rate.To the extent permissible under applicable law or regulations  the Offeror and its affiliates or its brokers and its brokers' affiliates (acting as agents for the Offeror or its affiliates  as applicable) may from time to time after the date of this stock exchange release and during the pendency of the Tender Offer  and other than pursuant to the Tender Offer  directly or indirectly purchase or arrange to purchase Shares or any securities that are convertible into  exchangeable for or exercisable for Shares.

THE...,"Valoe OyjValoe Corporation Inside Information 10 February 2023 at 17.40 (Finnish time)VALOE HAS AGREED ON A EUR 5 000 000 FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT WITH WINANCE. THE FUNDING WILL BE USED AS WORKING CAPITAL AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE MASS PRODUCTION CONTRACT WITH SONO MOTORS HAS BEEN POSTPONED AND TO PAY DOWN THE COMPANY‚ÄôS DEBT TO RIVERFORT.Background and Purpose of Financial ArrangementValoe Oyj (‚ÄúValoe‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) has signed a convertible note facility agreement with Winance concerning a funding arrangement of up to EUR 5 000 000 in convertible loan notes (the ""Convertible Notes"") that will be accompanied by share subscription warrants (the ""Warrants"") (the agreement  the Convertible Notes and the Warrants hereinafter referred to collectively as the ""Arrangement"").Valoe will use the funding as working capital. The need for additional funding became apparent after the signing of the mass production contract for Sion  Sono Motors' self-charging electric vehicle  and the related estimated cash flows were postponed. In addition  Valoe will pay down its debt to Riverfort Global Opportunities Pcc Limited by approximately one million euro.On 20 December 2022  Valoe disclosed that the signing of the contract Valoe is negotiating with the company‚Äôs significant customer has been postponed until the end of the first quarter of 2023. The delay was expected to have negative impact on Valoe‚Äôs working capital situation. With Winance‚Äôs financing that has now been agreed on  Valoe expects to be able to meet its working capital needs until the substantial customer contracts are signed and the planned cash flow from customer contracts start to materialize.Under the Arrangement  Valoe issues Convertible Notes to Winance. The Convertible Notes may be drawn down so that the first tranche amounts to EUR2 000 000  after which the Convertible Notes may be drawn down in maximum of 6 sequential tranches of EUR 500 000 each (the first tranche and the subsequent Tranches  each ""Tranche"") during a period of 24 months from the drawdown of the first Tranche provided that the preconditions for each Tranche are met. Winance has the right to convert each Tranche into the Company‚Äôs newly issued or treasury shares. In addition  Winance will receive Warrants stripped from the Convertible Notes at the drawdown of each Tranche. The Warrants entitle Winance to subscribe to additional shares of the Company with a subscription price described in the Characteristics of the Warrants.Story continuesThe Company has an obligation to draw down the first Tranche of EUR 2 000 000 and a minimum of two sequential Tranches of the Convertible Notes  i.e. a total minimum of EUR 3 000 000. The remainder of the Convertible Notes  a total of four Tranches of EUR500 000 totaling EUR 2 000 000  may be drawn down by the Company at its discretion.Valoe has  pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Arrangement between Valoe and Winance  withdrawn the first Tranche of EUR 2 000 000  and issued to Winance in total 2 000 convertible notes and in total 13 333 333 warrants related thereto.Commercial Terms of ArrangementPursuant to the Arrangement  Winance may be given in the maximum of 5 000 convertible loan notes against subscription price of EUR 1 000 per each convertible loan note. The Convertible Notes entitle their holder to subscribe to maximum of 50 000 000 shares of the Company in the aggregate.The subscription price of the Notes related to the Tranche Warrants shall be equal to 98% of the par value of the Notes.Notwithstanding the first Tranche  a Tranche may be drawn down by the Company provided that all previously issued Convertible Notes within the Arrangement have been converted into the shares of the Company or that a cool down period agreed between the parties has lapsed  unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. Each Tranche may be drawn in several parts.Winance has agreed to subscribe for the Convertible Notes issued by the Company with a conversion ratio calculated at the time the respective conversion is requested so that the conversion ratio is equal to 90 % of the lowest daily volume weighted average price observed over a period of fifteen (15) consecutive trading days prior to such conversion request.The Convertible Notes bear a zero interest rate. The Convertible Notes have a maturity of 12 months from the issuance of each Tranche. Each Tranche must be converted into the Company's shares upon maturity at the latest.In connection with the drawdown of each Tranche  Winance will receive Warrants free of charge. Winance has the right  but no obligation  to subscribe for the Company‚Äôs shares based on the Warrants. In connection with the Arrangement  Winance may be given maximum of 10 000 000 Warrants in the aggregate which entitle their holder to subscribe to maximum of 10 000 000 shares of the Company in the aggregate. The number of Warrants that shall be attached to the Convertible Notes of a Tranche shall be determined as follows: 20% of the nominal value of the Convertible Notes of a Tranche divided by the Exercise Price of Warrants  the resulting number of Warrants being rounded down to the nearest whole number. For the purposes of the aforesaid  the ""Exercise Price of Warrants"" shall be 110% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price in the 15 trading days immediately preceding the request to issue the relevant Tranche.The subscription period of the Company's shares pursuant to the Warrants is five (5) years from the issuance of each Warrant.The exact number of the Company's shares to be issued based on the conversion of the Convertible Notes and the exercise of the Warrants depends  in the manner described above  on the conversion ratio applied to the Convertible Notes and Warrants and is thus not yet known. Depending on the exact number of the Company's shares to be issued based on the conversion of the Convertible Notes and the exercise of the Warrants  it may be necessary for the Board of Directors of the Company to apply for additional authorizations from the general meeting of shareholders in order to implement the entire Arrangement.There is a weighty financial reason for the Company to issue the Convertible Notes and Warrants to Winance as the purpose of the Arrangement is to strengthen the tight working capital situation of the Company. The subscription price of the Convertible Notes and Warrants as well as the shares of the Company to be subscribed based on the Convertible Notes and Warrants is based on the agreement between the Company and Winance.The drawdown of each Tranche requires that certain representations and warranties given by the Company and other customary conditions relating to financing arrangements of this nature are met.Winance has the right to terminate the Arrangement if the Company‚Äôs operations become subject to a material adverse effect  there has been a change of control in the Company or in the event of default which  if curable  is not cured within 30 business days.Valoe will pay Winance on the Arrangement an upfront commitment fee equaling EUR 400 000 in Convertible Notes.The terms and conditions of the Convertible Notes and of the Warrants (without schedules) are included in all material respects in the Appendices 1 and 2 of this release.In Mikkeli on 10 February 2023Valoe OyjBOARD OF DIRECTORSFor more information:CEO Iikka Savisalo  Valoe Corporation tel. +35 40 521 6082email: iikka.savisalo@valoe.comDistribution:Nasdaq Helsinki OyMain mediawww.valoe.comValoe Corporation specializes in the clean energy  especially in photovoltaic solutions.

The mood at the start of the year was expectant in terms of the ending of the COVID-19 pandemic of the past two years and the lifting of the restrictions  and the year began with strong economic growth. However  Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine in February  created a new kind of uncertainty in the world and the war resulted in human suffering.The war‚Äôs impacts could been seen in our operating environment as economic uncertainty  rising energy prices and interest rates and high inflation. These multiplier effects showed in SATO‚Äôs business operations during the reporting year. We have approximately 25 000 homes in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku. In addition  SATO has 522 apartments in St. Petersburg  which make up approximately one per cent of the value of our investment assets. Since the start of the war in Ukraine  we have been reviewing opportunities to withdraw from the Russian business operations and we are searching actively for a solution.Story continuesDespite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental apartments in Finland  and the urbanisation trend continues. The rise in mortgage interest rates coupled with the increase in energy and other costs had a partial impact on the growth in rental apartment demand. Now  also some of the people looking for an owner-occupied apartment may consider renting an apartment.The competition between rental housing providers is tough and a large number of new rental apartments has been built especially in the Helsinki metropolitan area in recent years. The historically high rate of housing construction is slowing. There are significantly fewer housing starts than before  but a large number of new apartments will be completed in 2023. This will maintain the tight competition for good tenants and keep rent increases moderate  despite the pressure for rent to increase in the future due to the rising cost level.During the reporting year  our investments in rental apartments were EUR 190.5 million (167.1). In 2022  we completed 191 rental apartments and 52 FlexHomes. On 31 December 2022  a total of 1 418 apartments were under construction. During the second half of the reporting year  we made a decision to refrain from launching any new construction projects. Our decision was based on the dramatic rise in the cost level for construction and property maintenance and the increase in financing costs  while rent development remained moderate due to the market situation.During the first half of the year  we made a decision to launch new non-subsidised rental apartment construction projects in Rykmentinpuisto in Tuusula  Skanssi in Turku and Finnoo in Espoo. The Rykmentinpuisto project is our first new apartment investment in Tuusula in 15 years and the Skanssi project is the first new apartment investment in Turku in five years.In April of the reporting year  we sold 2 009 rental apartments mainly in the Lahti  Jyv√§skyl√§ and Oulu areas to the Swedish investment company Heimstaden. The sale was consistent with our strategy of focusing our apartment investments on the Helsinki metropolitan area and its commuting area along the main railway  and in Tampere and Turku and their surrounding municipalities.We continued to develop the customer experience at SATO during the year. The economic occupancy rate improved compared to the previous year and was 95.2% (94.9). Our tenant turnover for the reporting year fell and our customer satisfaction improved. We clarified and simplified the processes and operating models related to the customer experience and focused especially on building a harmonised and seamless service experience. In addition to developing digital services  we invested in our presence near to the customers.During the reporting year  we continued our sustainability work and released our sustainability programme for 2023‚àí2026  our second ever. The themes of the sustainability programme are sustainable housing  thriving communities and sustainable profitability. Our vision is to be a leader in sustainable rental housing. In our own sustainability goals  we have committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).Last autumn  SATO became the first rental housing provider to join the Ostavastuullisesti.fi service  which provides sustainable service and products and tips for sustainable living. A sustainability panel consisting of outside experts in sustainable production and consumption selected six of SATO‚Äôs buildings: Lupajantie 2 in Mellunkyl√§  Helsinki; Jokiniityntie 28 in Kirkkonummi; Lincolninaukio 4 in Keimola  Vantaa; Kotkatie 6 in Espoo and Jokiniementie 46 and 48 in Ver√§j√§m√§ki  Helsinki to be featured on the website as more sustainable options. We also participated in Rakli‚Äôs Green Homes activities (which started up in 2022)  with altogether 1 100 Green Homes which had either geothermal heat or consumption-based water invoicing or both.During the reporting year  we focused on supporting the well-being of SATO personnel and encouraged SATO employees to learn and grow continually. Our goal is for each person to be able to come up with ideas in their work and develop solutions for future rental housing. We want for everyone at SATO to have the courage to reinvent themselves and the ability to succeed. During the year  the entire organisation adopted the objectives and key results (OKR) model with which we are working towards better setting of objectives  closer monitoring of results and openness. The constantly increasing complexity in the operating environment challenges both experts‚Äô and supervisors‚Äô competence and thinking. In order to provide support to this end  we launched supervisor training in the coaching management style during the reporting year.I wish to thank all SATO employees for their committed and excellent work. I also wish to thank our partners and the residents of our SATOhomes for their good co-operation during the past year.Report of the Board of DirectorsReport of the Board of Directors 1 January‚Äì31 December 2022Operating environmentThe year 2022 began with strong economic growth. Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine in February of the reporting year brought uncertainty to the economic outlook  dramatically raising the price of energy and accelerating inflation. The exceptionally high inflation forced the central banks to react by rapidly hiking interest rates. During the reporting year  the ECB raised its key interest rate four times after the summer and it was 2.50% at the end of 2022. Due to the high inflation  interest rate hikes are expected to continue in early 2023. Inflation is anticipated to stabilise during 2023.Employment development was strong in early 2022  but slowed down towards year-end due to economic challenges. During the reporting year  consumers‚Äô confidence weakened to a historically low level after the start of the year  which showed in private consumption. According to the projection made by the Bank of Finland on 16 December 2022  Finland‚Äôs economic growth in 2022 will be 1.9 % due to the good start to the year. In 2023  the increase in energy prices and the cost of living is predicted to cause the economy to slide into a slight downturn and shrink by 0.5%.Uncertainty and rising interest rates are slowing housing sales. According to the statistics released by the Central Federation of Finnish Real Estate Agencies in December 2022  sales volumes of new and old apartments clearly fell in November compared to the five-year average. According to Statistics Finland‚Äôs preliminary data in December  the prices of old owner-occupied apartments fell in November 2022 in the whole of Finland by 3.4% compared to November of the previous year.The economic situation will decelerate the historically high rate of construction. The number of issued building permits began to fall already in 2021  but plenty of new apartments were and will be completed in 2022 and 2023  which is maintaining tight competition for good tenants and keeping rent increases moderate. The increased cost level resulting from inflation does  however  create pressure to increase rents in the future.The lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and improving employment resulted in a positive turnaround in internal migration to large growth centres in 2022 and demand for rental apartments has begun to grow. This  and SATO‚Äôs investments in making renting more efficient and improving customer service  were visible as an increase in SATO‚Äôs occupancy rate. Also  economic uncertainty  upward pressure on interest rates and increasing consumer prices contributed to the increase in the demand for rental apartments.Despite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental apartments  and the urbanisation trend continues. Dense urban living near services and along good public transport connections is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. The Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy strong growth  while according to Statistics Finland‚Äôs population projection  Finland‚Äôs population will start declining in 2031. The Helsinki metropolitan area is expected to grow by over 200 000 new residents by 2040. Close to 80% of the area‚Äôs residents already live in one- to two-person households  and the number of small households continues to rise. The proportion of immigrants living in the capital area is predicted to grow from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. Aging populations typically move closer to growth centres and the services they offer  and they increasingly expect housing-related services.The change in the population structure and urbanisation create a stable foundation for demand for rental housing especially in the capital area and in Tampere and Turku. Outside of growth centres  the real prices of homes are declining  which makes acquiring an owner-occupied apartment in growth centres even more challenging for people coming from those areas.StrategyCustomer experience  sustainability and sustainable housing  and SATO employees lie at the core of SATO‚Äôs strategy. We want to be closely involved in our customers‚Äô daily lives in order to serve them in the best possible way. We build homes that stand the test of time and we take care of them in line with the life-cycle principles. We enable sustainable housing for our residents and encourage them to make sustainable choices in their daily lives. We want all SATO employees to be able to contribute ideas and participate in developing future housing solutions.SATO is a housing investment company whose basic product is a rental apartment in an apartment building. We focus our investments on growth centres: the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku  because in these areas demand for apartments is the highest and the increase in value is expected to be stable over the longer term. Our operations are geared towards profitable growth.During the reporting year  our strategy implementation focused especially on developing the customer experience  improving customer satisfaction and retention  and ensuring an excellent moving-in experience. We prepared a sustainability programme for 2023‚Äì2026  which is based on feedback from our stakeholders  such as personnel  customers and partners. The themes of the sustainability programme are sustainable housing  thriving communities and sustainable profitability. In our own sustainability goals  we have committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). With regard to our personnel  we focused on supporting work well-being and developing an inspiring employee experience  competence and a coaching management style.SATO has set maintaining its investment grade credit rating as a strategic goal. Our return on equity target is 8%. In addition  our strategic goal is to achieve a continuously improving Net Promoter Score (NPS) from our residents.According to SATO‚Äôs dividend policy  a maximum of 40% of the cash flow from operations will be paid in annual dividends  depending on the market situation  investment level  the development of the equity ratio and the solvency ratio.Net sales and profitIn 2022  consolidated net sales were EUR 291.2 million (298.3).Operating profit was EUR 198.9 million (304.5). The operating profit without the fair value change of investment properties was EUR 213.8 million (175.4). The change in fair value was EUR -14.9 million (129.1).Net financing costs totalled EUR -47.0 million (-45.1).Profit before taxes was EUR 151.9 million (259.4). Cash flow from operations (free cash flow after taxes excluding changes in fair value) amounted to EUR 141.3 million (107.9).Earnings per share were EUR 2.13 (3.64).Financial position and financingThe consolidated balance sheet totalled EUR 5 184.7 million (5 091.4) at the end of December. Equity was EUR 2 480.9 million (2 351.3). Equity per share was EUR 43.82 (41.53).The Group‚Äôs equity ratio was 47.8% (46.2) at the end of the year. EUR 137.3 million in new long-term financing was withdrawn and the solvency ratio was 40.7% (42.5) at the end of December.The Group‚Äôs return on equity was 5.0% (9.1). Return on invested capital was 4.3% (6.7).Cash and cash equivalents at the end of December totalled EUR 60.5 million (8.5). Interest-bearing liabilities at the end of December totalled EUR 2 145.7 million (2 169.5)  of which loans subject to market terms accounted for EUR 1 991.3 million (1 994.5). The loan itemisation is in note 26 of the financial statements. At the end of the reporting year  the average loan interest rate was 2.3% (1.7). Net financing costs totalled EUR -47.0 million(-45.1). The average maturity of loans was 3.3 years (4.0).The calculated impact of changes in the market value of interest hedging on equity was EUR 48.1 million (15.1). During the reporting year  SATO increased the proportion of unsecured loans to 88.1% of all loans. At the end of the year  the proportion of unencumbered assets was 89.2% of the balance sheet.Group structureSATO Corporation is the parent company of SATO Group. At the end of the reporting year  the parent company had a total of 21 subsidiaries engaged in business operations (23). Mergers took place during the year in order to clarify the Group structure.SATO Corporation‚Äôs majority shareholder is Balder Finska Otas AB  whose parent company is Fastighets AB Balder  which is quoted on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.Housing businessOur housing business includes rental activities  customer service  lifecycle management and maintenance. Effective rental activities and digital services provide home-seekers with quick access to a home  and the Group with a steadily increasing cash flow. High-quality maintenance operations ensure the comfort of residents and that the apartments stay in good condition and maintain their value. We serve our customers in daily housing issues through our customer-oriented service organisation.The competition between rental housing providers has become tighter  as a large volume of new rental apartments have been built in growth centres  especially in the Helsinki metropolitan area  in recent years. Tenants now have a wide array of choices and a successful customer experience is more important than ever. We try to respond to this challenge by adjusting the organisation and our service processes. We want to be closely involved in our customers‚Äô daily lives in order to serve them in the best possible way.During the reporting year we expanded the house expert model further in the Helsinki metropolitan area. At the end of the year  SATO employed 62 house experts and the model is now in use to its full extent in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku. The house experts take care of the technical building work on homes and buildings. The purpose of our house expert operating model is to create a better customer experience and more efficient maintenance.SATO had approximately 45 000 customers at the end of the reporting year. We measure our successes in customer encounters using the Net Promoter Score (NPS). Our customer satisfaction improved during the reporting year. We clarified and simplified the processes and operating models related to the customer experience and focused especially on building a harmonised and seamless service experience. We invested in developing digital services  as well as our presence near to the customers. We also established closer collaboration between SATO employees working at our residents‚Äô buildings and improved internal communications.The economic occupancy rate improved compared to the previous year and was 95.2% (94.9) on average in Finland. The external tenant turnover rate for rental apartments was 28.4% (31.2). Rental income decreased 2.4% and was EUR 291.2 million (298.3).The average monthly rent of SATO‚Äôs rental apartments in Finland at the end of the reporting year was EUR 17.84 per m2 (17.46).Net rental income for apartments was EUR 200.4 million (210.6).Investment propertiesOn 31 December 2022  SATO owned a total of 24 999 apartments (26 791). Altogether 191 rental apartments were completed and 1 was acquired. The total number of divested rental apartments was 2 021  of which 2 009 rental apartments were sold to the Swedish investment company Heimstaden.Fair valueThe development of the value of rental apartments is a key factor for SATO. The housing stock is focussed on areas and apartment sizes that are expected to grow in demand in the long term. The allocation of building repairs is based on life-cycle plans and repair need specifications.The fair value of investment properties at the end of December totalled EUR 5 044.2 million (5 032.8). The change in the value of investment properties  including investments and divestments in the financial year  was EUR 11.4 million (279.3).The external expert JLL Finland Oy (JLL) issues a biannual statement on the valuation methods applied by SATO  the appropriateness of sources of information used and the quality and credibility of the valuation for Finnish investment properties. JLL‚Äôs latest statement was issued on the valuation carried out on 31 December 2022. The criteria for the determination of the fair value are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.The change in value was influenced by the increase in yield requirements and the decrease in the fair value of St. Petersburg housing assets.At the end of the year  the Helsinki metropolitan area‚Äôs commuting area accounted for 87.3%  Tampere for 6.4% and Turku for 5.1%  and St. Petersburg for roughly 1.2% of the value of apartments.Investments  divestments and property developmentInvestment activities are used to manage the housing portfolio and prepare the ground for growth. SATO‚Äôs investments in the 2000s in non-subsidised rental apartments total more than EUR 3 billion. SATO acquires and builds entire rental buildings and single rental apartments. Property development allows for new investments in rental apartments in Finland. The rental potential and value of rental apartments owned by SATO are developed through renovation activities.Investments in rental apartments were EUR 190.5 million (167.1). Investments in the Helsinki metropolitan area represented 84.0% of all investments in the reporting year. Investments in new apartments represented 57.1% of the investments. In addition  on 31 December 2022  binding purchase agreements in Finland totalled EUR 114.3 million (96.8).During the reporting year  2 021 rental apartments (26) were divested in Finland. Their total value was EUR 210.6 million (7.9). In April of the reporting year  we sold 2 009 rental apartments mainly in the Lahti  Jyv√§skyl√§ and Oulu areas to the Swedish investment company Heimstaden. The sale was consistent with our strategy based on which SATO is focusing its apartment investments on the Helsinki metropolitan area and its commuting area along the main railway  and in Tampere and Turku and their surrounding municipalities.The book value of plot reserves totalled EUR 40.8 million (43.4) at the end of December. The value of new plots acquired by the end of December totalled EUR 18.4 million (15.5).The permitted building volume for about 1 450 apartments is being developed for the plots in the company‚Äôs housing portfolio. This allows SATO to utilise existing infrastructure  create a denser urban structure and thus bring more customers closer to services and public transport connections.We collaborate with cities when areas are being developed and new housing is planned for them. As a long-term owner  housing investor and housing provider  SATO wants to build nice homes  residential areas and pleasant urban areas for decades to come. During the reporting year  we continued the development of the Hakunila area in Vantaa and Finnoo in Espoo  for example. In Helsinki  we were involved in planning the Mellunpuisto project in Mellunkyl√§ and we continued our collaboration with VR to develop the area it owns in Ilmala. During the reporting year  plots in complementary planning areas developed by SATO were sold to construction companies and other partners  enabling the construction of approximately 175‚àí200 owner-occupied apartments and roughly 25 state-subsidised rental apartments  thus promoting a diverse residential area and urban structure.In May 2022  construction of non-subsidised rental apartments began in Rykmentinpuisto in Tuusula. The area is a collaboration by several parties and the area will include different types of housing. SATO is building 92 non-subsidised rental apartments in the area. The Rykmentinpuisto Pataljoonantie project is SATO‚Äôs first new apartment investment in Tuusula in more than 15 years.In August 2022  SATO signed a deed to buy from Lujatalo an apartment building which is being built in Skanssi  Turku. The eight-storey building under construction at the address Sorakatu 9 will have 77 new rental apartments. This is SATO‚Äôs first new apartment investment in Turku in five years. Construction was begun in August 2022 and the apartments will be ready for residents at the end of 2023.We are building 257 new rental apartments at Peijinkuja in Finnoo  Espoo. Construction began in August 2022 and the apartments will be completed in stages during autumn 2024. The project is based on long-term development work in which we drew up a new local plan with the City of Espoo for a property that SATO owns in the old low-rise area of Hannus  which formerly featured terraced houses. The area is being transformed into a new area called Finnoo. SATO‚Äôs goal is to continue developing the Finnoo area in the future.During the reporting year  new rental apartments were finished on Lupajantie in Mellunm√§ki  Helsinki and on Jokiniityntie in Kirkkonummi.Due to rising construction  maintenance and financing costs and the moderate rent development resulting from the competitive situation  we made a decision to refrain from launching new construction projects and we are postponing their launch.In 2022  we completed 191 rental apartments (235) and 0 owner-occupied apartments (71) and 52 FlexHomes (0) in Finland. On 31 December 2022  a total of 1 418 apartments (1 152) were under construction: 1 418 rental apartments (1 100) and 0 owner-occupied apartments (0) and 0 FlexHomes (52). FlexHome is a short-term ownership concept that enables home ownership with a small initial capital outlay and which the resident can purchase entirely for themselves within five years of completion.A total of EUR 92.4 million (93.6) was spent on repairing and upgrading apartments.At the end of December  SATO owned 522 apartments (525) in St. Petersburg. The economic occupancy rate of rental apartments in St. Petersburg was 92.4% (97.7) on average. Since the start of the war in Ukraine  we have been reviewing opportunities to withdraw from the Russian business operations. Based on our studies  a fast withdrawal is not possible. For this reason  SATO will continue to rent residential apartments in St. Petersburg until a way to withdraw has been found. The company is actively seeking a solution.SustainabilityOur sustainability work during the reporting year was guided by SATO‚Äôs strategy and our sustainability programme for 2019‚Äì2022  which emphasised carbon-neutral cities and the well-being of residents and neighbourhoods.Due to the energy crisis resulting from the war in Ukraine  we increased the efficiency of our energy saving measures and paid more attention to the temperatures of apartments than earlier. We monitor and regulate the heating of some 21 000 SATOhomes using AI. Our goal is to maintain a temperature of approximately 21 degrees in SATOhomes  which is a healthy and energy-efficient indoor temperature. In addition to our own energy saving measures  we actively provided our residents with guidance on energy saving opportunities in their day-to-day lives. At the end of the year  we provided our residents with instructions on how to prepare for possible blackouts in the exceptional energy situation.During the reporting year  we launched a development project related to waste and sorting  in which we surveyed our homes‚Äô waste-collection points and inspected their lighting  the number of waste bins and signage. Based on the survey  we targeted repairs at the sites that needed them and they will continue in upcoming years. Our housing advisors‚Äô tours focused on waste guidance during the year. We pilot tested a clothing collection point on Kauppakartanonkatu in Helsinki‚Äôs It√§keskus.Some of our sustainable development measures are described below under ‚ÄòImpacts on the environment and society‚Äô.In the autumn of 2022  an external sustainability panel chose six of SATO‚Äôs rental apartment buildings to be among the Ostavastuullisesti.fi website‚Äôs more sustainable choices. SATO was the first rental housing provider to be included in the Ostavastuullisesti.fi service. Our following buildings were assessed to be a more sustainable choice: Lupajantie 2 in Mellunkyl√§  Helsinki; Jokiniityntie 28 in Kirkkonummi; Lincolninaukio 4 in Keimola  Vantaa; Kotkatie 6 in Espoo and Jokiniementie 46 and 48 in Ver√§j√§m√§ki  Helsinki.In 2022  we took part in Rakli‚Äôs newly launched Green Homes activities. At the end of 2022  we had altogether 1 100 Green Homes which had either geothermal heat or consumption-based water invoicing or both.We participated for the eighth time in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) assessment. SATO received two stars on a scale of one to five. SATO‚Äôs score in the Standing Investments Benchmark (existing properties) fell by one point from last year (score now at 73)  while in the Development Benchmark (construction projects) SATO‚Äôs score rose to 75 points from 71 points last year. We report on our sustainability annually in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative‚Äôs (GRI) reporting guidelines  and the environmental sustainability figures presented in the report have been verified by an independent third party  i.e. KPMG Oy Ab.During the reporting year  we collaborated on a project with the non-profit organisations No Fixed Abode and the Rehabilitation Foundation to help participants in the project find two of life‚Äôs essentials ‚Äì a home and a job. By the end of 2022  10 people who had participated in the project were living in a SATOhome.During 2022  we updated the materiality analysis and released a new sustainability programme for 2023‚Äì2026. Our vision is to be a leader in sustainable rental housing during the programme period.In 2020 we committed to reporting in compliance with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and in 2021  we conducted an extensive assessment of the risks and opportunities arising from climate change for SATO‚Äôs entire supply chain. In the framework  the risks are divided into four main categories: transition risks  acute and chronic physical risks and social risks. At the same time  we carried out a scenario analysis to look into how the two- and four-degree scenarios affect society and how SATO should prepare for these changes. During the reporting year  risks caused by climate change were part of SATO‚Äôs general risk assessment that is conducted internally each year. In 2022  two reports were made to SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors on climate risks and opportunities and their impact.The Corporate Governance Statement is published separately from the Report of the Board of Directors. SATO‚Äôs Corporate Governance Statement  Code of Conduct and sustainability programme are available at sato.fi.Impacts on the environment and societyOur objective is to systematically reduce the negative impacts of our operations on the environment. We reduce the load on the environment by regularly and proactively taking care of and repairing homes and properties according to the life-cycle principle  and by building properties primarily in existing urban environments and near good public transport connections.The planning of SATO‚Äôs new rental apartments always takes into account energy efficiency and solutions that will last for decades. In new properties  SATO‚Äôs goal is energy class A (energy performance indicator 75 or below)  which is significantly better than that required by the building code (energy performance indicator 90). All of the buildings that were completed during the reporting year were energy class A. The average EPI for buildings begun during 2022 was 72 and all of the housing starts are energy class A.We are committed to the Energy Efficiency Agreement targets for the property sector  aiming for a reduction in the total consumption of electricity and heat of 10.5% from the 2015 baseline by 2025.The use of renewable energy in heating significantly reduces the in-use emissions of homes. At every new building and renovation site  we look into the possibility of geothermal heat. We currently have 17 properties that are carbon neutral in terms of electricity and heating. During the reporting year  geothermal heat was being built on 12 properties. In addition  six properties had a solar power plant and solar power plants were being built on nine properties. In 2022  building electricity consisted entirely of emission-free electricity.During 2022  SATO converted the heating system to geothermal heat at the last properties which still had fossil-fuel-based heating  thus taking us a significant step closer to our goal of achieving in-use carbon neutrality.Vantaa Energy and SATO signed an energy partnership agreement in February 2022. Together with Vantaa Energy  we are developing carbon-neutral energy solutions for buildings‚Äô heating and cooling  which will help us achieve our carbon neutrality target by 2030 for in-use energy consumption.During the reporting year  we continued to invest in energy efficiency improvements in SATOhomes in connection with renovations. In renovations  our goal is to improve energy efficiency by some 30% compared to earlier. Due to the rise in heating and electricity prices  energy costs rose overall.During the reporting year  specific energy consumption fell 4.1%  specific electricity consumption rose 7.1% and specific water consumption fell 2.0% compared to 2021. Specific emissions from SATO‚Äôs apartments fell by 9.3% compared to 2021 and were 28.2 (31.1) carbon dioxide equivalent kilograms per square metre. Emissions are calculated according to the absolute consumption of district heat. Electricity was generated from emission-free nuclear power.According to the Ministry of the Environment  the built environment causes approximately one third of Finland‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions. The construction industry  together with the real estate sector and their related services  employ more than half a million people and bring in tax revenues for society. The construction industry does  however  have negative impacts not only on the environment  but also society and people. Some well-known examples of the construction industry‚Äôs negative impacts are the grey economy  occupational safety and human rights-related violations  as well as irregularities in procurement and delivery chains. We regularly assess and predict the social  economic and environmental risks related to our operations. We try to systematically reduce the identified negative impacts  for example by following our Code of Conduct  by combating the grey economy  by conducting audits and internal control  and by continuously developing our operations. During 2022  we decided to survey the current state of our compliance function in order to gain an overall picture of our policies and commitments.SATO has a whistleblowing channel through which SATO employees and external stakeholders can anonymously report critical concerns.The Group‚Äôs sustainability programme is available in its entirety at sato.fi.Development activitiesSATO‚Äôs development activities during the reporting year focused on developing sales and customer experience processes and operating models  the renewal of the invoicing processes and improving the continuous development operating model. We invested in developing digital services  as well as our presence near to the customers  and in building a uniform and seamless service experience. Our goal is to serve our customers in the best way possible  regardless of time or place.Based on customer feedback  we also developed  during the reporting year  our processes involving the rental of a new home. The changes made daily work more efficient for our rental team  which also means even better service for our customers. We revamped the reservation of apartment viewings to make them more flexible for the customer and to pilot test the online reservation of viewings no matter the time or place. The apartment viewings were mostly held by our own viewing agents. We updated the apartment application process on the sato.fi website and in 2022 made it possible for our customers to apply for homes using the ‚Äòmore sustainable option‚Äô search criterion.In our development operations last year  we also focused on renewing the invoicing processes and we piloted a new invoicing system in summer 2022. The new system offers better opportunities to view up-to-date invoicing information and the plan is to roll it out in full in spring 2023.In developing the business  we adopted a continuous development model at SATO during the reporting year. We defined the roles related to the model and will develop the activities as smaller components rather than large units  which will speed up development work and allow processes to be improved more effectively.A total of EUR 3.2 million (3.2) was spent on development  corresponding to approximately 1.1% of net sales.Risk managementRisk management is used to ensure that risks impacting the company‚Äôs business are identified  managed and monitored. The main risks of SATO‚Äôs business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.SATO‚Äôs most significant risks are related to prolonged inflation and the resulting rise in interest rates. As a result of the war in Ukraine  the prices of energy  food  materials and commodities have increased dramatically and interest rates have risen. Higher cost of living can have a negative impact on consumers‚Äô purchasing power and ability to meet their obligations. If the strong growth in the cost of financing and maintenance costs continues and the market situation does not provide an opportunity to transfer the higher costs into rents in full  this can have a negative impact on the fair value of investment assets and the company‚Äôs ability to finance investments  which means that new investments and renovations will have to be postponed.The most significant risks in the renting of apartments are related to economic cycles and fluctuations in demand and supply. Market risk can increase the supply of rental housing to a point that it exceeds demand. This leads to rental housing vacancies and pressure to even out or lower the rent level especially for the old housing portfolio.A clear weakening in the housing market could have a negative impact on the market value of SATO‚Äôs housing portfolio. In accordance with its strategy  SATO focuses its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing its existing housing portfolio  thus ensuring the rental potential of its apartments and the development of their value.Changes in official regulations and legislation  as well as the uncertainty stemming from them  may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and thus on SATO‚Äôs business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and also calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group‚Äôs treasury policy  which has been approved by SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors. Our financial risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other long-term financing commitments. The company established a EUR 1.5 billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) bond programme in 2019.The means for managing the liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  committed credit facilities of EUR 700 million and a commercial paper programme of EUR 400 million. We increase the amount of reserves as the financing requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating rate loans form an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed and floating rate loans either by issuing fixed rate loans or by interest rate hedges. According to our treasury policy  our objective is to keep the ratio of fixed rate loans at over 60 % of debt portfolio after interest hedging.There are risks related to the business environment in our St. Petersburg operations  including currency risk. The consolidation of foreign currency-denominated assets in the consolidated financial statements also involves a translation risk. Possibilities of hedging the translation risk are evaluated in accordance with our financial policy. SATO has abstained from making new investments in Russia for a long time. Since the start of the war in Ukraine  the company has been reviewing opportunities to withdraw from the Russian business operations. Based on our studies  a fast withdrawal is not possible  which is why SATO will continue to rent residential apartments in St. Petersburg until a way to withdraw has been found. The company is actively seeking a solution. The Russian operating environment is expected to be extremely uncertain and it may cause disturbances in SATO‚Äôs business operations in Russia and with parties related to the Russian business. This can affect SATO‚Äôs ability to make payments to suppliers  its employees and authorities  and to receive payments from customers  which can have a significant adverse impact on SATO‚Äôs business operations in Russia. If the Ukraine war is prolonged  doing business in Russia may have a negative impact on the company‚Äôs reputation and it may make doing business difficult in Finland and weaken the company‚Äôs ability to procure financing on the market. It may also have an adverse impact on the financial result or operations of SATO‚Äôs properties  not to mention on financing costs or values.A more detailed description of risks and risk management is available on the Group‚Äôs website www.sato.fi.Pending legal actionsSATO has no official procedures  legal actions or arbitration proceedings pending that would have a significant impact on the company‚Äôs financial standing or profitability  and SATO is not aware of any threat of such proceedings.SharesOn 31 December 2022  the share capital of SATO Corporation was EUR 4 442 192.00 and there were 56 783 067 shares.

If a shareholder chooses not to exercise their nomination right  the right will pass on to the next largest shareholder. The State Pension Fund  the company‚Äôs fourth largest shareholder on 1 October 2022  did not exercise its nomination right  and the right was passed to Erkka Valkila  the fifth largest shareholder. The Committee consisted of representatives of the following shareholders: Balder Finska Otas AB (Erik Selin)  Stichting Depositary APG Strategic Real Estate Pool (Hans Spikker)  Elo Mutual Pension Insurance Company (Hanna Hiidenpalo) and Erkka Valkila.Board of Directors  CEO and auditorsThe Annual General Meeting held on 24 March 2022 confirmed that the Board of Directors consists of six members.In 2022  the members of SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors were chairman Erik Selin and ordinary members Esa Lager  Tarja P√§√§kk√∂nen  Sharam Rahi  Johannus (Hans) Spikker and Timo Stenius.The Board of Directors convened 11 times in 2022. The Board‚Äôs work is supported by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.In 2022  Antti Aarnio  M.Sc. (Tech.)  was SATO‚Äôs CEO.As the company‚Äôs auditor  the Annual General Meeting selected the audit firm Deloitte Oy  which appointed APA Aleksi Martamo as the auditor in charge. The auditor‚Äôs term in office is the financial year  and the auditor‚Äôs duties end at the closing of the next Annual General Meeting.Members of the Management GroupDuring the reporting period 2022  the Corporate Management Group consisted of Antti Aarnio  CEO  Arto Aalto  EVP  Investments  Markku Honkasalo  CFO  Janne Ojalehto  CCO (until 27 January 2023) and Elina Vaurasalo  EVP  Housing Business.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO‚Äôs business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence  the development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  the general competitive situation and interest rates.Employment development was strong in early 2022  but slowed down towards year-end due to economic challenges. During the reporting year  consumers‚Äô confidence weakened to a historically low level after the start of the year  which showed in private consumption. According to the projection made by the Bank of Finland on 16 December 2022  Finland‚Äôs economic growth in 2022 will be 1.9% due to the good start to the year. In 2023  the increase in energy prices and the cost of living is predicted to cause the economy to slide into a slight downturn and shrink by 0.5%.Uncertainty and rising interest rates are slowing housing sales. According to the statistics released by the Central Federation of Finnish Real Estate Agencies in December 2022  sales volumes of new and old apartments clearly fell in November compared to the five-year average. According to Statistics Finland‚Äôs preliminary data in December  the prices of old owner-occupied apartments fell in November 2022 in the whole of Finland by 3.4% compared to November of the previous year.The economic situation will decelerate the historically high rate of construction. The number of issued building permits began to fall already in 2021  but plenty of new apartments were and will be completed in 2022 and 2023  which is maintaining tight competition for good tenants and keeping rent increases moderate. The increased cost level resulting from inflation does  however  create pressure to increase rents in the future.The lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and improving employment resulted in a positive turnaround in internal migration to large growth centres in 2022 and demand for rental apartments has begun to grow. This  and SATO‚Äôs investments in making renting more efficient and improving customer service  were visible as an increase in SATO‚Äôs occupancy rate. Also  economic uncertainty  upward pressure on interest rates and increasing consumer prices contributed to the increase in the demand for rental apartments.As tenants have a wider array of choices  a successful customer experience is more important than ever. SATO is investing strongly in increasing its customer presence and developing digital services.In line with its majority shareholder‚Äôs operating model  SATO Corporation will not publish guidance on its 2023 earnings. The parent company of Balder Finska Otas AB is Fastighets AB Balder  which is quoted on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.Proposal of the Board of Directors for the distribution of profitOn 31 December 2022  the parent company‚Äôs distributable equity was EUR 512 557 145.56  of which profit for the period was EUR 129 644 613.16.

Underwriting profit amounted to EUR 1 314 million (1 282)  representing year-on-year growth of 2 per cent or 13 per cent adjusted for COVID-19 effects reported in 2021. The Group combined ratio was solid at 82.1 per cent (81.4)  supported by excellent performance in Nordic P&C and benefits from higher discount rates. Excluding the reported COVID-19 effects in 2021  the combined ratio would have improved by 1.0 percentage points year-on-year. Gross written premiums increased by 6 per cent to EUR 8 136 million (7 644)  driven by strong renewals  high retention and disciplined pricing. Sampo targets mid-single digit per cent underwriting profit growth on average and a combined ratio below 86 per cent for 2021-2023.If P&C‚Äôs underwriting profit increased 11 per cent to EUR 985 million (891) and the combined ratio improved to 80.3 per cent (81.3). The result was driven by a 7.2 per cent currency adjusted premium growth and continued strong underlying performance. Premium development was supported by broad-based growth across all business areas  with Industrial and the Baltics seeing the most notable positive development. In the largest business area  Private  currency adjusted premium growth remained solid at 3.5 per cent despite a decline in Nordic new car sales. The adjusted risk ratio improved by approximately 0.5 percentage points year-on-year. In addition to the strong underwriting development  the significant changes in the interest rate environment during 2022 increased If‚Äôs fixed income running yield to 3.2 per cent (1.5). Profit before taxes increased to EUR 1 217 million (1 077).Topdanmark‚Äôs profit before taxes for 2022 in Sampo Group‚Äôs profit and loss account decreased to EUR 220 million (346)  as the investment result was affected by the adverse market environment. The sale of Topdanmark life insurance business in the fourth quarter of 2022 supported the result by EUR 72 million. The combined ratio stood at 83.1 per cent (82.3).Hastings reported solid top-line growth with resilient margins in a challenging UK motor insurance market  in which the claims inflation remained elevated throughout the year. Gross written premiums grew by 15 per cent on a currency adjusted basis in 2022  supported by high retention and disciplined pricing. Live customer policies increased 2 per cent year-on-year to over 3.2 million  driven by a 33 per cent growth in home insurance  while motor policy count was stable. Hastings‚Äô operating ratio increased to 89.7 per cent (80.3). Profit before taxes amounted to EUR 73 million (127)  or EUR 131 million (168) excluding the non-operational depreciation and amortisation.The Mandatum segment‚Äôs profit before taxes for 2022 decreased to EUR 207 million (291)  reflecting lower realised gains and an increase in the group contribution to Sampo plc to EUR 29 million (15). Mandatum‚Äôs net flows in third-party assets remained positive in every quarter  but were outweighed by the decline in market values  leading to assets under management of EUR 10.3 billion at the end of 2022  down from EUR 11.1 billion at the year-end 2021. Mandatum Life‚Äôs Solvency II ratio increased to 248 per cent (190)  driven by higher interest rates and lower solvency capital requirement.The profit before taxes of EUR 1 863 million (3 171) for 2022 includes accounting effects of EUR 138 million (982) defined as extraordinary items in accordance with Sampo Group‚Äôs dividend policy. Of the total amount  EUR 103 million related to the sale of Nordea shares  EUR 72 million to the sale of Topdanmark Life and EUR -37 million to the reclassification of Nordax from an associated company to fair value investment. Excluding these items  the profit before taxes declined to EUR 1 725 million (2 189)  mainly as a result of Nordea no longer being consolidated as an associate. The total comprehensive income  which takes changes in the market values of assets into account  was affected by the adverse capital markets environment and amounted to EUR -26 million (3 448).Sampo Group‚Äôs year-end 2022 Solvency II ratio stood at 210 per cent  up from 185 per cent at the year-end 2021  but down from 256 per cent at the end of the third quarter. The decrease over the third quarter was primarily driven by the inclusion of the dividend proposal and the planned new buyback programme. Sampo targets a solvency ratio of 170‚Äì190 per cent.Sampo Group‚Äôs financial leverage was 25.6 per cent at the end of 2022  up from 23.8 per cent at the end of 2021  but slightly down from 25.9 per cent at the end of the third quarter. Sampo targets a financial leverage ratio below 30 per cent.Sampo plc‚Äôs Board of Directors proposes a dividend of EUR 2.60 per share for the 2022 financial year to the Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 May 2023. This consists of a regular dividend (formerly known as the insurance dividend as introduced at the 2021 CMD) of EUR 1.80 per share (1.70)  representing growth of 6 per cent  and an extra dividend of EUR 0.80 per share. In addition to the dividend  management is to propose to the Board a new EUR 400 million buyback programme.The implementation of IFRS 17 and 9 on 1 January 2023 will bring asset and liability side mark-to-market effects into Sampo‚Äôs reported net income. As a result  the Sampo Board has decided to adjust the Group‚Äôs dividend policy  such that the payout ratio is measured against a newly defined operational result rather than net profit excluding items defined as extraordinary  as previously. The change is not expected to have any significant effect on the size and trajectory of dividends. The adjusted dividend policy is described in the section Dividend proposal.On 7 December 2022  Sampo plc announced that the Board of Directors had decided to undertake a strategic review of Mandatum in line with Sampo‚Äôs strategic focus on P&C insurance. The Board continues to review a number of different options  with the aim to evaluate whether a separation of Mandatum could create shareholder value. Sampo expects to provide a further update on the strategic review by the end of the first quarter of 2023.In 2022  Sampo repurchased its own shares through three buyback programmes. Of the latest buyback programme of EUR 1 billion  launched on 9 June 2022  EUR 845 million had been executed at year-end 2022. The programme was completed on 8 February 2023. In total  Sampo repurchased 32 million shares for a total of EUR 1.4 billion in 2022.FOURTH QUARTER 2022 IN BRIEFIn October-December 2022  Sampo Group reported profit before taxes of EUR 390 million (1 197). Excluding accounting effects treated as extraordinary items in accordance with Sampo Group‚Äôs dividend policy  profit before taxes amounted to EUR 355 million (452). Earnings per share amounted to EUR 0.50 (1.89)  or EUR 0.41 (0.55) excluding extraordinary items. Total comprehensive income  which takes changes in the market values of assets into account  amounted to EUR 448 million (1 269).Group underwriting profit increased to EUR 304 million (297). Excluding COVID-19 effects reported in the comparison period  underwriting profit grew by 12 per cent. The Group combined ratio amounted to 83.7 per cent (83.0).If P&C reported profit before taxes of EUR 285 million (260) and underwriting profit of EUR 229 million (210). The combined ratio was 81.7 per cent (82.9) and gross written premium growth 7.8 per cent on a currency adjusted basis. The adjusted risk ratio  which excludes the impact of large losses  severe weather  reported COVID-19 effects and prior year development  improved by 0.2 percentage points year-on-year.Topdanmark‚Äôs profit before taxes amounted to EUR 128 million (89) and combined ratio was 82.1 per cent (80.6).Hastings profit before taxes amounted to EUR 7 million (11). The operating ratio deteriorated to 94.0 per cent (87.9)  driven by increased claims frequency due to harsh weather conditions particularly in December. Gross written premiums increased by 31 per cent year-on-year on a currency adjusted basis. Live customer policy count remained stable  supported by continued strong growth in home insurance.The Mandatum segment‚Äôs profit before taxes amounted to EUR 18 million (91)  net of a profit contribution to Sampo plc of EUR 29 million (15). Excluding the profit contribution  profit before taxes stood at EUR 47 million (106). Mandatum‚Äôs third-party assets under management increased to EUR 10.3 billion from EUR 10.1 billion at the end of the third quarter  supported by strong net flows of EUR 213 million during the quarter.GROUP CEO‚ÄôS COMMENTSampo‚Äôs fourth quarter was characterised by strong operational execution  robust financial results and further steps on our strategic agenda. As we conclude a successful year  I am delighted that we are announcing EUR 1.7 billion (EUR 3.40 per share) of planned capital returns to shareholders.Sampo‚Äôs P&C insurance operations delivered excellent fourth quarter underwriting results of EUR 304 million  representing 13 per cent year-on-year growth  after adjusting for COVID-19 effects in the prior year. Notably  this result was achieved despite adverse weather in the form of heavy snowfall and cold weather. As always  our focus has been on assisting affected customers through superior service  which is a cornerstone of our strategy and instrumental in securing high retention rates over the long term.The result was driven mainly by our Nordic P&C business  where If grew underwriting profit excluding COVID-19 effects by 23 per cent  supported by an excellent fourth quarter combined ratio of 81.7 per cent and currency adjusted premium growth of 7.8 per cent. Importantly  our Nordic customer retention has remained high as we continue to cover claims inflation of 4‚Äì5 per cent with rate increases. The strongest pricing momentum is observed in Industrial  but fourth quarter premium growth also benefited from a stabilisation of new cars sales  albeit at a relatively low level  including support from high electric vehicle sales.In the UK  market conditions remained challenging  but Hastings achieved premium growth of 15 per cent over 2022 as it implemented significant rate increases to cover claims inflation of 12 per cent. Adverse weather had a negative impact on Hastings‚Äô operating ratio  pushing this to 89.7 per cent for 2022 as a whole. Although above our annual 88 per cent target  Hastings has delivered a relatively resilient result in what has been a challenging year for the UK motor market. I believe this reflects skilful operational execution and the company‚Äôs strong positioning and capabilities  which I expect will enable attractive profit growth as market conditions improve.In the capital markets  the fourth quarter saw further increases in interest rates and positive development in equity markets. Due to the short duration of our fixed income portfolio  we were able to continue to rapidly increase our running yield. Over 2022  higher running yields have added roughly EUR 230 million to Sampo‚Äôs annual pre-tax earning power  with the largest contribution coming from If P&C  which has more than doubled its running yield to 3.2 per cent (1.5).In December  Sampo‚Äôs Board of Directors launched a strategic review of Mandatum to evaluate whether separating the entity from the Group could add shareholder value. As a pure P&C insurer  Sampo could deliver higher and more resilient returns on capital  while an independent Mandatum would enjoy greater strategic flexibility to invest in growth. On the other hand  Mandatum makes an attractive contribution to the Group‚Äôs cash flow that supports value creation over time. We expect to provide an update on the review by the end of the first quarter of 2023.Turning to capital management  Sampo remains committed to capital discipline with a EUR 2.60 per share dividend proposal for 2022 and a EUR 400 million share buyback programme  which management is to propose. Adjusting for these actions  the Group retains EUR 2 per share of excess capital above the needs of the insurance operations  most of which is tied into private equity investments held in Sampo plc.Torbj√∂rn MagnussonGroup CEOOUTLOOKOutlook for 2023Sampo Group‚Äôs P&C insurance operations are expected to achieve underwriting margins that meet the annual targets set for 2021‚Äì2023. At Group level  Sampo targets a combined ratio of below 86 per cent  while the target for its largest subsidiary  If P&C  is below 85 per cent. Hastings targets an operating ratio of below 88 per cent.The combined and operating ratios of Sampo Group‚Äôs P&C insurance operations are subject to volatility driven by  among other factors  seasonal weather patterns  large claims and prior year development. These effects are particularly relevant for individual segments and business areas  such as the Danish and UK operations.The mark-to-market component of the net financial result will be significantly influenced by capital markets‚Äô developments  particularly in life insurance.With regard to Topdanmark  reference is made to the profit forecast model that the company publishes on a quarterly basis.The major risks and uncertainties for the Group in the near-termIn its current day-to-day business activities Sampo Group is exposed to various risks and uncertainties  mainly through its major business units.Major risks affecting the Group companies‚Äô profitability and its variation are market  credit  insurance and operational risks. At the Group level  sources of risks are the same  although they are not directly additive due to the effects of diversification.Uncertainties in the form of major unforeseen events may have an immediate impact on the Group‚Äôs profitability. The identification of unforeseen events is easier than the estimation of their probabilities  timing  and potential outcomes. During 2022 the global economy was hit by the war in Ukraine and at the same time  inflation pressures intensified and broadened forcing central banks to raise interest rates sharply. This may lead to both a further significant slowdown in economic growth and a deterioration in the debt service capacity of businesses  households and governments. Furthermore  the re-alignment of energy supplies in Europe takes time and the energy crisis could continue for several years. These developments are currently causing significant uncertainties in economic and capital market development. At the same time rapidly evolving hybrid threats create new challenges for states and businesses. There are also a number of widely identified macroeconomic  political and other sources of uncertainty which can  in various ways  affect the financial services industry in a negative manner.Other sources of uncertainty are unforeseen structural changes in the business environment and already identified trends and potential wide-impact events. These external drivers may have a long-term impact on how Sampo Group‚Äôs business will be conducted. Examples of identified trends are demographic changes  sustainability issues  and technological developments in areas such as artificial intelligence and digitalisation including threats posed by cybercrime.DIVIDEND PROPOSALDividendUnder Sampo Group‚Äôs capital management framework  Sampo will return ongoing surplus capital generation from its insurance operations through a regular dividend. Other forms of surplus capital generation  including possible proceeds from disposals of financial investments  are returned through additional dividends and/or buybacks  to the extent that the funds are not utilised to support business development. Sampo targets a Solvency II ratio of 170‚Äì190 per cent and financial leverage below 30 per cent.According to Sampo plc‚Äôs Dividend Policy applied for distribution of 2022 earnings  total annual dividends paid shall represent at least 70 per cent of Sampo Group‚Äôs net profit for the year (excluding extraordinary items). In 2022  accounting items related to the sale of Nordea shares  the sale of Topdanmark life insurance operations and the reclassification of Nordax from an associated company to fair value investment have been defined as extraordinary in accordance with Sampo‚Äôs dividend policy.The parent company‚Äôs distributable capital and reserves totalled EUR 6 716 million of which profit for the financial year 2022 was EUR 1 780 million. Based on the policies outlined above  the Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a total dividend of EUR 2.60 per share be paid to all shares except for the shares held by Sampo plc on the dividend record date of 22 May 2023. The total dividend includes a regular dividend of EUR 1.80 per share as well as an extra dividend of EUR 0.80 per share.As earnings per share excluding extraordinary items amounted to EUR 2.41 per share  the payout ratio for the total dividend equates to 108 per cent. The remainder of the distributable funds are left in the company‚Äôs equity capital. After adjusting for the proposed dividend  Sampo Group‚Äôs 2022 year-end distributable funds amounted to EUR 5 378 million  Group Solvency II ratio to 210 per cent and financial leverage to 28.6 per cent.Dividend paymentThe dividend is proposed to be paid to the shareholders registered in the register of shareholders held by Euroclear Finland Oy as at the record date of 22 May 2023. The Board proposes that the dividends be paid on 31 May 2023.The issuer of the Swedish depository receipts shall ensure that the dividend is paid to the depository receipt holders registered in the securities depository and settlement register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB as at the record date of 22 May 2023  which payment shall be made in Swedish kronor.Financial positionNo significant changes have taken place in the company's financial position since the end of the financial year. The company's liquidity position is good and in the view of the Board  the proposed distributions do not jeopardise the company's ability to fulfil its obligations.Adjustment to Sampo Group‚Äôs dividend policyThe implementation of IFRS 17 and 9 on 1 January 2023 will bring asset and liability side mark-to-market effects into Sampo‚Äôs reported net income. As a result  the Sampo Board has decided to adjust the Group‚Äôs dividend policy  such that the minimum payout ratio of 70 per cent is measured against a newly defined operational result rather than net profit excluding items defined as extraordinary  as previously. The change is not expected to have any significant effect on the size and trajectory of dividends. The adjustment is effective to payouts made in respect of the 2023 and later financial years‚Äô.According to the updated dividend policy  Sampo is to pay a stable and sustainable regular dividend that grows in line with the Group‚Äôs earnings over time. Total annual dividends paid will be at least 70 per cent of Group‚Äôs operational result.The operational result is similar to net profit excluding items defined as extraordinary used under IFRS 4  with the main differences being that it excludes all result effects from discount rate changes as well as non-operational amortisation in Sampo‚Äôs P&C operations  and that Mandatum‚Äôs profit is replaced with the dividend stream that it provides to Sampo plc. The full definition of the operational result can be found at www.sampo.com/dividend .Sampo is committed to operating a strong and efficient balance sheet  as defined by the Group‚Äôs capital management framework. To enable this  regular dividends can be complemented with distributions of excess capital via share buybacks and/or extra dividends.OTHER DEVELOPMENTSStrategic review of MandatumOn 7 December 2022  Sampo plc announced that the Board of Directors had decided to undertake a strategic review of Mandatum in line with Sampo‚Äôs strategic focus on P&C insurance. The Board continues to review a number of different options  with the aim to evaluate whether a separation of Mandatum could create shareholder value.The Board of Directors of Sampo plc is content with the current Group structure as it offers diversification in terms of business exposures as well as capital and cash generation. Sampo expects to provide a further update on the strategic review by the end of the first quarter of 2023.EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODShare buyback programmeSampo‚Äôs share buyback programme of EUR 1 billion announced on 9 June 2022 continued after the end of the reporting period. The buyback programme was completed on 8 February 2023  when at market close  the company held  after cancellation of the own shares on 8 December 2022  in total 5.4 million Sampo A shares representing 1.05 per cent of the total number of shares in Sampo plc. Sampo had bought altogether 22.1 million A shares under the share buyback programme between 10 June 2022 and 8 February 2023  of which 16.7 million shares were cancelled on 8 December 2022. Further information on the buyback programme is available on www.sampo.com/sharebuyback .Proposal for the new Chair of the BoardSampo disclosed on 30 January 2023 that its Nomination and Remuneration Committee plans to propose previous Board member Antti M√§kinen as a new member of the Board of Directors of Sampo plc at the Annual General Meeting on 17 May 2023  and to nominate him as Chair of the Board of Directors.

Underwriting profit amounted to EUR 1 314 million (1 282)  representing year-on-year growth of 2 per cent or 13 per cent adjusted for COVID-19 effects reported in 2021. The Group combined ratio was solid at 82.1 per cent (81.4)  supported by excellent performance in Nordic P&C and benefits from higher discount rates. Excluding the reported COVID-19 effects in 2021  the combined ratio would have improved by 1.0 percentage points year-on-year. Gross written premiums increased by 6 per cent to EUR 8 136 million (7 644)  driven by strong renewals  high retention and disciplined pricing. Sampo targets mid-single digit per cent underwriting profit growth on average and a combined ratio below 86 per cent for 2021-2023.If P&C‚Äôs underwriting profit increased 11 per cent to EUR 985 million (891) and the combined ratio improved to 80.3 per cent (81.3). The result was driven by a 7.2 per cent currency adjusted premium growth and continued strong underlying performance. Premium development was supported by broad-based growth across all business areas  with Industrial and the Baltics seeing the most notable positive development. In the largest business area  Private  currency adjusted premium growth remained solid at 3.5 per cent despite a decline in Nordic new car sales. The adjusted risk ratio improved by approximately 0.5 percentage points year-on-year. In addition to the strong underwriting development  the significant changes in the interest rate environment during 2022 increased If‚Äôs fixed income running yield to 3.2 per cent (1.5). Profit before taxes increased to EUR 1 217 million (1 077).Topdanmark‚Äôs profit before taxes for 2022 in Sampo Group‚Äôs profit and loss account decreased to EUR 220 million (346)  as the investment result was affected by the adverse market environment. The sale of Topdanmark life insurance business in the fourth quarter of 2022 supported the result by EUR 72 million. The combined ratio stood at 83.1 per cent (82.3).Hastings reported solid top-line growth with resilient margins in a challenging UK motor insurance market  in which the claims inflation remained elevated throughout the year. Gross written premiums grew by 15 per cent on a currency adjusted basis in 2022  supported by high retention and disciplined pricing. Live customer policies increased 2 per cent year-on-year to over 3.2 million  driven by a 33 per cent growth in home insurance  while motor policy count was stable. Hastings‚Äô operating ratio increased to 89.7 per cent (80.3). Profit before taxes amounted to EUR 73 million (127)  or EUR 131 million (168) excluding the non-operational depreciation and amortisation.The Mandatum segment‚Äôs profit before taxes for 2022 decreased to EUR 207 million (291)  reflecting lower realised gains and an increase in the group contribution to Sampo plc to EUR 29 million (15). Mandatum‚Äôs net flows in third-party assets remained positive in every quarter  but were outweighed by the decline in market values  leading to assets under management of EUR 10.3 billion at the end of 2022  down from EUR 11.1 billion at the year-end 2021. Mandatum Life‚Äôs Solvency II ratio increased to 248 per cent (190)  driven by higher interest rates and lower solvency capital requirement.The profit before taxes of EUR 1 863 million (3 171) for 2022 includes accounting effects of EUR 138 million (982) defined as extraordinary items in accordance with Sampo Group‚Äôs dividend policy. Of the total amount  EUR 103 million related to the sale of Nordea shares  EUR 72 million to the sale of Topdanmark Life and EUR -37 million to the reclassification of Nordax from an associated company to fair value investment. Excluding these items  the profit before taxes declined to EUR 1 725 million (2 189)  mainly as a result of Nordea no longer being consolidated as an associate. The total comprehensive income  which takes changes in the market values of assets into account  was affected by the adverse capital markets environment and amounted to EUR -26 million (3 448).Sampo Group‚Äôs year-end 2022 Solvency II ratio stood at 210 per cent  up from 185 per cent at the year-end 2021  but down from 256 per cent at the end of the third quarter. The decrease over the third quarter was primarily driven by the inclusion of the dividend proposal and the planned new buyback programme. Sampo targets a solvency ratio of 170‚Äì190 per cent.Sampo Group‚Äôs financial leverage was 25.6 per cent at the end of 2022  up from 23.8 per cent at the end of 2021  but slightly down from 25.9 per cent at the end of the third quarter. Sampo targets a financial leverage ratio below 30 per cent.Sampo plc‚Äôs Board of Directors proposes a dividend of EUR 2.60 per share for the 2022 financial year to the Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 May 2023. This consists of a regular dividend (formerly known as the insurance dividend as introduced at the 2021 CMD) of EUR 1.80 per share (1.70)  representing growth of 6 per cent  and an extra dividend of EUR 0.80 per share. In addition to the dividend  management is to propose to the Board a new EUR 400 million buyback programme.The implementation of IFRS 17 and 9 on 1 January 2023 will bring asset and liability side mark-to-market effects into Sampo‚Äôs reported net income. As a result  the Sampo Board has decided to adjust the Group‚Äôs dividend policy  such that the payout ratio is measured against a newly defined operational result rather than net profit excluding items defined as extraordinary  as previously. The change is not expected to have any significant effect on the size and trajectory of dividends. The adjusted dividend policy is described in the section Dividend proposal.On 7 December 2022  Sampo plc announced that the Board of Directors had decided to undertake a strategic review of Mandatum in line with Sampo‚Äôs strategic focus on P&C insurance. The Board continues to review a number of different options  with the aim to evaluate whether a separation of Mandatum could create shareholder value. Sampo expects to provide a further update on the strategic review by the end of the first quarter of 2023.In 2022  Sampo repurchased its own shares through three buyback programmes. Of the latest buyback programme of EUR 1 billion  launched on 9 June 2022  EUR 845 million had been executed at year-end 2022. The programme was completed on 8 February 2023. In total  Sampo repurchased 32 million shares for a total of EUR 1.4 billion in 2022.FOURTH QUARTER 2022 IN BRIEFIn October-December 2022  Sampo Group reported profit before taxes of EUR 390 million (1 197). Excluding accounting effects treated as extraordinary items in accordance with Sampo Group‚Äôs dividend policy  profit before taxes amounted to EUR 355 million (452). Earnings per share amounted to EUR 0.50 (1.89)  or EUR 0.41 (0.55) excluding extraordinary items. Total comprehensive income  which takes changes in the market values of assets into account  amounted to EUR 448 million (1 269).Group underwriting profit increased to EUR 304 million (297). Excluding COVID-19 effects reported in the comparison period  underwriting profit grew by 12 per cent. The Group combined ratio amounted to 83.7 per cent (83.0).If P&C reported profit before taxes of EUR 285 million (260) and underwriting profit of EUR 229 million (210). The combined ratio was 81.7 per cent (82.9) and gross written premium growth 7.8 per cent on a currency adjusted basis. The adjusted risk ratio  which excludes the impact of large losses  severe weather  reported COVID-19 effects and prior year development  improved by 0.2 percentage points year-on-year.Topdanmark‚Äôs profit before taxes amounted to EUR 128 million (89) and combined ratio was 82.1 per cent (80.6).Hastings profit before taxes amounted to EUR 7 million (11). The operating ratio deteriorated to 94.0 per cent (87.9)  driven by increased claims frequency due to harsh weather conditions particularly in December. Gross written premiums increased by 31 per cent year-on-year on a currency adjusted basis. Live customer policy count remained stable  supported by continued strong growth in home insurance.The Mandatum segment‚Äôs profit before taxes amounted to EUR 18 million (91)  net of a profit contribution to Sampo plc of EUR 29 million (15). Excluding the profit contribution  profit before taxes stood at EUR 47 million (106). Mandatum‚Äôs third-party assets under management increased to EUR 10.3 billion from EUR 10.1 billion at the end of the third quarter  supported by strong net flows of EUR 213 million during the quarter.GROUP CEO‚ÄôS COMMENTSampo‚Äôs fourth quarter was characterised by strong operational execution  robust financial results and further steps on our strategic agenda. As we conclude a successful year  I am delighted that we are announcing EUR 1.7 billion (EUR 3.40 per share) of planned capital returns to shareholders.Sampo‚Äôs P&C insurance operations delivered excellent fourth quarter underwriting results of EUR 304 million  representing 13 per cent year-on-year growth  after adjusting for COVID-19 effects in the prior year. Notably  this result was achieved despite adverse weather in the form of heavy snowfall and cold weather. As always  our focus has been on assisting affected customers through superior service  which is a cornerstone of our strategy and instrumental in securing high retention rates over the long term.The result was driven mainly by our Nordic P&C business  where If grew underwriting profit excluding COVID-19 effects by 23 per cent  supported by an excellent fourth quarter combined ratio of 81.7 per cent and currency adjusted premium growth of 7.8 per cent. Importantly  our Nordic customer retention has remained high as we continue to cover claims inflation of 4‚Äì5 per cent with rate increases. The strongest pricing momentum is observed in Industrial  but fourth quarter premium growth also benefited from a stabilisation of new cars sales  albeit at a relatively low level  including support from high electric vehicle sales.In the UK  market conditions remained challenging  but Hastings achieved premium growth of 15 per cent over 2022 as it implemented significant rate increases to cover claims inflation of 12 per cent. Adverse weather had a negative impact on Hastings‚Äô operating ratio  pushing this to 89.7 per cent for 2022 as a whole. Although above our annual 88 per cent target  Hastings has delivered a relatively resilient result in what has been a challenging year for the UK motor market. I believe this reflects skilful operational execution and the company‚Äôs strong positioning and capabilities  which I expect will enable attractive profit growth as market conditions improve.In the capital markets  the fourth quarter saw further increases in interest rates and positive development in equity markets. Due to the short duration of our fixed income portfolio  we were able to continue to rapidly increase our running yield. Over 2022  higher running yields have added roughly EUR 230 million to Sampo‚Äôs annual pre-tax earning power  with the largest contribution coming from If P&C  which has more than doubled its running yield to 3.2 per cent (1.5).In December  Sampo‚Äôs Board of Directors launched a strategic review of Mandatum to evaluate whether separating the entity from the Group could add shareholder value. As a pure P&C insurer  Sampo could deliver higher and more resilient returns on capital  while an independent Mandatum would enjoy greater strategic flexibility to invest in growth. On the other hand  Mandatum makes an attractive contribution to the Group‚Äôs cash flow that supports value creation over time. We expect to provide an update on the review by the end of the first quarter of 2023.Turning to capital management  Sampo remains committed to capital discipline with a EUR 2.60 per share dividend proposal for 2022 and a EUR 400 million share buyback programme  which management is to propose. Adjusting for these actions  the Group retains EUR 2 per share of excess capital above the needs of the insurance operations  most of which is tied into private equity investments held in Sampo plc.Torbj√∂rn MagnussonGroup CEOOUTLOOKOutlook for 2023Sampo Group‚Äôs P&C insurance operations are expected to achieve underwriting margins that meet the annual targets set for 2021‚Äì2023. At Group level  Sampo targets a combined ratio of below 86 per cent  while the target for its largest subsidiary  If P&C  is below 85 per cent. Hastings targets an operating ratio of below 88 per cent.The combined and operating ratios of Sampo Group‚Äôs P&C insurance operations are subject to volatility driven by  among other factors  seasonal weather patterns  large claims and prior year development. These effects are particularly relevant for individual segments and business areas  such as the Danish and UK operations.The mark-to-market component of the net financial result will be significantly influenced by capital markets‚Äô developments  particularly in life insurance.With regard to Topdanmark  reference is made to the profit forecast model that the company publishes on a quarterly basis.The major risks and uncertainties for the Group in the near-termIn its current day-to-day business activities Sampo Group is exposed to various risks and uncertainties  mainly through its major business units.Major risks affecting the Group companies‚Äô profitability and its variation are market  credit  insurance and operational risks. At the Group level  sources of risks are the same  although they are not directly additive due to the effects of diversification.Uncertainties in the form of major unforeseen events may have an immediate impact on the Group‚Äôs profitability. The identification of unforeseen events is easier than the estimation of their probabilities  timing  and potential outcomes. During 2022 the global economy was hit by the war in Ukraine and at the same time  inflation pressures intensified and broadened forcing central banks to raise interest rates sharply. This may lead to both a further significant slowdown in economic growth and a deterioration in the debt service capacity of businesses  households and governments. Furthermore  the re-alignment of energy supplies in Europe takes time and the energy crisis could continue for several years. These developments are currently causing significant uncertainties in economic and capital market development. At the same time rapidly evolving hybrid threats create new challenges for states and businesses. There are also a number of widely identified macroeconomic  political and other sources of uncertainty which can  in various ways  affect the financial services industry in a negative manner.Other sources of uncertainty are unforeseen structural changes in the business environment and already identified trends and potential wide-impact events. These external drivers may have a long-term impact on how Sampo Group‚Äôs business will be conducted. Examples of identified trends are demographic changes  sustainability issues  and technological developments in areas such as artificial intelligence and digitalisation including threats posed by cybercrime.DIVIDEND PROPOSALDividendUnder Sampo Group‚Äôs capital management framework  Sampo will return ongoing surplus capital generation from its insurance operations through a regular dividend. Other forms of surplus capital generation  including possible proceeds from disposals of financial investments  are returned through additional dividends and/or buybacks  to the extent that the funds are not utilised to support business development. Sampo targets a Solvency II ratio of 170‚Äì190 per cent and financial leverage below 30 per cent.According to Sampo plc‚Äôs Dividend Policy applied for distribution of 2022 earnings  total annual dividends paid shall represent at least 70 per cent of Sampo Group‚Äôs net profit for the year (excluding extraordinary items). In 2022  accounting items related to the sale of Nordea shares  the sale of Topdanmark life insurance operations and the reclassification of Nordax from an associated company to fair value investment have been defined as extraordinary in accordance with Sampo‚Äôs dividend policy.The parent company‚Äôs distributable capital and reserves totalled EUR 6 716 million of which profit for the financial year 2022 was EUR 1 780 million. Based on the policies outlined above  the Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a total dividend of EUR 2.60 per share be paid to all shares except for the shares held by Sampo plc on the dividend record date of 22 May 2023. The total dividend includes a regular dividend of EUR 1.80 per share as well as an extra dividend of EUR 0.80 per share.As earnings per share excluding extraordinary items amounted to EUR 2.41 per share  the payout ratio for the total dividend equates to 108 per cent. The remainder of the distributable funds are left in the company‚Äôs equity capital. After adjusting for the proposed dividend  Sampo Group‚Äôs 2022 year-end distributable funds amounted to EUR 5 378 million  Group Solvency II ratio to 210 per cent and financial leverage to 28.6 per cent.Dividend paymentThe dividend is proposed to be paid to the shareholders registered in the register of shareholders held by Euroclear Finland Oy as at the record date of 22 May 2023. The Board proposes that the dividends be paid on 31 May 2023.The issuer of the Swedish depository receipts shall ensure that the dividend is paid to the depository receipt holders registered in the securities depository and settlement register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB as at the record date of 22 May 2023  which payment shall be made in Swedish kronor.Financial positionNo significant changes have taken place in the company's financial position since the end of the financial year. The company's liquidity position is good and in the view of the Board  the proposed distributions do not jeopardise the company's ability to fulfil its obligations.Adjustment to Sampo Group‚Äôs dividend policyThe implementation of IFRS 17 and 9 on 1 January 2023 will bring asset and liability side mark-to-market effects into Sampo‚Äôs reported net income. As a result  the Sampo Board has decided to adjust the Group‚Äôs dividend policy  such that the minimum payout ratio of 70 per cent is measured against a newly defined operational result rather than net profit excluding items defined as extraordinary  as previously. The change is not expected to have any significant effect on the size and trajectory of dividends. The adjustment is effective to payouts made in respect of the 2023 and later financial years‚Äô.According to the updated dividend policy  Sampo is to pay a stable and sustainable regular dividend that grows in line with the Group‚Äôs earnings over time. Total annual dividends paid will be at least 70 per cent of Group‚Äôs operational result.The operational result is similar to net profit excluding items defined as extraordinary used under IFRS 4  with the main differences being that it excludes all result effects from discount rate changes as well as non-operational amortisation in Sampo‚Äôs P&C operations  and that Mandatum‚Äôs profit is replaced with the dividend stream that it provides to Sampo plc. The full definition of the operational result can be found at www.sampo.com/dividend .Sampo is committed to operating a strong and efficient balance sheet  as defined by the Group‚Äôs capital management framework. To enable this  regular dividends can be complemented with distributions of excess capital via share buybacks and/or extra dividends.OTHER DEVELOPMENTSStrategic review of MandatumOn 7 December 2022  Sampo plc announced that the Board of Directors had decided to undertake a strategic review of Mandatum in line with Sampo‚Äôs strategic focus on P&C insurance. The Board continues to review a number of different options  with the aim to evaluate whether a separation of Mandatum could create shareholder value.The Board of Directors of Sampo plc is content with the current Group structure as it offers diversification in terms of business exposures as well as capital and cash generation. Sampo expects to provide a further update on the strategic review by the end of the first quarter of 2023.EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODShare buyback programmeSampo‚Äôs share buyback programme of EUR 1 billion announced on 9 June 2022 continued after the end of the reporting period. The buyback programme was completed on 8 February 2023  when at market close  the company held  after cancellation of the own shares on 8 December 2022  in total 5.4 million Sampo A shares representing 1.05 per cent of the total number of shares in Sampo plc. Sampo had bought altogether 22.1 million A shares under the share buyback programme between 10 June 2022 and 8 February 2023  of which 16.7 million shares were cancelled on 8 December 2022. Further information on the buyback programme is available on www.sampo.com/sharebuyback .Proposal for the new Chair of the BoardSampo disclosed on 30 January 2023 that its Nomination and Remuneration Committee plans to propose previous Board member Antti M√§kinen as a new member of the Board of Directors of Sampo plc at the Annual General Meeting on 17 May 2023  and to nominate him as Chair of the Board of Directors.

The complete report is attached to this release and is also available at www.sanoma.com/en/investors .Q4 2022The Group‚Äôs net sales grew to EUR 260 million (2021: 252). The positive impact of the acquisition of Pearson Italy and Germany was partially offset by lower advertising sales. The Group‚Äôs comparable growth was ‚Äë3% (2021: 6%).Operational EBIT excl. PPA was seasonally negative and amounted to EUR -2 million (2021: -5).EBIT was EUR -21 million (2021: -19). Items affecting comparability (IACs) increased to EUR -8 million (2021: -5) and were mainly related to recent acquisitions in Learning. Purchase price allocation adjustments and amortisations (PPAs) grew to EUR 11 million (2021: 8) as a result of the acquisition of the Italian and German business.Operational EPS was EUR -0.07 (2021: -0.06).EPS was EUR -0.13 (2021: -0.09).On 16 December 2022  Sanoma received a payment decision regarding tax audits for 2019‚àí2021 concerning the VAT treatment of magazine distribution in Media Finland  from which it will appeal. Based on the decision received  Sanoma paid EUR 11 million of VAT  penalties and interests at year end 2022 in order to avoid further interest accumulation. For dividend calculation purposes  the Group‚Äôs free cash flow will be adjusted for the prepayment.On 7 November 2022  Sanoma signed a EUR 300 million syndicated revolving credit facility replacing its earlier facility of the same size  and syndicated its EUR 250 million 4-year term loan used for the acquisition of Pearson Italy and Germany with a group of ten relationship banks.On 26 October  the Board of Directors decided the record date and payment date of the second dividend instalment of EUR 0.27 per share. The dividend record date was 28 October and the payment date 4 November.On 4 October  Sanoma divested Eduarte  a Dutch student administration system provider for vocational education  in line with the strategy to harmonise its digital offering across the learning business.FY 2022The Group‚Äôs net sales grew to EUR 1 298 million (2021: 1 252) mainly driven by the acquisition of the Italian and German learning business from Pearson. The Group‚Äôs comparable net sales growth was 1% (2021: 7%).Operational EBIT excl. PPA declined to EUR 189 million (2021: 197)  corresponding to a margin of 14.6% (2021: 15.8%). Earnings were stable in Learning and declined in Media Finland mainly due to lower advertising sales and higher paper costs.EBIT was EUR 112 million (2021: 142). IACs increased to EUR -38 million (2021: -16) mainly due to transaction and integration costs of recent acquisitions as well as impairments in Learning. PPAs were EUR 39 million (2021: 39).Operational EPS was EUR 0.65 (2021: 0.69).EPS was EUR 0.47 (2021: 0.62).Free cash flow declined to EUR 112 million (2021: 140) mainly due to lower earnings  as well as higher working capital  investments and taxes. It includes a significant positive contribution from the working capital of the acquired Italian and German businesses due to the timing of the acquisition.Net debt/Adj. EBITDA increased to 3.2 (2021: 2.4) mainly as a result of the acquisition in Italy and Germany.On 31 August  Sanoma completed the acquisition of Pearson‚Äôs local K12 learning content business in Italy and its small exam preparation business in Germany.On 7 June  Sanoma announced its strategic growth ambition to increase the Group‚Äôs net sales to over EUR 2 billion by 2030  with at least 75% coming from the learning business.The Board proposes a dividend of 0.37 ‚Ç¨ per share (2021: 0.54)  corresponding to 93% of the underlying free cash flow. The dividend will be paid in three instalments  EUR 0.13 on 28 April  EUR 0.13 in September and EUR 0.11 in November.Outlook for 2023In 2023  Sanoma expects that the Group‚Äôs reported net sales will be EUR 1.35‚Äí1.4 billion (2022: 1.3). The Group‚Äôs operational EBIT excl. PPA is expected to be EUR 150‚àí180 million (2022: 189).Regarding the operating environment  Sanoma expects that:The economies in the Group‚Äôs operating countries  particularly in Finland  will experience a mild recession.The advertising market in Finland will decline slightly  with most of the decline during the first half of the year.President and CEO Susan Duinhoven:‚ÄùIn light of the significant changes in the world around us  2022 was another solid year of transformation for Sanoma ‚Äìalthough being very different from what we expected twelve months ago  just coming out of the coronavirus pandemic. In Learning  one of the highlights in 2022 was the acquisition of two established learning businesses in Italy and Germany from Pearson. We were happy to welcome these strong teams to Sanoma at the end of August. The acquired businesses fit well in our learning portfolio and strategy  and the acquisition had already a modest positive contribution to our net sales growth and operational EBIT  and due to the timing of the acquisition also a significant one to the free cash flow. The integration has started according to our plans and playbook and we expect the separation from Pearson and integration into Sanoma to be a sizable project over the next 18‚àí24 months.Net sales of Learning grew by 7% driven by the acquired Italian and German businesses. Organic growth was good across our operating countries except ‚Äì in line with our expectations ‚Äì in Poland  where the latest curriculum renewal ended in 2021. In Spain  the implementation of the major educational reform and curriculum renewal  LOMLOE  started a bit more fragmented than we had anticipated. However  it created solid growth in the demand for learning content in 2022  which is expected to continue also in 2023 extending most likely even into 2024. The inflationary cost increases impacted the earnings in Learning  as we typically can set our prices only once a year. Now for 2023  we have been able to adapt the prices for our products and services and we expect that it will take 1‚àí2 years to fully mitigate the cost increases in most of our markets. Especially the higher personnel costs that in most of our businesses will impact us only from 2023 onwards  will take some time to mitigate. Despite the inflationary cost increases  the operational earnings remained stable in most of our businesses. The main exception was the Dutch distribution business that suffered during the summer period from labour shortage and related sharp increase in hiring costs  delays due to supply chain issues with our main supplier and the general inflationary cost pressures.In Media Finland  net sales were stable  while operational earnings declined driven by lower advertising sales and significantly higher paper costs. The active cost containment by the teams across fixed cost categories was not able to fully offset the adverse inflationary impact on Media Finland‚Äôs operational earnings. One of the highlights of the year was the clear growth in the number of visits to all our digital news platforms  especially Ilta-Sanomat  as well as solid growth in the digitally active subscription base of both Helsingin Sanomat and the regional news media titles. Subscription sales were stable  while the total number of subscribers declined slightly towards the end of the year reflecting the weakening consumer confidence in Finland. During the second half of the year  advertising sales declined year-on-year compared to the strong demand in 2021 that was driven by the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.Sustainability is at the core of both our learning and media business. During the year  we continued our actions towards our targets by focusing on improving diversity  equality and inclusion across Sanoma and sending our climate targets for validation to the Science-Based Targets initiative. Our progressive and holistic approach to sustainability was reflected in continued improvement in key ESG ratings and inclusion into the Nasdaq OMX Sustainability Finland Index. We were delighted to also see that our Employee Experience Index remained stable at the good level of 7.3  even in a year that put quite some challenges and hardship for our teams  and we continued to exceed the European benchmark that was 7.1.Compared to last year  our free cash flow declined significantly. The main reasons for this were higher investments in digital development in Learning  adaptation of our offices to the hybrid way of working as well as lower EBITDA and costs related to the recent acquisition in Learning. This was mostly compensated by the working capital that came with the acquired businesses due to the timing of the acquisition. Without a similar benefit from the Italian and German acquisition as seen in 2022  we expect the Group‚Äôs 2023 free cash flow to temporarily decline  being impacted by the lower earnings expected in our Finnish media business  continued investments in our digital platforms and integration of the recently acquired businesses together with significantly higher financial expenses.The Board proposes a dividend of EUR 0.37 (2021: 0.54)  corresponding to a yield of 3.8% on the end of 2022 share price and 93% of the underlying free cash flow. This proposal balances the capital use between the dividend and our continuing investments in growing the business further.We expect the challenging operating environment to continue  leading to a mild recession in most of our operating countries. This will be impacting our performance in 2023  and thus our Outlook for 2023 shows growth in net sales with slightly lower operational EBIT. In 2023  we will focus on further building the long-term strengths of our businesses around learning content  harmonisation of digital learning platforms and leading offering in digital news and entertainment  and thus coming out of the recession even stronger than we went in. At the same time  we will intensify our thoughtful cost management and highly selective approach to growth investments. We remain fully committed to our growth strategy as well as our long-term financial targets. We are aiming for the Group net sales to be above EUR 2 billion  with at least 75% coming from the learning business  which we aim to achieve through organic growth and further acquisitions within K12 learning services. Also in the shorter term  we continue to be interested in value creating acquisitions in K12 learning content  especially in-market acquisitions  even though our main focus this year will be on integrations and gaining the scale benefits that our European portfolio can offer.I would like to extend my great thanks to all Sanoma employees for their excellent work  tenacity and strong commitment to supporting our customers in these more challenging times. Thanks to our teams  we were able to continue our growth  operational development and solid financial performance throughout the year 2022. I also want to thank our customers and shareholders for their continued support and interest in selecting Sanoma as their partner and investment respectively. Together we will continue on our strategic path with an aim to grow and further strengthen our positions and improve our performance in the years ahead.‚Äô‚ÄôKey indicators for continuing operationsEUR million Q4 2022 Q4 2021 Change FY 2022 FY 2021 Change Net sales 259.5 252.4 3% 1 298.3 1 251.6 4% Operational EBITDA 1) 45.3 42.1 7% 355.4 361.0 -2% Margin 1) 17.4% 16.7% 27.4% 28.8% Operational EBIT excl.

Including the fund for non-restricted equity of EUR 210 million  the distributable funds amounted to EUR 665 million. The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that:A dividend of EUR 0.37 per share shall be paid for the year 2022. The dividend shall be paid in three instalments. The first instalment of EUR 0.13 per share shall be paid to a shareholder who is registered in the shareholders‚Äô register of the company maintained by Euroclear Finland Ltd on the dividend record date 21 April 2023. The payment date for this instalment is 28 April 2023. Record date for the second instalment of EUR 0.13 per share will be decided by the Board of Directors in September  and the estimated payment date will be in September 2023. Record date for the third instalment of EUR 0.11 per share will be decided by the Board of Directors in October  and the estimated payment date will be in November 2023.The amount left in equity shall be EUR 605 million.According to its dividend policy  Sanoma aims to pay an increasing dividend  equal to 40‚Äì60% of the annual free cash flow. When proposing a dividend to the AGM  the Board of Directors looks at the general macro-economic environment  Sanoma‚Äôs current and target capital structure  Sanoma‚Äôs future business plans and investment needs  as well as both previous year‚Äôs cash flows and expected future cash flows affecting capital structure.Analyst and investor conferenceAn analyst and investor conference will be held in English by the President and CEO Susan Duinhoven and CFO Alex Green at 11:00 EET at Sanomatalo  Flik Studio Eliel  1st floor  T√∂√∂l√∂nlahdenkatu 2  Helsinki.The conference can be followed as a live webcast at https://sanoma.videosync.fi/q4-2022-result .Management presentation is followed by a Q&A session.

The complete report is attached to this release and is also available at www.sanoma.com/en/investors .Q4 2022The Group‚Äôs net sales grew to EUR 260 million (2021: 252). The positive impact of the acquisition of Pearson Italy and Germany was partially offset by lower advertising sales. The Group‚Äôs comparable growth was ‚Äë3% (2021: 6%).Operational EBIT excl. PPA was seasonally negative and amounted to EUR -2 million (2021: -5).EBIT was EUR -21 million (2021: -19). Items affecting comparability (IACs) increased to EUR -8 million (2021: -5) and were mainly related to recent acquisitions in Learning. Purchase price allocation adjustments and amortisations (PPAs) grew to EUR 11 million (2021: 8) as a result of the acquisition of the Italian and German business.Operational EPS was EUR -0.07 (2021: -0.06).EPS was EUR -0.13 (2021: -0.09).On 16 December 2022  Sanoma received a payment decision regarding tax audits for 2019‚àí2021 concerning the VAT treatment of magazine distribution in Media Finland  from which it will appeal. Based on the decision received  Sanoma paid EUR 11 million of VAT  penalties and interests at year end 2022 in order to avoid further interest accumulation. For dividend calculation purposes  the Group‚Äôs free cash flow will be adjusted for the prepayment.On 7 November 2022  Sanoma signed a EUR 300 million syndicated revolving credit facility replacing its earlier facility of the same size  and syndicated its EUR 250 million 4-year term loan used for the acquisition of Pearson Italy and Germany with a group of ten relationship banks.On 26 October  the Board of Directors decided the record date and payment date of the second dividend instalment of EUR 0.27 per share. The dividend record date was 28 October and the payment date 4 November.On 4 October  Sanoma divested Eduarte  a Dutch student administration system provider for vocational education  in line with the strategy to harmonise its digital offering across the learning business.FY 2022The Group‚Äôs net sales grew to EUR 1 298 million (2021: 1 252) mainly driven by the acquisition of the Italian and German learning business from Pearson. The Group‚Äôs comparable net sales growth was 1% (2021: 7%).Operational EBIT excl. PPA declined to EUR 189 million (2021: 197)  corresponding to a margin of 14.6% (2021: 15.8%). Earnings were stable in Learning and declined in Media Finland mainly due to lower advertising sales and higher paper costs.EBIT was EUR 112 million (2021: 142). IACs increased to EUR -38 million (2021: -16) mainly due to transaction and integration costs of recent acquisitions as well as impairments in Learning. PPAs were EUR 39 million (2021: 39).Operational EPS was EUR 0.65 (2021: 0.69).EPS was EUR 0.47 (2021: 0.62).Free cash flow declined to EUR 112 million (2021: 140) mainly due to lower earnings  as well as higher working capital  investments and taxes. It includes a significant positive contribution from the working capital of the acquired Italian and German businesses due to the timing of the acquisition.Net debt/Adj. EBITDA increased to 3.2 (2021: 2.4) mainly as a result of the acquisition in Italy and Germany.On 31 August  Sanoma completed the acquisition of Pearson‚Äôs local K12 learning content business in Italy and its small exam preparation business in Germany.On 7 June  Sanoma announced its strategic growth ambition to increase the Group‚Äôs net sales to over EUR 2 billion by 2030  with at least 75% coming from the learning business.The Board proposes a dividend of 0.37 ‚Ç¨ per share (2021: 0.54)  corresponding to 93% of the underlying free cash flow. The dividend will be paid in three instalments  EUR 0.13 on 28 April  EUR 0.13 in September and EUR 0.11 in November.Outlook for 2023In 2023  Sanoma expects that the Group‚Äôs reported net sales will be EUR 1.35‚Äí1.4 billion (2022: 1.3). The Group‚Äôs operational EBIT excl. PPA is expected to be EUR 150‚àí180 million (2022: 189).Regarding the operating environment  Sanoma expects that:The economies in the Group‚Äôs operating countries  particularly in Finland  will experience a mild recession.The advertising market in Finland will decline slightly  with most of the decline during the first half of the year.President and CEO Susan Duinhoven:‚ÄùIn light of the significant changes in the world around us  2022 was another solid year of transformation for Sanoma ‚Äìalthough being very different from what we expected twelve months ago  just coming out of the coronavirus pandemic. In Learning  one of the highlights in 2022 was the acquisition of two established learning businesses in Italy and Germany from Pearson. We were happy to welcome these strong teams to Sanoma at the end of August. The acquired businesses fit well in our learning portfolio and strategy  and the acquisition had already a modest positive contribution to our net sales growth and operational EBIT  and due to the timing of the acquisition also a significant one to the free cash flow. The integration has started according to our plans and playbook and we expect the separation from Pearson and integration into Sanoma to be a sizable project over the next 18‚àí24 months.Net sales of Learning grew by 7% driven by the acquired Italian and German businesses. Organic growth was good across our operating countries except ‚Äì in line with our expectations ‚Äì in Poland  where the latest curriculum renewal ended in 2021. In Spain  the implementation of the major educational reform and curriculum renewal  LOMLOE  started a bit more fragmented than we had anticipated. However  it created solid growth in the demand for learning content in 2022  which is expected to continue also in 2023 extending most likely even into 2024. The inflationary cost increases impacted the earnings in Learning  as we typically can set our prices only once a year. Now for 2023  we have been able to adapt the prices for our products and services and we expect that it will take 1‚àí2 years to fully mitigate the cost increases in most of our markets. Especially the higher personnel costs that in most of our businesses will impact us only from 2023 onwards  will take some time to mitigate. Despite the inflationary cost increases  the operational earnings remained stable in most of our businesses. The main exception was the Dutch distribution business that suffered during the summer period from labour shortage and related sharp increase in hiring costs  delays due to supply chain issues with our main supplier and the general inflationary cost pressures.In Media Finland  net sales were stable  while operational earnings declined driven by lower advertising sales and significantly higher paper costs. The active cost containment by the teams across fixed cost categories was not able to fully offset the adverse inflationary impact on Media Finland‚Äôs operational earnings. One of the highlights of the year was the clear growth in the number of visits to all our digital news platforms  especially Ilta-Sanomat  as well as solid growth in the digitally active subscription base of both Helsingin Sanomat and the regional news media titles. Subscription sales were stable  while the total number of subscribers declined slightly towards the end of the year reflecting the weakening consumer confidence in Finland. During the second half of the year  advertising sales declined year-on-year compared to the strong demand in 2021 that was driven by the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.Sustainability is at the core of both our learning and media business. During the year  we continued our actions towards our targets by focusing on improving diversity  equality and inclusion across Sanoma and sending our climate targets for validation to the Science-Based Targets initiative. Our progressive and holistic approach to sustainability was reflected in continued improvement in key ESG ratings and inclusion into the Nasdaq OMX Sustainability Finland Index. We were delighted to also see that our Employee Experience Index remained stable at the good level of 7.3  even in a year that put quite some challenges and hardship for our teams  and we continued to exceed the European benchmark that was 7.1.Compared to last year  our free cash flow declined significantly. The main reasons for this were higher investments in digital development in Learning  adaptation of our offices to the hybrid way of working as well as lower EBITDA and costs related to the recent acquisition in Learning. This was mostly compensated by the working capital that came with the acquired businesses due to the timing of the acquisition. Without a similar benefit from the Italian and German acquisition as seen in 2022  we expect the Group‚Äôs 2023 free cash flow to temporarily decline  being impacted by the lower earnings expected in our Finnish media business  continued investments in our digital platforms and integration of the recently acquired businesses together with significantly higher financial expenses.The Board proposes a dividend of EUR 0.37 (2021: 0.54)  corresponding to a yield of 3.8% on the end of 2022 share price and 93% of the underlying free cash flow. This proposal balances the capital use between the dividend and our continuing investments in growing the business further.We expect the challenging operating environment to continue  leading to a mild recession in most of our operating countries. This will be impacting our performance in 2023  and thus our Outlook for 2023 shows growth in net sales with slightly lower operational EBIT. In 2023  we will focus on further building the long-term strengths of our businesses around learning content  harmonisation of digital learning platforms and leading offering in digital news and entertainment  and thus coming out of the recession even stronger than we went in. At the same time  we will intensify our thoughtful cost management and highly selective approach to growth investments. We remain fully committed to our growth strategy as well as our long-term financial targets. We are aiming for the Group net sales to be above EUR 2 billion  with at least 75% coming from the learning business  which we aim to achieve through organic growth and further acquisitions within K12 learning services. Also in the shorter term  we continue to be interested in value creating acquisitions in K12 learning content  especially in-market acquisitions  even though our main focus this year will be on integrations and gaining the scale benefits that our European portfolio can offer.I would like to extend my great thanks to all Sanoma employees for their excellent work  tenacity and strong commitment to supporting our customers in these more challenging times. Thanks to our teams  we were able to continue our growth  operational development and solid financial performance throughout the year 2022. I also want to thank our customers and shareholders for their continued support and interest in selecting Sanoma as their partner and investment respectively. Together we will continue on our strategic path with an aim to grow and further strengthen our positions and improve our performance in the years ahead.‚Äô‚ÄôKey indicators for continuing operationsEUR million Q4 2022 Q4 2021 Change FY 2022 FY 2021 Change Net sales 259.5 252.4 3% 1 298.3 1 251.6 4% Operational EBITDA 1) 45.3 42.1 7% 355.4 361.0 -2% Margin 1) 17.4% 16.7% 27.4% 28.8% Operational EBIT excl.

The opinion of BofA Securities was provided for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors of Caverion and does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holders of Shares should act in connection with the Tender Offer or any related matter.THE ACCEPTANCE PROCEDURE OF THE TENDER OFFERAcceptance of the Tender Offer with Alternative Consideration may only be submitted on the business day following the publication of the Supplement Document  i.e. from February 13  2023.Before February 13  2023  acceptance of the Tender Offer can only be made with the Cash Offer Price. Each shareholder of Caverion whose acceptance of the Tender Offer has been submitted before February 13  2023  shall be deemed to have accepted the Tender Offer with the Cash Offer Price.If a shareholder of Caverion has submitted the acceptance of the Tender Offer before February 13  2023 in respect of the Shares held by him/her and wishes to elect the Alternative Consideration instead of the Cash Offer Price  such shareholder must submit a valid withdrawal of his/her earlier acceptance of the Tender Offer in accordance with instructions from the account operator and submit a duly executed acceptance form for the Alternative Consideration. Neither the Offeror nor Nordea (in its capacity as arranger and an account operator) will charge the shareholders for withdrawing their acceptance of the Tender Offer in order to accept the Alternative Consideration in such a situation.A shareholder may only choose to receive either the Alternative Consideration or the Cash Offer Price for all Shares held on the same book-entry account  and  consequently  shareholders may only tender for mixed consideration if the relevant Shares are held on separate book-entry accounts.The shareholders holding Shares on equity savings accounts who have selected the Alternative Consideration will receive  instead of the Alternative Consideration Instruments  non-transferable rights to payment from the Offeror  and to demonstrate these  the book-entries named as other rights will be recorded to a shareholder's equity savings account.Most Finnish account operators will send a new notice regarding the Tender Offer and related instructions to those who are registered as shareholders in the shareholders' register of Caverion maintained by Euroclear Finland.

In particular  the financial information included in this stock exchange release has been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in Finland  which may not be comparable to the financial statements or financial information of U.S. companies. The Tender Offer is made to Caverion's shareholders resident in the United States on the same terms and conditions as those made to all other shareholders of Caverion to whom an offer is made. Any informational documents  including this stock exchange release  are being disseminated to U.S. shareholders on a basis comparable to the method that such documents are provided to Caverion's other shareholders.As permitted under the Tier I Exemption  the settlement of the Tender Offer is based on the applicable Finnish law provisions  which differ from the settlement procedures customary in the United States  particularly as regards to the time when payment of the consideration is rendered. The Tender Offer  which is subject to Finnish law  is being made to the U.S. shareholders in accordance with the applicable U.S. securities laws  and applicable exemptions thereunder  in particular the Tier I Exemption and the 802 Exemption. To the extent the Tender Offer is subject to U.S. securities laws  those laws only apply to U.S. shareholders and will not give rise to claims on the part of any other person.

THE FUNDING WILL BE USED AS WORKING CAPITAL AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE MASS PRODUCTION CONTRACT WI‚Ä¶,"Valoe Corporation Inside Information 10 February 2023 at 17.40 (Finnish time)VALOE HAS AGREED ON A EUR 5 000 000 FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT WITH WINANCE. THE FUNDING WILL BE USED AS WORKING CAPITAL AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE MASS PRODUCTION CONTRACT WITH SONO MOTORS HAS BEEN POSTPONED AND TO PAY DOWN THE COMPANY‚ÄôS DEBT TO RIVERFORT.Background and Purpose of Financial ArrangementValoe Oyj (‚ÄúValoe‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) has signed a convertible note facility agreement with Winance concerning a funding arrangement of up to EUR 5 000 000 in convertible loan notes (the ""Convertible Notes"") that will be accompanied by share subscription warrants (the ""Warrants"") (the agreement  the Convertible Notes and the Warrants hereinafter referred to collectively as the ""Arrangement"").Valoe will use the funding as working capital. The need for additional funding became apparent after the signing of the mass production contract for Sion  Sono Motors' self-charging electric vehicle  and the related estimated cash flows were postponed. In addition  Valoe will pay down its debt to Riverfort Global Opportunities Pcc Limited by approximately one million euro.On 20 December 2022  Valoe disclosed that the signing of the contract Valoe is negotiating with the company‚Äôs significant customer has been postponed until the end of the first quarter of 2023. The delay was expected to have negative impact on Valoe‚Äôs working capital situation. With Winance‚Äôs financing that has now been agreed on  Valoe expects to be able to meet its working capital needs until the substantial customer contracts are signed and the planned cash flow from customer contracts start to materialize.Under the Arrangement  Valoe issues Convertible Notes to Winance. The Convertible Notes may be drawn down so that the first tranche amounts to EUR2 000 000  after which the Convertible Notes may be drawn down in maximum of 6 sequential tranches of EUR 500 000 each (the first tranche and the subsequent Tranches  each ""Tranche"") during a period of 24 months from the drawdown of the first Tranche provided that the preconditions for each Tranche are met. Winance has the right to convert each Tranche into the Company‚Äôs newly issued or treasury shares. In addition  Winance will receive Warrants stripped from the Convertible Notes at the drawdown of each Tranche. The Warrants entitle Winance to subscribe to additional shares of the Company with a subscription price described in the Characteristics of the Warrants.The Company has an obligation to draw down the first Tranche of EUR 2 000 000 and a minimum of two sequential Tranches of the Convertible Notes  i.e. a total minimum of EUR 3 000 000. The remainder of the Convertible Notes  a total of four Tranches of EUR500 000 totaling EUR 2 000 000  may be drawn down by the Company at its discretion.Valoe has  pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Arrangement between Valoe and Winance  withdrawn the first Tranche of EUR 2 000 000  and issued to Winance in total 2 000 convertible notes and in total 13 333 333 warrants related thereto.Commercial Terms of ArrangementPursuant to the Arrangement  Winance may be given in the maximum of 5 000 convertible loan notes against subscription price of EUR 1 000 per each convertible loan note. The Convertible Notes entitle their holder to subscribe to maximum of 50 000 000 shares of the Company in the aggregate.The subscription price of the Notes related to the Tranche Warrants shall be equal to 98% of the par value of the Notes.Notwithstanding the first Tranche  a Tranche may be drawn down by the Company provided that all previously issued Convertible Notes within the Arrangement have been converted into the shares of the Company or that a cool down period agreed between the parties has lapsed  unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. Each Tranche may be drawn in several parts.Winance has agreed to subscribe for the Convertible Notes issued by the Company with a conversion ratio calculated at the time the respective conversion is requested so that the conversion ratio is equal to 90 % of the lowest daily volume weighted average price observed over a period of fifteen (15) consecutive trading days prior to such conversion request.The Convertible Notes bear a zero interest rate. The Convertible Notes have a maturity of 12 months from the issuance of each Tranche. Each Tranche must be converted into the Company's shares upon maturity at the latest.In connection with the drawdown of each Tranche  Winance will receive Warrants free of charge. Winance has the right  but no obligation  to subscribe for the Company‚Äôs shares based on the Warrants. In connection with the Arrangement  Winance may be given maximum of 10 000 000 Warrants in the aggregate which entitle their holder to subscribe to maximum of 10 000 000 shares of the Company in the aggregate. The number of Warrants that shall be attached to the Convertible Notes of a Tranche shall be determined as follows: 20% of the nominal value of the Convertible Notes of a Tranche divided by the Exercise Price of Warrants  the resulting number of Warrants being rounded down to the nearest whole number. For the purposes of the aforesaid  the ""Exercise Price of Warrants"" shall be 110% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price in the 15 trading days immediately preceding the request to issue the relevant Tranche.The subscription period of the Company's shares pursuant to the Warrants is five (5) years from the issuance of each Warrant.The exact number of the Company's shares to be issued based on the conversion of the Convertible Notes and the exercise of the Warrants depends  in the manner described above  on the conversion ratio applied to the Convertible Notes and Warrants and is thus not yet known. Depending on the exact number of the Company's shares to be issued based on the conversion of the Convertible Notes and the exercise of the Warrants  it may be necessary for the Board of Directors of the Company to apply for additional authorizations from the general meeting of shareholders in order to implement the entire Arrangement.There is a weighty financial reason for the Company to issue the Convertible Notes and Warrants to Winance as the purpose of the Arrangement is to strengthen the tight working capital situation of the Company. The subscription price of the Convertible Notes and Warrants as well as the shares of the Company to be subscribed based on the Convertible Notes and Warrants is based on the agreement between the Company and Winance.The drawdown of each Tranche requires that certain representations and warranties given by the Company and other customary conditions relating to financing arrangements of this nature are met.Winance has the right to terminate the Arrangement if the Company‚Äôs operations become subject to a material adverse effect  there has been a change of control in the Company or in the event of default which  if curable  is not cured within 30 business days.Valoe will pay Winance on the Arrangement an upfront commitment fee equaling EUR 400 000 in Convertible Notes.The terms and conditions of the Convertible Notes and of the Warrants (without schedules) are included in all material respects in the Appendices 1 and 2 of this release.In Mikkeli on 10 February 2023Valoe OyjBOARD OF DIRECTORSFor more information:CEO Iikka Savisalo  Valoe Corporation tel. +35 40 521 6082email: iikka.savisalo@valoe.comDistribution:Nasdaq Helsinki OyMain mediawww.valoe.comValoe Corporation specializes in the clean energy  especially in photovoltaic solutions.

THE FUNDING WILL BE USED AS WORKING CAPITAL AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE MASS PRODUCTION CONTRACT WITH SONO MOTORS HAS BEEN POSTPONED AND TO PAY DOWN THE COMPANY‚ÄôS DEBT TO RIVERFORT.Background and Purpose of Financial ArrangementValoe Oyj (‚ÄúValoe‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) has signed a convertible note facility agreement with Winance concerning a funding arrangement of up to EUR 5 000 000 in convertible loan notes (the ""Convertible Notes"") that will be accompanied by share subscription warrants (the ""Warrants"") (the agreement  the Convertible Notes and the Warrants hereinafter referred to collectively as the ""Arrangement"").Valoe will use the funding as working capital. The need for additional funding became apparent after the signing of the mass production contract for Sion  Sono Motors' self-charging electric vehicle  and the related estimated cash flows were postponed. In addition  Valoe will pay down its debt to Riverfort Global Opportunities Pcc Limited by approximately one million euro.On 20 December 2022  Valoe disclosed that the signing of the contract Valoe is negotiating with the company‚Äôs significant customer has been postponed until the end of the first quarter of 2023. The delay was expected to have negative impact on Valoe‚Äôs working capital situation. With Winance‚Äôs financing that has now been agreed on  Valoe expects to be able to meet its working capital needs until the substantial customer contracts are signed and the planned cash flow from customer contracts start to materialize.Under the Arrangement  Valoe issues Convertible Notes to Winance. The Convertible Notes may be drawn down so that the first tranche amounts to EUR2 000 000  after which the Convertible Notes may be drawn down in maximum of 6 sequential tranches of EUR 500 000 each (the first tranche and the subsequent Tranches  each ""Tranche"") during a period of 24 months from the drawdown of the first Tranche provided that the preconditions for each Tranche are met. Winance has the right to convert each Tranche into the Company‚Äôs newly issued or treasury shares. In addition  Winance will receive Warrants stripped from the Convertible Notes at the drawdown of each Tranche. The Warrants entitle Winance to subscribe to additional shares of the Company with a subscription price described in the Characteristics of the Warrants.The Company has an obligation to draw down the first Tranche of EUR 2 000 000 and a minimum of two sequential Tranches of the Convertible Notes  i.e. a total minimum of EUR 3 000 000. The remainder of the Convertible Notes  a total of four Tranches of EUR500 000 totaling EUR 2 000 000  may be drawn down by the Company at its discretion.Valoe has  pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Arrangement between Valoe and Winance  withdrawn the first Tranche of EUR 2 000 000  and issued to Winance in total 2 000 convertible notes and in total 13 333 333 warrants related thereto.Commercial Terms of ArrangementPursuant to the Arrangement  Winance may be given in the maximum of 5 000 convertible loan notes against subscription price of EUR 1 000 per each convertible loan note. The Convertible Notes entitle their holder to subscribe to maximum of 50 000 000 shares of the Company in the aggregate.The subscription price of the Notes related to the Tranche Warrants shall be equal to 98% of the par value of the Notes.Notwithstanding the first Tranche  a Tranche may be drawn down by the Company provided that all previously issued Convertible Notes within the Arrangement have been converted into the shares of the Company or that a cool down period agreed between the parties has lapsed  unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. Each Tranche may be drawn in several parts.Winance has agreed to subscribe for the Convertible Notes issued by the Company with a conversion ratio calculated at the time the respective conversion is requested so that the conversion ratio is equal to 90 % of the lowest daily volume weighted average price observed over a period of fifteen (15) consecutive trading days prior to such conversion request.The Convertible Notes bear a zero interest rate. The Convertible Notes have a maturity of 12 months from the issuance of each Tranche. Each Tranche must be converted into the Company's shares upon maturity at the latest.In connection with the drawdown of each Tranche  Winance will receive Warrants free of charge. Winance has the right  but no obligation  to subscribe for the Company‚Äôs shares based on the Warrants. In connection with the Arrangement  Winance may be given maximum of 10 000 000 Warrants in the aggregate which entitle their holder to subscribe to maximum of 10 000 000 shares of the Company in the aggregate. The number of Warrants that shall be attached to the Convertible Notes of a Tranche shall be determined as follows: 20% of the nominal value of the Convertible Notes of a Tranche divided by the Exercise Price of Warrants  the resulting number of Warrants being rounded down to the nearest whole number. For the purposes of the aforesaid  the ""Exercise Price of Warrants"" shall be 110% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price in the 15 trading days immediately preceding the request to issue the relevant Tranche.The subscription period of the Company's shares pursuant to the Warrants is five (5) years from the issuance of each Warrant.The exact number of the Company's shares to be issued based on the conversion of the Convertible Notes and the exercise of the Warrants depends  in the manner described above  on the conversion ratio applied to the Convertible Notes and Warrants and is thus not yet known. Depending on the exact number of the Company's shares to be issued based on the conversion of the Convertible Notes and the exercise of the Warrants  it may be necessary for the Board of Directors of the Company to apply for additional authorizations from the general meeting of shareholders in order to implement the entire Arrangement.There is a weighty financial reason for the Company to issue the Convertible Notes and Warrants to Winance as the purpose of the Arrangement is to strengthen the tight working capital situation of the Company. The subscription price of the Convertible Notes and Warrants as well as the shares of the Company to be subscribed based on the Convertible Notes and Warrants is based on the agreement between the Company and Winance.The drawdown of each Tranche requires that certain representations and warranties given by the Company and other customary conditions relating to financing arrangements of this nature are met.Winance has the right to terminate the Arrangement if the Company‚Äôs operations become subject to a material adverse effect  there has been a change of control in the Company or in the event of default which  if curable  is not cured within 30 business days.Valoe will pay Winance on the Arrangement an upfront commitment fee equaling EUR 400 000 in Convertible Notes.The terms and conditions of the Convertible Notes and of the Warrants (without schedules) are included in all material respects in the Appendices 1 and 2 of this release.In Mikkeli on 10 February 2023Valoe OyjBOARD OF DIRECTORSFor more information:CEO Iikka Savisalo  Valoe Corporation tel. +35 40 521 6082email: iikka.savisalo@valoe.comDistribution:Nasdaq Helsinki OyMain mediawww.valoe.comValoe Corporation specializes in the clean energy  especially in photovoltaic solutions.

The mood at the start of the year was expectant in terms of the ending of the COVID-19 pandemic of the past two years and the lifting of the restrictions  and the year began with strong economic growth. However  Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine in February  created a new kind of uncertainty in the world and the war resulted in human suffering.The war‚Äôs impacts could been seen in our operating environment as economic uncertainty  rising energy prices and interest rates and high inflation. These multiplier effects showed in SATO‚Äôs business operations during the reporting year. We have approximately 25 000 homes in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku. In addition  SATO has 522 apartments in St. Petersburg  which make up approximately one per cent of the value of our investment assets. Since the start of the war in Ukraine  we have been reviewing opportunities to withdraw from the Russian business operations and we are searching actively for a solution.Despite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental apartments in Finland  and the urbanisation trend continues. The rise in mortgage interest rates coupled with the increase in energy and other costs had a partial impact on the growth in rental apartment demand. Now  also some of the people looking for an owner-occupied apartment may consider renting an apartment.The competition between rental housing providers is tough and a large number of new rental apartments has been built especially in the Helsinki metropolitan area in recent years. The historically high rate of housing construction is slowing. There are significantly fewer housing starts than before  but a large number of new apartments will be completed in 2023. This will maintain the tight competition for good tenants and keep rent increases moderate  despite the pressure for rent to increase in the future due to the rising cost level.During the reporting year  our investments in rental apartments were EUR 190.5 million (167.1). In 2022  we completed 191 rental apartments and 52 FlexHomes. On 31 December 2022  a total of 1 418 apartments were under construction. During the second half of the reporting year  we made a decision to refrain from launching any new construction projects. Our decision was based on the dramatic rise in the cost level for construction and property maintenance and the increase in financing costs  while rent development remained moderate due to the market situation.During the first half of the year  we made a decision to launch new non-subsidised rental apartment construction projects in Rykmentinpuisto in Tuusula  Skanssi in Turku and Finnoo in Espoo. The Rykmentinpuisto project is our first new apartment investment in Tuusula in 15 years and the Skanssi project is the first new apartment investment in Turku in five years.In April of the reporting year  we sold 2 009 rental apartments mainly in the Lahti  Jyv√§skyl√§ and Oulu areas to the Swedish investment company Heimstaden. The sale was consistent with our strategy of focusing our apartment investments on the Helsinki metropolitan area and its commuting area along the main railway  and in Tampere and Turku and their surrounding municipalities.We continued to develop the customer experience at SATO during the year. The economic occupancy rate improved compared to the previous year and was 95.2% (94.9). Our tenant turnover for the reporting year fell and our customer satisfaction improved. We clarified and simplified the processes and operating models related to the customer experience and focused especially on building a harmonised and seamless service experience. In addition to developing digital services  we invested in our presence near to the customers.During the reporting year  we continued our sustainability work and released our sustainability programme for 2023‚àí2026  our second ever. The themes of the sustainability programme are sustainable housing  thriving communities and sustainable profitability. Our vision is to be a leader in sustainable rental housing. In our own sustainability goals  we have committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).Last autumn  SATO became the first rental housing provider to join the Ostavastuullisesti.fi service  which provides sustainable service and products and tips for sustainable living. A sustainability panel consisting of outside experts in sustainable production and consumption selected six of SATO‚Äôs buildings: Lupajantie 2 in Mellunkyl√§  Helsinki; Jokiniityntie 28 in Kirkkonummi; Lincolninaukio 4 in Keimola  Vantaa; Kotkatie 6 in Espoo and Jokiniementie 46 and 48 in Ver√§j√§m√§ki  Helsinki to be featured on the website as more sustainable options. We also participated in Rakli‚Äôs Green Homes activities (which started up in 2022)  with altogether 1 100 Green Homes which had either geothermal heat or consumption-based water invoicing or both.During the reporting year  we focused on supporting the well-being of SATO personnel and encouraged SATO employees to learn and grow continually. Our goal is for each person to be able to come up with ideas in their work and develop solutions for future rental housing. We want for everyone at SATO to have the courage to reinvent themselves and the ability to succeed. During the year  the entire organisation adopted the objectives and key results (OKR) model with which we are working towards better setting of objectives  closer monitoring of results and openness. The constantly increasing complexity in the operating environment challenges both experts‚Äô and supervisors‚Äô competence and thinking. In order to provide support to this end  we launched supervisor training in the coaching management style during the reporting year.I wish to thank all SATO employees for their committed and excellent work. I also wish to thank our partners and the residents of our SATOhomes for their good co-operation during the past year.Report of the Board of DirectorsReport of the Board of Directors 1 January‚Äì31 December 2022Operating environmentThe year 2022 began with strong economic growth. Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine in February of the reporting year brought uncertainty to the economic outlook  dramatically raising the price of energy and accelerating inflation. The exceptionally high inflation forced the central banks to react by rapidly hiking interest rates. During the reporting year  the ECB raised its key interest rate four times after the summer and it was 2.50% at the end of 2022. Due to the high inflation  interest rate hikes are expected to continue in early 2023. Inflation is anticipated to stabilise during 2023.Employment development was strong in early 2022  but slowed down towards year-end due to economic challenges. During the reporting year  consumers‚Äô confidence weakened to a historically low level after the start of the year  which showed in private consumption. According to the projection made by the Bank of Finland on 16 December 2022  Finland‚Äôs economic growth in 2022 will be 1.9 % due to the good start to the year. In 2023  the increase in energy prices and the cost of living is predicted to cause the economy to slide into a slight downturn and shrink by 0.5%.Uncertainty and rising interest rates are slowing housing sales. According to the statistics released by the Central Federation of Finnish Real Estate Agencies in December 2022  sales volumes of new and old apartments clearly fell in November compared to the five-year average. According to Statistics Finland‚Äôs preliminary data in December  the prices of old owner-occupied apartments fell in November 2022 in the whole of Finland by 3.4% compared to November of the previous year.The economic situation will decelerate the historically high rate of construction. The number of issued building permits began to fall already in 2021  but plenty of new apartments were and will be completed in 2022 and 2023  which is maintaining tight competition for good tenants and keeping rent increases moderate. The increased cost level resulting from inflation does  however  create pressure to increase rents in the future.The lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and improving employment resulted in a positive turnaround in internal migration to large growth centres in 2022 and demand for rental apartments has begun to grow. This  and SATO‚Äôs investments in making renting more efficient and improving customer service  were visible as an increase in SATO‚Äôs occupancy rate. Also  economic uncertainty  upward pressure on interest rates and increasing consumer prices contributed to the increase in the demand for rental apartments.Despite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental apartments  and the urbanisation trend continues. Dense urban living near services and along good public transport connections is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. The Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy strong growth  while according to Statistics Finland‚Äôs population projection  Finland‚Äôs population will start declining in 2031. The Helsinki metropolitan area is expected to grow by over 200 000 new residents by 2040. Close to 80% of the area‚Äôs residents already live in one- to two-person households  and the number of small households continues to rise. The proportion of immigrants living in the capital area is predicted to grow from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. Aging populations typically move closer to growth centres and the services they offer  and they increasingly expect housing-related services.The change in the population structure and urbanisation create a stable foundation for demand for rental housing especially in the capital area and in Tampere and Turku. Outside of growth centres  the real prices of homes are declining  which makes acquiring an owner-occupied apartment in growth centres even more challenging for people coming from those areas.StrategyCustomer experience  sustainability and sustainable housing  and SATO employees lie at the core of SATO‚Äôs strategy. We want to be closely involved in our customers‚Äô daily lives in order to serve them in the best possible way. We build homes that stand the test of time and we take care of them in line with the life-cycle principles. We enable sustainable housing for our residents and encourage them to make sustainable choices in their daily lives. We want all SATO employees to be able to contribute ideas and participate in developing future housing solutions.SATO is a housing investment company whose basic product is a rental apartment in an apartment building. We focus our investments on growth centres: the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku  because in these areas demand for apartments is the highest and the increase in value is expected to be stable over the longer term. Our operations are geared towards profitable growth.During the reporting year  our strategy implementation focused especially on developing the customer experience  improving customer satisfaction and retention  and ensuring an excellent moving-in experience. We prepared a sustainability programme for 2023‚Äì2026  which is based on feedback from our stakeholders  such as personnel  customers and partners. The themes of the sustainability programme are sustainable housing  thriving communities and sustainable profitability. In our own sustainability goals  we have committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). With regard to our personnel  we focused on supporting work well-being and developing an inspiring employee experience  competence and a coaching management style.SATO has set maintaining its investment grade credit rating as a strategic goal. Our return on equity target is 8%. In addition  our strategic goal is to achieve a continuously improving Net Promoter Score (NPS) from our residents.According to SATO‚Äôs dividend policy  a maximum of 40% of the cash flow from operations will be paid in annual dividends  depending on the market situation  investment level  the development of the equity ratio and the solvency ratio.Net sales and profitIn 2022  consolidated net sales were EUR 291.2 million (298.3).Operating profit was EUR 198.9 million (304.5). The operating profit without the fair value change of investment properties was EUR 213.8 million (175.4).

The average maturity of loans was 3.3 years (4.0).The calculated impact of changes in the market value of interest hedging on equity was EUR 48.1 million (15.1). During the reporting year  SATO increased the proportion of unsecured loans to 88.1% of all loans. At the end of the year  the proportion of unencumbered assets was 89.2% of the balance sheet.Group structureSATO Corporation is the parent company of SATO Group. At the end of the reporting year  the parent company had a total of 21 subsidiaries engaged in business operations (23). Mergers took place during the year in order to clarify the Group structure.SATO Corporation‚Äôs majority shareholder is Balder Finska Otas AB  whose parent company is Fastighets AB Balder  which is quoted on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.Housing businessOur housing business includes rental activities  customer service  lifecycle management and maintenance. Effective rental activities and digital services provide home-seekers with quick access to a home  and the Group with a steadily increasing cash flow. High-quality maintenance operations ensure the comfort of residents and that the apartments stay in good condition and maintain their value. We serve our customers in daily housing issues through our customer-oriented service organisation.The competition between rental housing providers has become tighter  as a large volume of new rental apartments have been built in growth centres  especially in the Helsinki metropolitan area  in recent years. Tenants now have a wide array of choices and a successful customer experience is more important than ever. We try to respond to this challenge by adjusting the organisation and our service processes. We want to be closely involved in our customers‚Äô daily lives in order to serve them in the best possible way.During the reporting year we expanded the house expert model further in the Helsinki metropolitan area. At the end of the year  SATO employed 62 house experts and the model is now in use to its full extent in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku. The house experts take care of the technical building work on homes and buildings. The purpose of our house expert operating model is to create a better customer experience and more efficient maintenance.SATO had approximately 45 000 customers at the end of the reporting year. We measure our successes in customer encounters using the Net Promoter Score (NPS). Our customer satisfaction improved during the reporting year. We clarified and simplified the processes and operating models related to the customer experience and focused especially on building a harmonised and seamless service experience. We invested in developing digital services  as well as our presence near to the customers. We also established closer collaboration between SATO employees working at our residents‚Äô buildings and improved internal communications.The economic occupancy rate improved compared to the previous year and was 95.2% (94.9) on average in Finland. The external tenant turnover rate for rental apartments was 28.4% (31.2). Rental income decreased 2.4% and was EUR 291.2 million (298.3).The average monthly rent of SATO‚Äôs rental apartments in Finland at the end of the reporting year was EUR 17.84 per m2 (17.46).Net rental income for apartments was EUR 200.4 million (210.6).Investment propertiesOn 31 December 2022  SATO owned a total of 24 999 apartments (26 791). Altogether 191 rental apartments were completed and 1 was acquired. The total number of divested rental apartments was 2 021  of which 2 009 rental apartments were sold to the Swedish investment company Heimstaden.Fair valueThe development of the value of rental apartments is a key factor for SATO. The housing stock is focussed on areas and apartment sizes that are expected to grow in demand in the long term. The allocation of building repairs is based on life-cycle plans and repair need specifications.The fair value of investment properties at the end of December totalled EUR 5 044.2 million (5 032.8). The change in the value of investment properties  including investments and divestments in the financial year  was EUR 11.4 million (279.3).The external expert JLL Finland Oy (JLL) issues a biannual statement on the valuation methods applied by SATO  the appropriateness of sources of information used and the quality and credibility of the valuation for Finnish investment properties. JLL‚Äôs latest statement was issued on the valuation carried out on 31 December 2022. The criteria for the determination of the fair value are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.The change in value was influenced by the increase in yield requirements and the decrease in the fair value of St. Petersburg housing assets.At the end of the year  the Helsinki metropolitan area‚Äôs commuting area accounted for 87.3%  Tampere for 6.4% and Turku for 5.1%  and St. Petersburg for roughly 1.2% of the value of apartments.Investments  divestments and property developmentInvestment activities are used to manage the housing portfolio and prepare the ground for growth. SATO‚Äôs investments in the 2000s in non-subsidised rental apartments total more than EUR 3 billion. SATO acquires and builds entire rental buildings and single rental apartments. Property development allows for new investments in rental apartments in Finland. The rental potential and value of rental apartments owned by SATO are developed through renovation activities.Investments in rental apartments were EUR 190.5 million (167.1). Investments in the Helsinki metropolitan area represented 84.0% of all investments in the reporting year. Investments in new apartments represented 57.1% of the investments. In addition  on 31 December 2022  binding purchase agreements in Finland totalled EUR 114.3 million (96.8).During the reporting year  2 021 rental apartments (26) were divested in Finland. Their total value was EUR 210.6 million (7.9). In April of the reporting year  we sold 2 009 rental apartments mainly in the Lahti  Jyv√§skyl√§ and Oulu areas to the Swedish investment company Heimstaden. The sale was consistent with our strategy based on which SATO is focusing its apartment investments on the Helsinki metropolitan area and its commuting area along the main railway  and in Tampere and Turku and their surrounding municipalities.The book value of plot reserves totalled EUR 40.8 million (43.4) at the end of December. The value of new plots acquired by the end of December totalled EUR 18.4 million (15.5).The permitted building volume for about 1 450 apartments is being developed for the plots in the company‚Äôs housing portfolio. This allows SATO to utilise existing infrastructure  create a denser urban structure and thus bring more customers closer to services and public transport connections.We collaborate with cities when areas are being developed and new housing is planned for them. As a long-term owner  housing investor and housing provider  SATO wants to build nice homes  residential areas and pleasant urban areas for decades to come. During the reporting year  we continued the development of the Hakunila area in Vantaa and Finnoo in Espoo  for example. In Helsinki  we were involved in planning the Mellunpuisto project in Mellunkyl√§ and we continued our collaboration with VR to develop the area it owns in Ilmala. During the reporting year  plots in complementary planning areas developed by SATO were sold to construction companies and other partners  enabling the construction of approximately 175‚àí200 owner-occupied apartments and roughly 25 state-subsidised rental apartments  thus promoting a diverse residential area and urban structure.In May 2022  construction of non-subsidised rental apartments began in Rykmentinpuisto in Tuusula. The area is a collaboration by several parties and the area will include different types of housing. SATO is building 92 non-subsidised rental apartments in the area. The Rykmentinpuisto Pataljoonantie project is SATO‚Äôs first new apartment investment in Tuusula in more than 15 years.In August 2022  SATO signed a deed to buy from Lujatalo an apartment building which is being built in Skanssi  Turku. The eight-storey building under construction at the address Sorakatu 9 will have 77 new rental apartments. This is SATO‚Äôs first new apartment investment in Turku in five years. Construction was begun in August 2022 and the apartments will be ready for residents at the end of 2023.We are building 257 new rental apartments at Peijinkuja in Finnoo  Espoo. Construction began in August 2022 and the apartments will be completed in stages during autumn 2024. The project is based on long-term development work in which we drew up a new local plan with the City of Espoo for a property that SATO owns in the old low-rise area of Hannus  which formerly featured terraced houses. The area is being transformed into a new area called Finnoo. SATO‚Äôs goal is to continue developing the Finnoo area in the future.During the reporting year  new rental apartments were finished on Lupajantie in Mellunm√§ki  Helsinki and on Jokiniityntie in Kirkkonummi.Due to rising construction  maintenance and financing costs and the moderate rent development resulting from the competitive situation  we made a decision to refrain from launching new construction projects and we are postponing their launch.In 2022  we completed 191 rental apartments (235) and 0 owner-occupied apartments (71) and 52 FlexHomes (0) in Finland. On 31 December 2022  a total of 1 418 apartments (1 152) were under construction: 1 418 rental apartments (1 100) and 0 owner-occupied apartments (0) and 0 FlexHomes (52). FlexHome is a short-term ownership concept that enables home ownership with a small initial capital outlay and which the resident can purchase entirely for themselves within five years of completion.A total of EUR 92.4 million (93.6) was spent on repairing and upgrading apartments.At the end of December  SATO owned 522 apartments (525) in St. Petersburg. The economic occupancy rate of rental apartments in St. Petersburg was 92.4% (97.7) on average. Since the start of the war in Ukraine  we have been reviewing opportunities to withdraw from the Russian business operations. Based on our studies  a fast withdrawal is not possible. For this reason  SATO will continue to rent residential apartments in St. Petersburg until a way to withdraw has been found. The company is actively seeking a solution.SustainabilityOur sustainability work during the reporting year was guided by SATO‚Äôs strategy and our sustainability programme for 2019‚Äì2022  which emphasised carbon-neutral cities and the well-being of residents and neighbourhoods.Due to the energy crisis resulting from the war in Ukraine  we increased the efficiency of our energy saving measures and paid more attention to the temperatures of apartments than earlier. We monitor and regulate the heating of some 21 000 SATOhomes using AI. Our goal is to maintain a temperature of approximately 21 degrees in SATOhomes  which is a healthy and energy-efficient indoor temperature. In addition to our own energy saving measures  we actively provided our residents with guidance on energy saving opportunities in their day-to-day lives. At the end of the year  we provided our residents with instructions on how to prepare for possible blackouts in the exceptional energy situation.During the reporting year  we launched a development project related to waste and sorting  in which we surveyed our homes‚Äô waste-collection points and inspected their lighting  the number of waste bins and signage. Based on the survey  we targeted repairs at the sites that needed them and they will continue in upcoming years. Our housing advisors‚Äô tours focused on waste guidance during the year. We pilot tested a clothing collection point on Kauppakartanonkatu in Helsinki‚Äôs It√§keskus.Some of our sustainable development measures are described below under ‚ÄòImpacts on the environment and society‚Äô.In the autumn of 2022  an external sustainability panel chose six of SATO‚Äôs rental apartment buildings to be among the Ostavastuullisesti.fi website‚Äôs more sustainable choices. SATO was the first rental housing provider to be included in the Ostavastuullisesti.fi service. Our following buildings were assessed to be a more sustainable choice: Lupajantie 2 in Mellunkyl√§  Helsinki; Jokiniityntie 28 in Kirkkonummi; Lincolninaukio 4 in Keimola  Vantaa; Kotkatie 6 in Espoo and Jokiniementie 46 and 48 in Ver√§j√§m√§ki  Helsinki.In 2022  we took part in Rakli‚Äôs newly launched Green Homes activities. At the end of 2022  we had altogether 1 100 Green Homes which had either geothermal heat or consumption-based water invoicing or both.We participated for the eighth time in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) assessment. SATO received two stars on a scale of one to five. SATO‚Äôs score in the Standing Investments Benchmark (existing properties) fell by one point from last year (score now at 73)  while in the Development Benchmark (construction projects) SATO‚Äôs score rose to 75 points from 71 points last year. We report on our sustainability annually in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative‚Äôs (GRI) reporting guidelines  and the environmental sustainability figures presented in the report have been verified by an independent third party  i.e. KPMG Oy Ab.During the reporting year  we collaborated on a project with the non-profit organisations No Fixed Abode and the Rehabilitation Foundation to help participants in the project find two of life‚Äôs essentials ‚Äì a home and a job. By the end of 2022  10 people who had participated in the project were living in a SATOhome.During 2022  we updated the materiality analysis and released a new sustainability programme for 2023‚Äì2026. Our vision is to be a leader in sustainable rental housing during the programme period.In 2020 we committed to reporting in compliance with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and in 2021  we conducted an extensive assessment of the risks and opportunities arising from climate change for SATO‚Äôs entire supply chain. In the framework  the risks are divided into four main categories: transition risks  acute and chronic physical risks and social risks. At the same time  we carried out a scenario analysis to look into how the two- and four-degree scenarios affect society and how SATO should prepare for these changes. During the reporting year  risks caused by climate change were part of SATO‚Äôs general risk assessment that is conducted internally each year. In 2022  two reports were made to SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors on climate risks and opportunities and their impact.The Corporate Governance Statement is published separately from the Report of the Board of Directors. SATO‚Äôs Corporate Governance Statement  Code of Conduct and sustainability programme are available at sato.fi.Impacts on the environment and societyOur objective is to systematically reduce the negative impacts of our operations on the environment. We reduce the load on the environment by regularly and proactively taking care of and repairing homes and properties according to the life-cycle principle  and by building properties primarily in existing urban environments and near good public transport connections.The planning of SATO‚Äôs new rental apartments always takes into account energy efficiency and solutions that will last for decades. In new properties  SATO‚Äôs goal is energy class A (energy performance indicator 75 or below)  which is significantly better than that required by the building code (energy performance indicator 90). All of the buildings that were completed during the reporting year were energy class A. The average EPI for buildings begun during 2022 was 72 and all of the housing starts are energy class A.We are committed to the Energy Efficiency Agreement targets for the property sector  aiming for a reduction in the total consumption of electricity and heat of 10.5% from the 2015 baseline by 2025.The use of renewable energy in heating significantly reduces the in-use emissions of homes. At every new building and renovation site  we look into the possibility of geothermal heat. We currently have 17 properties that are carbon neutral in terms of electricity and heating. During the reporting year  geothermal heat was being built on 12 properties. In addition  six properties had a solar power plant and solar power plants were being built on nine properties. In 2022  building electricity consisted entirely of emission-free electricity.During 2022  SATO converted the heating system to geothermal heat at the last properties which still had fossil-fuel-based heating  thus taking us a significant step closer to our goal of achieving in-use carbon neutrality.Vantaa Energy and SATO signed an energy partnership agreement in February 2022. Together with Vantaa Energy  we are developing carbon-neutral energy solutions for buildings‚Äô heating and cooling  which will help us achieve our carbon neutrality target by 2030 for in-use energy consumption.During the reporting year  we continued to invest in energy efficiency improvements in SATOhomes in connection with renovations. In renovations  our goal is to improve energy efficiency by some 30% compared to earlier. Due to the rise in heating and electricity prices  energy costs rose overall.During the reporting year  specific energy consumption fell 4.1%  specific electricity consumption rose 7.1% and specific water consumption fell 2.0% compared to 2021. Specific emissions from SATO‚Äôs apartments fell by 9.3% compared to 2021 and were 28.2 (31.1) carbon dioxide equivalent kilograms per square metre. Emissions are calculated according to the absolute consumption of district heat. Electricity was generated from emission-free nuclear power.According to the Ministry of the Environment  the built environment causes approximately one third of Finland‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions. The construction industry  together with the real estate sector and their related services  employ more than half a million people and bring in tax revenues for society. The construction industry does  however  have negative impacts not only on the environment  but also society and people. Some well-known examples of the construction industry‚Äôs negative impacts are the grey economy  occupational safety and human rights-related violations  as well as irregularities in procurement and delivery chains. We regularly assess and predict the social  economic and environmental risks related to our operations. We try to systematically reduce the identified negative impacts  for example by following our Code of Conduct  by combating the grey economy  by conducting audits and internal control  and by continuously developing our operations. During 2022  we decided to survey the current state of our compliance function in order to gain an overall picture of our policies and commitments.SATO has a whistleblowing channel through which SATO employees and external stakeholders can anonymously report critical concerns.The Group‚Äôs sustainability programme is available in its entirety at sato.fi.Development activitiesSATO‚Äôs development activities during the reporting year focused on developing sales and customer experience processes and operating models  the renewal of the invoicing processes and improving the continuous development operating model. We invested in developing digital services  as well as our presence near to the customers  and in building a uniform and seamless service experience. Our goal is to serve our customers in the best way possible  regardless of time or place.Based on customer feedback  we also developed  during the reporting year  our processes involving the rental of a new home. The changes made daily work more efficient for our rental team  which also means even better service for our customers. We revamped the reservation of apartment viewings to make them more flexible for the customer and to pilot test the online reservation of viewings no matter the time or place. The apartment viewings were mostly held by our own viewing agents. We updated the apartment application process on the sato.fi website and in 2022 made it possible for our customers to apply for homes using the ‚Äòmore sustainable option‚Äô search criterion.In our development operations last year  we also focused on renewing the invoicing processes and we piloted a new invoicing system in summer 2022. The new system offers better opportunities to view up-to-date invoicing information and the plan is to roll it out in full in spring 2023.In developing the business  we adopted a continuous development model at SATO during the reporting year. We defined the roles related to the model and will develop the activities as smaller components rather than large units  which will speed up development work and allow processes to be improved more effectively.A total of EUR 3.2 million (3.2) was spent on development  corresponding to approximately 1.1% of net sales.Risk managementRisk management is used to ensure that risks impacting the company‚Äôs business are identified  managed and monitored. The main risks of SATO‚Äôs business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.SATO‚Äôs most significant risks are related to prolonged inflation and the resulting rise in interest rates. As a result of the war in Ukraine  the prices of energy  food  materials and commodities have increased dramatically and interest rates have risen. Higher cost of living can have a negative impact on consumers‚Äô purchasing power and ability to meet their obligations. If the strong growth in the cost of financing and maintenance costs continues and the market situation does not provide an opportunity to transfer the higher costs into rents in full  this can have a negative impact on the fair value of investment assets and the company‚Äôs ability to finance investments  which means that new investments and renovations will have to be postponed.The most significant risks in the renting of apartments are related to economic cycles and fluctuations in demand and supply. Market risk can increase the supply of rental housing to a point that it exceeds demand. This leads to rental housing vacancies and pressure to even out or lower the rent level especially for the old housing portfolio.A clear weakening in the housing market could have a negative impact on the market value of SATO‚Äôs housing portfolio. In accordance with its strategy  SATO focuses its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing its existing housing portfolio  thus ensuring the rental potential of its apartments and the development of their value.Changes in official regulations and legislation  as well as the uncertainty stemming from them  may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and thus on SATO‚Äôs business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and also calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group‚Äôs treasury policy  which has been approved by SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors. Our financial risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other long-term financing commitments. The company established a EUR 1.5 billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) bond programme in 2019.The means for managing the liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  committed credit facilities of EUR 700 million and a commercial paper programme of EUR 400 million. We increase the amount of reserves as the financing requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating rate loans form an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed and floating rate loans either by issuing fixed rate loans or by interest rate hedges. According to our treasury policy  our objective is to keep the ratio of fixed rate loans at over 60 % of debt portfolio after interest hedging.There are risks related to the business environment in our St. Petersburg operations  including currency risk. The consolidation of foreign currency-denominated assets in the consolidated financial statements also involves a translation risk. Possibilities of hedging the translation risk are evaluated in accordance with our financial policy. SATO has abstained from making new investments in Russia for a long time. Since the start of the war in Ukraine  the company has been reviewing opportunities to withdraw from the Russian business operations. Based on our studies  a fast withdrawal is not possible  which is why SATO will continue to rent residential apartments in St. Petersburg until a way to withdraw has been found. The company is actively seeking a solution. The Russian operating environment is expected to be extremely uncertain and it may cause disturbances in SATO‚Äôs business operations in Russia and with parties related to the Russian business. This can affect SATO‚Äôs ability to make payments to suppliers  its employees and authorities  and to receive payments from customers  which can have a significant adverse impact on SATO‚Äôs business operations in Russia. If the Ukraine war is prolonged  doing business in Russia may have a negative impact on the company‚Äôs reputation and it may make doing business difficult in Finland and weaken the company‚Äôs ability to procure financing on the market. It may also have an adverse impact on the financial result or operations of SATO‚Äôs properties  not to mention on financing costs or values.A more detailed description of risks and risk management is available on the Group‚Äôs website www.sato.fi.Pending legal actionsSATO has no official procedures  legal actions or arbitration proceedings pending that would have a significant impact on the company‚Äôs financial standing or profitability  and SATO is not aware of any threat of such proceedings.SharesOn 31 December 2022  the share capital of SATO Corporation was EUR 4 442 192.00 and there were 56 783 067 shares.

The average number of personnel was 328 (276) during the reporting year. The Group‚Äôs salaries and remunerations in 2022 totalled EUR 21.6 million (18.8).Shareholders‚Äô Nomination CommitteeThe Shareholders‚Äô Nomination Committee consists of representatives of SATO‚Äôs four largest shareholders registered in the book-entry system on 1 October. If a shareholder chooses not to exercise their nomination right  the right will pass on to the next largest shareholder. The State Pension Fund  the company‚Äôs fourth largest shareholder on 1 October 2022  did not exercise its nomination right  and the right was passed to Erkka Valkila  the fifth largest shareholder. The Committee consisted of representatives of the following shareholders: Balder Finska Otas AB (Erik Selin)  Stichting Depositary APG Strategic Real Estate Pool (Hans Spikker)  Elo Mutual Pension Insurance Company (Hanna Hiidenpalo) and Erkka Valkila.Board of Directors  CEO and auditorsThe Annual General Meeting held on 24 March 2022 confirmed that the Board of Directors consists of six members.In 2022  the members of SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors were chairman Erik Selin and ordinary members Esa Lager  Tarja P√§√§kk√∂nen  Sharam Rahi  Johannus (Hans) Spikker and Timo Stenius.The Board of Directors convened 11 times in 2022. The Board‚Äôs work is supported by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.In 2022  Antti Aarnio  M.Sc. (Tech.)  was SATO‚Äôs CEO.As the company‚Äôs auditor  the Annual General Meeting selected the audit firm Deloitte Oy  which appointed APA Aleksi Martamo as the auditor in charge. The auditor‚Äôs term in office is the financial year  and the auditor‚Äôs duties end at the closing of the next Annual General Meeting.Members of the Management GroupDuring the reporting period 2022  the Corporate Management Group consisted of Antti Aarnio  CEO  Arto Aalto  EVP  Investments  Markku Honkasalo  CFO  Janne Ojalehto  CCO (until 27 January 2023) and Elina Vaurasalo  EVP  Housing Business.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO‚Äôs business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence  the development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  the general competitive situation and interest rates.Employment development was strong in early 2022  but slowed down towards year-end due to economic challenges. During the reporting year  consumers‚Äô confidence weakened to a historically low level after the start of the year  which showed in private consumption. According to the projection made by the Bank of Finland on 16 December 2022  Finland‚Äôs economic growth in 2022 will be 1.9% due to the good start to the year. In 2023  the increase in energy prices and the cost of living is predicted to cause the economy to slide into a slight downturn and shrink by 0.5%.Uncertainty and rising interest rates are slowing housing sales. According to the statistics released by the Central Federation of Finnish Real Estate Agencies in December 2022  sales volumes of new and old apartments clearly fell in November compared to the five-year average. According to Statistics Finland‚Äôs preliminary data in December  the prices of old owner-occupied apartments fell in November 2022 in the whole of Finland by 3.4% compared to November of the previous year.The economic situation will decelerate the historically high rate of construction. The number of issued building permits began to fall already in 2021  but plenty of new apartments were and will be completed in 2022 and 2023  which is maintaining tight competition for good tenants and keeping rent increases moderate. The increased cost level resulting from inflation does  however  create pressure to increase rents in the future.The lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and improving employment resulted in a positive turnaround in internal migration to large growth centres in 2022 and demand for rental apartments has begun to grow. This  and SATO‚Äôs investments in making renting more efficient and improving customer service  were visible as an increase in SATO‚Äôs occupancy rate. Also  economic uncertainty  upward pressure on interest rates and increasing consumer prices contributed to the increase in the demand for rental apartments.As tenants have a wider array of choices  a successful customer experience is more important than ever. SATO is investing strongly in increasing its customer presence and developing digital services.In line with its majority shareholder‚Äôs operating model  SATO Corporation will not publish guidance on its 2023 earnings. The parent company of Balder Finska Otas AB is Fastighets AB Balder  which is quoted on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.Proposal of the Board of Directors for the distribution of profitOn 31 December 2022  the parent company‚Äôs distributable equity was EUR 512 557 145.56  of which profit for the period was EUR 129 644 613.16.

My name is Caroline  and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. [Operator Instructions] However  you will have the opportunity to ask questions at the end of the call. [Operator Instructions]I will now hand over to your host  Stephane Boujnah  Euronext's CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board joined by Giorgio Modica  Euronext's CFO to begin today's conference. Thank you.Giorgio ModicaGood morning  everybody and thank you for joining us this morning for the Euronext fourth quarter and full-year 2022 results conference call and webcast. I am Stephane Boujnah  CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext. And I will start with the highlights of the full year and the fourth quarter. Giorgio Modica  the Euronext CFO will then further develop the main business and the financial highlights of the fourth quarter.As an introduction  I would like to highlight three points. First  Euronext is stronger than ever. Euronext is now present in the full value chain and Euronext confirmed its leadership position in listing and in trading in Europe. In addition our revenue demonstrated strong resilience  thanks to our diversified business model.Second  we beat our 2022 cost guidance  thanks to cost discipline in an inflationary environment. Third  we are well-advanced in the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group and by the end of 2023  we will reach EUR70 million of cumulative run rate synergies. We are now in a position to upgrade our 2024 synergy target by EUR15 million to EUR115 million of annual run rate synergies.Let me give you some more detail on each of those points. First  as I said Euronext is today the leading listing venue in Europe for equity  and for that globally. And we are also the largest venue for equity trading in Europe representing 2 times the volume traded on the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Borse. We are now a top-ranking Post Trade infrastructure operator through Euronext Clearing and Euronext Securities. This is all the result of our diversification strategy. And this major transformation is reflected in our 2022 performance where 58% of our underlying revenue is now non-volume related.2022 was also a strong year in terms of financial performance. In 2022 Euronext reached record underlying revenues  an income above EUR1.4 billion. This is up plus 13%  compared to 2021. We generated plus EUR120.2 million additional revenue in 2022  compared to ‚Äò21  which was a very strong reference shows as you may remember. This strong 2022 performance was driven by the strong performance of non-volume related businesses and enhanced revenue capture.And in trading  we recorded a very strong year for power and for ForEx trading. The softer volume environment for cash equity trading in the second half of 2022 was clearly offset by significant and efficient management of yield and a real uptick in market share from October 2022. Our Post Trade franchise significantly benefited from the consolidation of Euronext Clearing and Euronext Securities Milan  which were acquired as part of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition in April ‚Äò21. The diversified business of the Euronext Securities allowed us to capture value as settlement activity stabilized in H2 2022.I would -- like especially to highlight the performance of our listing business  which grew by plus 15.1% and reported solid listing activities with 83 new listings in 2022. In particular  we welcomed 20 international companies  which in my view is the recognition that Euronext  Euronext market in Europe are now the venue of choice for listing in Europe. Furthermore our Advanced Data Services business increased by plus 15.5%  reflecting growth across the real-time and non-real-time data business  as well as index growth.Lastly  following the successful migration of our Core Data Centre to Bergamo in June 2022  we significantly scaled up our Technology Solutions business reaching over EUR100 million in revenue now. That's why  as mentioned earlier  the share of non-volume related revenue represented 58% of our top line in 2022 and accounted for 141% of operating costs excluding D&A.And that brings me to our ongoing focus on cost discipline on slide five with a bigger picture on financials. Thanks to strong cost discipline and several positive one-off impacts of the year  we overachieved or revised cost guidance of EUR612 million  down from an initial cost guidance  as you may remember it  up EUR622 million  because we reported EUR606.1 million of underlying expenses excluding D&A. And this was achieved despite inflationary pressures  despite pressure on supply chains that everyone experiences.Consequently  our 2022 adjusted EBITDA grew double-digit to EUR861.6 million. This translated into an adjusted EBITDA margin at 58.7%. Overall  this performance resulted in a plus 5.7% increase of adjusted net income to EUR555.3 million. Adjusted EPS was down minus 4.8% to EUR5.21 per share. And this reflects the higher number of outstanding shares of our 2022  compared to 2021.On a reported basis  net income is up plus 6% to EUR437.8 million. Consequently a dividend of EUR2.22 per share will be proposed at our upcoming Annual General Meeting in May. These dividend represent a payout ratio of 50% of reported net income adjusted for the EUR49 million pretax or EUR35 million post tax one-off loss related to the partial disposal of the Euronext Clearing portfolio announced in Q2 2022. And this dividend is EUR0.29 more than the ‚Äò21 dividend per share. It is an increase of plus 13%.Moving now to the Q4 performance on slide six. Euronext reported a solid fourth quarter for 2022. The quarter was marked by strong performance of Advanced Data Services  strong performance of listing activities offset by lower revenues from business correlated with cash equity volumes. Underlying revenues were down minus 6.2%  compared to Q4 2021 at EUR347 million  reflecting the resilience of our diversified revenue streams in a low volatility environment.Despite softer cash equity derivatives and MTS cash trading activity  the strength of our non-volume related businesses enabled us to report only a slight decline in total revenue. First non-volume-related revenue posted a strong performance overall. Notably  as I said earlier in listing and advanced data services in technology. Second  our trading businesses that are not related to equity markets strongly performed. We notably recorded strong growth year-on-year in power trading and a solid quarter in ForEx trading.Last  we efficiently manage our revenue capture and regained market share from October 2022 in cash trading operations. This translated into non-volume related revenue accounting for 60% of the total Q4 revenue  and covering 130% of underlying operating expenses excluding D&A.So Q4 2022 underlying operational expenses excluding D&A increased slightly to EUR159.2 million up plus 1.6%  compared to Q4 2021. And this reflect for cost disciplined approach to cost control and higher capitalized project costs offsetting inflationary pressures. Overall we reported an EBITDA  an adjusted EBITDA of EUR187.9 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.1%. This led to an adjusted EPS at EUR1.11 per share and an adjusted net income of EUR118.2 million. On a reported basis the EPS for this fourth quarter reached EUR0.93.Clearly ‚Äò22 was a year of transformation for Euronext and we made good progress in our integration process and synergy delivery. The migration of our Core Data Centre from Basildon in the U.K. to Bergamo in Italy was the first key milestone of our growth or Impact strategic plan. This migration combined with continued cost discipline enabled us to deliver EUR34.1 million cumulated run rate annual synergies at the end of 2022 in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.Looking forward  we expect to achieve around EUR70 million of our targeted synergies by the end of ‚Äò23 alone with the delivery of several key projects. First  next month we will significantly change the dimension of our unique European liquidity pool  because the migration of Italian cash market to Euronext state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq will benefit local and global trading members and will allow an alignment of fees.Second  the other Italian markets will migrate to the Optiq European liquidity pool starting in Q4 2023. And looking further cost synergies with the termination of the Millennium LSEG technology contract. Third  Euronext Clearing would become the CCP of choice for equity clearing by the end of this year  generating revenue synergies. And the following year by Q3 2024 Euronext Clearing will also clear Euronext listed derivatives.Those good progress on integration mean that we are able to upgrade our synergy target. We expect total run rate synergies in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group to reach EUR115 million by the end of ‚Äô24. This is EUR15 million more than the amount targeted until now. And this is almost 2 times the initial amount announced at the moment of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition.You may remember that in April ‚Äò21 we committed to deliver EUR60 million of synergies in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. Today we are confident that we will deliver almost a double EUR115 million of synergies in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. So that demonstrates once again the strong track record of the Euronext teams in delivering operating performance and operating leverage.On the next slide  I'd like to take a moment to tell you in more detail about one of our key strategic objectives related to clearing. It's a key strategic project. Last month we confirmed the planned European expansion of Euronext Clearing to all Euronext listed derivatives for Q3 2024. As a result Euronext served LCH SA  a notice of termination for the existing derivative clearing agreement on 16 January 2023.As we already announced  the related termination fee of approximately EUR36 million to be paid to LCH SA is part of the EUR150 million envelope of implementation cost related to the growth for Impact 2024 strategic plan. Therefore  this amount will be provisioned in our income statement as a non-underlying expense in Q1 2023 and will be payable in 2024. When we embarked on our ambitions Post Trade Strategy our aim was clear. To offer our clients the benefit of scale and harmonization‚Äôs across European markets  while still maintaining a robust local footprint in Euronext market.For all clients this will bring margin efficiencies with the implementation of a new value-add risk model and a single default fund. It will also bring efficiencies across all asset classes with transparency on data  particularly on settlement leveraging Euronext Securities target to securities settlement platform. So the expansion of Euronext Clearing is really critical as it will allow us to manage the entire trading value chain of our markets by the end of ‚Äô24  and it will generate significant revenue and cost synergies.Moving to slide nine  we continued to deploy capital efficiently in 2022 through a number of initiatives allowing us to better control our technology and develop new services. First  in March Euronext Securities acquired the General Meetings  Designated Representative and Shareholder's Registers activities of Spafid. This strategic partnership has contributed to the high growth  but had its services offered through Euronex Securities franchise.Secondly  we have internalized the technology powering MTS and Euronext Securities in Milan as part of our plan to integrate our full value chain and our technology. In addition  following the completion of the strategic review undertaken as part of the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group and our decision to divert from non-core asset  Euronext has disposed the U.S. subsidiary of MTS  MTS Markets International Inc.Importantly during this time  we have pursued very actively our deleveraging path  reaching 2.6 times net debt to EBITDA at the end of December 2022. And this compares to 3.2 times net debt to EBITDA at the closing of the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. Together with our strong cash generation capability  this brings us to around EUR1.5 billion of available capital at the end of December 2022. And our progress has been recognized by S&P that upgraded their outlook to positive in 2022. And as you have seen it yesterday evening  we have been upgraded to BBB plus.So we are very well advanced on our integration. We are confident in our ability to deliver upgraded synergies  because  once again this demonstrates the post-merger integration track record of Euronext teams. And this confidence combined with our favorable liquidity position enables us to continue exploring external growth. We would be looking for assets able to contribute to higher organic revenue growth to provide scalability and to improve exposure to non-volume related businesses. Obviously always in line with our rigorous capital allocation policy.Finally  I'd like to take a moment to highlight the great progress we have made with our Fit for 1.5 degree ESG commitment. We [Technical Difficulty] achievements of this SBTi target have already been implemented such as the migration of the Euronext Core Data Centre in Bergamo  which is powered 100% by renewable energy sources. We are also pleased to announce that Euronext has been included in the Euronext Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Euronext Equileap Gender Equality France 40  two indices showcasing European companies that demonstrate a strong role in improving gender equality. And we have continued to push for a broader transition in our markets. We have launched the CAC SBTi index  an index for grouping companies within the SBF 120 that have set emission reduction target approved as being in line with the Paris Agreement 1.5 degree before.So I now hand over to Giorgio Modica for the review of our fourth quarter performance.Giorgio ModicaThank you very much Stephane and good morning  everyone. Let's have now a look at the performance of Euronext in the fourth quarter of 2022. I'm now on slide 12. In the fourth quarter of 2022 Euronext demonstrated solid results reflecting the strong performance of advanced data services and listing combined with an efficient management of market share and revenue capture in a challenging trading environment for especially cash trading volumes.As a result  and as already mentioned by Stephane  Euronext underlying revenue income was only down 6.2%  compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 despite the relevant reduction of volumes  notably reflecting the strength of our diversified business mix. Briefly  listing revenue grew 3.1% resulting from a resilient equity and debt listing activity despite the tougher environment. We capture the majority of listing in Europe  remarkable this quarter were the high shares of company from outside of the Euronext market among our listing  accounting for around 40% of equity listing and demonstrating the international appeal of Euronext.Trading revenue was down 12.1% resulting from lower cash equity and MTS cash volume  partially offset by a record quarter for power trading and a good performance of FX trading. Post Trade revenue including -- excluding NTI was down 2.5% as a result of weaker equity clearing activity and a stabilized settlement activity.Advanced data Service revenue increased 7.3%. This was good performance across the offering both on real-time and non-real-time data  as well as on indices. Technology Solutions grew 1.8% driven by the good performance of colocation activity after the migration to the Bergamo Data Centre in June this year.In the fourth quarter of 2022 non-volume related revenue accounted  as Stephane said  for 60% of total Group revenue versus 58% the same quarter last year  reflecting high Advanced Data Services and Corporate Service revenue and revenues from services in general. Lastly  those non-volume related revenues cover 130% of our underlying operating expenses excluding D&A compared to 136% last year.Now I would like to move to the next slide  slide 13  for listing. Listing revenue was EUR53.5 million this quarter with an increase of 3.1% compared to the same quarter last year. This growth is driven by a higher annual fees  the strong performance of corporate service and the positive impact of primary and secondary listing revenue recognition over time. We have discussed already the impact on IFRS on listing revenues.In detail during the fourth quarter of 2022 Euronext maintained its leading position in Europe for primary equity listing counting 24 new listing of which  as I said  approximately 40% were international companies. In the fourth quarter of 2022 EUR310 million were raised on Euronext primary markets compared to a very strong Q4 2021 with EUR6.6 billion raised on our markets.As far as secondary issue are concerned EUR10.1 billion was raised in the fourth quarter of 2022  well above the same quarter last year. Euronext also reinforced its position as the leading venue for bond listing worldwide this quarter with over 53 000 bond listed across all Euronext market at the end of the year. And this despite a slowdown of the global bond listing activity due to the macroeconomic environment. This translated into EUR226.9 billion in debt raised on Euronext market during this quarter.Overall  this brings us to a total of EUR237.3 billion raised in equity and debt of Euronext market this quarter. Lastly  Corporate Service continued its growth trajectory across businesses despite slightly lower webcast activity in a post-pandemic environment.Let's have a look at our trading business on slide 14. I'm starting with cash trading. In the fourth quarter of 2022  we observed lower cash trading volumes  which were partially offset by efficient revenue capture and market share management  in particular we saw an uptick in market share from October 2022 not at detriment of revenue capture.Cash trading revenue was EUR65.1 million this quarter  a decrease of 17.9%  compared to the same quarter last year as a result of average daily volumes of EUR10.1 billion  a volume decrease of 17.2% and 3% fewer trading days this quarter. Average revenue capture over the quarter was at 0.50 basis point versus 0.49 basis point in the fourth quarter of 2021  reflecting the dilutive impact of Borsa Italiana market and larger average order size in line with pre-pandemic levels. As a reminder  we charge per value and per order explaining the dilutive impact of larger order size on our revenue capture.As I said  we reported an uptick in market share from October 2022 and Euronext market share on cash trading averaged 65.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022. In the past we were often asked about the sustainability of those metrics. This is why I would like to confirm to you that in 2023  we expect to maintain on our market  the market share greater or equal to 63% and our revenue capture to be around 0.52 basis point following the integration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq  considering current market condition and order size.Euronext has once again confirmed its position as the largest  the deepest  and the most stable liquidity pool in Europe offering the highest quality of executions with market participants. We are excited that our cash trading business will significantly change dimension with a migration of Italian cash market to Euronext state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq in the first quarter of 2023.Now  I would like to move to Derivatives trading. Derivatives trading revenues decreased 5.4% to EUR13.4 million this quarter as a result of softer volume environment  partially offset by a positive impact of volume mix on revenue capture and fee changes. Average daily volumes on financial derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2022 were down 12.7% from the same quarter last year  suffering from a strong comparison basis with high volatility in the fourth quarter of 2021.Commodities average daily volumes were down 17.2% in the fourth quarter of 2022  compared to the fourth quarter of 2021  reflecting a normalized trading environment. Over the quarter  the average revenue capture increased for derivatives to EUR0.34 per lot  up 12.5% from the fourth quarter of 2021  thanks to volume mix impact and fee changes.Lastly on Fixed Income trading. Fixed Income trading reported revenue at EUR22.1 million this quarter  compared to EUR24.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This reflects an economic environment in Europe favoring money market and therefore repo volumes. MTS reported an overall robust performance in market dominated by increasing interest rate  with continued strong traction for repo trading offset by lower cash trading volumes.In the fourth quarter of 2022 MTS cash reported EUR12.8 million of revenue with ADV down 32.7% to EUR15.4 billion and MTS Repo reported EUR5.6 million of revenue with term-adjusted ADV up 36% to EUR397 billion.Continuing on trading on slide 15. The fourth quarter of 2022 saw a solid performance of Euronext FX in terms of both revenues and average daily volume  benefiting from the continued positive momentum with a high volatility and good traction of our matching engine in Singapore. Euronext reported average spot FX trading daily volumes of $20.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022  up 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.Spot FX trading revenue increased 9.5%  compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 at EUR6.7 million. Power trading reported EUR8.9 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022  a growth of 4.7% year-on-year driven by dynamic volumes increased foot print in Nord Pool in Central Europe  U.K.  Ireland and a continued robust performance in the Nordics.In the fourth quarter of 2022 average daily volume day ahead power traded was 2.98 terawatt hours  up 7.9% with respect to the same quarter last year  and average daily intraday power traded was at 0.13-terawatt hour. This is an increase of 9% year-on-year. I would like to highlight the intraday trading volumes in Central and Western Europe reached record level this quarter.Moving to slide 16. Revenues from our Post Trade activities excluding net treasury income decreased 2.5% to EUR88.6 million. Clearing revenue was down 3.9% this quarter to EUR29 million as a result of dynamic bond clearing activity  partially offsetting weaker cash and derivative clearing activity.As announced with the Q2 2022 results  Euronext Clearing engaged in a partial disposal of its investment portfolio. We dispose the portfolio maturing after the 1st of May 2023 and kept the rest until maturity. The runoff for this portfolio is currently ongoing and almost completed. As a consequence  our net treasury income is not yet at cruising speed and this quarter amounted to EUR4.3 million. In this respect  I would like to confirm our target for NTI 2023. In the first quarter of 2023  we expect to reach 10 basis point margin similarly from the margin we have reached in the fourth quarter of 2022. And from the second quarter this year and onwards we will reach our cruising speeds at 20 basis points.I wanted to make a brief comment as well on the upgrade of S&P. What I wanted to highlight is that the upgrade of rating is not only linked to an improvement of leverage  but as well a reduction of clearing risk and our rank anchor rating moved from BBB to BBB plus as S&P has removed the notch downgrade for clearing and settlement risk. This gives us a significantly more upside as far as rating is concerned.Continuing on settlement and other Post Trade revenue including the activity of Euronext Security  the revenues were EUR59.6 million this quarter  down 1.9% year-on-year. This reflect the resilient top line of Euronext Securities  thanks to its diversified geographical footprint in a stabilized environment. For settlement  over the fourth quarter of 2022  the value of assets under custody at Euronext Securities increased to EUR6.3 billion.I'm now moving to the next slide  slide 17  Advanced Data Services reached record revenues of EUR54.5 million this quarter  up 7.3% year-on-year  driven by strong traction of our core data businesses and good momentum of Advanced Data solution franchise including quant research and indices. Investor service revenues were up EUR2.6 million this quarter  up 13.2% reflecting continued commercial expansion of the business. Lastly  Technology Solutions revenue was up 1.8% compared to the same quarter last year to EUR26.9 million  reflecting the good performance of colocation activity following the migration of Euronext Core Data Centre  and this more than offset the lower revenues from hosting services.Moving to the next slide  I'm now on slide 19. I wanted to give some highlights on our 2023 cost guidance. In 2023 Euronext expects its underlying expenses excluding D&A to be around EUR630 million  compared to the annualized second half 2022 underlying expenses excluding D&A of around EUR620 million. The slight increase solidly relates to growth initiative to develop our non-volume related fund business.In other words  we expect that the cost base of Euronext to remain stable as cost savings and synergies will entirely compensate inflation and business development costs. I would like also to add that on the revenue side  we have performed a deep review of our pricing strategy across products to reflect inflation. And we will have the effect of this activity in 2023.I would like as well to do a few comments on integration costs. Stephane has already partially covered that. Following the termination of our derivative clearing agreement  we will post the provision this quarter of around EUR36 million covering termination and migration costs. For the sake of clarity  this does not change our target of integration cost  which is set at EUR150 million. In addition  I would like to confirm our previous guideline in terms of integration cost per quarter that for 2023 will range in between EUR10 million and EUR15 million depending on the quarter.Moving now to the next slide. This brings us to the EBITDA bridge. Euronext adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was down 12% to EUR187.9 million  mainly from lower volume environment partially as we discussed offset by non-volume related revenue growth and maintain cost discipline in an inflationary environment. Indeed despite the pressures of inflation and despite the deployment of our strategic plan cost remain contained this quarter  as Stephane mentioned earlier  we beat our revised 2022 cost target of EUR612 million  initially set at the beginning of the year at EUR622 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased as a consequence by 3.5 points  compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 to 54.1%.Moving to slide 21 for the bridge on net income. Adjusted net income this quarter was down 18.2% to EUR118.2 million  resulting from lower EBITDA  partially offset by the following elements. First lower D&A as in the first quarter of 2021 we had some write-offs as the one of the brand name of VP Securities  with as well lower net financing expenses mainly linked to the positive impact of higher interest rates  there are many moving parts in this number  but in summary  the positive impact of the interest rate on our interest income reported in the fourth quarter of 2022 is higher than the benefit from the interest rate swap we had in the fourth quarter of 2021 and it was terminated in 2022.And then I would like to highlight as well higher results from equity investment  representing the contribution of LCH SA and the dividend received from Euroclear. As a reminder  in last year Euroclear paid its dividend in Q1 and Q3. I would like to highlight that the non-underlying cost in this bridge are mainly represented by D&A and more specifically related to the PPA amortization of our acquisition.Lastly  tax for the fourth quarter of 2022 was EUR38.5 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 27.3% for the quarter. Reported net income was EUR99.3 million  and adjusted EPS basic was down 18% this quarter  EUR1.11 per share  compared to an adjusted EPS basic as well of EUR1.35 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. This reflects higher number of outstanding share of the quarter compared to last year.Moving to slide 22 for the cash flow generation and leverage. The net operating cash flow post tax amounted for a negative EUR147.1 million  compared to a positive EUR145.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This negative flow was impacted by a change in working capital related to Nord Pool CCP activities for EUR276 million.As we will see in the next slide  the balancing item of this negative cash flow is a reduction of the cash in transit for EUR297 million. Excluding the impact of on working capital from Nord Pool and Euronext Clearing  CCP activities net operating cash flow post tax accounted for 55.3% of EBITDA.Our net debt to EBITDA as reminded by Stephane was at 2.6 times in the fourth quarter of 2022  compared to 4.3 times in the third quarter of 2022  that was positively impacted by higher cash in transit as we just discussed included in the cash and cash equivalents. Excluding the EUR49 million non-underlying one-off loss on NTI  the net debt to last 12 months reported EBITDA was at 2.4 times in the fourth quarter of 2022.Moving on to the slide 23 for the evolution of our liquidity position over the quarter. As described on previous slide  you can see the impact of the short movement in working capital related to Nord Pool CCP activities in the net operating cash flow. As an illustration  our liquidity position remains strong  above EUR1.5 billion  including the undrawn revolving credit facility for EUR600 million  and excluding the cash currently in transit.As Stephane highlighted  while the integration of Borsa Italiana is on track  we can look for external growth opportunities  thanks to this strong liquidity position and improvement in our rating profile.And this completes my presentation  and now I give the floor back to Stephane.Stephane BoujnahThank you  Giorgio. As you have seen 2022 was a real pivotal year  we took advantage of our diversified business model  our business model which is much more diversified than many people think. We strengthened our core business with continuous leadership not only on listing and on trading  but also a very strong development in other businesses. We maintained our trademark cost discipline in an inflationary environment  which has affected everyone.And we have put the key projects of the Borsa Italiana Group integration on a very good track  hence our commitments in terms of synergy delivery for the years to come. So 2023  ‚Äò22 has demonstrated that Euronext has the recipe for success  for cash flow generation even in tough environments. Also 2022 paved the way for future growth in Euronext now 2023 will be a real transformational year.First  our cash trading market share is expected to remain greater or equal to 63% and our revenue capture for the cash equity trading business to remain above what we call to 0.52 bps in 2023 after the Borsa Italiana markets migration to Optiq.Second our continued cost discipline and achieved synergies will enable us to offset inflation. The slight increase in cost only results from costs related to non-volume related revenue growth initiatives and savings and synergies entirely compensate inflation and business development cost. So the superior track record of Euronext in post-merger integration will translate -- will continue to translate in a strong cost discipline.Third  as a result  we have great  our 2024 run rate synergy target to reach almost twice the level of the first announced synergies back to the time of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition announcement to what will be EUR115 million of run rate synergies by the end of ‚Äò24. ‚Äò23 will be pivotal  as I said  with the delivery of the key strategic projects that have been highlighted by Giorgio and I early on. And the continued cost optimization that will lead to EUR70 million of cumulated run rate synergies at the end of '23.And fourth  combined with our fast deleveraging  since the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group and as demonstrated by the BBB plus upgrade by S&P announced yesterday evening  we are now in the right position to look for possible external growth in the respect obviously of our strong investment criteria of return on capital employed above WACC after three or five years -- three years to five years.So thanks for your attention. We are now ready to take your questions together with Giorgio Modica  Anthony Attia  the Global Head of Primary Markets and Post Trade  and Simon  Head of Cash and Derivatives trading.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question from line  Kyle Voigt from KBW. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Kyle VoigtHi  good morning. Maybe a couple of questions from me. First question is just on pricing  some of your peers globally have spoken about taking larger pricing adjustment in 2023 given the inflationary backdrop  and I believe you mentioned that in your prepared remarks that you also took some inflationary adjustments. Just wondering how you viewed pricing in 2023 versus prior years. And in which lines we should really expect the most material pricing adjustments to come through?And then also just a question on the synergy realization slide in the deck and the timeline there. Obviously  some of the key dates are for the fourth quarter of 2023  so quite late in the year. So when we think about your 2023 underlying cost guidance  I'm just trying to get a sense of what level of actual realized cost synergies are embedded within that as that may help us think about the expense trajectory into 2024. And given those timing of synergies  is it possible that underlying costs may actually be down in 2024 versus 2023? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahThank you. So  Giorgio will answer your two questions  the first on pricing and the second one on the phasing of synergy delivery.Giorgio ModicaSo thank you very much for your questions. So with respect to pricing  I guess that the best way to describe what we were going to do is that mostly price are going to be increased in the non-trading activities. And the increase that we will have are around  I would say  mid-single-digit than some slightly more  some slightly less. But this gives you a sense of how much our non-volume related business will grow in terms of pricing.And if you consider that 60% of our business is non-volume related  this gives you a bit of an idea of what would be the price increase impact on our top line next year  excluding any other variables. So it's around mid-single-digit time 60%. Then on the line  this price increase we laid  I mean  I believe I indirectly answered saying that it's not really going to be the trading lines  but the other line. So this is for the first question.When it comes to the synergies  the way I can answer your question is the following. Let's start from the synergies that we have delivered run rate this quarter. So at the end of December 2022  we have reached EUR34 million of run rate synergies. What this means is that part of the synergies will hit the P&L in 2023. And this is going as well to contribute to making sure as I described that the key cost of the organization will remain flat from a P&L perspective.Then coming to the delivery of synergies next year  a few elements  there is going to be an important moment with the migration of Optiq in the first quarter  and this will have -- impact our P&L right after the migration. But then  you are correct  there are other cost and savings that are going to be delivered in the fourth quarter this year with the impact on the P&L of next year.So then  my last comment is that  this year we will deliver a combination of revenues and cost synergies. And as far as the revenue synergies  again  I already mentioned the Optiq integration  but we will have as well the launch of our clearing activities on equities.Kyle VoigtThank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line  Mike Werner from UBS. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Mike WernerThank you very much for the presentation and the explanations  all very  very helpful. Two questions from me please. In terms of the market share in cash equity trading  and we know you've adjusted your pricing schedule  I think it was in November  we saw an uptick in market shares into the year end. The data that I collect  which certainly is not perfect implies that market shares have trended lower in January and ultimately in the first couple of days of February. So I was wondering if you can confirm if that's what you're seeing.And then B  just wondering  is this -- is that price adjustment in November  kind of  your final take  is this something where we could see further adjustments ultimately to protect the market share as we look at over the next couple of months?And then on the second question  just thinking about deleveraging  and I think the debt to EBITDA was 2.6 times at the end of this year  very similar level at the end of 2021. I know there was a bunch of restructuring costs throughout the year. But as we look out to 2023 kind of given your guidance on restructuring costs  how should we think about the pace of deleveraging throughout ‚Äò23  assuming no M&A or no other factors involved? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo  Simon Gallagher will answer your first question on market share and yield and prices. And Giorgio Modica will answer your question on deleveraging pace and phasing.Simon GallagherThank you  Stephane. So to answer the first question on market share  so you're right  we implemented a first batch of measures on pricing and liquidity programs in November last year  which was successful  which resulted in a three-point uplift in market share over the quarter. And certainly since the start of the year  what we're seeing is that volumes are soft  there is a lack of real economy liquidity in the market  which has had a slightly downward influence on market share because regulated markets tend to have a higher proportion of real economy flow than the alternative trading venues. And so  that's what we see as the primary explanation for the first quarter.To answer your second question  the answer is resolutely  no. This is obviously not the end of the pricing measures we are taking  and the changes in liquidity we are making. There will be further adjustments to the flagship liquidity schemes in March  alongside as Stephane and Giorgio mentioned the pricing adjustments to the Italian market post migrations. These price changes and liquidity schemes will not be yield dilutive. They will be pushing our liquidity providers a bit more and adjusting the intricacies of the LP schemes. So this is not the end of the story. Obviously  this is a very dynamic and ongoing process.Mike WernerThank you very much.Giorgio ModicaYes  when it comes to the deleveraging profile  I can confirm a few elements. Now  I believe you are the target for dividends  so it's EUR236 million. And then the other element is that we confirm two-thirds cash flow conversion post tax from EBITDA. So with these two elements  I believe that now we have  I mean  we have guided with respect to the non-underlying costs are related to the termination of the agreement. Those are the key elements of the equation. So again to summarize  around 66% cash flow conversion post tax  and EUR236 million of dividends to be expected in 2023.Mike WernerThank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line  Haley Tam from Credit Suisse. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Haley TamGood morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Could I ask a couple about the revenue capture please in the equity market. So first of all  the Q4 revenue yield of 0.5 basis points was a step down from 0.53 in Q3? And if I've heard you correctly  you're saying that the supplemental liquidity provider scheme adjustments you've made are not yield dilutive. So I wonder if you could help us walk through that step down from 0.53 to 0.5  please just to understand the dynamics there?And then the second question  just to understand your assumptions for 2023  market share more than 63% to revenue capture 0.52 basis points. Are both of those numbers for after the Borsa Italiana migration or are they numbers that I should assume for the average through the year? And I do know that 63% is less than the 65% market share you had in Q4. So I just wondered if you could comment on that? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahOkay  so Simon Gallagher will answer your two questions on the revenue capture and on the phasing of the market share evolutions.Simon GallagherThank you  Stephane. So I'll break down very precisely the variance in yield from 0.53 to 0.5. In the numbers are included a small number of non-equity items  so it's the Warrants and Certificates and ETFs notably. So if we break down the 0.03  0.01 of that was due to non-equity items this variance in volumes in non-equity businesses  which are ETFs and the Warrants and Certificates. So that leaves 0.02 basis points imputable to cash equity yield. Two-thirds of this 0.02 was due to changes in the order sizes.And so  how does this impact the 0.02? When markets tend to be a bit less  there's less volatility in the markets  order sizes as we've seen recently  order sizes tend to go up a little bit  which means there is less arbitrage opportunities from the electronic liquidity providers  which means order sizes go up in the market. And this interacts with certain features of our fee grid where we have fixed euro fees per executed order.And so this is two-thirds of that 0.02 is imputable to order sizes. One-third of the 0.02 can be imputable to other features of the fee grid  including partially to the SLP changes we made in the supplemental liquidity scheme. So if you break down -- if you break it down that way  the changes we make to the SLP scheme are largely immaterial in terms of impacts on yield. And there will be further yield accretive changes to the SLP scheme from the second quarter onwards.With respect to the second question  the market share number  I think can be seen as an average over the year as a base. And the yield  the revenue traction number is a -- and the market share is obviously a floor we see and is the minimum we are targeting. And the yield extraction number is post -- is the run rate post the Italy migration.Haley TamThank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Bruce HamiltonHi  good morning  and thanks very much for the presentation and Q&A. I guess firstly just going back to the synergies  obviously encouraging that you've increased those. But could you break out the EUR115 million between revenues and costs? And just going back to the earlier question  given the consensus assumes  I think a reduction in absolute costs in 2024  is that kind of consistent with the way you're thinking about the cost synergies?And then secondly on M&A and balance sheet flexibility. In terms of your sort of EUR1.5 billion of capacity  I can see on slide 23 you've laid out  how you get there. But what's the sort of net debt EBITDA that you would be comfortable going up to temporarily to do a deal? And then just an update on what the -- what you'd view your current WACC as  as well would be helpful. Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo Giorgio will answer your question on the synergies delivery on cost and on the balance sheet and debt capabilities.Giorgio ModicaSo let's start with the first one. I would like to highlight that the increase from EUR100 million to EUR115 million is mainly related to a better visibility on the opportunities on clearing. So this is the first element  then when it comes to the breakdown between cost and revenue  I will try to do my best  but there is a complexity is that  as we said from the beginning  the EUR115 million is an improvement of EBITDA  that includes sometimes project involving more revenue and more cost. So the best breakdown I can provide you with is the following.Let's start from the original target  the EUR60 million. The EUR60 million were broken down as follows  EUR45 million of cost savings and EUR15 million of revenue uplift. Now this EUR15 million revenue uplift  the significant portion of the EUR15 million is linked to the migration of Optiq. Part of which were going and the most relevant part were going to execute in 45 days. And this is clearly pure revenue synergies. Then the other buckets are around EUR10 million EBITDA coming from the migration to the center. And this is already embedded in our number  but involves more revenues  but as well more cost.And then the remainder that was originally accessed to be EUR30 million and now it's increased to EUR45 million is the clearing opportunity. And you will -- and then there are many moving parts because we'll clearly have more revenues  but as well we will need to upgrade and as we are doing the platform of Euronext Clearing. But on the other side  we will not have any more the costs that today we are paying to LCH SA  which are currently captured in our P&L. So this is the breakdown. Unfortunately  I cannot further break down the different project in between cost and revenues. So this is -- this I believe covers your first question.When it comes to the underlying cost of capital  I believe that Euronext is in line what we see as an average of analyst  and again  as I always stress  those are a point in time  so what I can say is that  I don't see a major deviation from what you analysts are taking as an average as our own cost of capital. And when it comes to the max leverage  what I would say is the following. And again  this is very tricky question  because it depends very much on the target you acquire that give -- would give us additional leverage.But as we commented in the past  we believe that in terms of pure debt capacity  we would have a capacity in the range between EUR1.5 billion and EUR2 billion. This is roughly speaking the standalone capabilities we would have to finance and impute that acquisition. And again  I would like to highlight that as you very well know rating and leverage consideration are very much target specific.Bruce HamiltonGreat  very helpful. Thank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line Enrico Bolzoni from JP Morgan. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Enrico BolzoniHi  thank you. Good morning. Sorry to go back once again to market share  just a clarification. I would like to understand the market share you are guiding is something that in case you should not be on track to achieve; you would implement some changes in pricing or something else to make sure that you hit it or it's rather you simply saying that in light of your proposition your pricing in your relationship with customer you will naturally achieve? So this is my first question.And then a more general one  possibly related to that. Can you just give any comment in terms of what you're seeing in terms of volume migrating to dark pools  because it seems like these are increasing. And also interestingly the average order size are going down  while historically they have been higher in dark pools. So I was just curious to hear from you on this subject.And then finally  I mean  a number of your peers in Europe and also outside of Europe are increasingly doing partnership with technology providers. So I was just curious to hear your thoughts here. Is this something that you consider as well or you have more -- you think you have internal capabilities to develop all the technology infrastructure that you need to support your growth? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo I will answer your third question on the relationship with the providers of data services and data storage. And Simon Gallagher will answer your question about the market share dynamics and the dark pool development. We have made the deliberate decision to internalize within Euronext and to locate within Europe the businesses that are the most critical ones to our strategy and the operations that are the most sensitive ones to our operational leverage and operational performance. That has led to migrate our Core Data Centre that used to be in Basildon to new -- brand new data center  100% powered by green energy in Bergamo near Milan.We do believe that core data processing  core software  core systems  core data storage  core applications must be located within the European Union and must be managed by Europeans. We do use for historical data storage one of those technology provider that has facilities located in the Republic of Ireland. We do not intend to have critical applications  critical software  critical matching engine related platforms located outside the European Union  nor being managed outside the Group. So this is a deliberate choice we have done  which is consistent with our strategy.Others have done different choices in a different environment with different sharing of value with partners  with different profile of future dependency on third party providers. We have not taken the choice  we have taken the choice to internalize that and that was not done at the compromise of anything in terms of financial performance as you have seen it over the past few years.Over to you  Simon  on the market share and volumes.Simon GallagherThank you  Stephane. So to answer the first question on the two numbers of 63% and 0.52. So this is obviously an equilibrium between these two numbers. And the aim of this equilibrium is to maximize euro revenue extraction from the franchise. We believe that these two numbers represent the optimal trade-off for this year  obviously there is some room  wiggle room around these numbers. But the primary aim here is to maintain our role and our ability to price full value within the franchise across the various pricing segments.I just want to make one point. So beyond the explicit fees of 0.52  what is behind a lot of this is the management of implicit costs for investors  which is the quality of execution on our market. And this has to do with the mark out  the liquidity of our markets  which is by all published papers vastly superior to the alternative market. So this explicit yield number is only a part of the story. And I'd even say sort of a minority part of the story. The bigger picture behind here is the design of our liquidity schemes and the partnerships we form with our partners in the electronic trading community.The second point about dark pools  there's been some small increase in these pools. I'd say two things  dark pools  if you look at the numbers remained very small features still of the European execution landscape. These are low-single-digit -- sorry  below 10% in terms of volumes and is constrained by regulation  right. So we have the 8% cap and the 4% cap on reference price trading venues.And the second thing  if you look at the revenue models of these pools  they actually charge less than that we do in the lead markets. Third point with respect to dark pools we are observing with great interest the movements in the regulatory landscape  and we will be very active in this space. And depending what's happened -- what happens there  there will be potential business opportunities for Euronext as well in the stock trading space. So I think that's what we can say there.Enrico BolzoniThank you very much.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line Ian White from Autonomous Research. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Ian WhiteHi  thanks for taking my questions. Just a few follow-ups from my side please. Can you just clarify a little bit  your appetite for M&A at this stage  from the discussion so far  I'm sort of taking away that you'd be happy to consider a transformational deal at this stage  even while the Borsa Italiana integration is still ongoing. Is that a fair reflection of your appetite for M&A please?Second question  just any revised thoughts at all around the medium-term financial guidance that you've given for out to FY ‚Äò24. And finally  just maybe a clarification please on the outlook for NII. I think you talked about getting to cruising speed 20 bps yield  but how have collateral balances trended there over the last sort of few months and what's the outlook there please? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo I will answer your first question on the M&A framework and Giorgio will answer the two other questions on financial guidance. The M&A objectives or the M&A framework remains the same. We want to continue the growth of the Euronext project in two directions. The first one is to remain open to single country or several country exchanges in Europe  who consider being part of a scalable project and who might be interested in joining the largest single liquidity pool in Europe and the largest single order book and the most powerful technology platform. So anything that would make Euronext more relevant for some European market infrastructure is clearly something that we will consider.The other avenue is always to pursue the diversification of our of our top line. The diversification of our revenue mix  because this call is very interesting. There are many questions on market share and yield of the business that represents 20% of our top line today. It's important  I appreciate that. But you may have noticed that over the past few years  we have done a significant effort to diversify in Post Trade  to diversify in other asset classes like energy  like ForEx  like in other services like corporate services in technology et cetera.So we -- the objective Post Trade by any M&A move will be diversification of our top line. And the other objective would be to accelerate growth to capture businesses that have a growth profile that can accelerate the growth profile of the combined entity. So we explore and we analyze all sort of situations. And clearly the fact that our deleveraging has increased  and that the rating has been improved yesterday evening to BBB plus.The fact that the synergies in Italy are in the very good track  hence the upgrade targeted -- that really target that we have shared with you  it gives us more confidence that we need to explore these opportunities again. But nothing very new or fundamental  just an improvement of the surrounding consensus around the same strategy. We'd always  always the same very rigorous framework that we want to deploy the capital of our shareholders in acquisitions that generate a return on capital employed above the WACC of the company between year three and five after synergies. So that's the M&A framework.Over to you  Giorgio on the mid-term financial profile and end of ‚Äò24 guidance.Giorgio ModicaAbsolutely. Let me start with the net treasury income. I will give you a few more details so that you can have a better view. So the first element  I wanted to highlight is that  with respect to when we discussed the last time around the average collateral has actually increased  what we have seen are level at around the EUR22 billion.And in the fourth quarter of last year  these EUR4.3 million that we have posted as NTI represent around zero point -- around 7 basis points. So slightly below the 10 we guided. And this is the result of the fact that interest rates increase more than anticipated. And as you know  during the fourth quarter we still had an important point of fixed income portfolio in run off  but then in terms of euro million this is very  very marginal.If we now move to the first quarter this year  what we will have in terms of P&L is going to be a revenue capture  which is going to be closer to the 10 bps I guided. And we might have in euro million a result  which is in between EUR5 million and EUR6 million. Then after that we will see  collateral should remain in the EUR20 billion type of a range  slightly more  slightly less. And the cruising speed in terms of NTI should be 20 basis points. Then this is as granular as I can be  if you have follow up question  happy to take them.When it comes to the target of 2024  the only one I can put  we will not change the target is that within our current target of EBITDA growth  given the environment we see room for having slightly more revenues for an environment where we will have slightly more cost. So this is more or less the trend  so 5% to 6% EBITDA CAGR remains unchanged  maybe depending on how the next two years will evolve  we might be in a situation where revenue growth is going to be higher and cost marginally higher.Ian WhiteGot it. That's helpful. Thank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line Johannes Thormann from HSBC. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Johannes ThormannGood morning  everybody. And some follow-up questions please. First of all on the clearing business again. First of all  why have you delay in the margin improvement from 10 bps to 20 bps? I'm still lacking to understand  and will it be really fixed end of this quarter  or will we probably get next call the message again  we have another quarter running in 10 bps. What is driving this because investors here this is probably  anyway so it's just the worst time of the market?And secondly  on your clearing initiative in general  especially for the cash clearing  what incentives are you giving to the customers to move your business to Euronext Clearing away from LCH  because as I understand in cash clearing the customer has major part of the choice?And last but not least on the cash trading market share  historically you were about 70%  now you seem to be satisfied with 63%  which is also the revenue opportunity for the clearing business. So you're reducing your own revenue opportunity. What is driving your assumption to be satisfied with 63%? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahOkay. So Giorgio will answer your -- the first part of your questions. And Anthony Attia  who is the Head of Post Trade operations will answer your questions on the incentives  the pricing of our operation -- clearing operations and our market share in equity  cash equity clearing.Giorgio ModicaSo  I would like to clarify one element  you seem to highlight the level of surprise  but in July 2022  we expressed a very clear guideline saying that  we would have had 20 basis point in the third quarter  then 10 basis point in the fourth and in the first quarter and then back again 20 basis point. And the result  so -- and we guided for around EUR20 billion level of collateral  which means implicitly that we guided for EUR10 million in the third quarter and EUR5 million in the fourth quarter. The actual result were EUR11 million in the third quarter and EUR4 million in the fourth quarter  which is  I would say  exactly identical to what we have guided in July 2022.So what is happening? And why did we get zero point -- sorry 7 basis point and not 10 basis point  simply that  when you have a small portion of your portfolio  which is fixed income  it means that the rate on the asset side will not change  whereas on the liability side where 100% of our ability are benchmarked to ECB rates  then you pay more. And this has a slightly dilutive impact on the level of NTI.Finally  on your question  is really true that we are going to have 20 basis point in the second quarter? And then  my answer is  yes. As a simple fact that in -- as I said  from the 1st of May 2023  we'll no longer hold any fixed income portfolio and for all of our assets and all our liabilities are going to be at variable rate. And therefore  we will make the spread between the interest we collect and interest we give back to clients. I hope this clarifies.Anthony AttiaGood morning. This is Anthony Attia. Thank you for your question. Let me detail for you the value proposition of our clearing internalization initiatives. They are five main points that I want to share with you. So first of all  we will offer the clearing services for cash equity for all our Euronext market excluding Oslo  but including Italy. So in the same default fund  on the same risk framework and the value-add risk model  we will be able to clear all our cash equity trade. This generate efficiencies on margin and default contribution to the client compared to the current fragmented situation.Second  we will be operating from a state-of-the-art clearing platform that we are currently developing with one connection for all the market. And the use of the extremely efficient set of technologies.Third part  we are working on offering competing clearing fees. There‚Äôs no need to get into the rest of the [Technical Difficulty] on from a clearing fee point of view. But it's the combination of these different factors that create this attractive value proposition.And last  thanks to our Post Trade investment on Euronext Securities  our CSDs  in particular in Milan  we will be able to offer extremely competitive settlement fees. And so the engagement we have with the clearing members presently show that we are in a very  very good position to succeed in the migration at the end of 2023. Thank you.Johannes ThormannThank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the last question from line Greg Simpson from BNP Paribas. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Greg SimpsonHi  good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in at the end. Maybe a follow-up on clearing  can you just talk about what the current market share of that LCH SA has in your cash markets? What are your expectations for when your next clearing goes live in Q4. And then you have fewer CCP in the background. So just interested in any thoughts on competition?And then a second question would be on  on the mid-single-digit price increases in the non-volume areas  can you share if there's any user feedback on this? Do customers generally just accept the price increases as they're essential or is there any signs that you just might try to say optimize the subscriptions  our market data for example. Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo  Giorgio on pricing  and Anthony on the competition on clearing.Anthony AttiaSo on clearing  so we do not comment market share element of LCH SA or the Euroclear Europe  you can direct your questions to them. Nevertheless the setup that will be out at the end of the year is complete for CCP setup  which means that by default the trade done on Euronext Optiq platform will be routed towards Euronext Clearing and if the buyer and the seller select another CCP then the trade will be relative to these other CCP. So far this preferred CCP model creates an incentive for the year  for the CCP of choice to clear the bulk of the trade  because it provide efficiencies the way I commented before.Giorgio ModicaThen when it comes to your question with respect to price increase  it's actually a complicated question  but let me try to answer. So in general terms  clients are not necessarily happy of price increases. However  it is important to highlight that the general environment is -- in this general environment price increase are very common  everyone is increasing prices and therefore as well clients are accustomed to increase their own prices to their clients and receive a request for price increasing inflationary environment. So this is the first element.And we have not received any sign where our price increase were considered to be excessive. And clearly  we have deeply assessed that  making sure that price increase were commensurate to the quality of the service we provide. So this is the first element. Then you seem to refer more specifically to market data. And on that specific angle  what I can tell you is that  if you look  for example  at our -- if you look for example at our results in the fourth quarter  you see that the 7%  a part of that 7% is related to an increase of users.It's related to an increase of streams  which is quite surprisingly in an industry where usually there is attrition in terms of clients and number of terminals. And this reflect the new way of a mix way of working  flat -- part from home and part in the office where sharing screen and terminal becomes more complicated. So to make a long story short  we did pass the price increase that was generally well accepted by clients.Stephane BoujnahSo thank you everyone. As two words of conclusion now  I want to highlight really in my -- what is my view is that -- are the key takeaways of where we are today. We deliver diversification  our revenues are more diversified than they have ever been  and we will continue to deliver diversification. We deliver cost discipline in environment  which is quite complicated with inflationary pressure and we will continue to deliver cost discipline. We deliver post-merger integration for real with major projects already delivered in relation to the acquisition of Borsa Italiana  and new ones will be delivered including within a few weeks‚Äô time with the Optiq migration in Italy.And we will therefore there continue to deliver revenue synergies and other post-merger integration projects. We have delivered deleveraging and we will continue to deliver deleveraging as demonstrated by the BBB plus upgrade announced yesterday by S&P. So we are extremely confident that this strong diversified cost discipline operating leverage focused company with great assets to expand the top line through the extraction of revenue synergies will continue to be extremely positioned to capture opportunities in ‚Äò23.Thank you very much.

However  each of the Alternative Consideration Instruments or Deferred Payment Rights are not subject to any adjustments after such an Alternative Consideration Instrument has been delivered or a Deferred Payment Right has been recorded to the shareholder but  instead  the adjustments will occur only if the distribution of funds or other corporate event entitling to the adjustment or if a record date with respect to any of the foregoing occurs prior to the settlement of relevant completion trades of the Tender Offer.Bain Capital Europe Fund VI  Security Trading  Fennogens and Corbis have given equity commitments to the Offeror to fund the Offeror for the purposes of the Tender Offer and the designated purpose of such equity commitments is to enable payment of the aggregate Cash Offer Price and redemption of the Alternative Consideration Instruments and payment of the Deferred Payment to holders of equity savings accounts by the Offeror.RECOMMENDATION BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CAVERIONThe Board of Directors of Caverion  represented by a quorum comprising the non-conflicted members of the Board of Directors  has unanimously decided to recommend in its statement issued on February 9  2023 pursuant to the Finnish Securities Markets Act (746/2012  as amended) and the Helsinki Takeover Code issued by the Finnish Securities Market Association (the ""Helsinki Takeover Code"") that the shareholders of Caverion accept the Tender Offer. The Board of Directors of Caverion has received an updated opinion  dated January 24  2023  of Caverion's exclusive financial adviser  Bank of America Europe DAC  Stockholm branch (""BofA Securities"")  to the effect that  as of the date of such opinion  the increased Offer Price to be paid to holders of Shares (other than Security Trading  Fennogens and Corbis and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the Improved Tender Offer  was fair from a financial point of view  to such holders  which opinion was based upon and subject to the assumptions made  procedures followed  matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken as more fully described in such opinion. The opinion of BofA Securities was provided for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors of Caverion and does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holders of Shares should act in connection with the Tender Offer or any related matter.THE ACCEPTANCE PROCEDURE OF THE TENDER OFFERAcceptance of the Tender Offer with Alternative Consideration may only be submitted on the business day following the publication of the Supplement Document  i.e. from February 13  2023.Before February 13  2023  acceptance of the Tender Offer can only be made with the Cash Offer Price. Each shareholder of Caverion whose acceptance of the Tender Offer has been submitted before February 13  2023  shall be deemed to have accepted the Tender Offer with the Cash Offer Price.If a shareholder of Caverion has submitted the acceptance of the Tender Offer before February 13  2023 in respect of the Shares held by him/her and wishes to elect the Alternative Consideration instead of the Cash Offer Price  such shareholder must submit a valid withdrawal of his/her earlier acceptance of the Tender Offer in accordance with instructions from the account operator and submit a duly executed acceptance form for the Alternative Consideration. Neither the Offeror nor Nordea (in its capacity as arranger and an account operator) will charge the shareholders for withdrawing their acceptance of the Tender Offer in order to accept the Alternative Consideration in such a situation.A shareholder may only choose to receive either the Alternative Consideration or the Cash Offer Price for all Shares held on the same book-entry account  and  consequently  shareholders may only tender for mixed consideration if the relevant Shares are held on separate book-entry accounts.The shareholders holding Shares on equity savings accounts who have selected the Alternative Consideration will receive  instead of the Alternative Consideration Instruments  non-transferable rights to payment from the Offeror  and to demonstrate these  the book-entries named as other rights will be recorded to a shareholder's equity savings account.Most Finnish account operators will send a new notice regarding the Tender Offer and related instructions to those who are registered as shareholders in the shareholders' register of Caverion maintained by Euroclear Finland.

In particular  the financial information included in this stock exchange release has been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in Finland  which may not be comparable to the financial statements or financial information of U.S. companies. The Tender Offer is made to Caverion's shareholders resident in the United States on the same terms and conditions as those made to all other shareholders of Caverion to whom an offer is made. Any informational documents  including this stock exchange release  are being disseminated to U.S. shareholders on a basis comparable to the method that such documents are provided to Caverion's other shareholders.As permitted under the Tier I Exemption  the settlement of the Tender Offer is based on the applicable Finnish law provisions  which differ from the settlement procedures customary in the United States  particularly as regards to the time when payment of the consideration is rendered. The Tender Offer  which is subject to Finnish law  is being made to the U.S. shareholders in accordance with the applicable U.S. securities laws  and applicable exemptions thereunder  in particular the Tier I Exemption and the 802 Exemption. To the extent the Tender Offer is subject to U.S. securities laws  those laws only apply to U.S. shareholders and will not give rise to claims on the part of any other person.

My name is Caroline  and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. [Operator Instructions] However  you will have the opportunity to ask questions at the end of the call. [Operator Instructions]I will now hand over to your host  Stephane Boujnah  Euronext's CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board joined by Giorgio Modica  Euronext's CFO to begin today's conference. Thank you.Giorgio ModicaGood morning  everybody and thank you for joining us this morning for the Euronext fourth quarter and full-year 2022 results conference call and webcast. I am Stephane Boujnah  CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext. And I will start with the highlights of the full year and the fourth quarter. Giorgio Modica  the Euronext CFO will then further develop the main business and the financial highlights of the fourth quarter.As an introduction  I would like to highlight three points. First  Euronext is stronger than ever. Euronext is now present in the full value chain and Euronext confirmed its leadership position in listing and in trading in Europe. In addition our revenue demonstrated strong resilience  thanks to our diversified business model.Second  we beat our 2022 cost guidance  thanks to cost discipline in an inflationary environment. Third  we are well-advanced in the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group and by the end of 2023  we will reach EUR70 million of cumulative run rate synergies. We are now in a position to upgrade our 2024 synergy target by EUR15 million to EUR115 million of annual run rate synergies.Let me give you some more detail on each of those points. First  as I said Euronext is today the leading listing venue in Europe for equity  and for that globally. And we are also the largest venue for equity trading in Europe representing 2 times the volume traded on the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Borse. We are now a top-ranking Post Trade infrastructure operator through Euronext Clearing and Euronext Securities. This is all the result of our diversification strategy. And this major transformation is reflected in our 2022 performance where 58% of our underlying revenue is now non-volume related.2022 was also a strong year in terms of financial performance. In 2022 Euronext reached record underlying revenues  an income above EUR1.4 billion. This is up plus 13%  compared to 2021. We generated plus EUR120.2 million additional revenue in 2022  compared to ‚Äò21  which was a very strong reference shows as you may remember. This strong 2022 performance was driven by the strong performance of non-volume related businesses and enhanced revenue capture.And in trading  we recorded a very strong year for power and for ForEx trading. The softer volume environment for cash equity trading in the second half of 2022 was clearly offset by significant and efficient management of yield and a real uptick in market share from October 2022. Our Post Trade franchise significantly benefited from the consolidation of Euronext Clearing and Euronext Securities Milan  which were acquired as part of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition in April ‚Äò21. The diversified business of the Euronext Securities allowed us to capture value as settlement activity stabilized in H2 2022.I would -- like especially to highlight the performance of our listing business  which grew by plus 15.1% and reported solid listing activities with 83 new listings in 2022. In particular  we welcomed 20 international companies  which in my view is the recognition that Euronext  Euronext market in Europe are now the venue of choice for listing in Europe. Furthermore our Advanced Data Services business increased by plus 15.5%  reflecting growth across the real-time and non-real-time data business  as well as index growth.Lastly  following the successful migration of our Core Data Centre to Bergamo in June 2022  we significantly scaled up our Technology Solutions business reaching over EUR100 million in revenue now. That's why  as mentioned earlier  the share of non-volume related revenue represented 58% of our top line in 2022 and accounted for 141% of operating costs excluding D&A.And that brings me to our ongoing focus on cost discipline on slide five with a bigger picture on financials. Thanks to strong cost discipline and several positive one-off impacts of the year  we overachieved or revised cost guidance of EUR612 million  down from an initial cost guidance  as you may remember it  up EUR622 million  because we reported EUR606.1 million of underlying expenses excluding D&A. And this was achieved despite inflationary pressures  despite pressure on supply chains that everyone experiences.Consequently  our 2022 adjusted EBITDA grew double-digit to EUR861.6 million. This translated into an adjusted EBITDA margin at 58.7%. Overall  this performance resulted in a plus 5.7% increase of adjusted net income to EUR555.3 million. Adjusted EPS was down minus 4.8% to EUR5.21 per share. And this reflects the higher number of outstanding shares of our 2022  compared to 2021.On a reported basis  net income is up plus 6% to EUR437.8 million. Consequently a dividend of EUR2.22 per share will be proposed at our upcoming Annual General Meeting in May. These dividend represent a payout ratio of 50% of reported net income adjusted for the EUR49 million pretax or EUR35 million post tax one-off loss related to the partial disposal of the Euronext Clearing portfolio announced in Q2 2022. And this dividend is EUR0.29 more than the ‚Äò21 dividend per share. It is an increase of plus 13%.Moving now to the Q4 performance on slide six. Euronext reported a solid fourth quarter for 2022. The quarter was marked by strong performance of Advanced Data Services  strong performance of listing activities offset by lower revenues from business correlated with cash equity volumes. Underlying revenues were down minus 6.2%  compared to Q4 2021 at EUR347 million  reflecting the resilience of our diversified revenue streams in a low volatility environment.Despite softer cash equity derivatives and MTS cash trading activity  the strength of our non-volume related businesses enabled us to report only a slight decline in total revenue. First non-volume-related revenue posted a strong performance overall. Notably  as I said earlier in listing and advanced data services in technology. Second  our trading businesses that are not related to equity markets strongly performed. We notably recorded strong growth year-on-year in power trading and a solid quarter in ForEx trading.Last  we efficiently manage our revenue capture and regained market share from October 2022 in cash trading operations. This translated into non-volume related revenue accounting for 60% of the total Q4 revenue  and covering 130% of underlying operating expenses excluding D&A.So Q4 2022 underlying operational expenses excluding D&A increased slightly to EUR159.2 million up plus 1.6%  compared to Q4 2021. And this reflect for cost disciplined approach to cost control and higher capitalized project costs offsetting inflationary pressures. Overall we reported an EBITDA  an adjusted EBITDA of EUR187.9 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.1%. This led to an adjusted EPS at EUR1.11 per share and an adjusted net income of EUR118.2 million. On a reported basis the EPS for this fourth quarter reached EUR0.93.Clearly ‚Äò22 was a year of transformation for Euronext and we made good progress in our integration process and synergy delivery. The migration of our Core Data Centre from Basildon in the U.K. to Bergamo in Italy was the first key milestone of our growth or Impact strategic plan. This migration combined with continued cost discipline enabled us to deliver EUR34.1 million cumulated run rate annual synergies at the end of 2022 in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.Looking forward  we expect to achieve around EUR70 million of our targeted synergies by the end of ‚Äò23 alone with the delivery of several key projects. First  next month we will significantly change the dimension of our unique European liquidity pool  because the migration of Italian cash market to Euronext state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq will benefit local and global trading members and will allow an alignment of fees.Second  the other Italian markets will migrate to the Optiq European liquidity pool starting in Q4 2023. And looking further cost synergies with the termination of the Millennium LSEG technology contract. Third  Euronext Clearing would become the CCP of choice for equity clearing by the end of this year  generating revenue synergies. And the following year by Q3 2024 Euronext Clearing will also clear Euronext listed derivatives.Those good progress on integration mean that we are able to upgrade our synergy target. We expect total run rate synergies in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group to reach EUR115 million by the end of ‚Äô24. This is EUR15 million more than the amount targeted until now. And this is almost 2 times the initial amount announced at the moment of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition.You may remember that in April ‚Äò21 we committed to deliver EUR60 million of synergies in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. Today we are confident that we will deliver almost a double EUR115 million of synergies in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. So that demonstrates once again the strong track record of the Euronext teams in delivering operating performance and operating leverage.On the next slide  I'd like to take a moment to tell you in more detail about one of our key strategic objectives related to clearing. It's a key strategic project. Last month we confirmed the planned European expansion of Euronext Clearing to all Euronext listed derivatives for Q3 2024. As a result Euronext served LCH SA  a notice of termination for the existing derivative clearing agreement on 16 January 2023.As we already announced  the related termination fee of approximately EUR36 million to be paid to LCH SA is part of the EUR150 million envelope of implementation cost related to the growth for Impact 2024 strategic plan. Therefore  this amount will be provisioned in our income statement as a non-underlying expense in Q1 2023 and will be payable in 2024. When we embarked on our ambitions Post Trade Strategy our aim was clear. To offer our clients the benefit of scale and harmonization‚Äôs across European markets  while still maintaining a robust local footprint in Euronext market.For all clients this will bring margin efficiencies with the implementation of a new value-add risk model and a single default fund. It will also bring efficiencies across all asset classes with transparency on data  particularly on settlement leveraging Euronext Securities target to securities settlement platform. So the expansion of Euronext Clearing is really critical as it will allow us to manage the entire trading value chain of our markets by the end of ‚Äô24  and it will generate significant revenue and cost synergies.Moving to slide nine  we continued to deploy capital efficiently in 2022 through a number of initiatives allowing us to better control our technology and develop new services. First  in March Euronext Securities acquired the General Meetings  Designated Representative and Shareholder's Registers activities of Spafid. This strategic partnership has contributed to the high growth  but had its services offered through Euronex Securities franchise.Secondly  we have internalized the technology powering MTS and Euronext Securities in Milan as part of our plan to integrate our full value chain and our technology. In addition  following the completion of the strategic review undertaken as part of the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group and our decision to divert from non-core asset  Euronext has disposed the U.S. subsidiary of MTS  MTS Markets International Inc.Importantly during this time  we have pursued very actively our deleveraging path  reaching 2.6 times net debt to EBITDA at the end of December 2022. And this compares to 3.2 times net debt to EBITDA at the closing of the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. Together with our strong cash generation capability  this brings us to around EUR1.5 billion of available capital at the end of December 2022. And our progress has been recognized by S&P that upgraded their outlook to positive in 2022. And as you have seen it yesterday evening  we have been upgraded to BBB plus.So we are very well advanced on our integration. We are confident in our ability to deliver upgraded synergies  because  once again this demonstrates the post-merger integration track record of Euronext teams. And this confidence combined with our favorable liquidity position enables us to continue exploring external growth. We would be looking for assets able to contribute to higher organic revenue growth to provide scalability and to improve exposure to non-volume related businesses. Obviously always in line with our rigorous capital allocation policy.Finally  I'd like to take a moment to highlight the great progress we have made with our Fit for 1.5 degree ESG commitment. We [Technical Difficulty] achievements of this SBTi target have already been implemented such as the migration of the Euronext Core Data Centre in Bergamo  which is powered 100% by renewable energy sources. We are also pleased to announce that Euronext has been included in the Euronext Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Euronext Equileap Gender Equality France 40  two indices showcasing European companies that demonstrate a strong role in improving gender equality. And we have continued to push for a broader transition in our markets. We have launched the CAC SBTi index  an index for grouping companies within the SBF 120 that have set emission reduction target approved as being in line with the Paris Agreement 1.5 degree before.So I now hand over to Giorgio Modica for the review of our fourth quarter performance.Giorgio ModicaThank you very much Stephane and good morning  everyone. Let's have now a look at the performance of Euronext in the fourth quarter of 2022. I'm now on slide 12. In the fourth quarter of 2022 Euronext demonstrated solid results reflecting the strong performance of advanced data services and listing combined with an efficient management of market share and revenue capture in a challenging trading environment for especially cash trading volumes.As a result  and as already mentioned by Stephane  Euronext underlying revenue income was only down 6.2%  compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 despite the relevant reduction of volumes  notably reflecting the strength of our diversified business mix. Briefly  listing revenue grew 3.1% resulting from a resilient equity and debt listing activity despite the tougher environment. We capture the majority of listing in Europe  remarkable this quarter were the high shares of company from outside of the Euronext market among our listing  accounting for around 40% of equity listing and demonstrating the international appeal of Euronext.Trading revenue was down 12.1% resulting from lower cash equity and MTS cash volume  partially offset by a record quarter for power trading and a good performance of FX trading. Post Trade revenue including -- excluding NTI was down 2.5% as a result of weaker equity clearing activity and a stabilized settlement activity.Advanced data Service revenue increased 7.3%. This was good performance across the offering both on real-time and non-real-time data  as well as on indices. Technology Solutions grew 1.8% driven by the good performance of colocation activity after the migration to the Bergamo Data Centre in June this year.In the fourth quarter of 2022 non-volume related revenue accounted  as Stephane said  for 60% of total Group revenue versus 58% the same quarter last year  reflecting high Advanced Data Services and Corporate Service revenue and revenues from services in general. Lastly  those non-volume related revenues cover 130% of our underlying operating expenses excluding D&A compared to 136% last year.Now I would like to move to the next slide  slide 13  for listing. Listing revenue was EUR53.5 million this quarter with an increase of 3.1% compared to the same quarter last year. This growth is driven by a higher annual fees  the strong performance of corporate service and the positive impact of primary and secondary listing revenue recognition over time. We have discussed already the impact on IFRS on listing revenues.In detail during the fourth quarter of 2022 Euronext maintained its leading position in Europe for primary equity listing counting 24 new listing of which  as I said  approximately 40% were international companies. In the fourth quarter of 2022 EUR310 million were raised on Euronext primary markets compared to a very strong Q4 2021 with EUR6.6 billion raised on our markets.As far as secondary issue are concerned EUR10.1 billion was raised in the fourth quarter of 2022  well above the same quarter last year. Euronext also reinforced its position as the leading venue for bond listing worldwide this quarter with over 53 000 bond listed across all Euronext market at the end of the year. And this despite a slowdown of the global bond listing activity due to the macroeconomic environment. This translated into EUR226.9 billion in debt raised on Euronext market during this quarter.Overall  this brings us to a total of EUR237.3 billion raised in equity and debt of Euronext market this quarter. Lastly  Corporate Service continued its growth trajectory across businesses despite slightly lower webcast activity in a post-pandemic environment.Let's have a look at our trading business on slide 14. I'm starting with cash trading. In the fourth quarter of 2022  we observed lower cash trading volumes  which were partially offset by efficient revenue capture and market share management  in particular we saw an uptick in market share from October 2022 not at detriment of revenue capture.Cash trading revenue was EUR65.1 million this quarter  a decrease of 17.9%  compared to the same quarter last year as a result of average daily volumes of EUR10.1 billion  a volume decrease of 17.2% and 3% fewer trading days this quarter. Average revenue capture over the quarter was at 0.50 basis point versus 0.49 basis point in the fourth quarter of 2021  reflecting the dilutive impact of Borsa Italiana market and larger average order size in line with pre-pandemic levels. As a reminder  we charge per value and per order explaining the dilutive impact of larger order size on our revenue capture.As I said  we reported an uptick in market share from October 2022 and Euronext market share on cash trading averaged 65.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022. In the past we were often asked about the sustainability of those metrics. This is why I would like to confirm to you that in 2023  we expect to maintain on our market  the market share greater or equal to 63% and our revenue capture to be around 0.52 basis point following the integration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq  considering current market condition and order size.Euronext has once again confirmed its position as the largest  the deepest  and the most stable liquidity pool in Europe offering the highest quality of executions with market participants. We are excited that our cash trading business will significantly change dimension with a migration of Italian cash market to Euronext state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq in the first quarter of 2023.Now  I would like to move to Derivatives trading. Derivatives trading revenues decreased 5.4% to EUR13.4 million this quarter as a result of softer volume environment  partially offset by a positive impact of volume mix on revenue capture and fee changes. Average daily volumes on financial derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2022 were down 12.7% from the same quarter last year  suffering from a strong comparison basis with high volatility in the fourth quarter of 2021.Commodities average daily volumes were down 17.2% in the fourth quarter of 2022  compared to the fourth quarter of 2021  reflecting a normalized trading environment. Over the quarter  the average revenue capture increased for derivatives to EUR0.34 per lot  up 12.5% from the fourth quarter of 2021  thanks to volume mix impact and fee changes.Lastly on Fixed Income trading. Fixed Income trading reported revenue at EUR22.1 million this quarter  compared to EUR24.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This reflects an economic environment in Europe favoring money market and therefore repo volumes. MTS reported an overall robust performance in market dominated by increasing interest rate  with continued strong traction for repo trading offset by lower cash trading volumes.In the fourth quarter of 2022 MTS cash reported EUR12.8 million of revenue with ADV down 32.7% to EUR15.4 billion and MTS Repo reported EUR5.6 million of revenue with term-adjusted ADV up 36% to EUR397 billion.Continuing on trading on slide 15. The fourth quarter of 2022 saw a solid performance of Euronext FX in terms of both revenues and average daily volume  benefiting from the continued positive momentum with a high volatility and good traction of our matching engine in Singapore. Euronext reported average spot FX trading daily volumes of $20.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022  up 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.Spot FX trading revenue increased 9.5%  compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 at EUR6.7 million. Power trading reported EUR8.9 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022  a growth of 4.7% year-on-year driven by dynamic volumes increased foot print in Nord Pool in Central Europe  U.K.  Ireland and a continued robust performance in the Nordics.In the fourth quarter of 2022 average daily volume day ahead power traded was 2.98 terawatt hours  up 7.9% with respect to the same quarter last year  and average daily intraday power traded was at 0.13-terawatt hour. This is an increase of 9% year-on-year. I would like to highlight the intraday trading volumes in Central and Western Europe reached record level this quarter.Moving to slide 16. Revenues from our Post Trade activities excluding net treasury income decreased 2.5% to EUR88.6 million. Clearing revenue was down 3.9% this quarter to EUR29 million as a result of dynamic bond clearing activity  partially offsetting weaker cash and derivative clearing activity.As announced with the Q2 2022 results  Euronext Clearing engaged in a partial disposal of its investment portfolio. We dispose the portfolio maturing after the 1st of May 2023 and kept the rest until maturity. The runoff for this portfolio is currently ongoing and almost completed. As a consequence  our net treasury income is not yet at cruising speed and this quarter amounted to EUR4.3 million. In this respect  I would like to confirm our target for NTI 2023. In the first quarter of 2023  we expect to reach 10 basis point margin similarly from the margin we have reached in the fourth quarter of 2022. And from the second quarter this year and onwards we will reach our cruising speeds at 20 basis points.I wanted to make a brief comment as well on the upgrade of S&P. What I wanted to highlight is that the upgrade of rating is not only linked to an improvement of leverage  but as well a reduction of clearing risk and our rank anchor rating moved from BBB to BBB plus as S&P has removed the notch downgrade for clearing and settlement risk. This gives us a significantly more upside as far as rating is concerned.Continuing on settlement and other Post Trade revenue including the activity of Euronext Security  the revenues were EUR59.6 million this quarter  down 1.9% year-on-year. This reflect the resilient top line of Euronext Securities  thanks to its diversified geographical footprint in a stabilized environment. For settlement  over the fourth quarter of 2022  the value of assets under custody at Euronext Securities increased to EUR6.3 billion.I'm now moving to the next slide  slide 17  Advanced Data Services reached record revenues of EUR54.5 million this quarter  up 7.3% year-on-year  driven by strong traction of our core data businesses and good momentum of Advanced Data solution franchise including quant research and indices. Investor service revenues were up EUR2.6 million this quarter  up 13.2% reflecting continued commercial expansion of the business. Lastly  Technology Solutions revenue was up 1.8% compared to the same quarter last year to EUR26.9 million  reflecting the good performance of colocation activity following the migration of Euronext Core Data Centre  and this more than offset the lower revenues from hosting services.Moving to the next slide  I'm now on slide 19. I wanted to give some highlights on our 2023 cost guidance. In 2023 Euronext expects its underlying expenses excluding D&A to be around EUR630 million  compared to the annualized second half 2022 underlying expenses excluding D&A of around EUR620 million. The slight increase solidly relates to growth initiative to develop our non-volume related fund business.In other words  we expect that the cost base of Euronext to remain stable as cost savings and synergies will entirely compensate inflation and business development costs. I would like also to add that on the revenue side  we have performed a deep review of our pricing strategy across products to reflect inflation. And we will have the effect of this activity in 2023.I would like as well to do a few comments on integration costs. Stephane has already partially covered that. Following the termination of our derivative clearing agreement  we will post the provision this quarter of around EUR36 million covering termination and migration costs. For the sake of clarity  this does not change our target of integration cost  which is set at EUR150 million. In addition  I would like to confirm our previous guideline in terms of integration cost per quarter that for 2023 will range in between EUR10 million and EUR15 million depending on the quarter.Moving now to the next slide. This brings us to the EBITDA bridge. Euronext adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was down 12% to EUR187.9 million  mainly from lower volume environment partially as we discussed offset by non-volume related revenue growth and maintain cost discipline in an inflationary environment. Indeed despite the pressures of inflation and despite the deployment of our strategic plan cost remain contained this quarter  as Stephane mentioned earlier  we beat our revised 2022 cost target of EUR612 million  initially set at the beginning of the year at EUR622 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased as a consequence by 3.5 points  compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 to 54.1%.Moving to slide 21 for the bridge on net income. Adjusted net income this quarter was down 18.2% to EUR118.2 million  resulting from lower EBITDA  partially offset by the following elements. First lower D&A as in the first quarter of 2021 we had some write-offs as the one of the brand name of VP Securities  with as well lower net financing expenses mainly linked to the positive impact of higher interest rates  there are many moving parts in this number  but in summary  the positive impact of the interest rate on our interest income reported in the fourth quarter of 2022 is higher than the benefit from the interest rate swap we had in the fourth quarter of 2021 and it was terminated in 2022.And then I would like to highlight as well higher results from equity investment  representing the contribution of LCH SA and the dividend received from Euroclear. As a reminder  in last year Euroclear paid its dividend in Q1 and Q3. I would like to highlight that the non-underlying cost in this bridge are mainly represented by D&A and more specifically related to the PPA amortization of our acquisition.Lastly  tax for the fourth quarter of 2022 was EUR38.5 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 27.3% for the quarter. Reported net income was EUR99.3 million  and adjusted EPS basic was down 18% this quarter  EUR1.11 per share  compared to an adjusted EPS basic as well of EUR1.35 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. This reflects higher number of outstanding share of the quarter compared to last year.Moving to slide 22 for the cash flow generation and leverage. The net operating cash flow post tax amounted for a negative EUR147.1 million  compared to a positive EUR145.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This negative flow was impacted by a change in working capital related to Nord Pool CCP activities for EUR276 million.As we will see in the next slide  the balancing item of this negative cash flow is a reduction of the cash in transit for EUR297 million. Excluding the impact of on working capital from Nord Pool and Euronext Clearing  CCP activities net operating cash flow post tax accounted for 55.3% of EBITDA.Our net debt to EBITDA as reminded by Stephane was at 2.6 times in the fourth quarter of 2022  compared to 4.3 times in the third quarter of 2022  that was positively impacted by higher cash in transit as we just discussed included in the cash and cash equivalents. Excluding the EUR49 million non-underlying one-off loss on NTI  the net debt to last 12 months reported EBITDA was at 2.4 times in the fourth quarter of 2022.Moving on to the slide 23 for the evolution of our liquidity position over the quarter. As described on previous slide  you can see the impact of the short movement in working capital related to Nord Pool CCP activities in the net operating cash flow. As an illustration  our liquidity position remains strong  above EUR1.5 billion  including the undrawn revolving credit facility for EUR600 million  and excluding the cash currently in transit.As Stephane highlighted  while the integration of Borsa Italiana is on track  we can look for external growth opportunities  thanks to this strong liquidity position and improvement in our rating profile.And this completes my presentation  and now I give the floor back to Stephane.Stephane BoujnahThank you  Giorgio. As you have seen 2022 was a real pivotal year  we took advantage of our diversified business model  our business model which is much more diversified than many people think. We strengthened our core business with continuous leadership not only on listing and on trading  but also a very strong development in other businesses. We maintained our trademark cost discipline in an inflationary environment  which has affected everyone.And we have put the key projects of the Borsa Italiana Group integration on a very good track  hence our commitments in terms of synergy delivery for the years to come. So 2023  ‚Äò22 has demonstrated that Euronext has the recipe for success  for cash flow generation even in tough environments. Also 2022 paved the way for future growth in Euronext now 2023 will be a real transformational year.First  our cash trading market share is expected to remain greater or equal to 63% and our revenue capture for the cash equity trading business to remain above what we call to 0.52 bps in 2023 after the Borsa Italiana markets migration to Optiq.Second our continued cost discipline and achieved synergies will enable us to offset inflation. The slight increase in cost only results from costs related to non-volume related revenue growth initiatives and savings and synergies entirely compensate inflation and business development cost. So the superior track record of Euronext in post-merger integration will translate -- will continue to translate in a strong cost discipline.Third  as a result  we have great  our 2024 run rate synergy target to reach almost twice the level of the first announced synergies back to the time of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition announcement to what will be EUR115 million of run rate synergies by the end of ‚Äò24. ‚Äò23 will be pivotal  as I said  with the delivery of the key strategic projects that have been highlighted by Giorgio and I early on. And the continued cost optimization that will lead to EUR70 million of cumulated run rate synergies at the end of '23.And fourth  combined with our fast deleveraging  since the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group and as demonstrated by the BBB plus upgrade by S&P announced yesterday evening  we are now in the right position to look for possible external growth in the respect obviously of our strong investment criteria of return on capital employed above WACC after three or five years -- three years to five years.So thanks for your attention. We are now ready to take your questions together with Giorgio Modica  Anthony Attia  the Global Head of Primary Markets and Post Trade  and Simon  Head of Cash and Derivatives trading.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question from line  Kyle Voigt from KBW. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Kyle VoigtHi  good morning. Maybe a couple of questions from me. First question is just on pricing  some of your peers globally have spoken about taking larger pricing adjustment in 2023 given the inflationary backdrop  and I believe you mentioned that in your prepared remarks that you also took some inflationary adjustments. Just wondering how you viewed pricing in 2023 versus prior years. And in which lines we should really expect the most material pricing adjustments to come through?And then also just a question on the synergy realization slide in the deck and the timeline there. Obviously  some of the key dates are for the fourth quarter of 2023  so quite late in the year. So when we think about your 2023 underlying cost guidance  I'm just trying to get a sense of what level of actual realized cost synergies are embedded within that as that may help us think about the expense trajectory into 2024. And given those timing of synergies  is it possible that underlying costs may actually be down in 2024 versus 2023? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahThank you. So  Giorgio will answer your two questions  the first on pricing and the second one on the phasing of synergy delivery.Giorgio ModicaSo thank you very much for your questions. So with respect to pricing  I guess that the best way to describe what we were going to do is that mostly price are going to be increased in the non-trading activities. And the increase that we will have are around  I would say  mid-single-digit than some slightly more  some slightly less. But this gives you a sense of how much our non-volume related business will grow in terms of pricing.And if you consider that 60% of our business is non-volume related  this gives you a bit of an idea of what would be the price increase impact on our top line next year  excluding any other variables. So it's around mid-single-digit time 60%. Then on the line  this price increase we laid  I mean  I believe I indirectly answered saying that it's not really going to be the trading lines  but the other line. So this is for the first question.When it comes to the synergies  the way I can answer your question is the following. Let's start from the synergies that we have delivered run rate this quarter. So at the end of December 2022  we have reached EUR34 million of run rate synergies. What this means is that part of the synergies will hit the P&L in 2023. And this is going as well to contribute to making sure as I described that the key cost of the organization will remain flat from a P&L perspective.Then coming to the delivery of synergies next year  a few elements  there is going to be an important moment with the migration of Optiq in the first quarter  and this will have -- impact our P&L right after the migration. But then  you are correct  there are other cost and savings that are going to be delivered in the fourth quarter this year with the impact on the P&L of next year.So then  my last comment is that  this year we will deliver a combination of revenues and cost synergies. And as far as the revenue synergies  again  I already mentioned the Optiq integration  but we will have as well the launch of our clearing activities on equities.Kyle VoigtThank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line  Mike Werner from UBS. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Mike WernerThank you very much for the presentation and the explanations  all very  very helpful. Two questions from me please. In terms of the market share in cash equity trading  and we know you've adjusted your pricing schedule  I think it was in November  we saw an uptick in market shares into the year end. The data that I collect  which certainly is not perfect implies that market shares have trended lower in January and ultimately in the first couple of days of February. So I was wondering if you can confirm if that's what you're seeing.And then B  just wondering  is this -- is that price adjustment in November  kind of  your final take  is this something where we could see further adjustments ultimately to protect the market share as we look at over the next couple of months?And then on the second question  just thinking about deleveraging  and I think the debt to EBITDA was 2.6 times at the end of this year  very similar level at the end of 2021. I know there was a bunch of restructuring costs throughout the year. But as we look out to 2023 kind of given your guidance on restructuring costs  how should we think about the pace of deleveraging throughout ‚Äò23  assuming no M&A or no other factors involved? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo  Simon Gallagher will answer your first question on market share and yield and prices. And Giorgio Modica will answer your question on deleveraging pace and phasing.Simon GallagherThank you  Stephane. So to answer the first question on market share  so you're right  we implemented a first batch of measures on pricing and liquidity programs in November last year  which was successful  which resulted in a three-point uplift in market share over the quarter. And certainly since the start of the year  what we're seeing is that volumes are soft  there is a lack of real economy liquidity in the market  which has had a slightly downward influence on market share because regulated markets tend to have a higher proportion of real economy flow than the alternative trading venues. And so  that's what we see as the primary explanation for the first quarter.To answer your second question  the answer is resolutely  no. This is obviously not the end of the pricing measures we are taking  and the changes in liquidity we are making. There will be further adjustments to the flagship liquidity schemes in March  alongside as Stephane and Giorgio mentioned the pricing adjustments to the Italian market post migrations. These price changes and liquidity schemes will not be yield dilutive. They will be pushing our liquidity providers a bit more and adjusting the intricacies of the LP schemes. So this is not the end of the story. Obviously  this is a very dynamic and ongoing process.Mike WernerThank you very much.Giorgio ModicaYes  when it comes to the deleveraging profile  I can confirm a few elements. Now  I believe you are the target for dividends  so it's EUR236 million. And then the other element is that we confirm two-thirds cash flow conversion post tax from EBITDA. So with these two elements  I believe that now we have  I mean  we have guided with respect to the non-underlying costs are related to the termination of the agreement. Those are the key elements of the equation. So again to summarize  around 66% cash flow conversion post tax  and EUR236 million of dividends to be expected in 2023.Mike WernerThank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line  Haley Tam from Credit Suisse. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Haley TamGood morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Could I ask a couple about the revenue capture please in the equity market. So first of all  the Q4 revenue yield of 0.5 basis points was a step down from 0.53 in Q3? And if I've heard you correctly  you're saying that the supplemental liquidity provider scheme adjustments you've made are not yield dilutive. So I wonder if you could help us walk through that step down from 0.53 to 0.5  please just to understand the dynamics there?And then the second question  just to understand your assumptions for 2023  market share more than 63% to revenue capture 0.52 basis points. Are both of those numbers for after the Borsa Italiana migration or are they numbers that I should assume for the average through the year? And I do know that 63% is less than the 65% market share you had in Q4. So I just wondered if you could comment on that? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahOkay  so Simon Gallagher will answer your two questions on the revenue capture and on the phasing of the market share evolutions.Simon GallagherThank you  Stephane. So I'll break down very precisely the variance in yield from 0.53 to 0.5. In the numbers are included a small number of non-equity items  so it's the Warrants and Certificates and ETFs notably. So if we break down the 0.03  0.01 of that was due to non-equity items this variance in volumes in non-equity businesses  which are ETFs and the Warrants and Certificates. So that leaves 0.02 basis points imputable to cash equity yield. Two-thirds of this 0.02 was due to changes in the order sizes.And so  how does this impact the 0.02? When markets tend to be a bit less  there's less volatility in the markets  order sizes as we've seen recently  order sizes tend to go up a little bit  which means there is less arbitrage opportunities from the electronic liquidity providers  which means order sizes go up in the market. And this interacts with certain features of our fee grid where we have fixed euro fees per executed order.And so this is two-thirds of that 0.02 is imputable to order sizes. One-third of the 0.02 can be imputable to other features of the fee grid  including partially to the SLP changes we made in the supplemental liquidity scheme. So if you break down -- if you break it down that way  the changes we make to the SLP scheme are largely immaterial in terms of impacts on yield. And there will be further yield accretive changes to the SLP scheme from the second quarter onwards.With respect to the second question  the market share number  I think can be seen as an average over the year as a base. And the yield  the revenue traction number is a -- and the market share is obviously a floor we see and is the minimum we are targeting. And the yield extraction number is post -- is the run rate post the Italy migration.Haley TamThank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Bruce HamiltonHi  good morning  and thanks very much for the presentation and Q&A. I guess firstly just going back to the synergies  obviously encouraging that you've increased those. But could you break out the EUR115 million between revenues and costs? And just going back to the earlier question  given the consensus assumes  I think a reduction in absolute costs in 2024  is that kind of consistent with the way you're thinking about the cost synergies?And then secondly on M&A and balance sheet flexibility. In terms of your sort of EUR1.5 billion of capacity  I can see on slide 23 you've laid out  how you get there. But what's the sort of net debt EBITDA that you would be comfortable going up to temporarily to do a deal? And then just an update on what the -- what you'd view your current WACC as  as well would be helpful. Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo Giorgio will answer your question on the synergies delivery on cost and on the balance sheet and debt capabilities.Giorgio ModicaSo let's start with the first one. I would like to highlight that the increase from EUR100 million to EUR115 million is mainly related to a better visibility on the opportunities on clearing. So this is the first element  then when it comes to the breakdown between cost and revenue  I will try to do my best  but there is a complexity is that  as we said from the beginning  the EUR115 million is an improvement of EBITDA  that includes sometimes project involving more revenue and more cost. So the best breakdown I can provide you with is the following.Let's start from the original target  the EUR60 million. The EUR60 million were broken down as follows  EUR45 million of cost savings and EUR15 million of revenue uplift. Now this EUR15 million revenue uplift  the significant portion of the EUR15 million is linked to the migration of Optiq. Part of which were going and the most relevant part were going to execute in 45 days. And this is clearly pure revenue synergies. Then the other buckets are around EUR10 million EBITDA coming from the migration to the center. And this is already embedded in our number  but involves more revenues  but as well more cost.And then the remainder that was originally accessed to be EUR30 million and now it's increased to EUR45 million is the clearing opportunity. And you will -- and then there are many moving parts because we'll clearly have more revenues  but as well we will need to upgrade and as we are doing the platform of Euronext Clearing. But on the other side  we will not have any more the costs that today we are paying to LCH SA  which are currently captured in our P&L. So this is the breakdown. Unfortunately  I cannot further break down the different project in between cost and revenues. So this is -- this I believe covers your first question.When it comes to the underlying cost of capital  I believe that Euronext is in line what we see as an average of analyst  and again  as I always stress  those are a point in time  so what I can say is that  I don't see a major deviation from what you analysts are taking as an average as our own cost of capital. And when it comes to the max leverage  what I would say is the following. And again  this is very tricky question  because it depends very much on the target you acquire that give -- would give us additional leverage.But as we commented in the past  we believe that in terms of pure debt capacity  we would have a capacity in the range between EUR1.5 billion and EUR2 billion. This is roughly speaking the standalone capabilities we would have to finance and impute that acquisition. And again  I would like to highlight that as you very well know rating and leverage consideration are very much target specific.Bruce HamiltonGreat  very helpful. Thank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line Enrico Bolzoni from JP Morgan. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Enrico BolzoniHi  thank you. Good morning. Sorry to go back once again to market share  just a clarification. I would like to understand the market share you are guiding is something that in case you should not be on track to achieve; you would implement some changes in pricing or something else to make sure that you hit it or it's rather you simply saying that in light of your proposition your pricing in your relationship with customer you will naturally achieve? So this is my first question.And then a more general one  possibly related to that. Can you just give any comment in terms of what you're seeing in terms of volume migrating to dark pools  because it seems like these are increasing. And also interestingly the average order size are going down  while historically they have been higher in dark pools. So I was just curious to hear from you on this subject.And then finally  I mean  a number of your peers in Europe and also outside of Europe are increasingly doing partnership with technology providers. So I was just curious to hear your thoughts here. Is this something that you consider as well or you have more -- you think you have internal capabilities to develop all the technology infrastructure that you need to support your growth? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo I will answer your third question on the relationship with the providers of data services and data storage. And Simon Gallagher will answer your question about the market share dynamics and the dark pool development. We have made the deliberate decision to internalize within Euronext and to locate within Europe the businesses that are the most critical ones to our strategy and the operations that are the most sensitive ones to our operational leverage and operational performance. That has led to migrate our Core Data Centre that used to be in Basildon to new -- brand new data center  100% powered by green energy in Bergamo near Milan.We do believe that core data processing  core software  core systems  core data storage  core applications must be located within the European Union and must be managed by Europeans. We do use for historical data storage one of those technology provider that has facilities located in the Republic of Ireland. We do not intend to have critical applications  critical software  critical matching engine related platforms located outside the European Union  nor being managed outside the Group. So this is a deliberate choice we have done  which is consistent with our strategy.Others have done different choices in a different environment with different sharing of value with partners  with different profile of future dependency on third party providers. We have not taken the choice  we have taken the choice to internalize that and that was not done at the compromise of anything in terms of financial performance as you have seen it over the past few years.Over to you  Simon  on the market share and volumes.Simon GallagherThank you  Stephane. So to answer the first question on the two numbers of 63% and 0.52. So this is obviously an equilibrium between these two numbers. And the aim of this equilibrium is to maximize euro revenue extraction from the franchise. We believe that these two numbers represent the optimal trade-off for this year  obviously there is some room  wiggle room around these numbers. But the primary aim here is to maintain our role and our ability to price full value within the franchise across the various pricing segments.I just want to make one point. So beyond the explicit fees of 0.52  what is behind a lot of this is the management of implicit costs for investors  which is the quality of execution on our market. And this has to do with the mark out  the liquidity of our markets  which is by all published papers vastly superior to the alternative market. So this explicit yield number is only a part of the story. And I'd even say sort of a minority part of the story. The bigger picture behind here is the design of our liquidity schemes and the partnerships we form with our partners in the electronic trading community.The second point about dark pools  there's been some small increase in these pools. I'd say two things  dark pools  if you look at the numbers remained very small features still of the European execution landscape. These are low-single-digit -- sorry  below 10% in terms of volumes and is constrained by regulation  right. So we have the 8% cap and the 4% cap on reference price trading venues.And the second thing  if you look at the revenue models of these pools  they actually charge less than that we do in the lead markets. Third point with respect to dark pools we are observing with great interest the movements in the regulatory landscape  and we will be very active in this space. And depending what's happened -- what happens there  there will be potential business opportunities for Euronext as well in the stock trading space. So I think that's what we can say there.Enrico BolzoniThank you very much.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line Ian White from Autonomous Research. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Ian WhiteHi  thanks for taking my questions. Just a few follow-ups from my side please. Can you just clarify a little bit  your appetite for M&A at this stage  from the discussion so far  I'm sort of taking away that you'd be happy to consider a transformational deal at this stage  even while the Borsa Italiana integration is still ongoing. Is that a fair reflection of your appetite for M&A please?Second question  just any revised thoughts at all around the medium-term financial guidance that you've given for out to FY ‚Äò24. And finally  just maybe a clarification please on the outlook for NII. I think you talked about getting to cruising speed 20 bps yield  but how have collateral balances trended there over the last sort of few months and what's the outlook there please? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo I will answer your first question on the M&A framework and Giorgio will answer the two other questions on financial guidance. The M&A objectives or the M&A framework remains the same. We want to continue the growth of the Euronext project in two directions. The first one is to remain open to single country or several country exchanges in Europe  who consider being part of a scalable project and who might be interested in joining the largest single liquidity pool in Europe and the largest single order book and the most powerful technology platform. So anything that would make Euronext more relevant for some European market infrastructure is clearly something that we will consider.The other avenue is always to pursue the diversification of our of our top line. The diversification of our revenue mix  because this call is very interesting. There are many questions on market share and yield of the business that represents 20% of our top line today. It's important  I appreciate that. But you may have noticed that over the past few years  we have done a significant effort to diversify in Post Trade  to diversify in other asset classes like energy  like ForEx  like in other services like corporate services in technology et cetera.So we -- the objective Post Trade by any M&A move will be diversification of our top line. And the other objective would be to accelerate growth to capture businesses that have a growth profile that can accelerate the growth profile of the combined entity. So we explore and we analyze all sort of situations. And clearly the fact that our deleveraging has increased  and that the rating has been improved yesterday evening to BBB plus.The fact that the synergies in Italy are in the very good track  hence the upgrade targeted -- that really target that we have shared with you  it gives us more confidence that we need to explore these opportunities again. But nothing very new or fundamental  just an improvement of the surrounding consensus around the same strategy. We'd always  always the same very rigorous framework that we want to deploy the capital of our shareholders in acquisitions that generate a return on capital employed above the WACC of the company between year three and five after synergies. So that's the M&A framework.Over to you  Giorgio on the mid-term financial profile and end of ‚Äò24 guidance.Giorgio ModicaAbsolutely. Let me start with the net treasury income. I will give you a few more details so that you can have a better view. So the first element  I wanted to highlight is that  with respect to when we discussed the last time around the average collateral has actually increased  what we have seen are level at around the EUR22 billion.And in the fourth quarter of last year  these EUR4.3 million that we have posted as NTI represent around zero point -- around 7 basis points. So slightly below the 10 we guided. And this is the result of the fact that interest rates increase more than anticipated. And as you know  during the fourth quarter we still had an important point of fixed income portfolio in run off  but then in terms of euro million this is very  very marginal.If we now move to the first quarter this year  what we will have in terms of P&L is going to be a revenue capture  which is going to be closer to the 10 bps I guided. And we might have in euro million a result  which is in between EUR5 million and EUR6 million. Then after that we will see  collateral should remain in the EUR20 billion type of a range  slightly more  slightly less. And the cruising speed in terms of NTI should be 20 basis points. Then this is as granular as I can be  if you have follow up question  happy to take them.When it comes to the target of 2024  the only one I can put  we will not change the target is that within our current target of EBITDA growth  given the environment we see room for having slightly more revenues for an environment where we will have slightly more cost. So this is more or less the trend  so 5% to 6% EBITDA CAGR remains unchanged  maybe depending on how the next two years will evolve  we might be in a situation where revenue growth is going to be higher and cost marginally higher.Ian WhiteGot it. That's helpful. Thank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line Johannes Thormann from HSBC. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Johannes ThormannGood morning  everybody. And some follow-up questions please. First of all on the clearing business again. First of all  why have you delay in the margin improvement from 10 bps to 20 bps? I'm still lacking to understand  and will it be really fixed end of this quarter  or will we probably get next call the message again  we have another quarter running in 10 bps. What is driving this because investors here this is probably  anyway so it's just the worst time of the market?And secondly  on your clearing initiative in general  especially for the cash clearing  what incentives are you giving to the customers to move your business to Euronext Clearing away from LCH  because as I understand in cash clearing the customer has major part of the choice?And last but not least on the cash trading market share  historically you were about 70%  now you seem to be satisfied with 63%  which is also the revenue opportunity for the clearing business. So you're reducing your own revenue opportunity. What is driving your assumption to be satisfied with 63%? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahOkay. So Giorgio will answer your -- the first part of your questions. And Anthony Attia  who is the Head of Post Trade operations will answer your questions on the incentives  the pricing of our operation -- clearing operations and our market share in equity  cash equity clearing.Giorgio ModicaSo  I would like to clarify one element  you seem to highlight the level of surprise  but in July 2022  we expressed a very clear guideline saying that  we would have had 20 basis point in the third quarter  then 10 basis point in the fourth and in the first quarter and then back again 20 basis point. And the result  so -- and we guided for around EUR20 billion level of collateral  which means implicitly that we guided for EUR10 million in the third quarter and EUR5 million in the fourth quarter. The actual result were EUR11 million in the third quarter and EUR4 million in the fourth quarter  which is  I would say  exactly identical to what we have guided in July 2022.So what is happening? And why did we get zero point -- sorry 7 basis point and not 10 basis point  simply that  when you have a small portion of your portfolio  which is fixed income  it means that the rate on the asset side will not change  whereas on the liability side where 100% of our ability are benchmarked to ECB rates  then you pay more. And this has a slightly dilutive impact on the level of NTI.Finally  on your question  is really true that we are going to have 20 basis point in the second quarter? And then  my answer is  yes. As a simple fact that in -- as I said  from the 1st of May 2023  we'll no longer hold any fixed income portfolio and for all of our assets and all our liabilities are going to be at variable rate. And therefore  we will make the spread between the interest we collect and interest we give back to clients. I hope this clarifies.Anthony AttiaGood morning. This is Anthony Attia. Thank you for your question. Let me detail for you the value proposition of our clearing internalization initiatives. They are five main points that I want to share with you. So first of all  we will offer the clearing services for cash equity for all our Euronext market excluding Oslo  but including Italy. So in the same default fund  on the same risk framework and the value-add risk model  we will be able to clear all our cash equity trade. This generate efficiencies on margin and default contribution to the client compared to the current fragmented situation.Second  we will be operating from a state-of-the-art clearing platform that we are currently developing with one connection for all the market. And the use of the extremely efficient set of technologies.Third part  we are working on offering competing clearing fees. There‚Äôs no need to get into the rest of the [Technical Difficulty] on from a clearing fee point of view. But it's the combination of these different factors that create this attractive value proposition.And last  thanks to our Post Trade investment on Euronext Securities  our CSDs  in particular in Milan  we will be able to offer extremely competitive settlement fees. And so the engagement we have with the clearing members presently show that we are in a very  very good position to succeed in the migration at the end of 2023. Thank you.Johannes ThormannThank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the last question from line Greg Simpson from BNP Paribas. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Greg SimpsonHi  good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in at the end. Maybe a follow-up on clearing  can you just talk about what the current market share of that LCH SA has in your cash markets? What are your expectations for when your next clearing goes live in Q4. And then you have fewer CCP in the background. So just interested in any thoughts on competition?And then a second question would be on  on the mid-single-digit price increases in the non-volume areas  can you share if there's any user feedback on this? Do customers generally just accept the price increases as they're essential or is there any signs that you just might try to say optimize the subscriptions  our market data for example. Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo  Giorgio on pricing  and Anthony on the competition on clearing.Anthony AttiaSo on clearing  so we do not comment market share element of LCH SA or the Euroclear Europe  you can direct your questions to them. Nevertheless the setup that will be out at the end of the year is complete for CCP setup  which means that by default the trade done on Euronext Optiq platform will be routed towards Euronext Clearing and if the buyer and the seller select another CCP then the trade will be relative to these other CCP. So far this preferred CCP model creates an incentive for the year  for the CCP of choice to clear the bulk of the trade  because it provide efficiencies the way I commented before.Giorgio ModicaThen when it comes to your question with respect to price increase  it's actually a complicated question  but let me try to answer. So in general terms  clients are not necessarily happy of price increases. However  it is important to highlight that the general environment is -- in this general environment price increase are very common  everyone is increasing prices and therefore as well clients are accustomed to increase their own prices to their clients and receive a request for price increasing inflationary environment. So this is the first element.And we have not received any sign where our price increase were considered to be excessive. And clearly  we have deeply assessed that  making sure that price increase were commensurate to the quality of the service we provide. So this is the first element. Then you seem to refer more specifically to market data. And on that specific angle  what I can tell you is that  if you look  for example  at our -- if you look for example at our results in the fourth quarter  you see that the 7%  a part of that 7% is related to an increase of users.It's related to an increase of streams  which is quite surprisingly in an industry where usually there is attrition in terms of clients and number of terminals. And this reflect the new way of a mix way of working  flat -- part from home and part in the office where sharing screen and terminal becomes more complicated. So to make a long story short  we did pass the price increase that was generally well accepted by clients.Stephane BoujnahSo thank you everyone. As two words of conclusion now  I want to highlight really in my -- what is my view is that -- are the key takeaways of where we are today. We deliver diversification  our revenues are more diversified than they have ever been  and we will continue to deliver diversification. We deliver cost discipline in environment  which is quite complicated with inflationary pressure and we will continue to deliver cost discipline. We deliver post-merger integration for real with major projects already delivered in relation to the acquisition of Borsa Italiana  and new ones will be delivered including within a few weeks‚Äô time with the Optiq migration in Italy.And we will therefore there continue to deliver revenue synergies and other post-merger integration projects. We have delivered deleveraging and we will continue to deliver deleveraging as demonstrated by the BBB plus upgrade announced yesterday by S&P. So we are extremely confident that this strong diversified cost discipline operating leverage focused company with great assets to expand the top line through the extraction of revenue synergies will continue to be extremely positioned to capture opportunities in ‚Äò23.Thank you very much.

Since the invasion of Ukraine  Generalfinance has suspended credit facilities related to assigned debtors operating in countries directly affected by the conflict.Equity as of December 31  2022 stood at EUR56.8 million  compared to EUR32.0 million as of December 31  2021.The change in equity is mainly determined by the capital increase carried out in the context of the IPO for about EUR20.2 million  the company explains in a note  after deducting the costs directly attributable to the transaction passed through equity  net of the related tax effect as well as the allocation of the profit for 2021 to reserves.Massimo Gianolli  chief executive officer of Generalfinance  said  ""The year 2022 was a key year in the life of our company; we completed  in agreement with our shareholder Cr√©dit Agricole Italia  the listing of Generalfinance's shares on Euronext Milan  Euronext STAR Milan Segment  a strategic operation for us  as it allowed us to raise EUR20 million in new capital.""""We subsequently approved a new three-year Business Plan  with which we intend to grow further within our core business  the financing of distressed businesses through the divestment of working capital. From a business point of view  in the year we recorded strong growth in the flow of disbursements  amounting to EUR1.67 billion up 50 percent on 2021  with revenues up 29 percent; this confirms the steady growth trend.""As for the future  the company expects ""further growth in results compared to those achieved in 2022 and in line with the objectives defined in the recent Strategic Plan.""General Finance on Friday closed 0.3 percent in the red at EUR7.18 per share.By Chiara Bruschi  Alliance News reporterComments and questions to redazione@alliancenews.comCopyright 2023 Alliance News IS Italian Service Ltd.

The IPO will support the Company's continued expansion and consolidate its position as a global leader in the electric vehicle market.

Companies like EuroGroup Laminations are in our view at the heart of driving the transition to a low-carbon economy and the success of the IPO illustrates the increasing demand from institutional investors for opportunities such as these."" Following the IPO  Tikehau Capital's vehicles will jointly retain an 8.5% stake (before over- allotment option) in EuroGroup Laminations to continue to support the company's development and growth. Jean-Marc Gales  Tikehau Capital Operating Partner  and Roberto Quagliuolo will continue to serve as Board members of the Company.

Benefits from expense savings  growth initiatives  an improvement in claims experience  and strengthening of the US dollar are partly offset by lower fees due to adverse markets and outflows. Full year 2022 operating result of EUR 1.9 billion  stable compared with the previous yearThe capital ratios of all three main units remain above their respective operating levels. Group Solvency II ratio amounts to 208%Cash Capital at Holding increases from EUR 1.4 billion to EUR 1.6 billion  mainly from EUR 318 million of free cash flow in 4Q22. Full year free cash flow increases from EUR 729 million in 2021 to EUR 780 million in 2022Proposed final 2022 dividend of EUR 0.12 per common share to be paid in cash  which brings the full year dividend to EUR 0.23 per common shareAnnouncing new EUR 200 million share buyback to be executed in 1H23  barring unforeseen circumstancesStatement of Lard Friese  CEO‚ÄúThe fourth quarter closes out a year in which we accelerated our transformation and the execution of our strategy. During the quarter  we announced the transaction to combine our Dutch businesses with a.s.r.  a historic milestone for the company. Throughout the year we also made significant progress in improving our operating performance  and in further strengthening our balance sheet despite challenging market circumstances.Our net result for the fourth quarter reflects the previously announced impairment loss as a result of classifying Aegon the Netherlands as held for sale. The operating result increased by 4%  as improved claims experience  the benefit from our operational improvement program and strengthening of the US dollar more than offset adverse market conditions. The operational improvement program contributed EUR 627 million to our operating result over the course of 2022  exceeding our EUR 550 million target one year earlier than expected. Given the overall success of the program  and in light of upcoming changes due to the transaction with a.s.r.  we have decided to close out the reporting on the operational improvement program. We will provide an update to our strategy  including plans to further improve the efficiency of our operations and to accelerate commercial momentum at our Capital Markets Day in June 2023.This year‚Äôs commercial results underscore the importance of offering customers a broad range of products. As a result of the uncertain macroeconomic environment  we saw outflows in Asset Management and in the UK Retail channel. In Workplace Solutions in the US we experienced net outflows as a consequence of the departure of one large customer. At the same time  life insurance sales grew in our growth markets and in the US  where Individual Solutions achieved the highest level of quarterly new life sales in the last five years. During 2022  the Workplace channel in the UK recorded the highest level of net deposits in the past four years  demonstrating the improvements we are making to our UK franchise. In the fourth quarter  we introduced the first phase of More Ways to Save in the UK  a new savings proposition with enhanced online services. In the US  Transamerica launched a new indexed universal life product specifically designed for the brokerage channel  complementing our current product that is successfully marketed by World Financial Group‚Äôs more than 62 000 agents. Supported by the commitment of our employees across the company  we will continue to introduce new products  improve the digital experience for our customers  and further build on our distribution strengths.Story continuesAs a result of the progress we have made  both strategically and financially  we will propose a final dividend for 2022 of 12 eurocents per common share at our Annual General Meeting  bringing the full year dividend to 23 eurocents per common share. Furthermore  we are announcing a new EUR 200 million share buyback program for the first half of 2023  which underscores our disciplined capital management and commitment to returning surplus capital to our shareholders.Looking ahead  we remain fully focused on executing our strategy and meeting our financial objectives. The actions we have taken so far provide us with confidence that we can deliver at least EUR 1.0 billion operating capital generation from our units outside of the Netherlands in 2023  barring unforeseen circumstances. We have generated EUR 1.5 billion of free cash flow during the past two years  achieving the three year target we set at the 2020 Capital Markets Day. For 2023  we aim to deliver around EUR 600 million free cash flow and are targeting an increase in our dividend to around 30 eurocents per common share  a reflection of our confidence in our strategy for the group.‚ÄùMedia relations Investor relations Conference call including Q&A (9:00 a.m. CET) Dick Schiethart Jan Willem Weidema Audio webcast on aegon.com +31 (0) 6 22 88 99 25gcc@aegon.com+31 (0) 70 344 8028ir@aegon.comUnited States: +1 864 991 41 03 (local)United Kingdom: +44 808 175 15 36 (toll free)The Netherlands: +31 800 745 83 77 (toll free) Passcode: you will receive a personal pin upon registrationAdditional informationPresentationThe conference call presentation is available on aegon.com as of 7.00 a.m. CET.SupplementsAegon‚Äôs 4Q 2022 Financial Supplement and other supplementary documents are available on aegon.com.Conference call including Q&AThe conference call starts at 9:00 am CET  with an audio webcast on aegon.com.

More information can be found at aegon.com.Cautionary note regarding non-EU-IFRS measuresThis document includes the following non-EU-IFRS financial measures: operating result  income tax  result before tax  market consistent value of new business  return on equity and addressable expenses. These non-EU-IFRS measures  except for addressable expenses  are calculated by consolidating on a proportionate basis Aegon‚Äôs joint ventures and associated companies. The reconciliation of these measures  except for market consistent value of new business and return on equity  to the most comparable EU-IFRS measure is provided in the notes to this press release. Market consistent value of new business is not based on EU-IFRS  which are used to report Aegon‚Äôs primary financial statements and should not be viewed as a substitute for EU-IFRS financial measures. Aegon may define and calculate market consistent value of new business differently than other companies. Return on equity is a ratio using a non-EU-IFRS measure and is calculated by dividing the operating result after tax less cost of leverage by the average shareholders‚Äô equity excluding the revaluation reserve. Operating expenses are all expenses associated with selling and administrative activities (excluding commissions) after reallocation of claim handling expenses to benefits paid. This includes certain expenses recorded in other charges  including restructuring charges. Addressable expenses are expenses reflected in the operating result  excluding deferrable acquisition expenses  expenses in joint ventures and associates and expenses related to operations in CEE countries. Aegon believes that these non-EU-IFRS measures  together with the EU-IFRS information  provide meaningful supplemental information about the operating results of Aegon‚Äôs business including insight into the financial measures that senior management uses in managing the business.Local currencies and constant currency exchange ratesThis document contains certain information about Aegon‚Äôs results  financial condition and revenue generating investments presented in USD for the Americas and in GBP for the United Kingdom  because those businesses operate and are managed primarily in those currencies. Certain comparative information presented on a constant currency basis eliminates the effects of changes in currency exchange rates. None of this information is a substitute for or superior to financial information about Aegon presented in EUR  which is the currency of Aegon‚Äôs primary financial statements.Forward-looking statementsThe statements contained in this document that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

S√©bastien Ladet  Chief Executive Officer of Affluent Medical  said: ""Affluent Medical enters 2023 with a clear roadmap and strong ambitions. We are on track  backed by a strong and experienced management team  to take the next clinical steps to bring our three innovative medical devices to market. This capital increase is an essential milestone in accelerating the progress of current studies and targeting CE markings for Artus and KaliosTM by the end of 2024  followed by their commercial launch in 2025. Every day  millions of patients around the world suffer from mitral insufficiency and urinary incontinence  severe and disabling conditions  without truly effective and lasting treatment to date. Our primary objective remains to be able to offer these millions of patients a long-term therapeutic solution to restore a quality of life significantly affected by these diseases."" The proceeds of the Capital Increase are intended to provide the Company with some of the resources necessary to continue financing its requirements over the 12 months following the approval of the Prospectus relating to the ABSAR issue. However  the Company will continue to face the critical challenge of its 12 months financing  the maximum residual uncovered need is estimated at 5.0 million euros. The net proceeds will be used to finance the clinical development of Affluent Medical's various medical devices and will be used to: finalize the recruitment of patients in the Optimise II clinical study and the preparation of the industrialization of the Kalios TM medical device for mitral valve repair;finalize the validations of the Artus medical device for the treatment of moderate to severe urinary incontinence and the start of the Dry pilot study;start the recruitment of patients for the Minerva pilot study of the Epygon medical device for mitral valve replacement by transcatheter and the development of associated accessories;repay the Group's financial debts (Bpifrance innovation loan  Bpifrance repayable advances for the Minerva project and various state-guaranteed loans). In the event that the Capital Increase is only subscribed for 91 07% (i.e. estimated net income of ‚Ç¨11.845 million)  the funds raised would be allocated mainly to the finalization of the KaliosTM clinical study  the start-up of the Epygon and Artus pilot studies  and the repayment of the Group's financial debts. The development of accessories for Epygon and the industrialization of medical devices Epygon and Artus would be postponed. Main terms and conditions of the Capital Increase The purpose of this public offering is to issue new shares  each with one (1) redeemable share subscription warrant (the ""BSARs"" and  together with the new shares  the ""ABSARs"")  to be subscribed in cash  as part of a capital increase with preferential subscription rights maintained by shareholders  a gross amount of ‚Ç¨13.0 million per issue of 9 634 022 BSARs  likely to be increased to a maximum of ‚Ç¨14.3 million per issue of 10 597 424 ABSARs in the event of full exercise of the extension clause  at the unit price of ‚Ç¨1.35 per ABSAR at the rate of 13 ABSAR for 28 existing shares. BSARs may be exercised at any time until December 31  2025 (inclusive). 8 BSARs shall give the right to subscribe for one (1) new share (the ""Exercise Parity"")  subject to payment of an exercise price of: ‚Ç¨1.50 between March 6  2023 and December 5  2023; then‚Ç¨1.95 between December 6  2023 and December 31  2025. In addition  the Company may  at its sole discretion  carry out  at any time  from the issue of the BSAR until the end of their exercise period on December 31  2025  the early redemption of all of the BSARs remaining in circulation at the unit price of ‚Ç¨0.01; however  such early redemption will only be possible if the volume-weighted average of Affluent Medical shares over the 10 trading days preceding the date of publication of the early redemption notice multiplied by the Exercise Parity in force exceeds 140% of the exercise price of the BSARs on that date. In the event that the Company implements the redemption of the BSARs at a price of ‚Ç¨0.01  BSAR holders may avoid such redemption by exercising their BSARs on the basis of the exercise price set on this date per new share before the date fixed for redemption and thus benefit economically from the exercise of the BSARs. In the event that all of the BSARs are exercised for the respective exercise prices of ‚Ç¨1.50 and ‚Ç¨1.95 per new share  the gross amount of the capital increase would reach ‚Ç¨14 8 million and ‚Ç¨16.3 million respectively  likely to be increased to the maximum amounts of ‚Ç¨15.4 million and ‚Ç¨16.9 million in the event of full exercise of the extension clause in connection with the issue of the ABSARs. Each shareholder of the Company will receive one (1) preferential subscription right per share recorded in his/her securities account at the end of the accounting day of February 9  2023. Each shareholder of Affluent Medical may subscribe for 13 ABSARs on an irreducible basis for 28 existing shares held  i.e. 28 PSRs shall entitle each shareholder to subscribe to 13 ABSARs at a price of ‚Ç¨1.35 per ABSAR. At the same time as they deposit their irreducible subscriptions  the holders of PSRs may subscribe on a reducible basis for the number of ABSARs they wish to acquire  in addition to the number of ABSARs resulting from the exercise of their preferential PSRs on an irreducible basis. Any ABSARs not subscribed on an irreducible basis shall be distributed and allocated to the subscribers on a reducible basis. Reducible subscription orders will be served within the limit of their requests and in proportion to the number of existing shares whose rights will have been used in support of their subscription on an irreducible basis. In addition to the possibility of subscribing on an irreducible and reducible basis according to the terms and conditions specified above  any natural or legal person  whether or not they hold preferential subscription rights  may subscribe to this Capital Increase free of charge. Persons wishing to subscribe freely must send their request to their authorized financial intermediary at any time during the subscription period and pay the corresponding subscription price. In accordance with the provisions of Article L. 225-134 of the French Commercial Code  free subscriptions shall only be taken into account if the irreducible and reducible subscriptions have not absorbed the entire Offering  it being specified that the Board of Directors shall have the right to freely distribute the ABSARs not subscribed  in whole or in part  among the persons (shareholders or third parties) of its choice having made requests for subscriptions on a free basis. Based on the closing price of the Affluent Medical share on 7 February 2023  i.e. ‚Ç¨1.642: the subscription price of the ABSARs of ‚Ç¨1.35 per ABSAR shows a nominal discount of 17.78% to the market price and a discount of 12.33% to the theoretical value of the ex-right share (‚Ç¨1.539) the theoretical value of a New Share (‚Ç¨1.32)  excluding the theoretical value of the BSAR attached to the New Share (‚Ç¨0.03)  represents a nominal discount of 19.63% to the share price and a discount of 14.29% to the theoretical value of the ex-right share (‚Ç¨1.539);the theoretical value of the ex-right share (‚Ç¨1.539)  shows a discount of 6.22% compared to the share price;the theoretical value of the preferential subscription right is ‚Ç¨0.102. Preferential subscription rights will be traded on Euronext Paris from February 10  2023 to February 23  2023  inclusive  under ISIN code FR001400FL20. The subscription period will be open from February 14  2023 to February 27  2023  inclusive  according to the indicative timetable. New shares and BSARs will be admitted to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris on March 6  2023. The new shares will be admitted on the same quotation line as existing shares under the ISIN code: FR0013333077  and BSARs will be admitted to a separate quotation line under the ISIN code: FR001400FL38.

Mr. Christophe Giot  VP Clinical Operations  who does not hold any Affluent Medical shares as of the date of the Prospectus  has committed to participate in the Offer up to 15 000 euros. In addition  10 investors (the ""Investors"") have irrevocably undertaken  within the framework of free subscriptions  to subscribe  for a total amount of ‚Ç¨2 060 000  for the ABSARs which would not have been subscribed for at the end of the irreducible  reducible or free subscription period  in order to carry out the Capital Increase with 100% DPS  i.e. the issuance of 9 634 022 ABSARs  corresponding to an Offer of approximately ‚Ç¨13.0 million.

Lock-up commitments of the Company From the date of the Prospectus and until 180 calendar days following the date of settlement-delivery of the ABSARs  subject to certain exceptions and until December 31  2023  the Company has undertaken not to issue shares or securities giving access to the capital in the context of financing through Equity Line or OCABSA. Lock-up retention and non-exercise commitments Truffle Capital has undertaken to retain  subject to certain usual exceptions  the Affluent Medical shares that it holds prior to the Capital Increase for a period ending 270 calendar days following the settlement date of the Capital Increase and the Affluent Medical ABSARs that may be subscribed in connection with the transaction for a period ending 180 calendar days following the settlement date of the Capital Increase. Capital Increase Partners Financial Advisor of the Company Lead Arranger and Bookrunner Legal counsel Auditor Auditor Financial communication consulting Corporate communication consulting Information available to the public The terms of the Capital Increase with the maintenance of shareholders' preferential subscription rights are described in the prospectus approved by the Autorit√© des March√©s Financiers (""AMF"") under number 23-029 dated February 8  2023 (the ""Prospectus""). This Prospectus is composed of Affluent Medical's 2021 Universal Registration Document approved by the AMF on April 29  2022 under number R.22-017 (the ""2021 Universal Registration Document"")  the amendment to the 2021 universal registration document approved by the AMF on February 8  2023 under the number 23-003 (the ""Amendment"")  and the offering notice (including the summary of the prospectus) relating to the Capital Increase. The Company draws the public's attention to the risk factors set out in section 2 of the offering notice and in sections 3 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document and the Amendment  including liquidity risk  which states that Afffluent Medical does not have sufficient net working capital to meet its obligations and operating cash requirements over the next twelve months  as its cash to date enables it to finance its operations until March 2023. Thus  including in the event of completion of the Capital Increase with PSR  the 12-month working capital will continue to be insufficient to meet the Group's obligations and operating cash requirements. Statement on net working capital at 12 months As of the approval date of the Prospectus  the Group does not have sufficient net working capital to meet its obligations and cash requirements over the next 12 months. The Group's cash position as of the date of approval of the Prospectus allows it to finance its activities until March 2023. After deducting the Company's current resources and before taking into account the proceeds of the issue  the net unfunded amount necessary for the continuation of the Group's activities over the 12 months following the date of approval of the Prospectus  according to the Group's current development plan  is estimated at ‚Ç¨16.2 million. It consists of (i) a financing need to ensure the continuity of operations and expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on KaliosTM  Artus and Epygon for ‚Ç¨19.4 million  and (ii) repayments of the Bpifrance innovation loan  Bpifrance repayable advances concerning the Mivana project  and the various loans guaranteed by the State for ‚Ç¨1.4 million  and (iii) investments of ‚Ç¨0.5 million. After taking into account the Group's cash position at the date of approval of the Prospectus (‚Ç¨0.4 million)  payments of VAT receivables refunds (‚Ç¨2.1 million)  the research tax credit (‚Ç¨1.0 million)  and Bpifrance subsidies and repayable advances for the Artus project (‚Ç¨1.6 million) that the Company believes it has a reasonable chance of receiving  the net amount required to continue the Group's activities over the 12 months following the date of approval of the Prospectus is estimated at ‚Ç¨16.2 million. The Offering is intended to provide Affluent Medical with the resources necessary to finance its development for at least the next 7 months. Thus  including in the event of completion of the Capital Increase with PSR  the 12-month working capital will continue to be insufficient to meet the Group's obligations and operating cash requirements. In the absence of the exercise of the BSARs attached to the New Shares issued as part of the Offering  the net proceeds of the Offering  the shortfall in the 12-month working capital requirement remaining after the Capital Increase with PSR and the Group's cash horizon would be as follows if the Offering is limited to 91 07%  in the event of completion of the Offering at 100% or in the event of full exercise of the Extension Clause bringing the Offer up to 110% of its initial amount: Offer Net proceeds of the Offering before the potential exercise of BSARs Shortfall in the remaining 12-month working capital requirement Cash horizon - Completion of the Offering at 91.07% ‚Ç¨11.2m ‚Ç¨5;0m September 2023 - Completion of the Offering at 100% ‚Ç¨12.2m ‚Ç¨4.0m October 2023 - Completion of the Offering at 115% (full exercise of the Extension Clause) ‚Ç¨13.5m ‚Ç¨2.7m November 2023 It is also specified that the exercise of the BSARs attached to the New Shares as part of the Offering could enable additional fundraising of ‚Ç¨1.6 million  ‚Ç¨1.8 million  and ‚Ç¨2.0 million euros respectively  in the event of the exercise of all of these BSARs in the 9 months following the completion of the Offering on the basis of a subscription price for new shares of the Company of ‚Ç¨1.50 in the event of completion of the Initial Offer at91.07%  100%  and 110%. Additional financing  amounting to between ‚Ç¨5.0 million in the event of completion of the Offering at 91.07% and ‚Ç¨2.7 million in the event of completion of the Offering at 115%  will therefore be necessary after taking into account the net proceeds of the Offering and before the potential exercise of the BSARs so that the Group can finance its obligations and operating cash flow requirements over the 12 months following the date of approval of the Prospectus. The Group intends primarily to remedy the shortfall in its net working capital over 12 months as of the date of approval of the Prospectus by a maximum amount of ‚Ç¨5.0 million by seeking new dilutive and/or non-dilutive financing solutions. The Group could therefore proceed with another capital increase according to market conditions or other alternative sources of financing. As a result  the Group initiated discussions on the establishment of a Venture Loan amounting to around ‚Ç¨6 million and initiated steps to obtain non-dilutive financing in the form of subsidies and repayable advances to finance its clinical programs as part of an innovation aid scheme. Since its inception  Affluent Medical has demonstrated its ability to effectively implement its various financing options when necessary. However  in the absence of the necessary financing  the Group will consider cost-cutting solutions by focusing on its clinical activity and thus deferring its projects relating to the preparation of regulatory files and the industrialization of its medical devices for an estimated cost savings of ‚Ç¨4.2 million. However  these reductions will make it possible to maintain the KaliosTM clinical program  its most advanced medical device  as well as the pilot clinical studies for Artus and Epygon. The submission of the KaliosTM CE marking application would be postponed by six months  and the pivotal phases of the Artus and Epygon clinical studies and the filings of the CE marking applications would be postponed by one year. The reduction in costs over the 12 months following the date of approval of the Prospectus would reduce the net amount necessary for the continuation of the Group's activities over the 12 months following the date of approval of the Prospectus to ‚Ç¨12.0 million instead of ‚Ç¨16.2 million. If Affluent Medical implements its cost reduction plan and the Group fails to raise additional funds on top of this Capital Increase with PSR  the shortfall of its net working capital at 12 months on the date of approval of the Prospectus would be of a maximum amount of ‚Ç¨0.8 million  corresponding to the completion of the Offering up to 91.07% before the exercise of the BSARs  as applicable. This additional requirement would be financed through the financial support of Truffle Capital  the Group's main shareholder  up to a limit of ‚Ç¨3.0 million.

As expected at the time of the last announcement on 20 October 2022  sales excluding acquisitions should amount to 88% of the level achieved in 2019 (i.e. around ‚Ç¨430 million). However  like-for-like earnings (EBITDA  EBIT and consolidated net income attributable to owners of the parent) are expected to be around 20% higher than in 2019  confirming a stronger than expected performance  thanks to solid margins as well as control of operating expenses. Some cost cuts are non-recurring in nature.Under these conditions  consolidated sales including the acquisitions of Eurofun Group (European market leader in cycling holidays  sales of ‚Ç¨80 million and EBITDA of ‚Ç¨4.7 million in 2019) and Extraordinary Journeys (US tailor-made travel specialist  sales of $13 million and EBITDA of $0.9 million in 2019)  both consolidated as of 1 July 2022  should exceed ‚Ç¨490 million in 2022 (versus ‚Ç¨487 million in 2019). Consolidated EBITDA could reach close to ‚Ç¨45 million compared with ‚Ç¨33.6 million in 2019  an increase of 34%.The Company‚Äôs Board of Directors is due to meet on 18 April to approve the financial statements for the year (unaudited at present) and a press release will be published after market close on the same day.2023 BUSINESS ACTIVITYThe Group benefited from a sharp upturn in business  with bookings up significantly in the last three months. For the period to 5 February 2023  bookings for departures in 2023 (excluding acquisitions carried out in 2022) were 24% higher than during the same period ending in January 2019 for departures in 2019. This increase is based on a sales volume representing 41% of 2019 sales.This trend is more evident in tailor-made travel than in adventure travel  which has still seen very strong growth. Furthermore  the Group has also noted an increase in the average spend  particularly in tailor-made travel  which ‚Äì depending on the brand ‚Äì is thanks to favourable development in the mix of destinations  higher prices and more services being bought.Booking for companies acquired in 2022 were also up significantly.OUTLOOKNotwithstanding any exceptional public health-related events or adverse international events  the Group could achieve strong sales and earnings growth in 2023 relative to 2022 and 2019  as a result of both the very favourable bookings trend and the full-year consolidation of acquisitions carried out in 2022.(*) 2019 financial year: 2020 and 2021 sales and earnings are not representative due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Reminder:The Group is market leader in France (i) in tailor-made travel (53% of sales)  with the Voyageurs du Monde  Comptoir des Voyages  Bynativ  Original Travel and Extraordinary Journeys brands  (ii) in adventure travel (29% of sales)  with the Terres d'Aventure  Allibert Trekking  Nomade Aventure  KE Adventure Travel  and (iii) in biking travel (18% of sales) with the Eurofun Group brands.The shares are admitted to trading on the Euronext Growth market and eligible for PEA PME savings plans.Contacts:Voyageurs du Monde Lionel Habasque  Deputy CEO  T: 01 53 73 77 09Email: lhabasque@terdav.comAlain Capestan  Deputy CEO  T: 01 42 86 16 57Email: acapestan@voyageursdumonde.fr,neutral,0.06,0.94,0.0,positive,0.59,0.4,0.0,True,English,"['Voyageurs du Monde', 'sharp increase', 'Profits', 'bookings', '2022', '2023', 'PEA PME savings plans', 'exceptional public health-related events', 'US tailor-made travel specialist', 'Voyageurs du Monde group', 'adverse international events', 'consolidated net income', 'last three months', 'Extraordinary Journeys brands', 'European market leader', 'KE Adventure Travel', 'Eurofun Group brands', 'Euronext Growth market', 'favourable bookings trend', 'last announcement', 'favourable development', 'strong growth', 'Original Travel', 'biking travel', 'The Group', 'Press release', 'solid margins', 'operating expenses', 'cost cuts', 'cycling holidays', 'The Company', 'financial statements', 'same day', 'sharp upturn', 'average spend', 'higher prices', 'full-year consolidation', 'Covid-19 pandemic', 'Comptoir des', 'Allibert Trekking', 'Lionel Habasque', 'Deputy CEO', 'Alain Capestan', 'Consolidated EBITDA', '2022 financial year', '2019 financial year', 'earnings growth', '2023 BUSINESS ACTIVITY', 'same period', 'Nomade Aventure', 'sharp increase', 'sales volume', 'strong sales', '2019 sales', '2021 sales', 'Paris', '9 February', 'Profits', '2022 RESULTS', 'time', '20 October', 'acquisitions', 'level', 'owners', 'parent', 'performance', 'control', 'nature', 'conditions', '1 July', 'Board', 'Directors', '18 April', 'present', '5 February', 'departures', 'January', 'mix', 'destinations', 'services', 'companies', 'OUTLOOK', 'Reminder', 'France', 'Voyages', 'Bynativ', 'Terres', 'shares', 'Contacts', 'Email', 'voyageursdumonde']",2022-02-10,2023-02-10,marketscreener.com

The vessel w‚Ä¶,"Transocean  a global leader in the offshore drilling industry  has made a non-controlling investment in DEME Group's subsidiary GSR  through the contribution of an ultra-deepwater drilling vessel and cash investment.The vessel will be converted for a system integration test to explore the technical and environmental feasibility of recovering nodules in ultra-deepwater .The alliance will strengthen GSR's subsea experience and thereby contribute to its leadership position in the deep seabed minerals sector.DEME Group NV (Euronext Brussels: DEME) today announced a strategic cooperation with Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG) that brings together DEME's Global Sea Mineral Resources' (""GSR"") leadership in ultra-deepwater mineral exploration and seafloor nodule collection technology with Transocean's world-class offshore expertise and capabilities.As part of its investment  Transocean is contributing the vessel 'Ocean Rig Olympia' for GSR's ongoing exploration work  a cash investment and engineering capacity. In return  Transocean is receiving a minoritystake  including a board seat  in GSR. Following the successful trial of GSR's pre-prototype seafloor nodule collector in 2021 at 4500m water depth  a key task ahead for GSR is a system integration test (""SIT"")  scheduled for 2025. The SIT - for which the converted ultra-deepwater vessel shall be instrumental - will entail a trial of a full-scale seafloor nodule collector and riser to lift the nodules to the surface vessel and is part of GSR's step-by-step and precautionary approach to project and technology development as the company explores the feasibility of commercial operations.""Transocean is a leader in the global offshore drilling industry and is well known for its ultra-deepwater expertise. We are proud to be working with them as we further explore the potential of deep seabed minerals  which may represent a better way of meeting future metal demand and expand diversity of supply. Critical metals  such as nickel  cobalt  copper  and manganese - found in polymetallic nodules - are key ingredients for a low-carbon future. Deep-seabed mining certainly won't replace land-based mining entirely  however  according to peer-reviewed scientific literature  these metals could be delivered with a 40% reduction of the carbon footprint  which is essential when combating climate change.""  said Kris Van Nijen  Managing Director of GSR.Chief Executive Officer Luc Vandenbulcke of DEME Group said: ""Since the International Energy Agency reported that society will need six times more metals by 2040 to become a net-zero society in 2050  there have been many national initiatives to secure the necessary supply of raw materials. From the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act  the Australian & Canadian Critical Minerals Strategy to the EU Critical Minerals Act  society is now fully aware of the geopolitical and environmental risk of the clean energy transition. As a result  the development of marine minerals has gained considerable momentum to help supply the responsible minerals needed to meet demand due to increased population  urbanization  and transition to a clean energy future and circular economy.

Improving execution supported another excellent sales performance from our growth platforms in Oncology and Neuroscience. I was particularly pleased with the progress of the pipeline  including the recent clinical-trial results for Onivyde  which could significantly benefit patients with pancreatic cancer. We have also been replenishing the pipeline at pace through the acquisition of Epizyme in Oncology and  more recently  the announcement of Albireo in Rare Disease.Our external-innovation strategy  underpinned by a strong balance sheet and increasing cash generation  is expanding the number of potential medicines we have across our three therapy areas  and we have the ambition to enlarge the pipeline further. With the Company fully focused on Specialty Care  the outlook is promising  reflecting our commitment to bringing more medicines to patients and ensuring the sustainable growth of Ipsen.‚ÄùDelivering on strategyIpsen delivered successfully on the second year of the implementation of its strategy: Focus. Together. For patients and society.The divestment of the Consumer HealthCare (CHC) business in 2022 was a major step forward towards building a more focused Ipsen  centering on Specialty Care. The growth platforms produced a double-digit performance  including Dysport  which grew by 29.4%%7 and Cabometyx  up by 23.9%7. There were also favorable developments from the existing pipeline  including positive results from the Phase III trial of the Onivyde-based regimen in pancreatic cancer  as well as the initiation of new trials  including a Phase II trial of elafibranor in rare liver disease.It was also a particularly strong period of replenishment of the pipeline  founded on the strong execution of Ipsen‚Äôs external-innovation model. Through a combination of in-licensing and acquisitions  the Company has added 20 new assets to the pipeline in the last two years across the three strategic therapy areas of Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience. In 2022  Ipsen strengthened its position in Oncology by acquiring Epizyme  a fully integrated  commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing and delivering transformative therapies against novel epigenetic targets for cancer patients. More recently  Ipsen announced its intention to acquire Albireo8  a leading innovator in bile-acid modulators to treat pediatric and adult cholestatic liver diseases. This anticipated acquisition is designed to enrich Ipsen‚Äôs Rare Disease portfolio and pipeline.Finally  the Company continued to drive benefits from its global efficiencies program  yielding savings across the entire cost base  which enabled significant further investment in Ipsen‚Äôs priorities for growth.Full-year 2023 guidanceIpsen has set the following financial guidance for FY 2023  assuming the completion of the planned acquisition of Albireo  expected to close in the first quarter of the year:Total-sales growth greater than 4.0%  at constant currency. Based on the average level of exchange rates in January 2023  an anticipated adverse impact on total sales of around 2% from currenciesCore operating margin around 30% of total sales  excluding any potential impact of incremental investments from future external-innovation transactionsIpsen intends to provide a mid-term outlook before the end of 2023  following the anticipated completion of the acquisition of Albireo8  as well as a number of pipeline milestones.Business development updateIn January 2023  Ipsen and Albireo announced that they had entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Ipsen will acquire Albireo  a leading innovator in bile-acid modulators to treat pediatric and adult cholestatic liver diseases. The anticipated acquisition will enrich Ipsen‚Äôs Rare Disease portfolio and pipeline. The lead medicine in Albireo‚Äôs pipeline is Bylvay¬Æ (odevixibat)  the first-approved treatment in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis in the U.S. and E.U.  with potential in other rare diseases. The transaction is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2023.Pipeline updateIn November 2022  Ipsen announced that the NAPOLI 3 Phase III trial of Onivyde plus 5 fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin (NALIRIFOX regimen)  compared to nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in previously untreated patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma  met its primary endpoint  demonstrating a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in overall survival. The full trial results were presented in January 2023 at the American Clinical Society of Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in San Francisco  U.S.In December 2022  Ipsen announced that the CONTACT-01 Phase III trial of Cabometyx  in combination with atezolizumab  compared to docetaxel in patients with unmutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who experienced disease progression on or after treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and platinum-containing chemotherapy  did not meet its primary endpoint of an improvement in overall survival.In December 2022  the U.S. FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding the New Drug Application for palovarotene  an investigational treatment for the reduction of new abnormal bone formation (heterotopic ossification) in people living with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. The CRL was related to the regulatory agency‚Äôs previous request for additional information on palovarotene clinical-trial data communicated to Ipsen in October 2022  which was not a request for additional efficacy or safety data beyond existing studies. Ipsen anticipates responding to the request in the first quarter of 2023  with an expected six-month U.S. FDA review cycle. In January 2023  Ipsen received a negative opinion from the CHMP9 for palovarotene in the same indication. The Company will request a re-examination of the opinion  based on scientific data available from the existing palovarotene clinical-trial program.Environment  Social and Governance: Generation IpsenIpsen is committed to science-based reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions and its near-term climate targets were independently validated by the Science Based Target initiative in 2022. Ipsen now uses 100% green electricity for all operations in the U.K.  the Republic of Ireland and France. This increased the Company‚Äôs use of electricity from renewable sources to 90%  in line with a commitment to 100% renewable-electricity use by 2025. Another action was a further decarbonizing of Ipsen‚Äôs processes that have traditionally used fossil fuels to produce heat and steam for the manufacturing process  while a new Fleet For Future program is focused on the transitioning of at least 30% of Ipsen‚Äôs vehicle fleet to battery-electric vehicles by 2025.The Company is focused on patients‚Äô access to medicines  including the provision in 2022 of humanitarian relief in response to the crisis in Ukraine via patient support  medicine donations and funding to the Red Cross and Tulipe charities. The partnership with Access Accelerated  a not-for-profit collective that works in communities that lack sufficient access to healthcare to address non-communicable diseases  also continued to thrive. Finally  Fondation Ipsen  under the aegis of the Fondation de France  again reached millions of people impacted by rare diseases  helping to improve lives across around 100 countries.Consolidated financial statementsThe Board of Directors approved the consolidated financial statements on 8 February 2023. The consolidated financial statements have been audited and the Statutory Auditors‚Äô report is in the process of being published. Ipsen‚Äôs comprehensive audited financial statements will be available in due course on ipsen.com (regulated-information section).Conference callA conference call and webcast for investors and analysts will begin today at 1.45pm  Paris time.

In the fourth quarter  Somatuline sales in North America declined by 17.6% 10   augmented by the difference in year-on-year levels of inventories in the U.S. In Europe  sales declined by 11.6% 10   reflecting the larger effects of the launches of generic lanreotide in more markets  including Germany  France  Spain and Italy. Sales in the Rest of the World grew by 36.7% 10   a result of strong performances in several geographies  including the Middle East  Japan  Russia  and Brazil.Dysport : The performance was driven by growth in the aesthetics market  including increased sales to Ipsen‚Äôs partner  Galderma  in North America  Brazil and Australia  and strong demand in most therapeutics markets. Stronger growth in the second half of the year reflected a recent manufacturing-capacity increase that benefitted supply to meet aesthetics-market demand.Decapeptyl : the performance was mainly driven by continued market-share gains in Europe  primarily in France  the U.K. and Italy  along with higher volumes in the Rest of the World. In China  sales continued to grow  despite the impact of the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reduced growth in the fourth quarter reflected a particular impact from the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in China  as well as the phasing of various shipments.Cabometyx : the performance reflected strong volume uptakes in renal cell carcinoma across most geographies  mainly as a second-line monotherapy and  more recently  as a first-line therapy in combination with nivolumab.Onivyde : sales growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in the U.S.  as well as increased sales to Ipsen‚Äôs ex-U.S. partner.Tazverik: sales in the U.S. were consolidated for the four months from 1 September 2022.Total sales by geographical areaFY2022 FY2021 %change Q42022 Q42021 %change ‚Ç¨m ‚Ç¨m Actual CER11 ‚Ç¨m ‚Ç¨m Actual CER11 North America 1 032.1 916.3 12.6% 0.4% 272.9 266.5 2.4% -8.7% Europe12 1 237.3 1 205.5 2.6% 2.4% 312.6 318.3 -1.8% -1.4% Rest of the World 755.6 521.4 44.9% 36.7% 231.0 146.2 57.9% 47.4% Total Sales 3 025.0 2 643.3 14.4% 8.5% 816.4 731.0 11.7% 5.8%Commentary is based on the performance in FY 2022.North America : sales growth of 0.4% 11 was driven by a continued strong performance from Dysport in the therapeutics market and  in the aesthetics market  through Galderma  and from Onivyde  offset by a Somatuline sales decline of 7.5% 11 .Europe : sales growth of 2.4% 11 mainly reflected strong Cabometyx performances in France  Spain  Poland and Germany  Decapeptyl‚Äôs continued market-share uptakes and Onivyde‚Äôs performance through Ipsen‚Äôs partner. Dysport sales grew by 9.8% 11   a result of volume uptakes in the therapeutics market. Following the advance of generic lanreotide in a larger number of European markets  Somatuline sales declined by 11.6% 11 .Rest of the World: sales growth of 36.7%11 was driven by a solid volume performance in both Oncology and Neuroscience. In Oncology  the increase in Decapeptyl sales reflected volume growth in China  with continued share gains in several markets. The strong performance of Cabometyx was also a result of market-share gains across a number of geographies  including Brazil  Taiwan and the Middle East. The performance also reflected strong Somatuline sales  including in the Middle East  Japan and Brazil. In Neuroscience  the strong growth of Dysport sales was a result of volume uptakes in aesthetics markets  primarily in Latin America  Australia and the Middle East  as well as solid performances in therapeutics markets.Comparison of core consolidated income statementIn accordance with IFRS 5  FY 2022 consolidated net profit and free cash flow resulting from the CHC business have been reclassified in separate line items: ‚ÄòNet profit/(loss) from discontinued operations‚Äô in the profit and loss account and ‚ÄòChange in net cash/(debt) from discontinued operations‚Äô in the cash-flow statement. The comparative figures for the prior year have been restated accordingly.FY 2022 opening net cash ‚Ç¨28.0m  versus FY 2021 closing net debt of ‚Ç¨126.4m  reflected the reclassification of the contingent liabilities (earnouts and CVRs13)  previously part of the definition of net debt. In the profit and loss account  the change in earnouts related to the probability of success and currency effects  previously impacting the financial results  was recognized in non-core operating income and expenses. The effect of unwinding is still presented in the financial results. FY 2021 was restated for these impacts.Epizyme was fully consolidated from 1 September 2022.Core financial measures are performance indicators.

Net financing costs declined by ‚Ç¨3.3m to ‚Ç¨18.5m  driven by higher interest rates on investment income. Other financial income and expense declined by ‚Ç¨1.1m to ‚Ç¨13.4m  mainly reflecting reduced foreign-exchange impacts on non-commercial transactions.Core income taxesCore income tax expense of ‚Ç¨210.8m reflected a higher profit before tax  combined with a lower core effective tax rate of 19.5% (FY 2021: 21.9%)  mainly impacted by the reclassification of Orphan Drug tax credits from research and development expenses to income taxes.Core consolidated net profitCore consolidated net profit increased by 17.9% to ‚Ç¨872.4m (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨740.1m).Core EPSFully-diluted core EPS came to ‚Ç¨10.51  representing growth of 18.4% (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨8.88).From core financial measures to IFRS reported figuresFY 2022 FY 2021 ‚Ç¨m ‚Ç¨m Core Consolidated Net Profit 872.4 740.1 Amortization of intangible assets (excluding software) (78.7) (59.6) Other operating income and expenses (105.4) (36.3) Restructuring costs (20.2) (14.6) Impairment losses (86.1) (6.5) Others 65.5 23.6 IFRS Consolidated Net Profit 647.5 646.7 IFRS EPS Fully Diluted - Attributable To Ipsen S.A.
