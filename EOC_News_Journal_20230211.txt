The legislative changes are based on the premise that  irrespective of the chosen general meeting format  shareholders' rights must not be compromised and that all participating shareholders can exercise their shareholder rights in full in real time  including the right to present questions and vote. The possibility to organise general meetings remotely enables the Company to prepare for rapid changes in the Company's operating environment and society in general  which may be caused  for example  by pandemics.

Underwriting profit amounted to EUR 1 314 million (1 282)  representing year-on-year growth of 2 per cent or 13 per cent adjusted for COVID-19 effects reported in 2021. The Group combined ratio was solid at 82.1 per cent (81.4)  supported by excellent performance in Nordic P&C and benefits from higher discount rates. Excluding the reported COVID-19 effects in 2021  the combined ratio would have improved by 1.0 percentage points year-on-year. Gross written premiums increased by 6 per cent to EUR 8 136 million (7 644)  driven by strong renewals  high retention and disciplined pricing. Sampo targets mid-single digit per cent underwriting profit growth on average and a combined ratio below 86 per cent for 2021-2023.If P&C‚Äôs underwriting profit increased 11 per cent to EUR 985 million (891) and the combined ratio improved to 80.3 per cent (81.3). The result was driven by a 7.2 per cent currency adjusted premium growth and continued strong underlying performance. Premium development was supported by broad-based growth across all business areas  with Industrial and the Baltics seeing the most notable positive development. In the largest business area  Private  currency adjusted premium growth remained solid at 3.5 per cent despite a decline in Nordic new car sales. The adjusted risk ratio improved by approximately 0.5 percentage points year-on-year. In addition to the strong underwriting development  the significant changes in the interest rate environment during 2022 increased If‚Äôs fixed income running yield to 3.2 per cent (1.5). Profit before taxes increased to EUR 1 217 million (1 077).Topdanmark‚Äôs profit before taxes for 2022 in Sampo Group‚Äôs profit and loss account decreased to EUR 220 million (346)  as the investment result was affected by the adverse market environment. The sale of Topdanmark life insurance business in the fourth quarter of 2022 supported the result by EUR 72 million. The combined ratio stood at 83.1 per cent (82.3).Hastings reported solid top-line growth with resilient margins in a challenging UK motor insurance market  in which the claims inflation remained elevated throughout the year. Gross written premiums grew by 15 per cent on a currency adjusted basis in 2022  supported by high retention and disciplined pricing. Live customer policies increased 2 per cent year-on-year to over 3.2 million  driven by a 33 per cent growth in home insurance  while motor policy count was stable. Hastings‚Äô operating ratio increased to 89.7 per cent (80.3). Profit before taxes amounted to EUR 73 million (127)  or EUR 131 million (168) excluding the non-operational depreciation and amortisation.The Mandatum segment‚Äôs profit before taxes for 2022 decreased to EUR 207 million (291)  reflecting lower realised gains and an increase in the group contribution to Sampo plc to EUR 29 million (15). Mandatum‚Äôs net flows in third-party assets remained positive in every quarter  but were outweighed by the decline in market values  leading to assets under management of EUR 10.3 billion at the end of 2022  down from EUR 11.1 billion at the year-end 2021. Mandatum Life‚Äôs Solvency II ratio increased to 248 per cent (190)  driven by higher interest rates and lower solvency capital requirement.The profit before taxes of EUR 1 863 million (3 171) for 2022 includes accounting effects of EUR 138 million (982) defined as extraordinary items in accordance with Sampo Group‚Äôs dividend policy. Of the total amount  EUR 103 million related to the sale of Nordea shares  EUR 72 million to the sale of Topdanmark Life and EUR -37 million to the reclassification of Nordax from an associated company to fair value investment. Excluding these items  the profit before taxes declined to EUR 1 725 million (2 189)  mainly as a result of Nordea no longer being consolidated as an associate. The total comprehensive income  which takes changes in the market values of assets into account  was affected by the adverse capital markets environment and amounted to EUR -26 million (3 448).Sampo Group‚Äôs year-end 2022 Solvency II ratio stood at 210 per cent  up from 185 per cent at the year-end 2021  but down from 256 per cent at the end of the third quarter. The decrease over the third quarter was primarily driven by the inclusion of the dividend proposal and the planned new buyback programme. Sampo targets a solvency ratio of 170‚Äì190 per cent.Sampo Group‚Äôs financial leverage was 25.6 per cent at the end of 2022  up from 23.8 per cent at the end of 2021  but slightly down from 25.9 per cent at the end of the third quarter. Sampo targets a financial leverage ratio below 30 per cent.Sampo plc‚Äôs Board of Directors proposes a dividend of EUR 2.60 per share for the 2022 financial year to the Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 May 2023. This consists of a regular dividend (formerly known as the insurance dividend as introduced at the 2021 CMD) of EUR 1.80 per share (1.70)  representing growth of 6 per cent  and an extra dividend of EUR 0.80 per share. In addition to the dividend  management is to propose to the Board a new EUR 400 million buyback programme.The implementation of IFRS 17 and 9 on 1 January 2023 will bring asset and liability side mark-to-market effects into Sampo‚Äôs reported net income. As a result  the Sampo Board has decided to adjust the Group‚Äôs dividend policy  such that the payout ratio is measured against a newly defined operational result rather than net profit excluding items defined as extraordinary  as previously. The change is not expected to have any significant effect on the size and trajectory of dividends. The adjusted dividend policy is described in the section Dividend proposal.On 7 December 2022  Sampo plc announced that the Board of Directors had decided to undertake a strategic review of Mandatum in line with Sampo‚Äôs strategic focus on P&C insurance. The Board continues to review a number of different options  with the aim to evaluate whether a separation of Mandatum could create shareholder value. Sampo expects to provide a further update on the strategic review by the end of the first quarter of 2023.In 2022  Sampo repurchased its own shares through three buyback programmes. Of the latest buyback programme of EUR 1 billion  launched on 9 June 2022  EUR 845 million had been executed at year-end 2022. The programme was completed on 8 February 2023. In total  Sampo repurchased 32 million shares for a total of EUR 1.4 billion in 2022.FOURTH QUARTER 2022 IN BRIEFIn October-December 2022  Sampo Group reported profit before taxes of EUR 390 million (1 197). Excluding accounting effects treated as extraordinary items in accordance with Sampo Group‚Äôs dividend policy  profit before taxes amounted to EUR 355 million (452). Earnings per share amounted to EUR 0.50 (1.89)  or EUR 0.41 (0.55) excluding extraordinary items. Total comprehensive income  which takes changes in the market values of assets into account  amounted to EUR 448 million (1 269).Group underwriting profit increased to EUR 304 million (297). Excluding COVID-19 effects reported in the comparison period  underwriting profit grew by 12 per cent. The Group combined ratio amounted to 83.7 per cent (83.0).If P&C reported profit before taxes of EUR 285 million (260) and underwriting profit of EUR 229 million (210). The combined ratio was 81.7 per cent (82.9) and gross written premium growth 7.8 per cent on a currency adjusted basis. The adjusted risk ratio  which excludes the impact of large losses  severe weather  reported COVID-19 effects and prior year development  improved by 0.2 percentage points year-on-year.Topdanmark‚Äôs profit before taxes amounted to EUR 128 million (89) and combined ratio was 82.1 per cent (80.6).Hastings profit before taxes amounted to EUR 7 million (11). The operating ratio deteriorated to 94.0 per cent (87.9)  driven by increased claims frequency due to harsh weather conditions particularly in December. Gross written premiums increased by 31 per cent year-on-year on a currency adjusted basis. Live customer policy count remained stable  supported by continued strong growth in home insurance.The Mandatum segment‚Äôs profit before taxes amounted to EUR 18 million (91)  net of a profit contribution to Sampo plc of EUR 29 million (15). Excluding the profit contribution  profit before taxes stood at EUR 47 million (106). Mandatum‚Äôs third-party assets under management increased to EUR 10.3 billion from EUR 10.1 billion at the end of the third quarter  supported by strong net flows of EUR 213 million during the quarter.GROUP CEO‚ÄôS COMMENTSampo‚Äôs fourth quarter was characterised by strong operational execution  robust financial results and further steps on our strategic agenda. As we conclude a successful year  I am delighted that we are announcing EUR 1.7 billion (EUR 3.40 per share) of planned capital returns to shareholders.Sampo‚Äôs P&C insurance operations delivered excellent fourth quarter underwriting results of EUR 304 million  representing 13 per cent year-on-year growth  after adjusting for COVID-19 effects in the prior year. Notably  this result was achieved despite adverse weather in the form of heavy snowfall and cold weather. As always  our focus has been on assisting affected customers through superior service  which is a cornerstone of our strategy and instrumental in securing high retention rates over the long term.The result was driven mainly by our Nordic P&C business  where If grew underwriting profit excluding COVID-19 effects by 23 per cent  supported by an excellent fourth quarter combined ratio of 81.7 per cent and currency adjusted premium growth of 7.8 per cent. Importantly  our Nordic customer retention has remained high as we continue to cover claims inflation of 4‚Äì5 per cent with rate increases. The strongest pricing momentum is observed in Industrial  but fourth quarter premium growth also benefited from a stabilisation of new cars sales  albeit at a relatively low level  including support from high electric vehicle sales.In the UK  market conditions remained challenging  but Hastings achieved premium growth of 15 per cent over 2022 as it implemented significant rate increases to cover claims inflation of 12 per cent. Adverse weather had a negative impact on Hastings‚Äô operating ratio  pushing this to 89.7 per cent for 2022 as a whole. Although above our annual 88 per cent target  Hastings has delivered a relatively resilient result in what has been a challenging year for the UK motor market. I believe this reflects skilful operational execution and the company‚Äôs strong positioning and capabilities  which I expect will enable attractive profit growth as market conditions improve.In the capital markets  the fourth quarter saw further increases in interest rates and positive development in equity markets. Due to the short duration of our fixed income portfolio  we were able to continue to rapidly increase our running yield. Over 2022  higher running yields have added roughly EUR 230 million to Sampo‚Äôs annual pre-tax earning power  with the largest contribution coming from If P&C  which has more than doubled its running yield to 3.2 per cent (1.5).In December  Sampo‚Äôs Board of Directors launched a strategic review of Mandatum to evaluate whether separating the entity from the Group could add shareholder value. As a pure P&C insurer  Sampo could deliver higher and more resilient returns on capital  while an independent Mandatum would enjoy greater strategic flexibility to invest in growth. On the other hand  Mandatum makes an attractive contribution to the Group‚Äôs cash flow that supports value creation over time. We expect to provide an update on the review by the end of the first quarter of 2023.Turning to capital management  Sampo remains committed to capital discipline with a EUR 2.60 per share dividend proposal for 2022 and a EUR 400 million share buyback programme  which management is to propose. Adjusting for these actions  the Group retains EUR 2 per share of excess capital above the needs of the insurance operations  most of which is tied into private equity investments held in Sampo plc.Torbj√∂rn MagnussonGroup CEOOUTLOOKOutlook for 2023Sampo Group‚Äôs P&C insurance operations are expected to achieve underwriting margins that meet the annual targets set for 2021‚Äì2023. At Group level  Sampo targets a combined ratio of below 86 per cent  while the target for its largest subsidiary  If P&C  is below 85 per cent. Hastings targets an operating ratio of below 88 per cent.The combined and operating ratios of Sampo Group‚Äôs P&C insurance operations are subject to volatility driven by  among other factors  seasonal weather patterns  large claims and prior year development. These effects are particularly relevant for individual segments and business areas  such as the Danish and UK operations.The mark-to-market component of the net financial result will be significantly influenced by capital markets‚Äô developments  particularly in life insurance.With regard to Topdanmark  reference is made to the profit forecast model that the company publishes on a quarterly basis.The major risks and uncertainties for the Group in the near-termIn its current day-to-day business activities Sampo Group is exposed to various risks and uncertainties  mainly through its major business units.Major risks affecting the Group companies‚Äô profitability and its variation are market  credit  insurance and operational risks. At the Group level  sources of risks are the same  although they are not directly additive due to the effects of diversification.Uncertainties in the form of major unforeseen events may have an immediate impact on the Group‚Äôs profitability. The identification of unforeseen events is easier than the estimation of their probabilities  timing  and potential outcomes. During 2022 the global economy was hit by the war in Ukraine and at the same time  inflation pressures intensified and broadened forcing central banks to raise interest rates sharply. This may lead to both a further significant slowdown in economic growth and a deterioration in the debt service capacity of businesses  households and governments. Furthermore  the re-alignment of energy supplies in Europe takes time and the energy crisis could continue for several years. These developments are currently causing significant uncertainties in economic and capital market development. At the same time rapidly evolving hybrid threats create new challenges for states and businesses. There are also a number of widely identified macroeconomic  political and other sources of uncertainty which can  in various ways  affect the financial services industry in a negative manner.Other sources of uncertainty are unforeseen structural changes in the business environment and already identified trends and potential wide-impact events. These external drivers may have a long-term impact on how Sampo Group‚Äôs business will be conducted. Examples of identified trends are demographic changes  sustainability issues  and technological developments in areas such as artificial intelligence and digitalisation including threats posed by cybercrime.DIVIDEND PROPOSALDividendUnder Sampo Group‚Äôs capital management framework  Sampo will return ongoing surplus capital generation from its insurance operations through a regular dividend. Other forms of surplus capital generation  including possible proceeds from disposals of financial investments  are returned through additional dividends and/or buybacks  to the extent that the funds are not utilised to support business development. Sampo targets a Solvency II ratio of 170‚Äì190 per cent and financial leverage below 30 per cent.According to Sampo plc‚Äôs Dividend Policy applied for distribution of 2022 earnings  total annual dividends paid shall represent at least 70 per cent of Sampo Group‚Äôs net profit for the year (excluding extraordinary items). In 2022  accounting items related to the sale of Nordea shares  the sale of Topdanmark life insurance operations and the reclassification of Nordax from an associated company to fair value investment have been defined as extraordinary in accordance with Sampo‚Äôs dividend policy.The parent company‚Äôs distributable capital and reserves totalled EUR 6 716 million of which profit for the financial year 2022 was EUR 1 780 million. Based on the policies outlined above  the Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a total dividend of EUR 2.60 per share be paid to all shares except for the shares held by Sampo plc on the dividend record date of 22 May 2023. The total dividend includes a regular dividend of EUR 1.80 per share as well as an extra dividend of EUR 0.80 per share.As earnings per share excluding extraordinary items amounted to EUR 2.41 per share  the payout ratio for the total dividend equates to 108 per cent. The remainder of the distributable funds are left in the company‚Äôs equity capital. After adjusting for the proposed dividend  Sampo Group‚Äôs 2022 year-end distributable funds amounted to EUR 5 378 million  Group Solvency II ratio to 210 per cent and financial leverage to 28.6 per cent.Dividend paymentThe dividend is proposed to be paid to the shareholders registered in the register of shareholders held by Euroclear Finland Oy as at the record date of 22 May 2023. The Board proposes that the dividends be paid on 31 May 2023.The issuer of the Swedish depository receipts shall ensure that the dividend is paid to the depository receipt holders registered in the securities depository and settlement register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB as at the record date of 22 May 2023  which payment shall be made in Swedish kronor.Financial positionNo significant changes have taken place in the company's financial position since the end of the financial year. The company's liquidity position is good and in the view of the Board  the proposed distributions do not jeopardise the company's ability to fulfil its obligations.Adjustment to Sampo Group‚Äôs dividend policyThe implementation of IFRS 17 and 9 on 1 January 2023 will bring asset and liability side mark-to-market effects into Sampo‚Äôs reported net income. As a result  the Sampo Board has decided to adjust the Group‚Äôs dividend policy  such that the minimum payout ratio of 70 per cent is measured against a newly defined operational result rather than net profit excluding items defined as extraordinary  as previously. The change is not expected to have any significant effect on the size and trajectory of dividends. The adjustment is effective to payouts made in respect of the 2023 and later financial years‚Äô.According to the updated dividend policy  Sampo is to pay a stable and sustainable regular dividend that grows in line with the Group‚Äôs earnings over time. Total annual dividends paid will be at least 70 per cent of Group‚Äôs operational result.The operational result is similar to net profit excluding items defined as extraordinary used under IFRS 4  with the main differences being that it excludes all result effects from discount rate changes as well as non-operational amortisation in Sampo‚Äôs P&C operations  and that Mandatum‚Äôs profit is replaced with the dividend stream that it provides to Sampo plc. The full definition of the operational result can be found at www.sampo.com/dividend .Sampo is committed to operating a strong and efficient balance sheet  as defined by the Group‚Äôs capital management framework. To enable this  regular dividends can be complemented with distributions of excess capital via share buybacks and/or extra dividends.OTHER DEVELOPMENTSStrategic review of MandatumOn 7 December 2022  Sampo plc announced that the Board of Directors had decided to undertake a strategic review of Mandatum in line with Sampo‚Äôs strategic focus on P&C insurance. The Board continues to review a number of different options  with the aim to evaluate whether a separation of Mandatum could create shareholder value.The Board of Directors of Sampo plc is content with the current Group structure as it offers diversification in terms of business exposures as well as capital and cash generation. Sampo expects to provide a further update on the strategic review by the end of the first quarter of 2023.EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODShare buyback programmeSampo‚Äôs share buyback programme of EUR 1 billion announced on 9 June 2022 continued after the end of the reporting period. The buyback programme was completed on 8 February 2023  when at market close  the company held  after cancellation of the own shares on 8 December 2022  in total 5.4 million Sampo A shares representing 1.05 per cent of the total number of shares in Sampo plc. Sampo had bought altogether 22.1 million A shares under the share buyback programme between 10 June 2022 and 8 February 2023  of which 16.7 million shares were cancelled on 8 December 2022. Further information on the buyback programme is available on www.sampo.com/sharebuyback .Proposal for the new Chair of the BoardSampo disclosed on 30 January 2023 that its Nomination and Remuneration Committee plans to propose previous Board member Antti M√§kinen as a new member of the Board of Directors of Sampo plc at the Annual General Meeting on 17 May 2023  and to nominate him as Chair of the Board of Directors.

The complete report is attached to this release and is also available at www.sanoma.com/en/investors .Q4 2022The Group‚Äôs net sales grew to EUR 260 million (2021: 252). The positive impact of the acquisition of Pearson Italy and Germany was partially offset by lower advertising sales. The Group‚Äôs comparable growth was ‚Äë3% (2021: 6%).Operational EBIT excl. PPA was seasonally negative and amounted to EUR -2 million (2021: -5).EBIT was EUR -21 million (2021: -19). Items affecting comparability (IACs) increased to EUR -8 million (2021: -5) and were mainly related to recent acquisitions in Learning. Purchase price allocation adjustments and amortisations (PPAs) grew to EUR 11 million (2021: 8) as a result of the acquisition of the Italian and German business.Operational EPS was EUR -0.07 (2021: -0.06).EPS was EUR -0.13 (2021: -0.09).On 16 December 2022  Sanoma received a payment decision regarding tax audits for 2019‚àí2021 concerning the VAT treatment of magazine distribution in Media Finland  from which it will appeal. Based on the decision received  Sanoma paid EUR 11 million of VAT  penalties and interests at year end 2022 in order to avoid further interest accumulation. For dividend calculation purposes  the Group‚Äôs free cash flow will be adjusted for the prepayment.On 7 November 2022  Sanoma signed a EUR 300 million syndicated revolving credit facility replacing its earlier facility of the same size  and syndicated its EUR 250 million 4-year term loan used for the acquisition of Pearson Italy and Germany with a group of ten relationship banks.On 26 October  the Board of Directors decided the record date and payment date of the second dividend instalment of EUR 0.27 per share. The dividend record date was 28 October and the payment date 4 November.On 4 October  Sanoma divested Eduarte  a Dutch student administration system provider for vocational education  in line with the strategy to harmonise its digital offering across the learning business.FY 2022The Group‚Äôs net sales grew to EUR 1 298 million (2021: 1 252) mainly driven by the acquisition of the Italian and German learning business from Pearson. The Group‚Äôs comparable net sales growth was 1% (2021: 7%).Operational EBIT excl. PPA declined to EUR 189 million (2021: 197)  corresponding to a margin of 14.6% (2021: 15.8%). Earnings were stable in Learning and declined in Media Finland mainly due to lower advertising sales and higher paper costs.EBIT was EUR 112 million (2021: 142). IACs increased to EUR -38 million (2021: -16) mainly due to transaction and integration costs of recent acquisitions as well as impairments in Learning. PPAs were EUR 39 million (2021: 39).Operational EPS was EUR 0.65 (2021: 0.69).EPS was EUR 0.47 (2021: 0.62).Free cash flow declined to EUR 112 million (2021: 140) mainly due to lower earnings  as well as higher working capital  investments and taxes. It includes a significant positive contribution from the working capital of the acquired Italian and German businesses due to the timing of the acquisition.Net debt/Adj. EBITDA increased to 3.2 (2021: 2.4) mainly as a result of the acquisition in Italy and Germany.On 31 August  Sanoma completed the acquisition of Pearson‚Äôs local K12 learning content business in Italy and its small exam preparation business in Germany.On 7 June  Sanoma announced its strategic growth ambition to increase the Group‚Äôs net sales to over EUR 2 billion by 2030  with at least 75% coming from the learning business.The Board proposes a dividend of 0.37 ‚Ç¨ per share (2021: 0.54)  corresponding to 93% of the underlying free cash flow. The dividend will be paid in three instalments  EUR 0.13 on 28 April  EUR 0.13 in September and EUR 0.11 in November.Outlook for 2023In 2023  Sanoma expects that the Group‚Äôs reported net sales will be EUR 1.35‚Äí1.4 billion (2022: 1.3). The Group‚Äôs operational EBIT excl. PPA is expected to be EUR 150‚àí180 million (2022: 189).Regarding the operating environment  Sanoma expects that:The economies in the Group‚Äôs operating countries  particularly in Finland  will experience a mild recession.The advertising market in Finland will decline slightly  with most of the decline during the first half of the year.President and CEO Susan Duinhoven:‚ÄùIn light of the significant changes in the world around us  2022 was another solid year of transformation for Sanoma ‚Äìalthough being very different from what we expected twelve months ago  just coming out of the coronavirus pandemic. In Learning  one of the highlights in 2022 was the acquisition of two established learning businesses in Italy and Germany from Pearson. We were happy to welcome these strong teams to Sanoma at the end of August. The acquired businesses fit well in our learning portfolio and strategy  and the acquisition had already a modest positive contribution to our net sales growth and operational EBIT  and due to the timing of the acquisition also a significant one to the free cash flow. The integration has started according to our plans and playbook and we expect the separation from Pearson and integration into Sanoma to be a sizable project over the next 18‚àí24 months.Net sales of Learning grew by 7% driven by the acquired Italian and German businesses. Organic growth was good across our operating countries except ‚Äì in line with our expectations ‚Äì in Poland  where the latest curriculum renewal ended in 2021. In Spain  the implementation of the major educational reform and curriculum renewal  LOMLOE  started a bit more fragmented than we had anticipated. However  it created solid growth in the demand for learning content in 2022  which is expected to continue also in 2023 extending most likely even into 2024. The inflationary cost increases impacted the earnings in Learning  as we typically can set our prices only once a year. Now for 2023  we have been able to adapt the prices for our products and services and we expect that it will take 1‚àí2 years to fully mitigate the cost increases in most of our markets. Especially the higher personnel costs that in most of our businesses will impact us only from 2023 onwards  will take some time to mitigate. Despite the inflationary cost increases  the operational earnings remained stable in most of our businesses. The main exception was the Dutch distribution business that suffered during the summer period from labour shortage and related sharp increase in hiring costs  delays due to supply chain issues with our main supplier and the general inflationary cost pressures.In Media Finland  net sales were stable  while operational earnings declined driven by lower advertising sales and significantly higher paper costs. The active cost containment by the teams across fixed cost categories was not able to fully offset the adverse inflationary impact on Media Finland‚Äôs operational earnings. One of the highlights of the year was the clear growth in the number of visits to all our digital news platforms  especially Ilta-Sanomat  as well as solid growth in the digitally active subscription base of both Helsingin Sanomat and the regional news media titles. Subscription sales were stable  while the total number of subscribers declined slightly towards the end of the year reflecting the weakening consumer confidence in Finland. During the second half of the year  advertising sales declined year-on-year compared to the strong demand in 2021 that was driven by the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.Sustainability is at the core of both our learning and media business. During the year  we continued our actions towards our targets by focusing on improving diversity  equality and inclusion across Sanoma and sending our climate targets for validation to the Science-Based Targets initiative. Our progressive and holistic approach to sustainability was reflected in continued improvement in key ESG ratings and inclusion into the Nasdaq OMX Sustainability Finland Index. We were delighted to also see that our Employee Experience Index remained stable at the good level of 7.3  even in a year that put quite some challenges and hardship for our teams  and we continued to exceed the European benchmark that was 7.1.Compared to last year  our free cash flow declined significantly. The main reasons for this were higher investments in digital development in Learning  adaptation of our offices to the hybrid way of working as well as lower EBITDA and costs related to the recent acquisition in Learning. This was mostly compensated by the working capital that came with the acquired businesses due to the timing of the acquisition. Without a similar benefit from the Italian and German acquisition as seen in 2022  we expect the Group‚Äôs 2023 free cash flow to temporarily decline  being impacted by the lower earnings expected in our Finnish media business  continued investments in our digital platforms and integration of the recently acquired businesses together with significantly higher financial expenses.The Board proposes a dividend of EUR 0.37 (2021: 0.54)  corresponding to a yield of 3.8% on the end of 2022 share price and 93% of the underlying free cash flow. This proposal balances the capital use between the dividend and our continuing investments in growing the business further.We expect the challenging operating environment to continue  leading to a mild recession in most of our operating countries. This will be impacting our performance in 2023  and thus our Outlook for 2023 shows growth in net sales with slightly lower operational EBIT. In 2023  we will focus on further building the long-term strengths of our businesses around learning content  harmonisation of digital learning platforms and leading offering in digital news and entertainment  and thus coming out of the recession even stronger than we went in. At the same time  we will intensify our thoughtful cost management and highly selective approach to growth investments. We remain fully committed to our growth strategy as well as our long-term financial targets. We are aiming for the Group net sales to be above EUR 2 billion  with at least 75% coming from the learning business  which we aim to achieve through organic growth and further acquisitions within K12 learning services. Also in the shorter term  we continue to be interested in value creating acquisitions in K12 learning content  especially in-market acquisitions  even though our main focus this year will be on integrations and gaining the scale benefits that our European portfolio can offer.I would like to extend my great thanks to all Sanoma employees for their excellent work  tenacity and strong commitment to supporting our customers in these more challenging times. Thanks to our teams  we were able to continue our growth  operational development and solid financial performance throughout the year 2022.

The legislative changes are based on the premise that  irrespective of the chosen general meeting format  shareholders' rights must not be compromised and that all participating shareholders can exercise their shareholder rights in full in real time  including the right to present questions and vote. The possibility to organise general meetings remotely enables the Company to prepare for rapid changes in the Company's operating environment and society in general  which may be caused  for example  by pandemics.

The Offeror has on November 24  2022 published a tender offer document  dated November 24  2022  and on January 13  2023 published the first supplement document to the tender offer document  concerning the Tender Offer (the tender offer document  as supplemented from time to time  the ""Tender Offer Document""). The offer period for the Tender Offer commenced on November 24  2022  at 9:30 a.m. (Finnish time) and will expire on February 28  2023  at 4:00 p.m. (Finnish time)  unless the offer period is extended further or any extended offer period is discontinued as described in the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer.The Offeror announced on January 24  2023 improvement to the consideration offered in the Tender Offer  extension of the offer period  lowering the acceptance threshold and renewal of the recommendation by the Board of Directors of Caverion. As announced on January 24  2023  the Offeror supplements the Tender Offer Document with detailed information on the terms and conditions of the improved Tender Offer  including the Alternative Consideration Instruments. The Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority has today approved the Finnish language version of the related supplement to the Tender Offer Document (the ""Supplement Document""). The Supplement Document includes the amended terms and conditions of the Tender Offer. The Supplement Document is attached as Appendix 1 to this stock exchange release.North (BC) Lux Holdco SARL (""Bain Luxco"") (a vehicle owned and controlled by funds managed or advised by Bain Capital Private Equity (Europe)  LLP  and/or its affiliates (together ""Bain Capital"" and such funds being the ""Bain Capital Funds"")  Security Trading Oy (""Security Trading"")  Fennogens Investments S.A. (""Fennogens"") and Corbis S.A. (""Corbis"") form a consortium (the ""Consortium"") for the purposes of the Tender Offer.OFFER PRICE OF THE TENDER OFFERThe shareholders of Caverion are in the Tender Offer given the possibility to choose either: (i) a fixed cash payment of EUR 8.50 per Share payable in nine (9) months from the date of the first completion trades in the Tender Offer implemented through the issuance of a debt instrument with the nominal principal amount of EUR 8.50 (the ""Alternative Consideration Instrument"") for each Share tendered in the Tender Offer  or (ii) an immediate cash consideration of EUR 8.00 upon completion of the Tender Offer (the ""Cash Offer Price"") for each Share tendered in the Tender Offer. The Alternative Consideration Instruments will be issued by the Offeror on the date(s) of the completion trades of the Tender Offer with the nominal principal amount of EUR 8.50 and will be redeemed at their full nominal amount upon their maturity on the date falling nine (9) months after the date of first issuance of the Alternative Consideration Instruments. Shareholders choosing the Alternative Consideration will be issued one (1) Alternative Consideration Instrument for each Share tendered in the Tender Offer in connection with the completion trades of the Tender Offer. The acceptance of the Tender Offer with Alternative Consideration may be submitted on the business day following the publication of the Supplement Document  i.e. from February 13  2023. More detailed instructions are included in the Supplement Document and under section ""The Acceptance Procedure of the Tender Offer"" below.Shareholders holding Shares on Finnish equity savings accounts are not eligible to elect the Alternative Consideration Instrument in respect of such Shares for regulatory reasons. Instead of the Alternative Consideration Instruments  the shareholders holding Shares on the Finnish equity savings accounts have the possibility to elect a non-transferable deferred payment right of EUR 8.50 per Share to be paid in cash nine (9) months from the date of the first completion trades in the Tender Offer (the ""Deferred Payment Right""  and together with the Alternative Consideration Instruments the ""Alternative Consideration""). The Alternative Consideration and the Cash Offer Price are jointly referred to as the ""Offer Price"".The Cash Offer Price and the Alternative Consideration have been determined based on 136 472 645 issued and outstanding Shares. Should the Company increase the number of Shares that are issued and outstanding on the date hereof as a result of a new share issue  reclassification  stock split (including a reverse split) or any other similar transaction with dilutive effect  or should the Company distribute a dividend or otherwise distribute funds or any other assets to its shareholders  or if a record date with respect to any of the foregoing occurs prior to any of the settlements of the completion trades of the Tender Offer (whether after the expiry of the Offer Period or any Subsequent Offer Period (as defined below))  resulting in the distribution of funds not being payable to the Offeror  the Cash Offer Price and the Alternative Consideration payable by the Offeror shall be reduced accordingly on a euro-for-euro basis. However  each of the Alternative Consideration Instruments or Deferred Payment Rights are not subject to any adjustments after such an Alternative Consideration Instrument has been delivered or a Deferred Payment Right has been recorded to the shareholder but  instead  the adjustments will occur only if the distribution of funds or other corporate event entitling to the adjustment or if a record date with respect to any of the foregoing occurs prior to the settlement of relevant completion trades of the Tender Offer.Bain Capital Europe Fund VI  Security Trading  Fennogens and Corbis have given equity commitments to the Offeror to fund the Offeror for the purposes of the Tender Offer and the designated purpose of such equity commitments is to enable payment of the aggregate Cash Offer Price and redemption of the Alternative Consideration Instruments and payment of the Deferred Payment to holders of equity savings accounts by the Offeror.RECOMMENDATION BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CAVERIONThe Board of Directors of Caverion  represented by a quorum comprising the non-conflicted members of the Board of Directors  has unanimously decided to recommend in its statement issued on February 9  2023 pursuant to the Finnish Securities Markets Act (746/2012  as amended) and the Helsinki Takeover Code issued by the Finnish Securities Market Association (the ""Helsinki Takeover Code"") that the shareholders of Caverion accept the Tender Offer. The Board of Directors of Caverion has received an updated opinion  dated January 24  2023  of Caverion's exclusive financial adviser  Bank of America Europe DAC  Stockholm branch (""BofA Securities"")  to the effect that  as of the date of such opinion  the increased Offer Price to be paid to holders of Shares (other than Security Trading  Fennogens and Corbis and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the Improved Tender Offer  was fair from a financial point of view  to such holders  which opinion was based upon and subject to the assumptions made  procedures followed  matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken as more fully described in such opinion. The opinion of BofA Securities was provided for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors of Caverion and does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holders of Shares should act in connection with the Tender Offer or any related matter.THE ACCEPTANCE PROCEDURE OF THE TENDER OFFERAcceptance of the Tender Offer with Alternative Consideration may only be submitted on the business day following the publication of the Supplement Document  i.e. from February 13  2023.Before February 13  2023  acceptance of the Tender Offer can only be made with the Cash Offer Price. Each shareholder of Caverion whose acceptance of the Tender Offer has been submitted before February 13  2023  shall be deemed to have accepted the Tender Offer with the Cash Offer Price.If a shareholder of Caverion has submitted the acceptance of the Tender Offer before February 13  2023 in respect of the Shares held by him/her and wishes to elect the Alternative Consideration instead of the Cash Offer Price  such shareholder must submit a valid withdrawal of his/her earlier acceptance of the Tender Offer in accordance with instructions from the account operator and submit a duly executed acceptance form for the Alternative Consideration. Neither the Offeror nor Nordea (in its capacity as arranger and an account operator) will charge the shareholders for withdrawing their acceptance of the Tender Offer in order to accept the Alternative Consideration in such a situation.A shareholder may only choose to receive either the Alternative Consideration or the Cash Offer Price for all Shares held on the same book-entry account  and  consequently  shareholders may only tender for mixed consideration if the relevant Shares are held on separate book-entry accounts.The shareholders holding Shares on equity savings accounts who have selected the Alternative Consideration will receive  instead of the Alternative Consideration Instruments  non-transferable rights to payment from the Offeror  and to demonstrate these  the book-entries named as other rights will be recorded to a shareholder's equity savings account.Most Finnish account operators will send a new notice regarding the Tender Offer and related instructions to those who are registered as shareholders in the shareholders' register of Caverion maintained by Euroclear Finland. Shareholders of Caverion who do not receive such instructions from their account operator or asset manager should first contact their account operator or asset manager and can subsequently contact Nordea Bank Abp (""Nordea"") by sending an email to caverion-offer@nordea.com  where such shareholders of Caverion can receive information on submitting their acceptance of the Tender Offer. Please note  however  that Nordea will not be engaging in communications relating to the Tender Offer with shareholders located within the United States. Shareholders who are located within the United States may contact their brokers for necessary information.Those shareholders of Caverion whose Shares are nominee-registered  and who wish to accept the Tender Offer  must effect such acceptance in accordance with the instructions given by the custodian of the nominee-registered shareholders. The Offeror will not send an acceptance form or any other documents related to the Tender Offer to these shareholders of Caverion.For more information on the acceptance procedure of the Tender Offer  see section ""Terms and Conditions of the Tender Offer - Acceptance Procedure of the Tender offer"" in the Supplement Document. All shareholders of Caverion are advised to carefully review the Tender Offer Document and the Supplement Document before deciding on the acceptance of the Tender Offer.The Finnish language versions of the Tender Offer Document and the Supplement Document are available on the internet at www.caverion-offer.fi and www.nordea.fi/caverion-ostotarjous as of February 10  2023.

In particular  the financial information included in this stock exchange release has been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in Finland  which may not be comparable to the financial statements or financial information of U.S. companies. The Tender Offer is made to Caverion's shareholders resident in the United States on the same terms and conditions as those made to all other shareholders of Caverion to whom an offer is made. Any informational documents  including this stock exchange release  are being disseminated to U.S. shareholders on a basis comparable to the method that such documents are provided to Caverion's other shareholders.As permitted under the Tier I Exemption  the settlement of the Tender Offer is based on the applicable Finnish law provisions  which differ from the settlement procedures customary in the United States  particularly as regards to the time when payment of the consideration is rendered. The Tender Offer  which is subject to Finnish law  is being made to the U.S. shareholders in accordance with the applicable U.S. securities laws  and applicable exemptions thereunder  in particular the Tier I Exemption and the 802 Exemption. To the extent the Tender Offer is subject to U.S. securities laws  those laws only apply to U.S. shareholders and will not give rise to claims on the part of any other person. U.S. shareholders should consider that (whether paid initially in cash or upon redemption of any Alternative Consideration Instruments) the offer price for the Tender Offer is being paid in EUR and that no adjustment will be made based on any changes in the exchange rate.To the extent permissible under applicable law or regulations  the Offeror and its affiliates or its brokers and its brokers' affiliates (acting as agents for the Offeror or its affiliates  as applicable) may from time to time after the date of this stock exchange release and during the pendency of the Tender Offer  and other than pursuant to the Tender Offer  directly or indirectly purchase or arrange to purchase Shares or any securities that are convertible into  exchangeable for or exercisable for Shares.

In addition  the financial advisers to the Offeror may also engage in ordinary course trading activities in securities of Caverion  which may include purchases or arrangements to purchase such securities. To the extent required in Finland  any information about such purchases will be made public in Finland in the manner required by Finnish law.Neither the SEC nor any U.S. state securities commission has approved or disapproved the Tender Offer (including the offer of the Alternative Consideration Instruments)  passed upon the merits or fairness of the Tender Offer (including the offer of the Alternative Consideration Instruments)  or passed any comment upon the adequacy  accuracy or completeness of the disclosure in relation to the Tender Offer (including in relation to the Alternative Consideration Instruments).

THE FUNDING WILL BE USED AS WORKING CAPITAL AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE MASS PRODUCTION CONTRACT WITH SONO MOTORS HAS BEEN POSTPONED AND TO PAY DOWN THE COMPANY‚ÄôS DEBT TO RIVERFORT.Background and Purpose of Financial ArrangementValoe Oyj (‚ÄúValoe‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) has signed a convertible note facility agreement with Winance concerning a funding arrangement of up to EUR 5 000 000 in convertible loan notes (the ""Convertible Notes"") that will be accompanied by share subscription warrants (the ""Warrants"") (the agreement  the Convertible Notes and the Warrants hereinafter referred to collectively as the ""Arrangement"").Valoe will use the funding as working capital. The need for additional funding became apparent after the signing of the mass production contract for Sion  Sono Motors' self-charging electric vehicle  and the related estimated cash flows were postponed. In addition  Valoe will pay down its debt to Riverfort Global Opportunities Pcc Limited by approximately one million euro.On 20 December 2022  Valoe disclosed that the signing of the contract Valoe is negotiating with the company‚Äôs significant customer has been postponed until the end of the first quarter of 2023. The delay was expected to have negative impact on Valoe‚Äôs working capital situation. With Winance‚Äôs financing that has now been agreed on  Valoe expects to be able to meet its working capital needs until the substantial customer contracts are signed and the planned cash flow from customer contracts start to materialize.Under the Arrangement  Valoe issues Convertible Notes to Winance. The Convertible Notes may be drawn down so that the first tranche amounts to EUR2 000 000  after which the Convertible Notes may be drawn down in maximum of 6 sequential tranches of EUR 500 000 each (the first tranche and the subsequent Tranches  each ""Tranche"") during a period of 24 months from the drawdown of the first Tranche provided that the preconditions for each Tranche are met. Winance has the right to convert each Tranche into the Company‚Äôs newly issued or treasury shares. In addition  Winance will receive Warrants stripped from the Convertible Notes at the drawdown of each Tranche. The Warrants entitle Winance to subscribe to additional shares of the Company with a subscription price described in the Characteristics of the Warrants.Story continuesThe Company has an obligation to draw down the first Tranche of EUR 2 000 000 and a minimum of two sequential Tranches of the Convertible Notes  i.e. a total minimum of EUR 3 000 000. The remainder of the Convertible Notes  a total of four Tranches of EUR500 000 totaling EUR 2 000 000  may be drawn down by the Company at its discretion.Valoe has  pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Arrangement between Valoe and Winance  withdrawn the first Tranche of EUR 2 000 000  and issued to Winance in total 2 000 convertible notes and in total 13 333 333 warrants related thereto.Commercial Terms of ArrangementPursuant to the Arrangement  Winance may be given in the maximum of 5 000 convertible loan notes against subscription price of EUR 1 000 per each convertible loan note. The Convertible Notes entitle their holder to subscribe to maximum of 50 000 000 shares of the Company in the aggregate.The subscription price of the Notes related to the Tranche Warrants shall be equal to 98% of the par value of the Notes.Notwithstanding the first Tranche  a Tranche may be drawn down by the Company provided that all previously issued Convertible Notes within the Arrangement have been converted into the shares of the Company or that a cool down period agreed between the parties has lapsed  unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. Each Tranche may be drawn in several parts.Winance has agreed to subscribe for the Convertible Notes issued by the Company with a conversion ratio calculated at the time the respective conversion is requested so that the conversion ratio is equal to 90 % of the lowest daily volume weighted average price observed over a period of fifteen (15) consecutive trading days prior to such conversion request.The Convertible Notes bear a zero interest rate. The Convertible Notes have a maturity of 12 months from the issuance of each Tranche. Each Tranche must be converted into the Company's shares upon maturity at the latest.In connection with the drawdown of each Tranche  Winance will receive Warrants free of charge. Winance has the right  but no obligation  to subscribe for the Company‚Äôs shares based on the Warrants. In connection with the Arrangement  Winance may be given maximum of 10 000 000 Warrants in the aggregate which entitle their holder to subscribe to maximum of 10 000 000 shares of the Company in the aggregate. The number of Warrants that shall be attached to the Convertible Notes of a Tranche shall be determined as follows: 20% of the nominal value of the Convertible Notes of a Tranche divided by the Exercise Price of Warrants  the resulting number of Warrants being rounded down to the nearest whole number. For the purposes of the aforesaid  the ""Exercise Price of Warrants"" shall be 110% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price in the 15 trading days immediately preceding the request to issue the relevant Tranche.The subscription period of the Company's shares pursuant to the Warrants is five (5) years from the issuance of each Warrant.The exact number of the Company's shares to be issued based on the conversion of the Convertible Notes and the exercise of the Warrants depends  in the manner described above  on the conversion ratio applied to the Convertible Notes and Warrants and is thus not yet known. Depending on the exact number of the Company's shares to be issued based on the conversion of the Convertible Notes and the exercise of the Warrants  it may be necessary for the Board of Directors of the Company to apply for additional authorizations from the general meeting of shareholders in order to implement the entire Arrangement.There is a weighty financial reason for the Company to issue the Convertible Notes and Warrants to Winance as the purpose of the Arrangement is to strengthen the tight working capital situation of the Company. The subscription price of the Convertible Notes and Warrants as well as the shares of the Company to be subscribed based on the Convertible Notes and Warrants is based on the agreement between the Company and Winance.The drawdown of each Tranche requires that certain representations and warranties given by the Company and other customary conditions relating to financing arrangements of this nature are met.Winance has the right to terminate the Arrangement if the Company‚Äôs operations become subject to a material adverse effect  there has been a change of control in the Company or in the event of default which  if curable  is not cured within 30 business days.Valoe will pay Winance on the Arrangement an upfront commitment fee equaling EUR 400 000 in Convertible Notes.The terms and conditions of the Convertible Notes and of the Warrants (without schedules) are included in all material respects in the Appendices 1 and 2 of this release.In Mikkeli on 10 February 2023Valoe OyjBOARD OF DIRECTORSFor more information:CEO Iikka Savisalo  Valoe Corporation tel. +35 40 521 6082email: iikka.savisalo@valoe.comDistribution:Nasdaq Helsinki OyMain mediawww.valoe.comValoe Corporation specializes in the clean energy  especially in photovoltaic solutions.

The mood at the start of the year was expectant in terms of the ending of the COVID-19 pandemic of the past two years and the lifting of the restrictions  and the year began with strong economic growth. However  Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine in February  created a new kind of uncertainty in the world and the war resulted in human suffering.The war‚Äôs impacts could been seen in our operating environment as economic uncertainty  rising energy prices and interest rates and high inflation. These multiplier effects showed in SATO‚Äôs business operations during the reporting year. We have approximately 25 000 homes in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku. In addition  SATO has 522 apartments in St. Petersburg  which make up approximately one per cent of the value of our investment assets. Since the start of the war in Ukraine  we have been reviewing opportunities to withdraw from the Russian business operations and we are searching actively for a solution.Story continuesDespite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental apartments in Finland  and the urbanisation trend continues. The rise in mortgage interest rates coupled with the increase in energy and other costs had a partial impact on the growth in rental apartment demand. Now  also some of the people looking for an owner-occupied apartment may consider renting an apartment.The competition between rental housing providers is tough and a large number of new rental apartments has been built especially in the Helsinki metropolitan area in recent years. The historically high rate of housing construction is slowing. There are significantly fewer housing starts than before  but a large number of new apartments will be completed in 2023. This will maintain the tight competition for good tenants and keep rent increases moderate  despite the pressure for rent to increase in the future due to the rising cost level.During the reporting year  our investments in rental apartments were EUR 190.5 million (167.1). In 2022  we completed 191 rental apartments and 52 FlexHomes. On 31 December 2022  a total of 1 418 apartments were under construction. During the second half of the reporting year  we made a decision to refrain from launching any new construction projects. Our decision was based on the dramatic rise in the cost level for construction and property maintenance and the increase in financing costs  while rent development remained moderate due to the market situation.During the first half of the year  we made a decision to launch new non-subsidised rental apartment construction projects in Rykmentinpuisto in Tuusula  Skanssi in Turku and Finnoo in Espoo. The Rykmentinpuisto project is our first new apartment investment in Tuusula in 15 years and the Skanssi project is the first new apartment investment in Turku in five years.In April of the reporting year  we sold 2 009 rental apartments mainly in the Lahti  Jyv√§skyl√§ and Oulu areas to the Swedish investment company Heimstaden. The sale was consistent with our strategy of focusing our apartment investments on the Helsinki metropolitan area and its commuting area along the main railway  and in Tampere and Turku and their surrounding municipalities.We continued to develop the customer experience at SATO during the year. The economic occupancy rate improved compared to the previous year and was 95.2% (94.9). Our tenant turnover for the reporting year fell and our customer satisfaction improved. We clarified and simplified the processes and operating models related to the customer experience and focused especially on building a harmonised and seamless service experience. In addition to developing digital services  we invested in our presence near to the customers.During the reporting year  we continued our sustainability work and released our sustainability programme for 2023‚àí2026  our second ever. The themes of the sustainability programme are sustainable housing  thriving communities and sustainable profitability. Our vision is to be a leader in sustainable rental housing. In our own sustainability goals  we have committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).Last autumn  SATO became the first rental housing provider to join the Ostavastuullisesti.fi service  which provides sustainable service and products and tips for sustainable living. A sustainability panel consisting of outside experts in sustainable production and consumption selected six of SATO‚Äôs buildings: Lupajantie 2 in Mellunkyl√§  Helsinki; Jokiniityntie 28 in Kirkkonummi; Lincolninaukio 4 in Keimola  Vantaa; Kotkatie 6 in Espoo and Jokiniementie 46 and 48 in Ver√§j√§m√§ki  Helsinki to be featured on the website as more sustainable options. We also participated in Rakli‚Äôs Green Homes activities (which started up in 2022)  with altogether 1 100 Green Homes which had either geothermal heat or consumption-based water invoicing or both.During the reporting year  we focused on supporting the well-being of SATO personnel and encouraged SATO employees to learn and grow continually. Our goal is for each person to be able to come up with ideas in their work and develop solutions for future rental housing. We want for everyone at SATO to have the courage to reinvent themselves and the ability to succeed. During the year  the entire organisation adopted the objectives and key results (OKR) model with which we are working towards better setting of objectives  closer monitoring of results and openness. The constantly increasing complexity in the operating environment challenges both experts‚Äô and supervisors‚Äô competence and thinking. In order to provide support to this end  we launched supervisor training in the coaching management style during the reporting year.I wish to thank all SATO employees for their committed and excellent work. I also wish to thank our partners and the residents of our SATOhomes for their good co-operation during the past year.Report of the Board of DirectorsReport of the Board of Directors 1 January‚Äì31 December 2022Operating environmentThe year 2022 began with strong economic growth. Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine in February of the reporting year brought uncertainty to the economic outlook  dramatically raising the price of energy and accelerating inflation. The exceptionally high inflation forced the central banks to react by rapidly hiking interest rates. During the reporting year  the ECB raised its key interest rate four times after the summer and it was 2.50% at the end of 2022. Due to the high inflation  interest rate hikes are expected to continue in early 2023. Inflation is anticipated to stabilise during 2023.Employment development was strong in early 2022  but slowed down towards year-end due to economic challenges. During the reporting year  consumers‚Äô confidence weakened to a historically low level after the start of the year  which showed in private consumption. According to the projection made by the Bank of Finland on 16 December 2022  Finland‚Äôs economic growth in 2022 will be 1.9 % due to the good start to the year. In 2023  the increase in energy prices and the cost of living is predicted to cause the economy to slide into a slight downturn and shrink by 0.5%.Uncertainty and rising interest rates are slowing housing sales. According to the statistics released by the Central Federation of Finnish Real Estate Agencies in December 2022  sales volumes of new and old apartments clearly fell in November compared to the five-year average. According to Statistics Finland‚Äôs preliminary data in December  the prices of old owner-occupied apartments fell in November 2022 in the whole of Finland by 3.4% compared to November of the previous year.The economic situation will decelerate the historically high rate of construction. The number of issued building permits began to fall already in 2021  but plenty of new apartments were and will be completed in 2022 and 2023  which is maintaining tight competition for good tenants and keeping rent increases moderate. The increased cost level resulting from inflation does  however  create pressure to increase rents in the future.The lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and improving employment resulted in a positive turnaround in internal migration to large growth centres in 2022 and demand for rental apartments has begun to grow. This  and SATO‚Äôs investments in making renting more efficient and improving customer service  were visible as an increase in SATO‚Äôs occupancy rate. Also  economic uncertainty  upward pressure on interest rates and increasing consumer prices contributed to the increase in the demand for rental apartments.Despite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental apartments  and the urbanisation trend continues. Dense urban living near services and along good public transport connections is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. The Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy strong growth  while according to Statistics Finland‚Äôs population projection  Finland‚Äôs population will start declining in 2031. The Helsinki metropolitan area is expected to grow by over 200 000 new residents by 2040. Close to 80% of the area‚Äôs residents already live in one- to two-person households  and the number of small households continues to rise. The proportion of immigrants living in the capital area is predicted to grow from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. Aging populations typically move closer to growth centres and the services they offer  and they increasingly expect housing-related services.The change in the population structure and urbanisation create a stable foundation for demand for rental housing especially in the capital area and in Tampere and Turku. Outside of growth centres  the real prices of homes are declining  which makes acquiring an owner-occupied apartment in growth centres even more challenging for people coming from those areas.StrategyCustomer experience  sustainability and sustainable housing  and SATO employees lie at the core of SATO‚Äôs strategy. We want to be closely involved in our customers‚Äô daily lives in order to serve them in the best possible way. We build homes that stand the test of time and we take care of them in line with the life-cycle principles. We enable sustainable housing for our residents and encourage them to make sustainable choices in their daily lives. We want all SATO employees to be able to contribute ideas and participate in developing future housing solutions.SATO is a housing investment company whose basic product is a rental apartment in an apartment building. We focus our investments on growth centres: the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku  because in these areas demand for apartments is the highest and the increase in value is expected to be stable over the longer term. Our operations are geared towards profitable growth.During the reporting year  our strategy implementation focused especially on developing the customer experience  improving customer satisfaction and retention  and ensuring an excellent moving-in experience. We prepared a sustainability programme for 2023‚Äì2026  which is based on feedback from our stakeholders  such as personnel  customers and partners. The themes of the sustainability programme are sustainable housing  thriving communities and sustainable profitability. In our own sustainability goals  we have committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). With regard to our personnel  we focused on supporting work well-being and developing an inspiring employee experience  competence and a coaching management style.SATO has set maintaining its investment grade credit rating as a strategic goal. Our return on equity target is 8%. In addition  our strategic goal is to achieve a continuously improving Net Promoter Score (NPS) from our residents.According to SATO‚Äôs dividend policy  a maximum of 40% of the cash flow from operations will be paid in annual dividends  depending on the market situation  investment level  the development of the equity ratio and the solvency ratio.Net sales and profitIn 2022  consolidated net sales were EUR 291.2 million (298.3).Operating profit was EUR 198.9 million (304.5). The operating profit without the fair value change of investment properties was EUR 213.8 million (175.4). The change in fair value was EUR -14.9 million (129.1).Net financing costs totalled EUR -47.0 million (-45.1).Profit before taxes was EUR 151.9 million (259.4).

Return on invested capital was 4.3% (6.7).Cash and cash equivalents at the end of December totalled EUR 60.5 million (8.5). Interest-bearing liabilities at the end of December totalled EUR 2 145.7 million (2 169.5)  of which loans subject to market terms accounted for EUR 1 991.3 million (1 994.5). The loan itemisation is in note 26 of the financial statements. At the end of the reporting year  the average loan interest rate was 2.3% (1.7). Net financing costs totalled EUR -47.0 million(-45.1). The average maturity of loans was 3.3 years (4.0).The calculated impact of changes in the market value of interest hedging on equity was EUR 48.1 million (15.1). During the reporting year  SATO increased the proportion of unsecured loans to 88.1% of all loans. At the end of the year  the proportion of unencumbered assets was 89.2% of the balance sheet.Group structureSATO Corporation is the parent company of SATO Group. At the end of the reporting year  the parent company had a total of 21 subsidiaries engaged in business operations (23). Mergers took place during the year in order to clarify the Group structure.SATO Corporation‚Äôs majority shareholder is Balder Finska Otas AB  whose parent company is Fastighets AB Balder  which is quoted on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.Housing businessOur housing business includes rental activities  customer service  lifecycle management and maintenance. Effective rental activities and digital services provide home-seekers with quick access to a home  and the Group with a steadily increasing cash flow. High-quality maintenance operations ensure the comfort of residents and that the apartments stay in good condition and maintain their value. We serve our customers in daily housing issues through our customer-oriented service organisation.The competition between rental housing providers has become tighter  as a large volume of new rental apartments have been built in growth centres  especially in the Helsinki metropolitan area  in recent years. Tenants now have a wide array of choices and a successful customer experience is more important than ever. We try to respond to this challenge by adjusting the organisation and our service processes. We want to be closely involved in our customers‚Äô daily lives in order to serve them in the best possible way.During the reporting year we expanded the house expert model further in the Helsinki metropolitan area. At the end of the year  SATO employed 62 house experts and the model is now in use to its full extent in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku. The house experts take care of the technical building work on homes and buildings. The purpose of our house expert operating model is to create a better customer experience and more efficient maintenance.SATO had approximately 45 000 customers at the end of the reporting year. We measure our successes in customer encounters using the Net Promoter Score (NPS). Our customer satisfaction improved during the reporting year. We clarified and simplified the processes and operating models related to the customer experience and focused especially on building a harmonised and seamless service experience. We invested in developing digital services  as well as our presence near to the customers. We also established closer collaboration between SATO employees working at our residents‚Äô buildings and improved internal communications.The economic occupancy rate improved compared to the previous year and was 95.2% (94.9) on average in Finland. The external tenant turnover rate for rental apartments was 28.4% (31.2). Rental income decreased 2.4% and was EUR 291.2 million (298.3).The average monthly rent of SATO‚Äôs rental apartments in Finland at the end of the reporting year was EUR 17.84 per m2 (17.46).Net rental income for apartments was EUR 200.4 million (210.6).Investment propertiesOn 31 December 2022  SATO owned a total of 24 999 apartments (26 791). Altogether 191 rental apartments were completed and 1 was acquired. The total number of divested rental apartments was 2 021  of which 2 009 rental apartments were sold to the Swedish investment company Heimstaden.Fair valueThe development of the value of rental apartments is a key factor for SATO. The housing stock is focussed on areas and apartment sizes that are expected to grow in demand in the long term. The allocation of building repairs is based on life-cycle plans and repair need specifications.The fair value of investment properties at the end of December totalled EUR 5 044.2 million (5 032.8). The change in the value of investment properties  including investments and divestments in the financial year  was EUR 11.4 million (279.3).The external expert JLL Finland Oy (JLL) issues a biannual statement on the valuation methods applied by SATO  the appropriateness of sources of information used and the quality and credibility of the valuation for Finnish investment properties. JLL‚Äôs latest statement was issued on the valuation carried out on 31 December 2022. The criteria for the determination of the fair value are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.The change in value was influenced by the increase in yield requirements and the decrease in the fair value of St. Petersburg housing assets.At the end of the year  the Helsinki metropolitan area‚Äôs commuting area accounted for 87.3%  Tampere for 6.4% and Turku for 5.1%  and St. Petersburg for roughly 1.2% of the value of apartments.Investments  divestments and property developmentInvestment activities are used to manage the housing portfolio and prepare the ground for growth. SATO‚Äôs investments in the 2000s in non-subsidised rental apartments total more than EUR 3 billion. SATO acquires and builds entire rental buildings and single rental apartments. Property development allows for new investments in rental apartments in Finland. The rental potential and value of rental apartments owned by SATO are developed through renovation activities.Investments in rental apartments were EUR 190.5 million (167.1). Investments in the Helsinki metropolitan area represented 84.0% of all investments in the reporting year. Investments in new apartments represented 57.1% of the investments. In addition  on 31 December 2022  binding purchase agreements in Finland totalled EUR 114.3 million (96.8).During the reporting year  2 021 rental apartments (26) were divested in Finland. Their total value was EUR 210.6 million (7.9). In April of the reporting year  we sold 2 009 rental apartments mainly in the Lahti  Jyv√§skyl√§ and Oulu areas to the Swedish investment company Heimstaden. The sale was consistent with our strategy based on which SATO is focusing its apartment investments on the Helsinki metropolitan area and its commuting area along the main railway  and in Tampere and Turku and their surrounding municipalities.The book value of plot reserves totalled EUR 40.8 million (43.4) at the end of December. The value of new plots acquired by the end of December totalled EUR 18.4 million (15.5).The permitted building volume for about 1 450 apartments is being developed for the plots in the company‚Äôs housing portfolio. This allows SATO to utilise existing infrastructure  create a denser urban structure and thus bring more customers closer to services and public transport connections.We collaborate with cities when areas are being developed and new housing is planned for them. As a long-term owner  housing investor and housing provider  SATO wants to build nice homes  residential areas and pleasant urban areas for decades to come. During the reporting year  we continued the development of the Hakunila area in Vantaa and Finnoo in Espoo  for example. In Helsinki  we were involved in planning the Mellunpuisto project in Mellunkyl√§ and we continued our collaboration with VR to develop the area it owns in Ilmala. During the reporting year  plots in complementary planning areas developed by SATO were sold to construction companies and other partners  enabling the construction of approximately 175‚àí200 owner-occupied apartments and roughly 25 state-subsidised rental apartments  thus promoting a diverse residential area and urban structure.In May 2022  construction of non-subsidised rental apartments began in Rykmentinpuisto in Tuusula. The area is a collaboration by several parties and the area will include different types of housing. SATO is building 92 non-subsidised rental apartments in the area. The Rykmentinpuisto Pataljoonantie project is SATO‚Äôs first new apartment investment in Tuusula in more than 15 years.In August 2022  SATO signed a deed to buy from Lujatalo an apartment building which is being built in Skanssi  Turku. The eight-storey building under construction at the address Sorakatu 9 will have 77 new rental apartments. This is SATO‚Äôs first new apartment investment in Turku in five years. Construction was begun in August 2022 and the apartments will be ready for residents at the end of 2023.We are building 257 new rental apartments at Peijinkuja in Finnoo  Espoo. Construction began in August 2022 and the apartments will be completed in stages during autumn 2024. The project is based on long-term development work in which we drew up a new local plan with the City of Espoo for a property that SATO owns in the old low-rise area of Hannus  which formerly featured terraced houses. The area is being transformed into a new area called Finnoo. SATO‚Äôs goal is to continue developing the Finnoo area in the future.During the reporting year  new rental apartments were finished on Lupajantie in Mellunm√§ki  Helsinki and on Jokiniityntie in Kirkkonummi.Due to rising construction  maintenance and financing costs and the moderate rent development resulting from the competitive situation  we made a decision to refrain from launching new construction projects and we are postponing their launch.In 2022  we completed 191 rental apartments (235) and 0 owner-occupied apartments (71) and 52 FlexHomes (0) in Finland. On 31 December 2022  a total of 1 418 apartments (1 152) were under construction: 1 418 rental apartments (1 100) and 0 owner-occupied apartments (0) and 0 FlexHomes (52). FlexHome is a short-term ownership concept that enables home ownership with a small initial capital outlay and which the resident can purchase entirely for themselves within five years of completion.A total of EUR 92.4 million (93.6) was spent on repairing and upgrading apartments.At the end of December  SATO owned 522 apartments (525) in St. Petersburg. The economic occupancy rate of rental apartments in St. Petersburg was 92.4% (97.7) on average. Since the start of the war in Ukraine  we have been reviewing opportunities to withdraw from the Russian business operations. Based on our studies  a fast withdrawal is not possible. For this reason  SATO will continue to rent residential apartments in St. Petersburg until a way to withdraw has been found. The company is actively seeking a solution.SustainabilityOur sustainability work during the reporting year was guided by SATO‚Äôs strategy and our sustainability programme for 2019‚Äì2022  which emphasised carbon-neutral cities and the well-being of residents and neighbourhoods.Due to the energy crisis resulting from the war in Ukraine  we increased the efficiency of our energy saving measures and paid more attention to the temperatures of apartments than earlier. We monitor and regulate the heating of some 21 000 SATOhomes using AI. Our goal is to maintain a temperature of approximately 21 degrees in SATOhomes  which is a healthy and energy-efficient indoor temperature. In addition to our own energy saving measures  we actively provided our residents with guidance on energy saving opportunities in their day-to-day lives. At the end of the year  we provided our residents with instructions on how to prepare for possible blackouts in the exceptional energy situation.During the reporting year  we launched a development project related to waste and sorting  in which we surveyed our homes‚Äô waste-collection points and inspected their lighting  the number of waste bins and signage. Based on the survey  we targeted repairs at the sites that needed them and they will continue in upcoming years. Our housing advisors‚Äô tours focused on waste guidance during the year. We pilot tested a clothing collection point on Kauppakartanonkatu in Helsinki‚Äôs It√§keskus.Some of our sustainable development measures are described below under ‚ÄòImpacts on the environment and society‚Äô.In the autumn of 2022  an external sustainability panel chose six of SATO‚Äôs rental apartment buildings to be among the Ostavastuullisesti.fi website‚Äôs more sustainable choices. SATO was the first rental housing provider to be included in the Ostavastuullisesti.fi service. Our following buildings were assessed to be a more sustainable choice: Lupajantie 2 in Mellunkyl√§  Helsinki; Jokiniityntie 28 in Kirkkonummi; Lincolninaukio 4 in Keimola  Vantaa; Kotkatie 6 in Espoo and Jokiniementie 46 and 48 in Ver√§j√§m√§ki  Helsinki.In 2022  we took part in Rakli‚Äôs newly launched Green Homes activities. At the end of 2022  we had altogether 1 100 Green Homes which had either geothermal heat or consumption-based water invoicing or both.We participated for the eighth time in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) assessment. SATO received two stars on a scale of one to five. SATO‚Äôs score in the Standing Investments Benchmark (existing properties) fell by one point from last year (score now at 73)  while in the Development Benchmark (construction projects) SATO‚Äôs score rose to 75 points from 71 points last year. We report on our sustainability annually in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative‚Äôs (GRI) reporting guidelines  and the environmental sustainability figures presented in the report have been verified by an independent third party  i.e. KPMG Oy Ab.During the reporting year  we collaborated on a project with the non-profit organisations No Fixed Abode and the Rehabilitation Foundation to help participants in the project find two of life‚Äôs essentials ‚Äì a home and a job. By the end of 2022  10 people who had participated in the project were living in a SATOhome.During 2022  we updated the materiality analysis and released a new sustainability programme for 2023‚Äì2026. Our vision is to be a leader in sustainable rental housing during the programme period.In 2020 we committed to reporting in compliance with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and in 2021  we conducted an extensive assessment of the risks and opportunities arising from climate change for SATO‚Äôs entire supply chain. In the framework  the risks are divided into four main categories: transition risks  acute and chronic physical risks and social risks. At the same time  we carried out a scenario analysis to look into how the two- and four-degree scenarios affect society and how SATO should prepare for these changes. During the reporting year  risks caused by climate change were part of SATO‚Äôs general risk assessment that is conducted internally each year. In 2022  two reports were made to SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors on climate risks and opportunities and their impact.The Corporate Governance Statement is published separately from the Report of the Board of Directors. SATO‚Äôs Corporate Governance Statement  Code of Conduct and sustainability programme are available at sato.fi.Impacts on the environment and societyOur objective is to systematically reduce the negative impacts of our operations on the environment. We reduce the load on the environment by regularly and proactively taking care of and repairing homes and properties according to the life-cycle principle  and by building properties primarily in existing urban environments and near good public transport connections.The planning of SATO‚Äôs new rental apartments always takes into account energy efficiency and solutions that will last for decades. In new properties  SATO‚Äôs goal is energy class A (energy performance indicator 75 or below)  which is significantly better than that required by the building code (energy performance indicator 90). All of the buildings that were completed during the reporting year were energy class A. The average EPI for buildings begun during 2022 was 72 and all of the housing starts are energy class A.We are committed to the Energy Efficiency Agreement targets for the property sector  aiming for a reduction in the total consumption of electricity and heat of 10.5% from the 2015 baseline by 2025.The use of renewable energy in heating significantly reduces the in-use emissions of homes. At every new building and renovation site  we look into the possibility of geothermal heat. We currently have 17 properties that are carbon neutral in terms of electricity and heating. During the reporting year  geothermal heat was being built on 12 properties. In addition  six properties had a solar power plant and solar power plants were being built on nine properties. In 2022  building electricity consisted entirely of emission-free electricity.During 2022  SATO converted the heating system to geothermal heat at the last properties which still had fossil-fuel-based heating  thus taking us a significant step closer to our goal of achieving in-use carbon neutrality.Vantaa Energy and SATO signed an energy partnership agreement in February 2022. Together with Vantaa Energy  we are developing carbon-neutral energy solutions for buildings‚Äô heating and cooling  which will help us achieve our carbon neutrality target by 2030 for in-use energy consumption.During the reporting year  we continued to invest in energy efficiency improvements in SATOhomes in connection with renovations. In renovations  our goal is to improve energy efficiency by some 30% compared to earlier. Due to the rise in heating and electricity prices  energy costs rose overall.During the reporting year  specific energy consumption fell 4.1%  specific electricity consumption rose 7.1% and specific water consumption fell 2.0% compared to 2021. Specific emissions from SATO‚Äôs apartments fell by 9.3% compared to 2021 and were 28.2 (31.1) carbon dioxide equivalent kilograms per square metre. Emissions are calculated according to the absolute consumption of district heat. Electricity was generated from emission-free nuclear power.According to the Ministry of the Environment  the built environment causes approximately one third of Finland‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions. The construction industry  together with the real estate sector and their related services  employ more than half a million people and bring in tax revenues for society. The construction industry does  however  have negative impacts not only on the environment  but also society and people. Some well-known examples of the construction industry‚Äôs negative impacts are the grey economy  occupational safety and human rights-related violations  as well as irregularities in procurement and delivery chains. We regularly assess and predict the social  economic and environmental risks related to our operations. We try to systematically reduce the identified negative impacts  for example by following our Code of Conduct  by combating the grey economy  by conducting audits and internal control  and by continuously developing our operations. During 2022  we decided to survey the current state of our compliance function in order to gain an overall picture of our policies and commitments.SATO has a whistleblowing channel through which SATO employees and external stakeholders can anonymously report critical concerns.The Group‚Äôs sustainability programme is available in its entirety at sato.fi.Development activitiesSATO‚Äôs development activities during the reporting year focused on developing sales and customer experience processes and operating models  the renewal of the invoicing processes and improving the continuous development operating model. We invested in developing digital services  as well as our presence near to the customers  and in building a uniform and seamless service experience. Our goal is to serve our customers in the best way possible  regardless of time or place.Based on customer feedback  we also developed  during the reporting year  our processes involving the rental of a new home. The changes made daily work more efficient for our rental team  which also means even better service for our customers. We revamped the reservation of apartment viewings to make them more flexible for the customer and to pilot test the online reservation of viewings no matter the time or place. The apartment viewings were mostly held by our own viewing agents. We updated the apartment application process on the sato.fi website and in 2022 made it possible for our customers to apply for homes using the ‚Äòmore sustainable option‚Äô search criterion.In our development operations last year  we also focused on renewing the invoicing processes and we piloted a new invoicing system in summer 2022. The new system offers better opportunities to view up-to-date invoicing information and the plan is to roll it out in full in spring 2023.In developing the business  we adopted a continuous development model at SATO during the reporting year. We defined the roles related to the model and will develop the activities as smaller components rather than large units  which will speed up development work and allow processes to be improved more effectively.A total of EUR 3.2 million (3.2) was spent on development  corresponding to approximately 1.1% of net sales.Risk managementRisk management is used to ensure that risks impacting the company‚Äôs business are identified  managed and monitored. The main risks of SATO‚Äôs business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.SATO‚Äôs most significant risks are related to prolonged inflation and the resulting rise in interest rates. As a result of the war in Ukraine  the prices of energy  food  materials and commodities have increased dramatically and interest rates have risen. Higher cost of living can have a negative impact on consumers‚Äô purchasing power and ability to meet their obligations. If the strong growth in the cost of financing and maintenance costs continues and the market situation does not provide an opportunity to transfer the higher costs into rents in full  this can have a negative impact on the fair value of investment assets and the company‚Äôs ability to finance investments  which means that new investments and renovations will have to be postponed.The most significant risks in the renting of apartments are related to economic cycles and fluctuations in demand and supply. Market risk can increase the supply of rental housing to a point that it exceeds demand. This leads to rental housing vacancies and pressure to even out or lower the rent level especially for the old housing portfolio.A clear weakening in the housing market could have a negative impact on the market value of SATO‚Äôs housing portfolio. In accordance with its strategy  SATO focuses its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing its existing housing portfolio  thus ensuring the rental potential of its apartments and the development of their value.Changes in official regulations and legislation  as well as the uncertainty stemming from them  may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and thus on SATO‚Äôs business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and also calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group‚Äôs treasury policy  which has been approved by SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors. Our financial risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other long-term financing commitments. The company established a EUR 1.5 billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) bond programme in 2019.The means for managing the liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  committed credit facilities of EUR 700 million and a commercial paper programme of EUR 400 million. We increase the amount of reserves as the financing requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating rate loans form an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed and floating rate loans either by issuing fixed rate loans or by interest rate hedges. According to our treasury policy  our objective is to keep the ratio of fixed rate loans at over 60 % of debt portfolio after interest hedging.There are risks related to the business environment in our St. Petersburg operations  including currency risk. The consolidation of foreign currency-denominated assets in the consolidated financial statements also involves a translation risk. Possibilities of hedging the translation risk are evaluated in accordance with our financial policy. SATO has abstained from making new investments in Russia for a long time. Since the start of the war in Ukraine  the company has been reviewing opportunities to withdraw from the Russian business operations. Based on our studies  a fast withdrawal is not possible  which is why SATO will continue to rent residential apartments in St. Petersburg until a way to withdraw has been found. The company is actively seeking a solution. The Russian operating environment is expected to be extremely uncertain and it may cause disturbances in SATO‚Äôs business operations in Russia and with parties related to the Russian business. This can affect SATO‚Äôs ability to make payments to suppliers  its employees and authorities  and to receive payments from customers  which can have a significant adverse impact on SATO‚Äôs business operations in Russia. If the Ukraine war is prolonged  doing business in Russia may have a negative impact on the company‚Äôs reputation and it may make doing business difficult in Finland and weaken the company‚Äôs ability to procure financing on the market. It may also have an adverse impact on the financial result or operations of SATO‚Äôs properties  not to mention on financing costs or values.A more detailed description of risks and risk management is available on the Group‚Äôs website www.sato.fi.Pending legal actionsSATO has no official procedures  legal actions or arbitration proceedings pending that would have a significant impact on the company‚Äôs financial standing or profitability  and SATO is not aware of any threat of such proceedings.SharesOn 31 December 2022  the share capital of SATO Corporation was EUR 4 442 192.00 and there were 56 783 067 shares.

If a shareholder chooses not to exercise their nomination right  the right will pass on to the next largest shareholder. The State Pension Fund  the company‚Äôs fourth largest shareholder on 1 October 2022  did not exercise its nomination right  and the right was passed to Erkka Valkila  the fifth largest shareholder. The Committee consisted of representatives of the following shareholders: Balder Finska Otas AB (Erik Selin)  Stichting Depositary APG Strategic Real Estate Pool (Hans Spikker)  Elo Mutual Pension Insurance Company (Hanna Hiidenpalo) and Erkka Valkila.Board of Directors  CEO and auditorsThe Annual General Meeting held on 24 March 2022 confirmed that the Board of Directors consists of six members.In 2022  the members of SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors were chairman Erik Selin and ordinary members Esa Lager  Tarja P√§√§kk√∂nen  Sharam Rahi  Johannus (Hans) Spikker and Timo Stenius.The Board of Directors convened 11 times in 2022. The Board‚Äôs work is supported by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.In 2022  Antti Aarnio  M.Sc. (Tech.)  was SATO‚Äôs CEO.As the company‚Äôs auditor  the Annual General Meeting selected the audit firm Deloitte Oy  which appointed APA Aleksi Martamo as the auditor in charge. The auditor‚Äôs term in office is the financial year  and the auditor‚Äôs duties end at the closing of the next Annual General Meeting.Members of the Management GroupDuring the reporting period 2022  the Corporate Management Group consisted of Antti Aarnio  CEO  Arto Aalto  EVP  Investments  Markku Honkasalo  CFO  Janne Ojalehto  CCO (until 27 January 2023) and Elina Vaurasalo  EVP  Housing Business.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO‚Äôs business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence  the development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  the general competitive situation and interest rates.Employment development was strong in early 2022  but slowed down towards year-end due to economic challenges. During the reporting year  consumers‚Äô confidence weakened to a historically low level after the start of the year  which showed in private consumption. According to the projection made by the Bank of Finland on 16 December 2022  Finland‚Äôs economic growth in 2022 will be 1.9% due to the good start to the year. In 2023  the increase in energy prices and the cost of living is predicted to cause the economy to slide into a slight downturn and shrink by 0.5%.Uncertainty and rising interest rates are slowing housing sales. According to the statistics released by the Central Federation of Finnish Real Estate Agencies in December 2022  sales volumes of new and old apartments clearly fell in November compared to the five-year average. According to Statistics Finland‚Äôs preliminary data in December  the prices of old owner-occupied apartments fell in November 2022 in the whole of Finland by 3.4% compared to November of the previous year.The economic situation will decelerate the historically high rate of construction. The number of issued building permits began to fall already in 2021  but plenty of new apartments were and will be completed in 2022 and 2023  which is maintaining tight competition for good tenants and keeping rent increases moderate. The increased cost level resulting from inflation does  however  create pressure to increase rents in the future.The lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and improving employment resulted in a positive turnaround in internal migration to large growth centres in 2022 and demand for rental apartments has begun to grow. This  and SATO‚Äôs investments in making renting more efficient and improving customer service  were visible as an increase in SATO‚Äôs occupancy rate. Also  economic uncertainty  upward pressure on interest rates and increasing consumer prices contributed to the increase in the demand for rental apartments.As tenants have a wider array of choices  a successful customer experience is more important than ever. SATO is investing strongly in increasing its customer presence and developing digital services.In line with its majority shareholder‚Äôs operating model  SATO Corporation will not publish guidance on its 2023 earnings. The parent company of Balder Finska Otas AB is Fastighets AB Balder  which is quoted on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.Proposal of the Board of Directors for the distribution of profitOn 31 December 2022  the parent company‚Äôs distributable equity was EUR 512 557 145.56  of which profit for the period was EUR 129 644 613.16.

Underwriting profit amounted to EUR 1 314 million (1 282)  representing year-on-year growth of 2 per cent or 13 per cent adjusted for COVID-19 effects reported in 2021. The Group combined ratio was solid at 82.1 per cent (81.4)  supported by excellent performance in Nordic P&C and benefits from higher discount rates. Excluding the reported COVID-19 effects in 2021  the combined ratio would have improved by 1.0 percentage points year-on-year. Gross written premiums increased by 6 per cent to EUR 8 136 million (7 644)  driven by strong renewals  high retention and disciplined pricing. Sampo targets mid-single digit per cent underwriting profit growth on average and a combined ratio below 86 per cent for 2021-2023.If P&C‚Äôs underwriting profit increased 11 per cent to EUR 985 million (891) and the combined ratio improved to 80.3 per cent (81.3). The result was driven by a 7.2 per cent currency adjusted premium growth and continued strong underlying performance. Premium development was supported by broad-based growth across all business areas  with Industrial and the Baltics seeing the most notable positive development. In the largest business area  Private  currency adjusted premium growth remained solid at 3.5 per cent despite a decline in Nordic new car sales. The adjusted risk ratio improved by approximately 0.5 percentage points year-on-year. In addition to the strong underwriting development  the significant changes in the interest rate environment during 2022 increased If‚Äôs fixed income running yield to 3.2 per cent (1.5). Profit before taxes increased to EUR 1 217 million (1 077).Topdanmark‚Äôs profit before taxes for 2022 in Sampo Group‚Äôs profit and loss account decreased to EUR 220 million (346)  as the investment result was affected by the adverse market environment. The sale of Topdanmark life insurance business in the fourth quarter of 2022 supported the result by EUR 72 million. The combined ratio stood at 83.1 per cent (82.3).Hastings reported solid top-line growth with resilient margins in a challenging UK motor insurance market  in which the claims inflation remained elevated throughout the year. Gross written premiums grew by 15 per cent on a currency adjusted basis in 2022  supported by high retention and disciplined pricing. Live customer policies increased 2 per cent year-on-year to over 3.2 million  driven by a 33 per cent growth in home insurance  while motor policy count was stable. Hastings‚Äô operating ratio increased to 89.7 per cent (80.3). Profit before taxes amounted to EUR 73 million (127)  or EUR 131 million (168) excluding the non-operational depreciation and amortisation.The Mandatum segment‚Äôs profit before taxes for 2022 decreased to EUR 207 million (291)  reflecting lower realised gains and an increase in the group contribution to Sampo plc to EUR 29 million (15). Mandatum‚Äôs net flows in third-party assets remained positive in every quarter  but were outweighed by the decline in market values  leading to assets under management of EUR 10.3 billion at the end of 2022  down from EUR 11.1 billion at the year-end 2021. Mandatum Life‚Äôs Solvency II ratio increased to 248 per cent (190)  driven by higher interest rates and lower solvency capital requirement.The profit before taxes of EUR 1 863 million (3 171) for 2022 includes accounting effects of EUR 138 million (982) defined as extraordinary items in accordance with Sampo Group‚Äôs dividend policy. Of the total amount  EUR 103 million related to the sale of Nordea shares  EUR 72 million to the sale of Topdanmark Life and EUR -37 million to the reclassification of Nordax from an associated company to fair value investment. Excluding these items  the profit before taxes declined to EUR 1 725 million (2 189)  mainly as a result of Nordea no longer being consolidated as an associate. The total comprehensive income  which takes changes in the market values of assets into account  was affected by the adverse capital markets environment and amounted to EUR -26 million (3 448).Sampo Group‚Äôs year-end 2022 Solvency II ratio stood at 210 per cent  up from 185 per cent at the year-end 2021  but down from 256 per cent at the end of the third quarter. The decrease over the third quarter was primarily driven by the inclusion of the dividend proposal and the planned new buyback programme. Sampo targets a solvency ratio of 170‚Äì190 per cent.Sampo Group‚Äôs financial leverage was 25.6 per cent at the end of 2022  up from 23.8 per cent at the end of 2021  but slightly down from 25.9 per cent at the end of the third quarter. Sampo targets a financial leverage ratio below 30 per cent.Sampo plc‚Äôs Board of Directors proposes a dividend of EUR 2.60 per share for the 2022 financial year to the Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 May 2023. This consists of a regular dividend (formerly known as the insurance dividend as introduced at the 2021 CMD) of EUR 1.80 per share (1.70)  representing growth of 6 per cent  and an extra dividend of EUR 0.80 per share. In addition to the dividend  management is to propose to the Board a new EUR 400 million buyback programme.The implementation of IFRS 17 and 9 on 1 January 2023 will bring asset and liability side mark-to-market effects into Sampo‚Äôs reported net income. As a result  the Sampo Board has decided to adjust the Group‚Äôs dividend policy  such that the payout ratio is measured against a newly defined operational result rather than net profit excluding items defined as extraordinary  as previously. The change is not expected to have any significant effect on the size and trajectory of dividends. The adjusted dividend policy is described in the section Dividend proposal.On 7 December 2022  Sampo plc announced that the Board of Directors had decided to undertake a strategic review of Mandatum in line with Sampo‚Äôs strategic focus on P&C insurance. The Board continues to review a number of different options  with the aim to evaluate whether a separation of Mandatum could create shareholder value. Sampo expects to provide a further update on the strategic review by the end of the first quarter of 2023.In 2022  Sampo repurchased its own shares through three buyback programmes. Of the latest buyback programme of EUR 1 billion  launched on 9 June 2022  EUR 845 million had been executed at year-end 2022. The programme was completed on 8 February 2023. In total  Sampo repurchased 32 million shares for a total of EUR 1.4 billion in 2022.FOURTH QUARTER 2022 IN BRIEFIn October-December 2022  Sampo Group reported profit before taxes of EUR 390 million (1 197). Excluding accounting effects treated as extraordinary items in accordance with Sampo Group‚Äôs dividend policy  profit before taxes amounted to EUR 355 million (452). Earnings per share amounted to EUR 0.50 (1.89)  or EUR 0.41 (0.55) excluding extraordinary items. Total comprehensive income  which takes changes in the market values of assets into account  amounted to EUR 448 million (1 269).Group underwriting profit increased to EUR 304 million (297). Excluding COVID-19 effects reported in the comparison period  underwriting profit grew by 12 per cent. The Group combined ratio amounted to 83.7 per cent (83.0).If P&C reported profit before taxes of EUR 285 million (260) and underwriting profit of EUR 229 million (210). The combined ratio was 81.7 per cent (82.9) and gross written premium growth 7.8 per cent on a currency adjusted basis. The adjusted risk ratio  which excludes the impact of large losses  severe weather  reported COVID-19 effects and prior year development  improved by 0.2 percentage points year-on-year.Topdanmark‚Äôs profit before taxes amounted to EUR 128 million (89) and combined ratio was 82.1 per cent (80.6).Hastings profit before taxes amounted to EUR 7 million (11). The operating ratio deteriorated to 94.0 per cent (87.9)  driven by increased claims frequency due to harsh weather conditions particularly in December. Gross written premiums increased by 31 per cent year-on-year on a currency adjusted basis. Live customer policy count remained stable  supported by continued strong growth in home insurance.The Mandatum segment‚Äôs profit before taxes amounted to EUR 18 million (91)  net of a profit contribution to Sampo plc of EUR 29 million (15). Excluding the profit contribution  profit before taxes stood at EUR 47 million (106). Mandatum‚Äôs third-party assets under management increased to EUR 10.3 billion from EUR 10.1 billion at the end of the third quarter  supported by strong net flows of EUR 213 million during the quarter.GROUP CEO‚ÄôS COMMENTSampo‚Äôs fourth quarter was characterised by strong operational execution  robust financial results and further steps on our strategic agenda. As we conclude a successful year  I am delighted that we are announcing EUR 1.7 billion (EUR 3.40 per share) of planned capital returns to shareholders.Sampo‚Äôs P&C insurance operations delivered excellent fourth quarter underwriting results of EUR 304 million  representing 13 per cent year-on-year growth  after adjusting for COVID-19 effects in the prior year. Notably  this result was achieved despite adverse weather in the form of heavy snowfall and cold weather. As always  our focus has been on assisting affected customers through superior service  which is a cornerstone of our strategy and instrumental in securing high retention rates over the long term.The result was driven mainly by our Nordic P&C business  where If grew underwriting profit excluding COVID-19 effects by 23 per cent  supported by an excellent fourth quarter combined ratio of 81.7 per cent and currency adjusted premium growth of 7.8 per cent. Importantly  our Nordic customer retention has remained high as we continue to cover claims inflation of 4‚Äì5 per cent with rate increases. The strongest pricing momentum is observed in Industrial  but fourth quarter premium growth also benefited from a stabilisation of new cars sales  albeit at a relatively low level  including support from high electric vehicle sales.In the UK  market conditions remained challenging  but Hastings achieved premium growth of 15 per cent over 2022 as it implemented significant rate increases to cover claims inflation of 12 per cent. Adverse weather had a negative impact on Hastings‚Äô operating ratio  pushing this to 89.7 per cent for 2022 as a whole. Although above our annual 88 per cent target  Hastings has delivered a relatively resilient result in what has been a challenging year for the UK motor market. I believe this reflects skilful operational execution and the company‚Äôs strong positioning and capabilities  which I expect will enable attractive profit growth as market conditions improve.In the capital markets  the fourth quarter saw further increases in interest rates and positive development in equity markets. Due to the short duration of our fixed income portfolio  we were able to continue to rapidly increase our running yield. Over 2022  higher running yields have added roughly EUR 230 million to Sampo‚Äôs annual pre-tax earning power  with the largest contribution coming from If P&C  which has more than doubled its running yield to 3.2 per cent (1.5).In December  Sampo‚Äôs Board of Directors launched a strategic review of Mandatum to evaluate whether separating the entity from the Group could add shareholder value. As a pure P&C insurer  Sampo could deliver higher and more resilient returns on capital  while an independent Mandatum would enjoy greater strategic flexibility to invest in growth. On the other hand  Mandatum makes an attractive contribution to the Group‚Äôs cash flow that supports value creation over time. We expect to provide an update on the review by the end of the first quarter of 2023.Turning to capital management  Sampo remains committed to capital discipline with a EUR 2.60 per share dividend proposal for 2022 and a EUR 400 million share buyback programme  which management is to propose. Adjusting for these actions  the Group retains EUR 2 per share of excess capital above the needs of the insurance operations  most of which is tied into private equity investments held in Sampo plc.Torbj√∂rn MagnussonGroup CEOOUTLOOKOutlook for 2023Sampo Group‚Äôs P&C insurance operations are expected to achieve underwriting margins that meet the annual targets set for 2021‚Äì2023. At Group level  Sampo targets a combined ratio of below 86 per cent  while the target for its largest subsidiary  If P&C  is below 85 per cent. Hastings targets an operating ratio of below 88 per cent.The combined and operating ratios of Sampo Group‚Äôs P&C insurance operations are subject to volatility driven by  among other factors  seasonal weather patterns  large claims and prior year development. These effects are particularly relevant for individual segments and business areas  such as the Danish and UK operations.The mark-to-market component of the net financial result will be significantly influenced by capital markets‚Äô developments  particularly in life insurance.With regard to Topdanmark  reference is made to the profit forecast model that the company publishes on a quarterly basis.The major risks and uncertainties for the Group in the near-termIn its current day-to-day business activities Sampo Group is exposed to various risks and uncertainties  mainly through its major business units.Major risks affecting the Group companies‚Äô profitability and its variation are market  credit  insurance and operational risks. At the Group level  sources of risks are the same  although they are not directly additive due to the effects of diversification.Uncertainties in the form of major unforeseen events may have an immediate impact on the Group‚Äôs profitability. The identification of unforeseen events is easier than the estimation of their probabilities  timing  and potential outcomes. During 2022 the global economy was hit by the war in Ukraine and at the same time  inflation pressures intensified and broadened forcing central banks to raise interest rates sharply. This may lead to both a further significant slowdown in economic growth and a deterioration in the debt service capacity of businesses  households and governments. Furthermore  the re-alignment of energy supplies in Europe takes time and the energy crisis could continue for several years. These developments are currently causing significant uncertainties in economic and capital market development. At the same time rapidly evolving hybrid threats create new challenges for states and businesses. There are also a number of widely identified macroeconomic  political and other sources of uncertainty which can  in various ways  affect the financial services industry in a negative manner.Other sources of uncertainty are unforeseen structural changes in the business environment and already identified trends and potential wide-impact events. These external drivers may have a long-term impact on how Sampo Group‚Äôs business will be conducted. Examples of identified trends are demographic changes  sustainability issues  and technological developments in areas such as artificial intelligence and digitalisation including threats posed by cybercrime.DIVIDEND PROPOSALDividendUnder Sampo Group‚Äôs capital management framework  Sampo will return ongoing surplus capital generation from its insurance operations through a regular dividend. Other forms of surplus capital generation  including possible proceeds from disposals of financial investments  are returned through additional dividends and/or buybacks  to the extent that the funds are not utilised to support business development. Sampo targets a Solvency II ratio of 170‚Äì190 per cent and financial leverage below 30 per cent.According to Sampo plc‚Äôs Dividend Policy applied for distribution of 2022 earnings  total annual dividends paid shall represent at least 70 per cent of Sampo Group‚Äôs net profit for the year (excluding extraordinary items). In 2022  accounting items related to the sale of Nordea shares  the sale of Topdanmark life insurance operations and the reclassification of Nordax from an associated company to fair value investment have been defined as extraordinary in accordance with Sampo‚Äôs dividend policy.The parent company‚Äôs distributable capital and reserves totalled EUR 6 716 million of which profit for the financial year 2022 was EUR 1 780 million. Based on the policies outlined above  the Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a total dividend of EUR 2.60 per share be paid to all shares except for the shares held by Sampo plc on the dividend record date of 22 May 2023. The total dividend includes a regular dividend of EUR 1.80 per share as well as an extra dividend of EUR 0.80 per share.As earnings per share excluding extraordinary items amounted to EUR 2.41 per share  the payout ratio for the total dividend equates to 108 per cent. The remainder of the distributable funds are left in the company‚Äôs equity capital. After adjusting for the proposed dividend  Sampo Group‚Äôs 2022 year-end distributable funds amounted to EUR 5 378 million  Group Solvency II ratio to 210 per cent and financial leverage to 28.6 per cent.Dividend paymentThe dividend is proposed to be paid to the shareholders registered in the register of shareholders held by Euroclear Finland Oy as at the record date of 22 May 2023. The Board proposes that the dividends be paid on 31 May 2023.The issuer of the Swedish depository receipts shall ensure that the dividend is paid to the depository receipt holders registered in the securities depository and settlement register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB as at the record date of 22 May 2023  which payment shall be made in Swedish kronor.Financial positionNo significant changes have taken place in the company's financial position since the end of the financial year. The company's liquidity position is good and in the view of the Board  the proposed distributions do not jeopardise the company's ability to fulfil its obligations.Adjustment to Sampo Group‚Äôs dividend policyThe implementation of IFRS 17 and 9 on 1 January 2023 will bring asset and liability side mark-to-market effects into Sampo‚Äôs reported net income. As a result  the Sampo Board has decided to adjust the Group‚Äôs dividend policy  such that the minimum payout ratio of 70 per cent is measured against a newly defined operational result rather than net profit excluding items defined as extraordinary  as previously. The change is not expected to have any significant effect on the size and trajectory of dividends. The adjustment is effective to payouts made in respect of the 2023 and later financial years‚Äô.According to the updated dividend policy  Sampo is to pay a stable and sustainable regular dividend that grows in line with the Group‚Äôs earnings over time. Total annual dividends paid will be at least 70 per cent of Group‚Äôs operational result.The operational result is similar to net profit excluding items defined as extraordinary used under IFRS 4  with the main differences being that it excludes all result effects from discount rate changes as well as non-operational amortisation in Sampo‚Äôs P&C operations  and that Mandatum‚Äôs profit is replaced with the dividend stream that it provides to Sampo plc. The full definition of the operational result can be found at www.sampo.com/dividend .Sampo is committed to operating a strong and efficient balance sheet  as defined by the Group‚Äôs capital management framework. To enable this  regular dividends can be complemented with distributions of excess capital via share buybacks and/or extra dividends.OTHER DEVELOPMENTSStrategic review of MandatumOn 7 December 2022  Sampo plc announced that the Board of Directors had decided to undertake a strategic review of Mandatum in line with Sampo‚Äôs strategic focus on P&C insurance. The Board continues to review a number of different options  with the aim to evaluate whether a separation of Mandatum could create shareholder value.The Board of Directors of Sampo plc is content with the current Group structure as it offers diversification in terms of business exposures as well as capital and cash generation. Sampo expects to provide a further update on the strategic review by the end of the first quarter of 2023.EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODShare buyback programmeSampo‚Äôs share buyback programme of EUR 1 billion announced on 9 June 2022 continued after the end of the reporting period. The buyback programme was completed on 8 February 2023  when at market close  the company held  after cancellation of the own shares on 8 December 2022  in total 5.4 million Sampo A shares representing 1.05 per cent of the total number of shares in Sampo plc. Sampo had bought altogether 22.1 million A shares under the share buyback programme between 10 June 2022 and 8 February 2023  of which 16.7 million shares were cancelled on 8 December 2022. Further information on the buyback programme is available on www.sampo.com/sharebuyback .Proposal for the new Chair of the BoardSampo disclosed on 30 January 2023 that its Nomination and Remuneration Committee plans to propose previous Board member Antti M√§kinen as a new member of the Board of Directors of Sampo plc at the Annual General Meeting on 17 May 2023  and to nominate him as Chair of the Board of Directors.

Underwriting profit amounted to EUR 1 314 million (1 282)  representing year-on-year growth of 2 per cent or 13 per cent adjusted for COVID-19 effects reported in 2021. The Group combined ratio was solid at 82.1 per cent (81.4)  supported by excellent performance in Nordic P&C and benefits from higher discount rates. Excluding the reported COVID-19 effects in 2021  the combined ratio would have improved by 1.0 percentage points year-on-year. Gross written premiums increased by 6 per cent to EUR 8 136 million (7 644)  driven by strong renewals  high retention and disciplined pricing. Sampo targets mid-single digit per cent underwriting profit growth on average and a combined ratio below 86 per cent for 2021-2023.If P&C‚Äôs underwriting profit increased 11 per cent to EUR 985 million (891) and the combined ratio improved to 80.3 per cent (81.3). The result was driven by a 7.2 per cent currency adjusted premium growth and continued strong underlying performance. Premium development was supported by broad-based growth across all business areas  with Industrial and the Baltics seeing the most notable positive development. In the largest business area  Private  currency adjusted premium growth remained solid at 3.5 per cent despite a decline in Nordic new car sales. The adjusted risk ratio improved by approximately 0.5 percentage points year-on-year. In addition to the strong underwriting development  the significant changes in the interest rate environment during 2022 increased If‚Äôs fixed income running yield to 3.2 per cent (1.5). Profit before taxes increased to EUR 1 217 million (1 077).Topdanmark‚Äôs profit before taxes for 2022 in Sampo Group‚Äôs profit and loss account decreased to EUR 220 million (346)  as the investment result was affected by the adverse market environment. The sale of Topdanmark life insurance business in the fourth quarter of 2022 supported the result by EUR 72 million. The combined ratio stood at 83.1 per cent (82.3).Hastings reported solid top-line growth with resilient margins in a challenging UK motor insurance market  in which the claims inflation remained elevated throughout the year. Gross written premiums grew by 15 per cent on a currency adjusted basis in 2022  supported by high retention and disciplined pricing. Live customer policies increased 2 per cent year-on-year to over 3.2 million  driven by a 33 per cent growth in home insurance  while motor policy count was stable. Hastings‚Äô operating ratio increased to 89.7 per cent (80.3). Profit before taxes amounted to EUR 73 million (127)  or EUR 131 million (168) excluding the non-operational depreciation and amortisation.The Mandatum segment‚Äôs profit before taxes for 2022 decreased to EUR 207 million (291)  reflecting lower realised gains and an increase in the group contribution to Sampo plc to EUR 29 million (15). Mandatum‚Äôs net flows in third-party assets remained positive in every quarter  but were outweighed by the decline in market values  leading to assets under management of EUR 10.3 billion at the end of 2022  down from EUR 11.1 billion at the year-end 2021. Mandatum Life‚Äôs Solvency II ratio increased to 248 per cent (190)  driven by higher interest rates and lower solvency capital requirement.The profit before taxes of EUR 1 863 million (3 171) for 2022 includes accounting effects of EUR 138 million (982) defined as extraordinary items in accordance with Sampo Group‚Äôs dividend policy. Of the total amount  EUR 103 million related to the sale of Nordea shares  EUR 72 million to the sale of Topdanmark Life and EUR -37 million to the reclassification of Nordax from an associated company to fair value investment. Excluding these items  the profit before taxes declined to EUR 1 725 million (2 189)  mainly as a result of Nordea no longer being consolidated as an associate. The total comprehensive income  which takes changes in the market values of assets into account  was affected by the adverse capital markets environment and amounted to EUR -26 million (3 448).Sampo Group‚Äôs year-end 2022 Solvency II ratio stood at 210 per cent  up from 185 per cent at the year-end 2021  but down from 256 per cent at the end of the third quarter. The decrease over the third quarter was primarily driven by the inclusion of the dividend proposal and the planned new buyback programme. Sampo targets a solvency ratio of 170‚Äì190 per cent.Sampo Group‚Äôs financial leverage was 25.6 per cent at the end of 2022  up from 23.8 per cent at the end of 2021  but slightly down from 25.9 per cent at the end of the third quarter. Sampo targets a financial leverage ratio below 30 per cent.Sampo plc‚Äôs Board of Directors proposes a dividend of EUR 2.60 per share for the 2022 financial year to the Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 May 2023. This consists of a regular dividend (formerly known as the insurance dividend as introduced at the 2021 CMD) of EUR 1.80 per share (1.70)  representing growth of 6 per cent  and an extra dividend of EUR 0.80 per share. In addition to the dividend  management is to propose to the Board a new EUR 400 million buyback programme.The implementation of IFRS 17 and 9 on 1 January 2023 will bring asset and liability side mark-to-market effects into Sampo‚Äôs reported net income. As a result  the Sampo Board has decided to adjust the Group‚Äôs dividend policy  such that the payout ratio is measured against a newly defined operational result rather than net profit excluding items defined as extraordinary  as previously. The change is not expected to have any significant effect on the size and trajectory of dividends. The adjusted dividend policy is described in the section Dividend proposal.On 7 December 2022  Sampo plc announced that the Board of Directors had decided to undertake a strategic review of Mandatum in line with Sampo‚Äôs strategic focus on P&C insurance. The Board continues to review a number of different options  with the aim to evaluate whether a separation of Mandatum could create shareholder value. Sampo expects to provide a further update on the strategic review by the end of the first quarter of 2023.In 2022  Sampo repurchased its own shares through three buyback programmes. Of the latest buyback programme of EUR 1 billion  launched on 9 June 2022  EUR 845 million had been executed at year-end 2022. The programme was completed on 8 February 2023. In total  Sampo repurchased 32 million shares for a total of EUR 1.4 billion in 2022.FOURTH QUARTER 2022 IN BRIEFIn October-December 2022  Sampo Group reported profit before taxes of EUR 390 million (1 197). Excluding accounting effects treated as extraordinary items in accordance with Sampo Group‚Äôs dividend policy  profit before taxes amounted to EUR 355 million (452). Earnings per share amounted to EUR 0.50 (1.89)  or EUR 0.41 (0.55) excluding extraordinary items. Total comprehensive income  which takes changes in the market values of assets into account  amounted to EUR 448 million (1 269).Group underwriting profit increased to EUR 304 million (297). Excluding COVID-19 effects reported in the comparison period  underwriting profit grew by 12 per cent. The Group combined ratio amounted to 83.7 per cent (83.0).If P&C reported profit before taxes of EUR 285 million (260) and underwriting profit of EUR 229 million (210). The combined ratio was 81.7 per cent (82.9) and gross written premium growth 7.8 per cent on a currency adjusted basis. The adjusted risk ratio  which excludes the impact of large losses  severe weather  reported COVID-19 effects and prior year development  improved by 0.2 percentage points year-on-year.Topdanmark‚Äôs profit before taxes amounted to EUR 128 million (89) and combined ratio was 82.1 per cent (80.6).Hastings profit before taxes amounted to EUR 7 million (11). The operating ratio deteriorated to 94.0 per cent (87.9)  driven by increased claims frequency due to harsh weather conditions particularly in December. Gross written premiums increased by 31 per cent year-on-year on a currency adjusted basis. Live customer policy count remained stable  supported by continued strong growth in home insurance.The Mandatum segment‚Äôs profit before taxes amounted to EUR 18 million (91)  net of a profit contribution to Sampo plc of EUR 29 million (15). Excluding the profit contribution  profit before taxes stood at EUR 47 million (106). Mandatum‚Äôs third-party assets under management increased to EUR 10.3 billion from EUR 10.1 billion at the end of the third quarter  supported by strong net flows of EUR 213 million during the quarter.GROUP CEO‚ÄôS COMMENTSampo‚Äôs fourth quarter was characterised by strong operational execution  robust financial results and further steps on our strategic agenda. As we conclude a successful year  I am delighted that we are announcing EUR 1.7 billion (EUR 3.40 per share) of planned capital returns to shareholders.Sampo‚Äôs P&C insurance operations delivered excellent fourth quarter underwriting results of EUR 304 million  representing 13 per cent year-on-year growth  after adjusting for COVID-19 effects in the prior year. Notably  this result was achieved despite adverse weather in the form of heavy snowfall and cold weather. As always  our focus has been on assisting affected customers through superior service  which is a cornerstone of our strategy and instrumental in securing high retention rates over the long term.The result was driven mainly by our Nordic P&C business  where If grew underwriting profit excluding COVID-19 effects by 23 per cent  supported by an excellent fourth quarter combined ratio of 81.7 per cent and currency adjusted premium growth of 7.8 per cent. Importantly  our Nordic customer retention has remained high as we continue to cover claims inflation of 4‚Äì5 per cent with rate increases. The strongest pricing momentum is observed in Industrial  but fourth quarter premium growth also benefited from a stabilisation of new cars sales  albeit at a relatively low level  including support from high electric vehicle sales.In the UK  market conditions remained challenging  but Hastings achieved premium growth of 15 per cent over 2022 as it implemented significant rate increases to cover claims inflation of 12 per cent. Adverse weather had a negative impact on Hastings‚Äô operating ratio  pushing this to 89.7 per cent for 2022 as a whole. Although above our annual 88 per cent target  Hastings has delivered a relatively resilient result in what has been a challenging year for the UK motor market. I believe this reflects skilful operational execution and the company‚Äôs strong positioning and capabilities  which I expect will enable attractive profit growth as market conditions improve.In the capital markets  the fourth quarter saw further increases in interest rates and positive development in equity markets. Due to the short duration of our fixed income portfolio  we were able to continue to rapidly increase our running yield. Over 2022  higher running yields have added roughly EUR 230 million to Sampo‚Äôs annual pre-tax earning power  with the largest contribution coming from If P&C  which has more than doubled its running yield to 3.2 per cent (1.5).In December  Sampo‚Äôs Board of Directors launched a strategic review of Mandatum to evaluate whether separating the entity from the Group could add shareholder value. As a pure P&C insurer  Sampo could deliver higher and more resilient returns on capital  while an independent Mandatum would enjoy greater strategic flexibility to invest in growth. On the other hand  Mandatum makes an attractive contribution to the Group‚Äôs cash flow that supports value creation over time. We expect to provide an update on the review by the end of the first quarter of 2023.Turning to capital management  Sampo remains committed to capital discipline with a EUR 2.60 per share dividend proposal for 2022 and a EUR 400 million share buyback programme  which management is to propose. Adjusting for these actions  the Group retains EUR 2 per share of excess capital above the needs of the insurance operations  most of which is tied into private equity investments held in Sampo plc.Torbj√∂rn MagnussonGroup CEOOUTLOOKOutlook for 2023Sampo Group‚Äôs P&C insurance operations are expected to achieve underwriting margins that meet the annual targets set for 2021‚Äì2023. At Group level  Sampo targets a combined ratio of below 86 per cent  while the target for its largest subsidiary  If P&C  is below 85 per cent. Hastings targets an operating ratio of below 88 per cent.The combined and operating ratios of Sampo Group‚Äôs P&C insurance operations are subject to volatility driven by  among other factors  seasonal weather patterns  large claims and prior year development. These effects are particularly relevant for individual segments and business areas  such as the Danish and UK operations.The mark-to-market component of the net financial result will be significantly influenced by capital markets‚Äô developments  particularly in life insurance.With regard to Topdanmark  reference is made to the profit forecast model that the company publishes on a quarterly basis.The major risks and uncertainties for the Group in the near-termIn its current day-to-day business activities Sampo Group is exposed to various risks and uncertainties  mainly through its major business units.Major risks affecting the Group companies‚Äô profitability and its variation are market  credit  insurance and operational risks. At the Group level  sources of risks are the same  although they are not directly additive due to the effects of diversification.Uncertainties in the form of major unforeseen events may have an immediate impact on the Group‚Äôs profitability. The identification of unforeseen events is easier than the estimation of their probabilities  timing  and potential outcomes. During 2022 the global economy was hit by the war in Ukraine and at the same time  inflation pressures intensified and broadened forcing central banks to raise interest rates sharply. This may lead to both a further significant slowdown in economic growth and a deterioration in the debt service capacity of businesses  households and governments. Furthermore  the re-alignment of energy supplies in Europe takes time and the energy crisis could continue for several years. These developments are currently causing significant uncertainties in economic and capital market development. At the same time rapidly evolving hybrid threats create new challenges for states and businesses. There are also a number of widely identified macroeconomic  political and other sources of uncertainty which can  in various ways  affect the financial services industry in a negative manner.Other sources of uncertainty are unforeseen structural changes in the business environment and already identified trends and potential wide-impact events. These external drivers may have a long-term impact on how Sampo Group‚Äôs business will be conducted. Examples of identified trends are demographic changes  sustainability issues  and technological developments in areas such as artificial intelligence and digitalisation including threats posed by cybercrime.DIVIDEND PROPOSALDividendUnder Sampo Group‚Äôs capital management framework  Sampo will return ongoing surplus capital generation from its insurance operations through a regular dividend. Other forms of surplus capital generation  including possible proceeds from disposals of financial investments  are returned through additional dividends and/or buybacks  to the extent that the funds are not utilised to support business development. Sampo targets a Solvency II ratio of 170‚Äì190 per cent and financial leverage below 30 per cent.According to Sampo plc‚Äôs Dividend Policy applied for distribution of 2022 earnings  total annual dividends paid shall represent at least 70 per cent of Sampo Group‚Äôs net profit for the year (excluding extraordinary items). In 2022  accounting items related to the sale of Nordea shares  the sale of Topdanmark life insurance operations and the reclassification of Nordax from an associated company to fair value investment have been defined as extraordinary in accordance with Sampo‚Äôs dividend policy.The parent company‚Äôs distributable capital and reserves totalled EUR 6 716 million of which profit for the financial year 2022 was EUR 1 780 million. Based on the policies outlined above  the Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a total dividend of EUR 2.60 per share be paid to all shares except for the shares held by Sampo plc on the dividend record date of 22 May 2023. The total dividend includes a regular dividend of EUR 1.80 per share as well as an extra dividend of EUR 0.80 per share.As earnings per share excluding extraordinary items amounted to EUR 2.41 per share  the payout ratio for the total dividend equates to 108 per cent. The remainder of the distributable funds are left in the company‚Äôs equity capital. After adjusting for the proposed dividend  Sampo Group‚Äôs 2022 year-end distributable funds amounted to EUR 5 378 million  Group Solvency II ratio to 210 per cent and financial leverage to 28.6 per cent.Dividend paymentThe dividend is proposed to be paid to the shareholders registered in the register of shareholders held by Euroclear Finland Oy as at the record date of 22 May 2023. The Board proposes that the dividends be paid on 31 May 2023.The issuer of the Swedish depository receipts shall ensure that the dividend is paid to the depository receipt holders registered in the securities depository and settlement register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB as at the record date of 22 May 2023  which payment shall be made in Swedish kronor.Financial positionNo significant changes have taken place in the company's financial position since the end of the financial year. The company's liquidity position is good and in the view of the Board  the proposed distributions do not jeopardise the company's ability to fulfil its obligations.Adjustment to Sampo Group‚Äôs dividend policyThe implementation of IFRS 17 and 9 on 1 January 2023 will bring asset and liability side mark-to-market effects into Sampo‚Äôs reported net income. As a result  the Sampo Board has decided to adjust the Group‚Äôs dividend policy  such that the minimum payout ratio of 70 per cent is measured against a newly defined operational result rather than net profit excluding items defined as extraordinary  as previously. The change is not expected to have any significant effect on the size and trajectory of dividends. The adjustment is effective to payouts made in respect of the 2023 and later financial years‚Äô.According to the updated dividend policy  Sampo is to pay a stable and sustainable regular dividend that grows in line with the Group‚Äôs earnings over time. Total annual dividends paid will be at least 70 per cent of Group‚Äôs operational result.The operational result is similar to net profit excluding items defined as extraordinary used under IFRS 4  with the main differences being that it excludes all result effects from discount rate changes as well as non-operational amortisation in Sampo‚Äôs P&C operations  and that Mandatum‚Äôs profit is replaced with the dividend stream that it provides to Sampo plc. The full definition of the operational result can be found at www.sampo.com/dividend .Sampo is committed to operating a strong and efficient balance sheet  as defined by the Group‚Äôs capital management framework. To enable this  regular dividends can be complemented with distributions of excess capital via share buybacks and/or extra dividends.OTHER DEVELOPMENTSStrategic review of MandatumOn 7 December 2022  Sampo plc announced that the Board of Directors had decided to undertake a strategic review of Mandatum in line with Sampo‚Äôs strategic focus on P&C insurance. The Board continues to review a number of different options  with the aim to evaluate whether a separation of Mandatum could create shareholder value.The Board of Directors of Sampo plc is content with the current Group structure as it offers diversification in terms of business exposures as well as capital and cash generation. Sampo expects to provide a further update on the strategic review by the end of the first quarter of 2023.EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODShare buyback programmeSampo‚Äôs share buyback programme of EUR 1 billion announced on 9 June 2022 continued after the end of the reporting period. The buyback programme was completed on 8 February 2023  when at market close  the company held  after cancellation of the own shares on 8 December 2022  in total 5.4 million Sampo A shares representing 1.05 per cent of the total number of shares in Sampo plc. Sampo had bought altogether 22.1 million A shares under the share buyback programme between 10 June 2022 and 8 February 2023  of which 16.7 million shares were cancelled on 8 December 2022.

The complete report is attached to this release and is also available at www.sanoma.com/en/investors .Q4 2022The Group‚Äôs net sales grew to EUR 260 million (2021: 252). The positive impact of the acquisition of Pearson Italy and Germany was partially offset by lower advertising sales. The Group‚Äôs comparable growth was ‚Äë3% (2021: 6%).Operational EBIT excl. PPA was seasonally negative and amounted to EUR -2 million (2021: -5).EBIT was EUR -21 million (2021: -19). Items affecting comparability (IACs) increased to EUR -8 million (2021: -5) and were mainly related to recent acquisitions in Learning. Purchase price allocation adjustments and amortisations (PPAs) grew to EUR 11 million (2021: 8) as a result of the acquisition of the Italian and German business.Operational EPS was EUR -0.07 (2021: -0.06).EPS was EUR -0.13 (2021: -0.09).On 16 December 2022  Sanoma received a payment decision regarding tax audits for 2019‚àí2021 concerning the VAT treatment of magazine distribution in Media Finland  from which it will appeal. Based on the decision received  Sanoma paid EUR 11 million of VAT  penalties and interests at year end 2022 in order to avoid further interest accumulation. For dividend calculation purposes  the Group‚Äôs free cash flow will be adjusted for the prepayment.On 7 November 2022  Sanoma signed a EUR 300 million syndicated revolving credit facility replacing its earlier facility of the same size  and syndicated its EUR 250 million 4-year term loan used for the acquisition of Pearson Italy and Germany with a group of ten relationship banks.On 26 October  the Board of Directors decided the record date and payment date of the second dividend instalment of EUR 0.27 per share. The dividend record date was 28 October and the payment date 4 November.On 4 October  Sanoma divested Eduarte  a Dutch student administration system provider for vocational education  in line with the strategy to harmonise its digital offering across the learning business.FY 2022The Group‚Äôs net sales grew to EUR 1 298 million (2021: 1 252) mainly driven by the acquisition of the Italian and German learning business from Pearson. The Group‚Äôs comparable net sales growth was 1% (2021: 7%).Operational EBIT excl. PPA declined to EUR 189 million (2021: 197)  corresponding to a margin of 14.6% (2021: 15.8%). Earnings were stable in Learning and declined in Media Finland mainly due to lower advertising sales and higher paper costs.EBIT was EUR 112 million (2021: 142). IACs increased to EUR -38 million (2021: -16) mainly due to transaction and integration costs of recent acquisitions as well as impairments in Learning. PPAs were EUR 39 million (2021: 39).Operational EPS was EUR 0.65 (2021: 0.69).EPS was EUR 0.47 (2021: 0.62).Free cash flow declined to EUR 112 million (2021: 140) mainly due to lower earnings  as well as higher working capital  investments and taxes. It includes a significant positive contribution from the working capital of the acquired Italian and German businesses due to the timing of the acquisition.Net debt/Adj. EBITDA increased to 3.2 (2021: 2.4) mainly as a result of the acquisition in Italy and Germany.On 31 August  Sanoma completed the acquisition of Pearson‚Äôs local K12 learning content business in Italy and its small exam preparation business in Germany.On 7 June  Sanoma announced its strategic growth ambition to increase the Group‚Äôs net sales to over EUR 2 billion by 2030  with at least 75% coming from the learning business.The Board proposes a dividend of 0.37 ‚Ç¨ per share (2021: 0.54)  corresponding to 93% of the underlying free cash flow. The dividend will be paid in three instalments  EUR 0.13 on 28 April  EUR 0.13 in September and EUR 0.11 in November.Outlook for 2023In 2023  Sanoma expects that the Group‚Äôs reported net sales will be EUR 1.35‚Äí1.4 billion (2022: 1.3). The Group‚Äôs operational EBIT excl. PPA is expected to be EUR 150‚àí180 million (2022: 189).Regarding the operating environment  Sanoma expects that:The economies in the Group‚Äôs operating countries  particularly in Finland  will experience a mild recession.The advertising market in Finland will decline slightly  with most of the decline during the first half of the year.President and CEO Susan Duinhoven:‚ÄùIn light of the significant changes in the world around us  2022 was another solid year of transformation for Sanoma ‚Äìalthough being very different from what we expected twelve months ago  just coming out of the coronavirus pandemic. In Learning  one of the highlights in 2022 was the acquisition of two established learning businesses in Italy and Germany from Pearson. We were happy to welcome these strong teams to Sanoma at the end of August. The acquired businesses fit well in our learning portfolio and strategy  and the acquisition had already a modest positive contribution to our net sales growth and operational EBIT  and due to the timing of the acquisition also a significant one to the free cash flow. The integration has started according to our plans and playbook and we expect the separation from Pearson and integration into Sanoma to be a sizable project over the next 18‚àí24 months.Net sales of Learning grew by 7% driven by the acquired Italian and German businesses. Organic growth was good across our operating countries except ‚Äì in line with our expectations ‚Äì in Poland  where the latest curriculum renewal ended in 2021. In Spain  the implementation of the major educational reform and curriculum renewal  LOMLOE  started a bit more fragmented than we had anticipated. However  it created solid growth in the demand for learning content in 2022  which is expected to continue also in 2023 extending most likely even into 2024. The inflationary cost increases impacted the earnings in Learning  as we typically can set our prices only once a year. Now for 2023  we have been able to adapt the prices for our products and services and we expect that it will take 1‚àí2 years to fully mitigate the cost increases in most of our markets. Especially the higher personnel costs that in most of our businesses will impact us only from 2023 onwards  will take some time to mitigate. Despite the inflationary cost increases  the operational earnings remained stable in most of our businesses. The main exception was the Dutch distribution business that suffered during the summer period from labour shortage and related sharp increase in hiring costs  delays due to supply chain issues with our main supplier and the general inflationary cost pressures.In Media Finland  net sales were stable  while operational earnings declined driven by lower advertising sales and significantly higher paper costs. The active cost containment by the teams across fixed cost categories was not able to fully offset the adverse inflationary impact on Media Finland‚Äôs operational earnings. One of the highlights of the year was the clear growth in the number of visits to all our digital news platforms  especially Ilta-Sanomat  as well as solid growth in the digitally active subscription base of both Helsingin Sanomat and the regional news media titles. Subscription sales were stable  while the total number of subscribers declined slightly towards the end of the year reflecting the weakening consumer confidence in Finland. During the second half of the year  advertising sales declined year-on-year compared to the strong demand in 2021 that was driven by the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.Sustainability is at the core of both our learning and media business. During the year  we continued our actions towards our targets by focusing on improving diversity  equality and inclusion across Sanoma and sending our climate targets for validation to the Science-Based Targets initiative. Our progressive and holistic approach to sustainability was reflected in continued improvement in key ESG ratings and inclusion into the Nasdaq OMX Sustainability Finland Index. We were delighted to also see that our Employee Experience Index remained stable at the good level of 7.3  even in a year that put quite some challenges and hardship for our teams  and we continued to exceed the European benchmark that was 7.1.Compared to last year  our free cash flow declined significantly. The main reasons for this were higher investments in digital development in Learning  adaptation of our offices to the hybrid way of working as well as lower EBITDA and costs related to the recent acquisition in Learning. This was mostly compensated by the working capital that came with the acquired businesses due to the timing of the acquisition. Without a similar benefit from the Italian and German acquisition as seen in 2022  we expect the Group‚Äôs 2023 free cash flow to temporarily decline  being impacted by the lower earnings expected in our Finnish media business  continued investments in our digital platforms and integration of the recently acquired businesses together with significantly higher financial expenses.The Board proposes a dividend of EUR 0.37 (2021: 0.54)  corresponding to a yield of 3.8% on the end of 2022 share price and 93% of the underlying free cash flow. This proposal balances the capital use between the dividend and our continuing investments in growing the business further.We expect the challenging operating environment to continue  leading to a mild recession in most of our operating countries. This will be impacting our performance in 2023  and thus our Outlook for 2023 shows growth in net sales with slightly lower operational EBIT. In 2023  we will focus on further building the long-term strengths of our businesses around learning content  harmonisation of digital learning platforms and leading offering in digital news and entertainment  and thus coming out of the recession even stronger than we went in. At the same time  we will intensify our thoughtful cost management and highly selective approach to growth investments. We remain fully committed to our growth strategy as well as our long-term financial targets. We are aiming for the Group net sales to be above EUR 2 billion  with at least 75% coming from the learning business  which we aim to achieve through organic growth and further acquisitions within K12 learning services. Also in the shorter term  we continue to be interested in value creating acquisitions in K12 learning content  especially in-market acquisitions  even though our main focus this year will be on integrations and gaining the scale benefits that our European portfolio can offer.I would like to extend my great thanks to all Sanoma employees for their excellent work  tenacity and strong commitment to supporting our customers in these more challenging times. Thanks to our teams  we were able to continue our growth  operational development and solid financial performance throughout the year 2022.

The complete report is attached to this release and is also available at www.sanoma.com/en/investors .Q4 2022The Group‚Äôs net sales grew to EUR 260 million (2021: 252). The positive impact of the acquisition of Pearson Italy and Germany was partially offset by lower advertising sales. The Group‚Äôs comparable growth was ‚Äë3% (2021: 6%).Operational EBIT excl. PPA was seasonally negative and amounted to EUR -2 million (2021: -5).EBIT was EUR -21 million (2021: -19). Items affecting comparability (IACs) increased to EUR -8 million (2021: -5) and were mainly related to recent acquisitions in Learning. Purchase price allocation adjustments and amortisations (PPAs) grew to EUR 11 million (2021: 8) as a result of the acquisition of the Italian and German business.Operational EPS was EUR -0.07 (2021: -0.06).EPS was EUR -0.13 (2021: -0.09).On 16 December 2022  Sanoma received a payment decision regarding tax audits for 2019‚àí2021 concerning the VAT treatment of magazine distribution in Media Finland  from which it will appeal. Based on the decision received  Sanoma paid EUR 11 million of VAT  penalties and interests at year end 2022 in order to avoid further interest accumulation. For dividend calculation purposes  the Group‚Äôs free cash flow will be adjusted for the prepayment.On 7 November 2022  Sanoma signed a EUR 300 million syndicated revolving credit facility replacing its earlier facility of the same size  and syndicated its EUR 250 million 4-year term loan used for the acquisition of Pearson Italy and Germany with a group of ten relationship banks.On 26 October  the Board of Directors decided the record date and payment date of the second dividend instalment of EUR 0.27 per share. The dividend record date was 28 October and the payment date 4 November.On 4 October  Sanoma divested Eduarte  a Dutch student administration system provider for vocational education  in line with the strategy to harmonise its digital offering across the learning business.FY 2022The Group‚Äôs net sales grew to EUR 1 298 million (2021: 1 252) mainly driven by the acquisition of the Italian and German learning business from Pearson. The Group‚Äôs comparable net sales growth was 1% (2021: 7%).Operational EBIT excl. PPA declined to EUR 189 million (2021: 197)  corresponding to a margin of 14.6% (2021: 15.8%). Earnings were stable in Learning and declined in Media Finland mainly due to lower advertising sales and higher paper costs.EBIT was EUR 112 million (2021: 142). IACs increased to EUR -38 million (2021: -16) mainly due to transaction and integration costs of recent acquisitions as well as impairments in Learning. PPAs were EUR 39 million (2021: 39).Operational EPS was EUR 0.65 (2021: 0.69).EPS was EUR 0.47 (2021: 0.62).Free cash flow declined to EUR 112 million (2021: 140) mainly due to lower earnings  as well as higher working capital  investments and taxes. It includes a significant positive contribution from the working capital of the acquired Italian and German businesses due to the timing of the acquisition.Net debt/Adj. EBITDA increased to 3.2 (2021: 2.4) mainly as a result of the acquisition in Italy and Germany.On 31 August  Sanoma completed the acquisition of Pearson‚Äôs local K12 learning content business in Italy and its small exam preparation business in Germany.On 7 June  Sanoma announced its strategic growth ambition to increase the Group‚Äôs net sales to over EUR 2 billion by 2030  with at least 75% coming from the learning business.The Board proposes a dividend of 0.37 ‚Ç¨ per share (2021: 0.54)  corresponding to 93% of the underlying free cash flow. The dividend will be paid in three instalments  EUR 0.13 on 28 April  EUR 0.13 in September and EUR 0.11 in November.Outlook for 2023In 2023  Sanoma expects that the Group‚Äôs reported net sales will be EUR 1.35‚Äí1.4 billion (2022: 1.3). The Group‚Äôs operational EBIT excl. PPA is expected to be EUR 150‚àí180 million (2022: 189).Regarding the operating environment  Sanoma expects that:The economies in the Group‚Äôs operating countries  particularly in Finland  will experience a mild recession.The advertising market in Finland will decline slightly  with most of the decline during the first half of the year.President and CEO Susan Duinhoven:‚ÄùIn light of the significant changes in the world around us  2022 was another solid year of transformation for Sanoma ‚Äìalthough being very different from what we expected twelve months ago  just coming out of the coronavirus pandemic. In Learning  one of the highlights in 2022 was the acquisition of two established learning businesses in Italy and Germany from Pearson. We were happy to welcome these strong teams to Sanoma at the end of August. The acquired businesses fit well in our learning portfolio and strategy  and the acquisition had already a modest positive contribution to our net sales growth and operational EBIT  and due to the timing of the acquisition also a significant one to the free cash flow. The integration has started according to our plans and playbook and we expect the separation from Pearson and integration into Sanoma to be a sizable project over the next 18‚àí24 months.Net sales of Learning grew by 7% driven by the acquired Italian and German businesses. Organic growth was good across our operating countries except ‚Äì in line with our expectations ‚Äì in Poland  where the latest curriculum renewal ended in 2021. In Spain  the implementation of the major educational reform and curriculum renewal  LOMLOE  started a bit more fragmented than we had anticipated. However  it created solid growth in the demand for learning content in 2022  which is expected to continue also in 2023 extending most likely even into 2024. The inflationary cost increases impacted the earnings in Learning  as we typically can set our prices only once a year. Now for 2023  we have been able to adapt the prices for our products and services and we expect that it will take 1‚àí2 years to fully mitigate the cost increases in most of our markets. Especially the higher personnel costs that in most of our businesses will impact us only from 2023 onwards  will take some time to mitigate. Despite the inflationary cost increases  the operational earnings remained stable in most of our businesses. The main exception was the Dutch distribution business that suffered during the summer period from labour shortage and related sharp increase in hiring costs  delays due to supply chain issues with our main supplier and the general inflationary cost pressures.In Media Finland  net sales were stable  while operational earnings declined driven by lower advertising sales and significantly higher paper costs. The active cost containment by the teams across fixed cost categories was not able to fully offset the adverse inflationary impact on Media Finland‚Äôs operational earnings. One of the highlights of the year was the clear growth in the number of visits to all our digital news platforms  especially Ilta-Sanomat  as well as solid growth in the digitally active subscription base of both Helsingin Sanomat and the regional news media titles. Subscription sales were stable  while the total number of subscribers declined slightly towards the end of the year reflecting the weakening consumer confidence in Finland. During the second half of the year  advertising sales declined year-on-year compared to the strong demand in 2021 that was driven by the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.Sustainability is at the core of both our learning and media business. During the year  we continued our actions towards our targets by focusing on improving diversity  equality and inclusion across Sanoma and sending our climate targets for validation to the Science-Based Targets initiative. Our progressive and holistic approach to sustainability was reflected in continued improvement in key ESG ratings and inclusion into the Nasdaq OMX Sustainability Finland Index. We were delighted to also see that our Employee Experience Index remained stable at the good level of 7.3  even in a year that put quite some challenges and hardship for our teams  and we continued to exceed the European benchmark that was 7.1.Compared to last year  our free cash flow declined significantly. The main reasons for this were higher investments in digital development in Learning  adaptation of our offices to the hybrid way of working as well as lower EBITDA and costs related to the recent acquisition in Learning. This was mostly compensated by the working capital that came with the acquired businesses due to the timing of the acquisition. Without a similar benefit from the Italian and German acquisition as seen in 2022  we expect the Group‚Äôs 2023 free cash flow to temporarily decline  being impacted by the lower earnings expected in our Finnish media business  continued investments in our digital platforms and integration of the recently acquired businesses together with significantly higher financial expenses.The Board proposes a dividend of EUR 0.37 (2021: 0.54)  corresponding to a yield of 3.8% on the end of 2022 share price and 93% of the underlying free cash flow. This proposal balances the capital use between the dividend and our continuing investments in growing the business further.We expect the challenging operating environment to continue  leading to a mild recession in most of our operating countries. This will be impacting our performance in 2023  and thus our Outlook for 2023 shows growth in net sales with slightly lower operational EBIT. In 2023  we will focus on further building the long-term strengths of our businesses around learning content  harmonisation of digital learning platforms and leading offering in digital news and entertainment  and thus coming out of the recession even stronger than we went in. At the same time  we will intensify our thoughtful cost management and highly selective approach to growth investments. We remain fully committed to our growth strategy as well as our long-term financial targets. We are aiming for the Group net sales to be above EUR 2 billion  with at least 75% coming from the learning business  which we aim to achieve through organic growth and further acquisitions within K12 learning services. Also in the shorter term  we continue to be interested in value creating acquisitions in K12 learning content  especially in-market acquisitions  even though our main focus this year will be on integrations and gaining the scale benefits that our European portfolio can offer.I would like to extend my great thanks to all Sanoma employees for their excellent work  tenacity and strong commitment to supporting our customers in these more challenging times. Thanks to our teams  we were able to continue our growth  operational development and solid financial performance throughout the year 2022. I also want to thank our customers and shareholders for their continued support and interest in selecting Sanoma as their partner and investment respectively. Together we will continue on our strategic path with an aim to grow and further strengthen our positions and improve our performance in the years ahead.‚Äô‚ÄôKey indicators for continuing operationsEUR million Q4 2022 Q4 2021 Change FY 2022 FY 2021 Change Net sales 259.5 252.4 3% 1 298.3 1 251.6 4% Operational EBITDA 1) 45.3 42.1 7% 355.4 361.0 -2% Margin 1) 17.4% 16.7% 27.4% 28.8% Operational EBIT excl.

(""Fennogens"") and Corbis S.A. (""Corbis"") form a consortium (the ""Consortium"") for the purposes of the Tender Offer.OFFER PRICE OF THE TENDER OFFERThe shareholders of Caverion are in the Tender Offer given the possibility to choose either: (i) a fixed cash payment of EUR 8.50 per Share payable in nine (9) months from the date of the first completion trades in the Tender Offer implemented through the issuance of a debt instrument with the nominal principal amount of EUR 8.50 (the ""Alternative Consideration Instrument"") for each Share tendered in the Tender Offer  or (ii) an immediate cash consideration of EUR 8.00 upon completion of the Tender Offer (the ""Cash Offer Price"") for each Share tendered in the Tender Offer. The Alternative Consideration Instruments will be issued by the Offeror on the date(s) of the completion trades of the Tender Offer with the nominal principal amount of EUR 8.50 and will be redeemed at their full nominal amount upon their maturity on the date falling nine (9) months after the date of first issuance of the Alternative Consideration Instruments. Shareholders choosing the Alternative Consideration will be issued one (1) Alternative Consideration Instrument for each Share tendered in the Tender Offer in connection with the completion trades of the Tender Offer. The acceptance of the Tender Offer with Alternative Consideration may be submitted on the business day following the publication of the Supplement Document  i.e. from February 13  2023. More detailed instructions are included in the Supplement Document and under section ""The Acceptance Procedure of the Tender Offer"" below.Shareholders holding Shares on Finnish equity savings accounts are not eligible to elect the Alternative Consideration Instrument in respect of such Shares for regulatory reasons. Instead of the Alternative Consideration Instruments  the shareholders holding Shares on the Finnish equity savings accounts have the possibility to elect a non-transferable deferred payment right of EUR 8.50 per Share to be paid in cash nine (9) months from the date of the first completion trades in the Tender Offer (the ""Deferred Payment Right""  and together with the Alternative Consideration Instruments the ""Alternative Consideration""). The Alternative Consideration and the Cash Offer Price are jointly referred to as the ""Offer Price"".The Cash Offer Price and the Alternative Consideration have been determined based on 136 472 645 issued and outstanding Shares. Should the Company increase the number of Shares that are issued and outstanding on the date hereof as a result of a new share issue  reclassification  stock split (including a reverse split) or any other similar transaction with dilutive effect  or should the Company distribute a dividend or otherwise distribute funds or any other assets to its shareholders  or if a record date with respect to any of the foregoing occurs prior to any of the settlements of the completion trades of the Tender Offer (whether after the expiry of the Offer Period or any Subsequent Offer Period (as defined below))  resulting in the distribution of funds not being payable to the Offeror  the Cash Offer Price and the Alternative Consideration payable by the Offeror shall be reduced accordingly on a euro-for-euro basis. However  each of the Alternative Consideration Instruments or Deferred Payment Rights are not subject to any adjustments after such an Alternative Consideration Instrument has been delivered or a Deferred Payment Right has been recorded to the shareholder but  instead  the adjustments will occur only if the distribution of funds or other corporate event entitling to the adjustment or if a record date with respect to any of the foregoing occurs prior to the settlement of relevant completion trades of the Tender Offer.Bain Capital Europe Fund VI  Security Trading  Fennogens and Corbis have given equity commitments to the Offeror to fund the Offeror for the purposes of the Tender Offer and the designated purpose of such equity commitments is to enable payment of the aggregate Cash Offer Price and redemption of the Alternative Consideration Instruments and payment of the Deferred Payment to holders of equity savings accounts by the Offeror.RECOMMENDATION BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CAVERIONThe Board of Directors of Caverion  represented by a quorum comprising the non-conflicted members of the Board of Directors  has unanimously decided to recommend in its statement issued on February 9  2023 pursuant to the Finnish Securities Markets Act (746/2012  as amended) and the Helsinki Takeover Code issued by the Finnish Securities Market Association (the ""Helsinki Takeover Code"") that the shareholders of Caverion accept the Tender Offer. The Board of Directors of Caverion has received an updated opinion  dated January 24  2023  of Caverion's exclusive financial adviser  Bank of America Europe DAC  Stockholm branch (""BofA Securities"")  to the effect that  as of the date of such opinion  the increased Offer Price to be paid to holders of Shares (other than Security Trading  Fennogens and Corbis and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the Improved Tender Offer  was fair from a financial point of view  to such holders  which opinion was based upon and subject to the assumptions made  procedures followed  matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken as more fully described in such opinion. The opinion of BofA Securities was provided for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors of Caverion and does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holders of Shares should act in connection with the Tender Offer or any related matter.THE ACCEPTANCE PROCEDURE OF THE TENDER OFFERAcceptance of the Tender Offer with Alternative Consideration may only be submitted on the business day following the publication of the Supplement Document  i.e. from February 13  2023.Before February 13  2023  acceptance of the Tender Offer can only be made with the Cash Offer Price. Each shareholder of Caverion whose acceptance of the Tender Offer has been submitted before February 13  2023  shall be deemed to have accepted the Tender Offer with the Cash Offer Price.If a shareholder of Caverion has submitted the acceptance of the Tender Offer before February 13  2023 in respect of the Shares held by him/her and wishes to elect the Alternative Consideration instead of the Cash Offer Price  such shareholder must submit a valid withdrawal of his/her earlier acceptance of the Tender Offer in accordance with instructions from the account operator and submit a duly executed acceptance form for the Alternative Consideration. Neither the Offeror nor Nordea (in its capacity as arranger and an account operator) will charge the shareholders for withdrawing their acceptance of the Tender Offer in order to accept the Alternative Consideration in such a situation.A shareholder may only choose to receive either the Alternative Consideration or the Cash Offer Price for all Shares held on the same book-entry account  and  consequently  shareholders may only tender for mixed consideration if the relevant Shares are held on separate book-entry accounts.The shareholders holding Shares on equity savings accounts who have selected the Alternative Consideration will receive  instead of the Alternative Consideration Instruments  non-transferable rights to payment from the Offeror  and to demonstrate these  the book-entries named as other rights will be recorded to a shareholder's equity savings account.Most Finnish account operators will send a new notice regarding the Tender Offer and related instructions to those who are registered as shareholders in the shareholders' register of Caverion maintained by Euroclear Finland. Shareholders of Caverion who do not receive such instructions from their account operator or asset manager should first contact their account operator or asset manager and can subsequently contact Nordea Bank Abp (""Nordea"") by sending an email to caverion-offer@nordea.com  where such shareholders of Caverion can receive information on submitting their acceptance of the Tender Offer. Please note  however  that Nordea will not be engaging in communications relating to the Tender Offer with shareholders located within the United States. Shareholders who are located within the United States may contact their brokers for necessary information.Those shareholders of Caverion whose Shares are nominee-registered  and who wish to accept the Tender Offer  must effect such acceptance in accordance with the instructions given by the custodian of the nominee-registered shareholders. The Offeror will not send an acceptance form or any other documents related to the Tender Offer to these shareholders of Caverion.For more information on the acceptance procedure of the Tender Offer  see section ""Terms and Conditions of the Tender Offer - Acceptance Procedure of the Tender offer"" in the Supplement Document.

In particular  the financial information included in this stock exchange release has been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in Finland  which may not be comparable to the financial statements or financial information of U.S. companies. The Tender Offer is made to Caverion's shareholders resident in the United States on the same terms and conditions as those made to all other shareholders of Caverion to whom an offer is made. Any informational documents  including this stock exchange release  are being disseminated to U.S. shareholders on a basis comparable to the method that such documents are provided to Caverion's other shareholders.As permitted under the Tier I Exemption  the settlement of the Tender Offer is based on the applicable Finnish law provisions  which differ from the settlement procedures customary in the United States  particularly as regards to the time when payment of the consideration is rendered. The Tender Offer  which is subject to Finnish law  is being made to the U.S. shareholders in accordance with the applicable U.S. securities laws  and applicable exemptions thereunder  in particular the Tier I Exemption and the 802 Exemption. To the extent the Tender Offer is subject to U.S. securities laws  those laws only apply to U.S. shareholders and will not give rise to claims on the part of any other person.

THE FUNDING WILL BE USED AS WORKING CAPITAL AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE MASS PRODUCTION CONTRACT WITH SONO MOTORS HAS BEEN POSTPONED AND TO PAY DOWN THE COMPANY‚ÄôS DEBT TO RIVERFORT.Background and Purpose of Financial ArrangementValoe Oyj (‚ÄúValoe‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) has signed a convertible note facility agreement with Winance concerning a funding arrangement of up to EUR 5 000 000 in convertible loan notes (the ""Convertible Notes"") that will be accompanied by share subscription warrants (the ""Warrants"") (the agreement  the Convertible Notes and the Warrants hereinafter referred to collectively as the ""Arrangement"").Valoe will use the funding as working capital. The need for additional funding became apparent after the signing of the mass production contract for Sion  Sono Motors' self-charging electric vehicle  and the related estimated cash flows were postponed. In addition  Valoe will pay down its debt to Riverfort Global Opportunities Pcc Limited by approximately one million euro.On 20 December 2022  Valoe disclosed that the signing of the contract Valoe is negotiating with the company‚Äôs significant customer has been postponed until the end of the first quarter of 2023. The delay was expected to have negative impact on Valoe‚Äôs working capital situation. With Winance‚Äôs financing that has now been agreed on  Valoe expects to be able to meet its working capital needs until the substantial customer contracts are signed and the planned cash flow from customer contracts start to materialize.Under the Arrangement  Valoe issues Convertible Notes to Winance. The Convertible Notes may be drawn down so that the first tranche amounts to EUR2 000 000  after which the Convertible Notes may be drawn down in maximum of 6 sequential tranches of EUR 500 000 each (the first tranche and the subsequent Tranches  each ""Tranche"") during a period of 24 months from the drawdown of the first Tranche provided that the preconditions for each Tranche are met. Winance has the right to convert each Tranche into the Company‚Äôs newly issued or treasury shares. In addition  Winance will receive Warrants stripped from the Convertible Notes at the drawdown of each Tranche. The Warrants entitle Winance to subscribe to additional shares of the Company with a subscription price described in the Characteristics of the Warrants.The Company has an obligation to draw down the first Tranche of EUR 2 000 000 and a minimum of two sequential Tranches of the Convertible Notes  i.e. a total minimum of EUR 3 000 000. The remainder of the Convertible Notes  a total of four Tranches of EUR500 000 totaling EUR 2 000 000  may be drawn down by the Company at its discretion.Valoe has  pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Arrangement between Valoe and Winance  withdrawn the first Tranche of EUR 2 000 000  and issued to Winance in total 2 000 convertible notes and in total 13 333 333 warrants related thereto.Commercial Terms of ArrangementPursuant to the Arrangement  Winance may be given in the maximum of 5 000 convertible loan notes against subscription price of EUR 1 000 per each convertible loan note. The Convertible Notes entitle their holder to subscribe to maximum of 50 000 000 shares of the Company in the aggregate.The subscription price of the Notes related to the Tranche Warrants shall be equal to 98% of the par value of the Notes.Notwithstanding the first Tranche  a Tranche may be drawn down by the Company provided that all previously issued Convertible Notes within the Arrangement have been converted into the shares of the Company or that a cool down period agreed between the parties has lapsed  unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. Each Tranche may be drawn in several parts.Winance has agreed to subscribe for the Convertible Notes issued by the Company with a conversion ratio calculated at the time the respective conversion is requested so that the conversion ratio is equal to 90 % of the lowest daily volume weighted average price observed over a period of fifteen (15) consecutive trading days prior to such conversion request.The Convertible Notes bear a zero interest rate. The Convertible Notes have a maturity of 12 months from the issuance of each Tranche. Each Tranche must be converted into the Company's shares upon maturity at the latest.In connection with the drawdown of each Tranche  Winance will receive Warrants free of charge. Winance has the right  but no obligation  to subscribe for the Company‚Äôs shares based on the Warrants. In connection with the Arrangement  Winance may be given maximum of 10 000 000 Warrants in the aggregate which entitle their holder to subscribe to maximum of 10 000 000 shares of the Company in the aggregate. The number of Warrants that shall be attached to the Convertible Notes of a Tranche shall be determined as follows: 20% of the nominal value of the Convertible Notes of a Tranche divided by the Exercise Price of Warrants  the resulting number of Warrants being rounded down to the nearest whole number. For the purposes of the aforesaid  the ""Exercise Price of Warrants"" shall be 110% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price in the 15 trading days immediately preceding the request to issue the relevant Tranche.The subscription period of the Company's shares pursuant to the Warrants is five (5) years from the issuance of each Warrant.The exact number of the Company's shares to be issued based on the conversion of the Convertible Notes and the exercise of the Warrants depends  in the manner described above  on the conversion ratio applied to the Convertible Notes and Warrants and is thus not yet known. Depending on the exact number of the Company's shares to be issued based on the conversion of the Convertible Notes and the exercise of the Warrants  it may be necessary for the Board of Directors of the Company to apply for additional authorizations from the general meeting of shareholders in order to implement the entire Arrangement.There is a weighty financial reason for the Company to issue the Convertible Notes and Warrants to Winance as the purpose of the Arrangement is to strengthen the tight working capital situation of the Company. The subscription price of the Convertible Notes and Warrants as well as the shares of the Company to be subscribed based on the Convertible Notes and Warrants is based on the agreement between the Company and Winance.The drawdown of each Tranche requires that certain representations and warranties given by the Company and other customary conditions relating to financing arrangements of this nature are met.Winance has the right to terminate the Arrangement if the Company‚Äôs operations become subject to a material adverse effect  there has been a change of control in the Company or in the event of default which  if curable  is not cured within 30 business days.Valoe will pay Winance on the Arrangement an upfront commitment fee equaling EUR 400 000 in Convertible Notes.The terms and conditions of the Convertible Notes and of the Warrants (without schedules) are included in all material respects in the Appendices 1 and 2 of this release.In Mikkeli on 10 February 2023Valoe OyjBOARD OF DIRECTORSFor more information:CEO Iikka Savisalo  Valoe Corporation tel. +35 40 521 6082email: iikka.savisalo@valoe.comDistribution:Nasdaq Helsinki OyMain mediawww.valoe.comValoe Corporation specializes in the clean energy  especially in photovoltaic solutions.

THE FUNDING WILL BE USED AS WORKING CAPITAL AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE MASS PRODUCTION CONTRACT WITH SONO MOTORS HAS BEEN POSTPONED AND TO PAY DOWN THE COMPANY‚ÄôS DEBT TO RIVERFORT.Background and Purpose of Financial ArrangementValoe Oyj (‚ÄúValoe‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) has signed a convertible note facility agreement with Winance concerning a funding arrangement of up to EUR 5 000 000 in convertible loan notes (the ""Convertible Notes"") that will be accompanied by share subscription warrants (the ""Warrants"") (the agreement  the Convertible Notes and the Warrants hereinafter referred to collectively as the ""Arrangement"").Valoe will use the funding as working capital. The need for additional funding became apparent after the signing of the mass production contract for Sion  Sono Motors' self-charging electric vehicle  and the related estimated cash flows were postponed. In addition  Valoe will pay down its debt to Riverfort Global Opportunities Pcc Limited by approximately one million euro.On 20 December 2022  Valoe disclosed that the signing of the contract Valoe is negotiating with the company‚Äôs significant customer has been postponed until the end of the first quarter of 2023. The delay was expected to have negative impact on Valoe‚Äôs working capital situation. With Winance‚Äôs financing that has now been agreed on  Valoe expects to be able to meet its working capital needs until the substantial customer contracts are signed and the planned cash flow from customer contracts start to materialize.Under the Arrangement  Valoe issues Convertible Notes to Winance. The Convertible Notes may be drawn down so that the first tranche amounts to EUR2 000 000  after which the Convertible Notes may be drawn down in maximum of 6 sequential tranches of EUR 500 000 each (the first tranche and the subsequent Tranches  each ""Tranche"") during a period of 24 months from the drawdown of the first Tranche provided that the preconditions for each Tranche are met. Winance has the right to convert each Tranche into the Company‚Äôs newly issued or treasury shares. In addition  Winance will receive Warrants stripped from the Convertible Notes at the drawdown of each Tranche. The Warrants entitle Winance to subscribe to additional shares of the Company with a subscription price described in the Characteristics of the Warrants.The Company has an obligation to draw down the first Tranche of EUR 2 000 000 and a minimum of two sequential Tranches of the Convertible Notes  i.e. a total minimum of EUR 3 000 000. The remainder of the Convertible Notes  a total of four Tranches of EUR500 000 totaling EUR 2 000 000  may be drawn down by the Company at its discretion.Valoe has  pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Arrangement between Valoe and Winance  withdrawn the first Tranche of EUR 2 000 000  and issued to Winance in total 2 000 convertible notes and in total 13 333 333 warrants related thereto.Commercial Terms of ArrangementPursuant to the Arrangement  Winance may be given in the maximum of 5 000 convertible loan notes against subscription price of EUR 1 000 per each convertible loan note. The Convertible Notes entitle their holder to subscribe to maximum of 50 000 000 shares of the Company in the aggregate.The subscription price of the Notes related to the Tranche Warrants shall be equal to 98% of the par value of the Notes.Notwithstanding the first Tranche  a Tranche may be drawn down by the Company provided that all previously issued Convertible Notes within the Arrangement have been converted into the shares of the Company or that a cool down period agreed between the parties has lapsed  unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. Each Tranche may be drawn in several parts.Winance has agreed to subscribe for the Convertible Notes issued by the Company with a conversion ratio calculated at the time the respective conversion is requested so that the conversion ratio is equal to 90 % of the lowest daily volume weighted average price observed over a period of fifteen (15) consecutive trading days prior to such conversion request.The Convertible Notes bear a zero interest rate. The Convertible Notes have a maturity of 12 months from the issuance of each Tranche. Each Tranche must be converted into the Company's shares upon maturity at the latest.In connection with the drawdown of each Tranche  Winance will receive Warrants free of charge. Winance has the right  but no obligation  to subscribe for the Company‚Äôs shares based on the Warrants. In connection with the Arrangement  Winance may be given maximum of 10 000 000 Warrants in the aggregate which entitle their holder to subscribe to maximum of 10 000 000 shares of the Company in the aggregate. The number of Warrants that shall be attached to the Convertible Notes of a Tranche shall be determined as follows: 20% of the nominal value of the Convertible Notes of a Tranche divided by the Exercise Price of Warrants  the resulting number of Warrants being rounded down to the nearest whole number. For the purposes of the aforesaid  the ""Exercise Price of Warrants"" shall be 110% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price in the 15 trading days immediately preceding the request to issue the relevant Tranche.The subscription period of the Company's shares pursuant to the Warrants is five (5) years from the issuance of each Warrant.The exact number of the Company's shares to be issued based on the conversion of the Convertible Notes and the exercise of the Warrants depends  in the manner described above  on the conversion ratio applied to the Convertible Notes and Warrants and is thus not yet known. Depending on the exact number of the Company's shares to be issued based on the conversion of the Convertible Notes and the exercise of the Warrants  it may be necessary for the Board of Directors of the Company to apply for additional authorizations from the general meeting of shareholders in order to implement the entire Arrangement.There is a weighty financial reason for the Company to issue the Convertible Notes and Warrants to Winance as the purpose of the Arrangement is to strengthen the tight working capital situation of the Company. The subscription price of the Convertible Notes and Warrants as well as the shares of the Company to be subscribed based on the Convertible Notes and Warrants is based on the agreement between the Company and Winance.The drawdown of each Tranche requires that certain representations and warranties given by the Company and other customary conditions relating to financing arrangements of this nature are met.Winance has the right to terminate the Arrangement if the Company‚Äôs operations become subject to a material adverse effect  there has been a change of control in the Company or in the event of default which  if curable  is not cured within 30 business days.Valoe will pay Winance on the Arrangement an upfront commitment fee equaling EUR 400 000 in Convertible Notes.The terms and conditions of the Convertible Notes and of the Warrants (without schedules) are included in all material respects in the Appendices 1 and 2 of this release.In Mikkeli on 10 February 2023Valoe OyjBOARD OF DIRECTORSFor more information:CEO Iikka Savisalo  Valoe Corporation tel. +35 40 521 6082email: iikka.savisalo@valoe.comDistribution:Nasdaq Helsinki OyMain mediawww.valoe.comValoe Corporation specializes in the clean energy  especially in photovoltaic solutions.

The mood at the start of the year was expectant in terms of the ending of the COVID-19 pandemic of the past two years and the lifting of the restrictions  and the year began with strong economic growth. However  Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine in February  created a new kind of uncertainty in the world and the war resulted in human suffering.The war‚Äôs impacts could been seen in our operating environment as economic uncertainty  rising energy prices and interest rates and high inflation. These multiplier effects showed in SATO‚Äôs business operations during the reporting year. We have approximately 25 000 homes in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku. In addition  SATO has 522 apartments in St. Petersburg  which make up approximately one per cent of the value of our investment assets. Since the start of the war in Ukraine  we have been reviewing opportunities to withdraw from the Russian business operations and we are searching actively for a solution.Despite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental apartments in Finland  and the urbanisation trend continues. The rise in mortgage interest rates coupled with the increase in energy and other costs had a partial impact on the growth in rental apartment demand. Now  also some of the people looking for an owner-occupied apartment may consider renting an apartment.The competition between rental housing providers is tough and a large number of new rental apartments has been built especially in the Helsinki metropolitan area in recent years. The historically high rate of housing construction is slowing. There are significantly fewer housing starts than before  but a large number of new apartments will be completed in 2023. This will maintain the tight competition for good tenants and keep rent increases moderate  despite the pressure for rent to increase in the future due to the rising cost level.During the reporting year  our investments in rental apartments were EUR 190.5 million (167.1). In 2022  we completed 191 rental apartments and 52 FlexHomes. On 31 December 2022  a total of 1 418 apartments were under construction. During the second half of the reporting year  we made a decision to refrain from launching any new construction projects. Our decision was based on the dramatic rise in the cost level for construction and property maintenance and the increase in financing costs  while rent development remained moderate due to the market situation.During the first half of the year  we made a decision to launch new non-subsidised rental apartment construction projects in Rykmentinpuisto in Tuusula  Skanssi in Turku and Finnoo in Espoo. The Rykmentinpuisto project is our first new apartment investment in Tuusula in 15 years and the Skanssi project is the first new apartment investment in Turku in five years.In April of the reporting year  we sold 2 009 rental apartments mainly in the Lahti  Jyv√§skyl√§ and Oulu areas to the Swedish investment company Heimstaden. The sale was consistent with our strategy of focusing our apartment investments on the Helsinki metropolitan area and its commuting area along the main railway  and in Tampere and Turku and their surrounding municipalities.We continued to develop the customer experience at SATO during the year. The economic occupancy rate improved compared to the previous year and was 95.2% (94.9). Our tenant turnover for the reporting year fell and our customer satisfaction improved. We clarified and simplified the processes and operating models related to the customer experience and focused especially on building a harmonised and seamless service experience. In addition to developing digital services  we invested in our presence near to the customers.During the reporting year  we continued our sustainability work and released our sustainability programme for 2023‚àí2026  our second ever. The themes of the sustainability programme are sustainable housing  thriving communities and sustainable profitability. Our vision is to be a leader in sustainable rental housing. In our own sustainability goals  we have committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).Last autumn  SATO became the first rental housing provider to join the Ostavastuullisesti.fi service  which provides sustainable service and products and tips for sustainable living. A sustainability panel consisting of outside experts in sustainable production and consumption selected six of SATO‚Äôs buildings: Lupajantie 2 in Mellunkyl√§  Helsinki; Jokiniityntie 28 in Kirkkonummi; Lincolninaukio 4 in Keimola  Vantaa; Kotkatie 6 in Espoo and Jokiniementie 46 and 48 in Ver√§j√§m√§ki  Helsinki to be featured on the website as more sustainable options. We also participated in Rakli‚Äôs Green Homes activities (which started up in 2022)  with altogether 1 100 Green Homes which had either geothermal heat or consumption-based water invoicing or both.During the reporting year  we focused on supporting the well-being of SATO personnel and encouraged SATO employees to learn and grow continually. Our goal is for each person to be able to come up with ideas in their work and develop solutions for future rental housing. We want for everyone at SATO to have the courage to reinvent themselves and the ability to succeed. During the year  the entire organisation adopted the objectives and key results (OKR) model with which we are working towards better setting of objectives  closer monitoring of results and openness. The constantly increasing complexity in the operating environment challenges both experts‚Äô and supervisors‚Äô competence and thinking. In order to provide support to this end  we launched supervisor training in the coaching management style during the reporting year.I wish to thank all SATO employees for their committed and excellent work. I also wish to thank our partners and the residents of our SATOhomes for their good co-operation during the past year.Report of the Board of DirectorsReport of the Board of Directors 1 January‚Äì31 December 2022Operating environmentThe year 2022 began with strong economic growth. Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine in February of the reporting year brought uncertainty to the economic outlook  dramatically raising the price of energy and accelerating inflation. The exceptionally high inflation forced the central banks to react by rapidly hiking interest rates. During the reporting year  the ECB raised its key interest rate four times after the summer and it was 2.50% at the end of 2022. Due to the high inflation  interest rate hikes are expected to continue in early 2023. Inflation is anticipated to stabilise during 2023.Employment development was strong in early 2022  but slowed down towards year-end due to economic challenges. During the reporting year  consumers‚Äô confidence weakened to a historically low level after the start of the year  which showed in private consumption. According to the projection made by the Bank of Finland on 16 December 2022  Finland‚Äôs economic growth in 2022 will be 1.9 % due to the good start to the year. In 2023  the increase in energy prices and the cost of living is predicted to cause the economy to slide into a slight downturn and shrink by 0.5%.Uncertainty and rising interest rates are slowing housing sales. According to the statistics released by the Central Federation of Finnish Real Estate Agencies in December 2022  sales volumes of new and old apartments clearly fell in November compared to the five-year average. According to Statistics Finland‚Äôs preliminary data in December  the prices of old owner-occupied apartments fell in November 2022 in the whole of Finland by 3.4% compared to November of the previous year.The economic situation will decelerate the historically high rate of construction. The number of issued building permits began to fall already in 2021  but plenty of new apartments were and will be completed in 2022 and 2023  which is maintaining tight competition for good tenants and keeping rent increases moderate. The increased cost level resulting from inflation does  however  create pressure to increase rents in the future.The lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and improving employment resulted in a positive turnaround in internal migration to large growth centres in 2022 and demand for rental apartments has begun to grow. This  and SATO‚Äôs investments in making renting more efficient and improving customer service  were visible as an increase in SATO‚Äôs occupancy rate. Also  economic uncertainty  upward pressure on interest rates and increasing consumer prices contributed to the increase in the demand for rental apartments.Despite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental apartments  and the urbanisation trend continues. Dense urban living near services and along good public transport connections is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. The Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy strong growth  while according to Statistics Finland‚Äôs population projection  Finland‚Äôs population will start declining in 2031. The Helsinki metropolitan area is expected to grow by over 200 000 new residents by 2040. Close to 80% of the area‚Äôs residents already live in one- to two-person households  and the number of small households continues to rise. The proportion of immigrants living in the capital area is predicted to grow from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. Aging populations typically move closer to growth centres and the services they offer  and they increasingly expect housing-related services.The change in the population structure and urbanisation create a stable foundation for demand for rental housing especially in the capital area and in Tampere and Turku. Outside of growth centres  the real prices of homes are declining  which makes acquiring an owner-occupied apartment in growth centres even more challenging for people coming from those areas.StrategyCustomer experience  sustainability and sustainable housing  and SATO employees lie at the core of SATO‚Äôs strategy. We want to be closely involved in our customers‚Äô daily lives in order to serve them in the best possible way. We build homes that stand the test of time and we take care of them in line with the life-cycle principles. We enable sustainable housing for our residents and encourage them to make sustainable choices in their daily lives. We want all SATO employees to be able to contribute ideas and participate in developing future housing solutions.SATO is a housing investment company whose basic product is a rental apartment in an apartment building. We focus our investments on growth centres: the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku  because in these areas demand for apartments is the highest and the increase in value is expected to be stable over the longer term. Our operations are geared towards profitable growth.During the reporting year  our strategy implementation focused especially on developing the customer experience  improving customer satisfaction and retention  and ensuring an excellent moving-in experience. We prepared a sustainability programme for 2023‚Äì2026  which is based on feedback from our stakeholders  such as personnel  customers and partners. The themes of the sustainability programme are sustainable housing  thriving communities and sustainable profitability. In our own sustainability goals  we have committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). With regard to our personnel  we focused on supporting work well-being and developing an inspiring employee experience  competence and a coaching management style.SATO has set maintaining its investment grade credit rating as a strategic goal. Our return on equity target is 8%. In addition  our strategic goal is to achieve a continuously improving Net Promoter Score (NPS) from our residents.According to SATO‚Äôs dividend policy  a maximum of 40% of the cash flow from operations will be paid in annual dividends  depending on the market situation  investment level  the development of the equity ratio and the solvency ratio.Net sales and profitIn 2022  consolidated net sales were EUR 291.2 million (298.3).Operating profit was EUR 198.9 million (304.5). The operating profit without the fair value change of investment properties was EUR 213.8 million (175.4).

The average maturity of loans was 3.3 years (4.0).The calculated impact of changes in the market value of interest hedging on equity was EUR 48.1 million (15.1). During the reporting year  SATO increased the proportion of unsecured loans to 88.1% of all loans. At the end of the year  the proportion of unencumbered assets was 89.2% of the balance sheet.Group structureSATO Corporation is the parent company of SATO Group. At the end of the reporting year  the parent company had a total of 21 subsidiaries engaged in business operations (23). Mergers took place during the year in order to clarify the Group structure.SATO Corporation‚Äôs majority shareholder is Balder Finska Otas AB  whose parent company is Fastighets AB Balder  which is quoted on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.Housing businessOur housing business includes rental activities  customer service  lifecycle management and maintenance. Effective rental activities and digital services provide home-seekers with quick access to a home  and the Group with a steadily increasing cash flow. High-quality maintenance operations ensure the comfort of residents and that the apartments stay in good condition and maintain their value. We serve our customers in daily housing issues through our customer-oriented service organisation.The competition between rental housing providers has become tighter  as a large volume of new rental apartments have been built in growth centres  especially in the Helsinki metropolitan area  in recent years. Tenants now have a wide array of choices and a successful customer experience is more important than ever. We try to respond to this challenge by adjusting the organisation and our service processes. We want to be closely involved in our customers‚Äô daily lives in order to serve them in the best possible way.During the reporting year we expanded the house expert model further in the Helsinki metropolitan area. At the end of the year  SATO employed 62 house experts and the model is now in use to its full extent in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku. The house experts take care of the technical building work on homes and buildings. The purpose of our house expert operating model is to create a better customer experience and more efficient maintenance.SATO had approximately 45 000 customers at the end of the reporting year. We measure our successes in customer encounters using the Net Promoter Score (NPS). Our customer satisfaction improved during the reporting year. We clarified and simplified the processes and operating models related to the customer experience and focused especially on building a harmonised and seamless service experience. We invested in developing digital services  as well as our presence near to the customers. We also established closer collaboration between SATO employees working at our residents‚Äô buildings and improved internal communications.The economic occupancy rate improved compared to the previous year and was 95.2% (94.9) on average in Finland. The external tenant turnover rate for rental apartments was 28.4% (31.2). Rental income decreased 2.4% and was EUR 291.2 million (298.3).The average monthly rent of SATO‚Äôs rental apartments in Finland at the end of the reporting year was EUR 17.84 per m2 (17.46).Net rental income for apartments was EUR 200.4 million (210.6).Investment propertiesOn 31 December 2022  SATO owned a total of 24 999 apartments (26 791). Altogether 191 rental apartments were completed and 1 was acquired. The total number of divested rental apartments was 2 021  of which 2 009 rental apartments were sold to the Swedish investment company Heimstaden.Fair valueThe development of the value of rental apartments is a key factor for SATO. The housing stock is focussed on areas and apartment sizes that are expected to grow in demand in the long term. The allocation of building repairs is based on life-cycle plans and repair need specifications.The fair value of investment properties at the end of December totalled EUR 5 044.2 million (5 032.8). The change in the value of investment properties  including investments and divestments in the financial year  was EUR 11.4 million (279.3).The external expert JLL Finland Oy (JLL) issues a biannual statement on the valuation methods applied by SATO  the appropriateness of sources of information used and the quality and credibility of the valuation for Finnish investment properties. JLL‚Äôs latest statement was issued on the valuation carried out on 31 December 2022. The criteria for the determination of the fair value are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.The change in value was influenced by the increase in yield requirements and the decrease in the fair value of St. Petersburg housing assets.At the end of the year  the Helsinki metropolitan area‚Äôs commuting area accounted for 87.3%  Tampere for 6.4% and Turku for 5.1%  and St. Petersburg for roughly 1.2% of the value of apartments.Investments  divestments and property developmentInvestment activities are used to manage the housing portfolio and prepare the ground for growth. SATO‚Äôs investments in the 2000s in non-subsidised rental apartments total more than EUR 3 billion. SATO acquires and builds entire rental buildings and single rental apartments. Property development allows for new investments in rental apartments in Finland. The rental potential and value of rental apartments owned by SATO are developed through renovation activities.Investments in rental apartments were EUR 190.5 million (167.1). Investments in the Helsinki metropolitan area represented 84.0% of all investments in the reporting year. Investments in new apartments represented 57.1% of the investments. In addition  on 31 December 2022  binding purchase agreements in Finland totalled EUR 114.3 million (96.8).During the reporting year  2 021 rental apartments (26) were divested in Finland. Their total value was EUR 210.6 million (7.9). In April of the reporting year  we sold 2 009 rental apartments mainly in the Lahti  Jyv√§skyl√§ and Oulu areas to the Swedish investment company Heimstaden. The sale was consistent with our strategy based on which SATO is focusing its apartment investments on the Helsinki metropolitan area and its commuting area along the main railway  and in Tampere and Turku and their surrounding municipalities.The book value of plot reserves totalled EUR 40.8 million (43.4) at the end of December. The value of new plots acquired by the end of December totalled EUR 18.4 million (15.5).The permitted building volume for about 1 450 apartments is being developed for the plots in the company‚Äôs housing portfolio. This allows SATO to utilise existing infrastructure  create a denser urban structure and thus bring more customers closer to services and public transport connections.We collaborate with cities when areas are being developed and new housing is planned for them. As a long-term owner  housing investor and housing provider  SATO wants to build nice homes  residential areas and pleasant urban areas for decades to come. During the reporting year  we continued the development of the Hakunila area in Vantaa and Finnoo in Espoo  for example. In Helsinki  we were involved in planning the Mellunpuisto project in Mellunkyl√§ and we continued our collaboration with VR to develop the area it owns in Ilmala. During the reporting year  plots in complementary planning areas developed by SATO were sold to construction companies and other partners  enabling the construction of approximately 175‚àí200 owner-occupied apartments and roughly 25 state-subsidised rental apartments  thus promoting a diverse residential area and urban structure.In May 2022  construction of non-subsidised rental apartments began in Rykmentinpuisto in Tuusula. The area is a collaboration by several parties and the area will include different types of housing. SATO is building 92 non-subsidised rental apartments in the area. The Rykmentinpuisto Pataljoonantie project is SATO‚Äôs first new apartment investment in Tuusula in more than 15 years.In August 2022  SATO signed a deed to buy from Lujatalo an apartment building which is being built in Skanssi  Turku. The eight-storey building under construction at the address Sorakatu 9 will have 77 new rental apartments. This is SATO‚Äôs first new apartment investment in Turku in five years. Construction was begun in August 2022 and the apartments will be ready for residents at the end of 2023.We are building 257 new rental apartments at Peijinkuja in Finnoo  Espoo. Construction began in August 2022 and the apartments will be completed in stages during autumn 2024. The project is based on long-term development work in which we drew up a new local plan with the City of Espoo for a property that SATO owns in the old low-rise area of Hannus  which formerly featured terraced houses. The area is being transformed into a new area called Finnoo. SATO‚Äôs goal is to continue developing the Finnoo area in the future.During the reporting year  new rental apartments were finished on Lupajantie in Mellunm√§ki  Helsinki and on Jokiniityntie in Kirkkonummi.Due to rising construction  maintenance and financing costs and the moderate rent development resulting from the competitive situation  we made a decision to refrain from launching new construction projects and we are postponing their launch.In 2022  we completed 191 rental apartments (235) and 0 owner-occupied apartments (71) and 52 FlexHomes (0) in Finland. On 31 December 2022  a total of 1 418 apartments (1 152) were under construction: 1 418 rental apartments (1 100) and 0 owner-occupied apartments (0) and 0 FlexHomes (52). FlexHome is a short-term ownership concept that enables home ownership with a small initial capital outlay and which the resident can purchase entirely for themselves within five years of completion.A total of EUR 92.4 million (93.6) was spent on repairing and upgrading apartments.At the end of December  SATO owned 522 apartments (525) in St. Petersburg. The economic occupancy rate of rental apartments in St. Petersburg was 92.4% (97.7) on average. Since the start of the war in Ukraine  we have been reviewing opportunities to withdraw from the Russian business operations. Based on our studies  a fast withdrawal is not possible. For this reason  SATO will continue to rent residential apartments in St. Petersburg until a way to withdraw has been found. The company is actively seeking a solution.SustainabilityOur sustainability work during the reporting year was guided by SATO‚Äôs strategy and our sustainability programme for 2019‚Äì2022  which emphasised carbon-neutral cities and the well-being of residents and neighbourhoods.Due to the energy crisis resulting from the war in Ukraine  we increased the efficiency of our energy saving measures and paid more attention to the temperatures of apartments than earlier. We monitor and regulate the heating of some 21 000 SATOhomes using AI. Our goal is to maintain a temperature of approximately 21 degrees in SATOhomes  which is a healthy and energy-efficient indoor temperature. In addition to our own energy saving measures  we actively provided our residents with guidance on energy saving opportunities in their day-to-day lives. At the end of the year  we provided our residents with instructions on how to prepare for possible blackouts in the exceptional energy situation.During the reporting year  we launched a development project related to waste and sorting  in which we surveyed our homes‚Äô waste-collection points and inspected their lighting  the number of waste bins and signage. Based on the survey  we targeted repairs at the sites that needed them and they will continue in upcoming years. Our housing advisors‚Äô tours focused on waste guidance during the year. We pilot tested a clothing collection point on Kauppakartanonkatu in Helsinki‚Äôs It√§keskus.Some of our sustainable development measures are described below under ‚ÄòImpacts on the environment and society‚Äô.In the autumn of 2022  an external sustainability panel chose six of SATO‚Äôs rental apartment buildings to be among the Ostavastuullisesti.fi website‚Äôs more sustainable choices. SATO was the first rental housing provider to be included in the Ostavastuullisesti.fi service. Our following buildings were assessed to be a more sustainable choice: Lupajantie 2 in Mellunkyl√§  Helsinki; Jokiniityntie 28 in Kirkkonummi; Lincolninaukio 4 in Keimola  Vantaa; Kotkatie 6 in Espoo and Jokiniementie 46 and 48 in Ver√§j√§m√§ki  Helsinki.In 2022  we took part in Rakli‚Äôs newly launched Green Homes activities. At the end of 2022  we had altogether 1 100 Green Homes which had either geothermal heat or consumption-based water invoicing or both.We participated for the eighth time in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) assessment. SATO received two stars on a scale of one to five. SATO‚Äôs score in the Standing Investments Benchmark (existing properties) fell by one point from last year (score now at 73)  while in the Development Benchmark (construction projects) SATO‚Äôs score rose to 75 points from 71 points last year. We report on our sustainability annually in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative‚Äôs (GRI) reporting guidelines  and the environmental sustainability figures presented in the report have been verified by an independent third party  i.e. KPMG Oy Ab.During the reporting year  we collaborated on a project with the non-profit organisations No Fixed Abode and the Rehabilitation Foundation to help participants in the project find two of life‚Äôs essentials ‚Äì a home and a job. By the end of 2022  10 people who had participated in the project were living in a SATOhome.During 2022  we updated the materiality analysis and released a new sustainability programme for 2023‚Äì2026. Our vision is to be a leader in sustainable rental housing during the programme period.In 2020 we committed to reporting in compliance with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and in 2021  we conducted an extensive assessment of the risks and opportunities arising from climate change for SATO‚Äôs entire supply chain. In the framework  the risks are divided into four main categories: transition risks  acute and chronic physical risks and social risks. At the same time  we carried out a scenario analysis to look into how the two- and four-degree scenarios affect society and how SATO should prepare for these changes. During the reporting year  risks caused by climate change were part of SATO‚Äôs general risk assessment that is conducted internally each year. In 2022  two reports were made to SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors on climate risks and opportunities and their impact.The Corporate Governance Statement is published separately from the Report of the Board of Directors. SATO‚Äôs Corporate Governance Statement  Code of Conduct and sustainability programme are available at sato.fi.Impacts on the environment and societyOur objective is to systematically reduce the negative impacts of our operations on the environment. We reduce the load on the environment by regularly and proactively taking care of and repairing homes and properties according to the life-cycle principle  and by building properties primarily in existing urban environments and near good public transport connections.The planning of SATO‚Äôs new rental apartments always takes into account energy efficiency and solutions that will last for decades. In new properties  SATO‚Äôs goal is energy class A (energy performance indicator 75 or below)  which is significantly better than that required by the building code (energy performance indicator 90). All of the buildings that were completed during the reporting year were energy class A. The average EPI for buildings begun during 2022 was 72 and all of the housing starts are energy class A.We are committed to the Energy Efficiency Agreement targets for the property sector  aiming for a reduction in the total consumption of electricity and heat of 10.5% from the 2015 baseline by 2025.The use of renewable energy in heating significantly reduces the in-use emissions of homes. At every new building and renovation site  we look into the possibility of geothermal heat. We currently have 17 properties that are carbon neutral in terms of electricity and heating. During the reporting year  geothermal heat was being built on 12 properties. In addition  six properties had a solar power plant and solar power plants were being built on nine properties. In 2022  building electricity consisted entirely of emission-free electricity.During 2022  SATO converted the heating system to geothermal heat at the last properties which still had fossil-fuel-based heating  thus taking us a significant step closer to our goal of achieving in-use carbon neutrality.Vantaa Energy and SATO signed an energy partnership agreement in February 2022. Together with Vantaa Energy  we are developing carbon-neutral energy solutions for buildings‚Äô heating and cooling  which will help us achieve our carbon neutrality target by 2030 for in-use energy consumption.During the reporting year  we continued to invest in energy efficiency improvements in SATOhomes in connection with renovations. In renovations  our goal is to improve energy efficiency by some 30% compared to earlier. Due to the rise in heating and electricity prices  energy costs rose overall.During the reporting year  specific energy consumption fell 4.1%  specific electricity consumption rose 7.1% and specific water consumption fell 2.0% compared to 2021. Specific emissions from SATO‚Äôs apartments fell by 9.3% compared to 2021 and were 28.2 (31.1) carbon dioxide equivalent kilograms per square metre. Emissions are calculated according to the absolute consumption of district heat. Electricity was generated from emission-free nuclear power.According to the Ministry of the Environment  the built environment causes approximately one third of Finland‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions. The construction industry  together with the real estate sector and their related services  employ more than half a million people and bring in tax revenues for society. The construction industry does  however  have negative impacts not only on the environment  but also society and people. Some well-known examples of the construction industry‚Äôs negative impacts are the grey economy  occupational safety and human rights-related violations  as well as irregularities in procurement and delivery chains. We regularly assess and predict the social  economic and environmental risks related to our operations. We try to systematically reduce the identified negative impacts  for example by following our Code of Conduct  by combating the grey economy  by conducting audits and internal control  and by continuously developing our operations. During 2022  we decided to survey the current state of our compliance function in order to gain an overall picture of our policies and commitments.SATO has a whistleblowing channel through which SATO employees and external stakeholders can anonymously report critical concerns.The Group‚Äôs sustainability programme is available in its entirety at sato.fi.Development activitiesSATO‚Äôs development activities during the reporting year focused on developing sales and customer experience processes and operating models  the renewal of the invoicing processes and improving the continuous development operating model. We invested in developing digital services  as well as our presence near to the customers  and in building a uniform and seamless service experience. Our goal is to serve our customers in the best way possible  regardless of time or place.Based on customer feedback  we also developed  during the reporting year  our processes involving the rental of a new home. The changes made daily work more efficient for our rental team  which also means even better service for our customers. We revamped the reservation of apartment viewings to make them more flexible for the customer and to pilot test the online reservation of viewings no matter the time or place. The apartment viewings were mostly held by our own viewing agents. We updated the apartment application process on the sato.fi website and in 2022 made it possible for our customers to apply for homes using the ‚Äòmore sustainable option‚Äô search criterion.In our development operations last year  we also focused on renewing the invoicing processes and we piloted a new invoicing system in summer 2022. The new system offers better opportunities to view up-to-date invoicing information and the plan is to roll it out in full in spring 2023.In developing the business  we adopted a continuous development model at SATO during the reporting year. We defined the roles related to the model and will develop the activities as smaller components rather than large units  which will speed up development work and allow processes to be improved more effectively.A total of EUR 3.2 million (3.2) was spent on development  corresponding to approximately 1.1% of net sales.Risk managementRisk management is used to ensure that risks impacting the company‚Äôs business are identified  managed and monitored. The main risks of SATO‚Äôs business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.SATO‚Äôs most significant risks are related to prolonged inflation and the resulting rise in interest rates. As a result of the war in Ukraine  the prices of energy  food  materials and commodities have increased dramatically and interest rates have risen. Higher cost of living can have a negative impact on consumers‚Äô purchasing power and ability to meet their obligations. If the strong growth in the cost of financing and maintenance costs continues and the market situation does not provide an opportunity to transfer the higher costs into rents in full  this can have a negative impact on the fair value of investment assets and the company‚Äôs ability to finance investments  which means that new investments and renovations will have to be postponed.The most significant risks in the renting of apartments are related to economic cycles and fluctuations in demand and supply. Market risk can increase the supply of rental housing to a point that it exceeds demand. This leads to rental housing vacancies and pressure to even out or lower the rent level especially for the old housing portfolio.A clear weakening in the housing market could have a negative impact on the market value of SATO‚Äôs housing portfolio. In accordance with its strategy  SATO focuses its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing its existing housing portfolio  thus ensuring the rental potential of its apartments and the development of their value.Changes in official regulations and legislation  as well as the uncertainty stemming from them  may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and thus on SATO‚Äôs business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and also calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group‚Äôs treasury policy  which has been approved by SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors. Our financial risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other long-term financing commitments. The company established a EUR 1.5 billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) bond programme in 2019.The means for managing the liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  committed credit facilities of EUR 700 million and a commercial paper programme of EUR 400 million. We increase the amount of reserves as the financing requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating rate loans form an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed and floating rate loans either by issuing fixed rate loans or by interest rate hedges. According to our treasury policy  our objective is to keep the ratio of fixed rate loans at over 60 % of debt portfolio after interest hedging.There are risks related to the business environment in our St. Petersburg operations  including currency risk. The consolidation of foreign currency-denominated assets in the consolidated financial statements also involves a translation risk. Possibilities of hedging the translation risk are evaluated in accordance with our financial policy. SATO has abstained from making new investments in Russia for a long time. Since the start of the war in Ukraine  the company has been reviewing opportunities to withdraw from the Russian business operations. Based on our studies  a fast withdrawal is not possible  which is why SATO will continue to rent residential apartments in St. Petersburg until a way to withdraw has been found. The company is actively seeking a solution. The Russian operating environment is expected to be extremely uncertain and it may cause disturbances in SATO‚Äôs business operations in Russia and with parties related to the Russian business. This can affect SATO‚Äôs ability to make payments to suppliers  its employees and authorities  and to receive payments from customers  which can have a significant adverse impact on SATO‚Äôs business operations in Russia. If the Ukraine war is prolonged  doing business in Russia may have a negative impact on the company‚Äôs reputation and it may make doing business difficult in Finland and weaken the company‚Äôs ability to procure financing on the market. It may also have an adverse impact on the financial result or operations of SATO‚Äôs properties  not to mention on financing costs or values.A more detailed description of risks and risk management is available on the Group‚Äôs website www.sato.fi.Pending legal actionsSATO has no official procedures  legal actions or arbitration proceedings pending that would have a significant impact on the company‚Äôs financial standing or profitability  and SATO is not aware of any threat of such proceedings.SharesOn 31 December 2022  the share capital of SATO Corporation was EUR 4 442 192.00 and there were 56 783 067 shares.

The average number of personnel was 328 (276) during the reporting year. The Group‚Äôs salaries and remunerations in 2022 totalled EUR 21.6 million (18.8).Shareholders‚Äô Nomination CommitteeThe Shareholders‚Äô Nomination Committee consists of representatives of SATO‚Äôs four largest shareholders registered in the book-entry system on 1 October. If a shareholder chooses not to exercise their nomination right  the right will pass on to the next largest shareholder. The State Pension Fund  the company‚Äôs fourth largest shareholder on 1 October 2022  did not exercise its nomination right  and the right was passed to Erkka Valkila  the fifth largest shareholder. The Committee consisted of representatives of the following shareholders: Balder Finska Otas AB (Erik Selin)  Stichting Depositary APG Strategic Real Estate Pool (Hans Spikker)  Elo Mutual Pension Insurance Company (Hanna Hiidenpalo) and Erkka Valkila.Board of Directors  CEO and auditorsThe Annual General Meeting held on 24 March 2022 confirmed that the Board of Directors consists of six members.In 2022  the members of SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors were chairman Erik Selin and ordinary members Esa Lager  Tarja P√§√§kk√∂nen  Sharam Rahi  Johannus (Hans) Spikker and Timo Stenius.The Board of Directors convened 11 times in 2022. The Board‚Äôs work is supported by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.In 2022  Antti Aarnio  M.Sc. (Tech.)  was SATO‚Äôs CEO.As the company‚Äôs auditor  the Annual General Meeting selected the audit firm Deloitte Oy  which appointed APA Aleksi Martamo as the auditor in charge. The auditor‚Äôs term in office is the financial year  and the auditor‚Äôs duties end at the closing of the next Annual General Meeting.Members of the Management GroupDuring the reporting period 2022  the Corporate Management Group consisted of Antti Aarnio  CEO  Arto Aalto  EVP  Investments  Markku Honkasalo  CFO  Janne Ojalehto  CCO (until 27 January 2023) and Elina Vaurasalo  EVP  Housing Business.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO‚Äôs business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence  the development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  the general competitive situation and interest rates.Employment development was strong in early 2022  but slowed down towards year-end due to economic challenges. During the reporting year  consumers‚Äô confidence weakened to a historically low level after the start of the year  which showed in private consumption. According to the projection made by the Bank of Finland on 16 December 2022  Finland‚Äôs economic growth in 2022 will be 1.9% due to the good start to the year. In 2023  the increase in energy prices and the cost of living is predicted to cause the economy to slide into a slight downturn and shrink by 0.5%.Uncertainty and rising interest rates are slowing housing sales. According to the statistics released by the Central Federation of Finnish Real Estate Agencies in December 2022  sales volumes of new and old apartments clearly fell in November compared to the five-year average. According to Statistics Finland‚Äôs preliminary data in December  the prices of old owner-occupied apartments fell in November 2022 in the whole of Finland by 3.4% compared to November of the previous year.The economic situation will decelerate the historically high rate of construction. The number of issued building permits began to fall already in 2021  but plenty of new apartments were and will be completed in 2022 and 2023  which is maintaining tight competition for good tenants and keeping rent increases moderate. The increased cost level resulting from inflation does  however  create pressure to increase rents in the future.The lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and improving employment resulted in a positive turnaround in internal migration to large growth centres in 2022 and demand for rental apartments has begun to grow. This  and SATO‚Äôs investments in making renting more efficient and improving customer service  were visible as an increase in SATO‚Äôs occupancy rate. Also  economic uncertainty  upward pressure on interest rates and increasing consumer prices contributed to the increase in the demand for rental apartments.As tenants have a wider array of choices  a successful customer experience is more important than ever. SATO is investing strongly in increasing its customer presence and developing digital services.In line with its majority shareholder‚Äôs operating model  SATO Corporation will not publish guidance on its 2023 earnings. The parent company of Balder Finska Otas AB is Fastighets AB Balder  which is quoted on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.Proposal of the Board of Directors for the distribution of profitOn 31 December 2022  the parent company‚Äôs distributable equity was EUR 512 557 145.56  of which profit for the period was EUR 129 644 613.16.

My name is Caroline  and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. [Operator Instructions] However  you will have the opportunity to ask questions at the end of the call. [Operator Instructions]I will now hand over to your host  Stephane Boujnah  Euronext's CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board joined by Giorgio Modica  Euronext's CFO to begin today's conference. Thank you.Giorgio ModicaGood morning  everybody and thank you for joining us this morning for the Euronext fourth quarter and full-year 2022 results conference call and webcast. I am Stephane Boujnah  CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext. And I will start with the highlights of the full year and the fourth quarter. Giorgio Modica  the Euronext CFO will then further develop the main business and the financial highlights of the fourth quarter.As an introduction  I would like to highlight three points. First  Euronext is stronger than ever. Euronext is now present in the full value chain and Euronext confirmed its leadership position in listing and in trading in Europe. In addition our revenue demonstrated strong resilience  thanks to our diversified business model.Second  we beat our 2022 cost guidance  thanks to cost discipline in an inflationary environment. Third  we are well-advanced in the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group and by the end of 2023  we will reach EUR70 million of cumulative run rate synergies. We are now in a position to upgrade our 2024 synergy target by EUR15 million to EUR115 million of annual run rate synergies.Let me give you some more detail on each of those points. First  as I said Euronext is today the leading listing venue in Europe for equity  and for that globally. And we are also the largest venue for equity trading in Europe representing 2 times the volume traded on the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Borse. We are now a top-ranking Post Trade infrastructure operator through Euronext Clearing and Euronext Securities. This is all the result of our diversification strategy. And this major transformation is reflected in our 2022 performance where 58% of our underlying revenue is now non-volume related.2022 was also a strong year in terms of financial performance. In 2022 Euronext reached record underlying revenues  an income above EUR1.4 billion. This is up plus 13%  compared to 2021. We generated plus EUR120.2 million additional revenue in 2022  compared to ‚Äò21  which was a very strong reference shows as you may remember. This strong 2022 performance was driven by the strong performance of non-volume related businesses and enhanced revenue capture.And in trading  we recorded a very strong year for power and for ForEx trading. The softer volume environment for cash equity trading in the second half of 2022 was clearly offset by significant and efficient management of yield and a real uptick in market share from October 2022. Our Post Trade franchise significantly benefited from the consolidation of Euronext Clearing and Euronext Securities Milan  which were acquired as part of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition in April ‚Äò21. The diversified business of the Euronext Securities allowed us to capture value as settlement activity stabilized in H2 2022.I would -- like especially to highlight the performance of our listing business  which grew by plus 15.1% and reported solid listing activities with 83 new listings in 2022. In particular  we welcomed 20 international companies  which in my view is the recognition that Euronext  Euronext market in Europe are now the venue of choice for listing in Europe. Furthermore our Advanced Data Services business increased by plus 15.5%  reflecting growth across the real-time and non-real-time data business  as well as index growth.Lastly  following the successful migration of our Core Data Centre to Bergamo in June 2022  we significantly scaled up our Technology Solutions business reaching over EUR100 million in revenue now. That's why  as mentioned earlier  the share of non-volume related revenue represented 58% of our top line in 2022 and accounted for 141% of operating costs excluding D&A.And that brings me to our ongoing focus on cost discipline on slide five with a bigger picture on financials. Thanks to strong cost discipline and several positive one-off impacts of the year  we overachieved or revised cost guidance of EUR612 million  down from an initial cost guidance  as you may remember it  up EUR622 million  because we reported EUR606.1 million of underlying expenses excluding D&A. And this was achieved despite inflationary pressures  despite pressure on supply chains that everyone experiences.Consequently  our 2022 adjusted EBITDA grew double-digit to EUR861.6 million. This translated into an adjusted EBITDA margin at 58.7%. Overall  this performance resulted in a plus 5.7% increase of adjusted net income to EUR555.3 million. Adjusted EPS was down minus 4.8% to EUR5.21 per share. And this reflects the higher number of outstanding shares of our 2022  compared to 2021.On a reported basis  net income is up plus 6% to EUR437.8 million. Consequently a dividend of EUR2.22 per share will be proposed at our upcoming Annual General Meeting in May. These dividend represent a payout ratio of 50% of reported net income adjusted for the EUR49 million pretax or EUR35 million post tax one-off loss related to the partial disposal of the Euronext Clearing portfolio announced in Q2 2022. And this dividend is EUR0.29 more than the ‚Äò21 dividend per share. It is an increase of plus 13%.Moving now to the Q4 performance on slide six. Euronext reported a solid fourth quarter for 2022. The quarter was marked by strong performance of Advanced Data Services  strong performance of listing activities offset by lower revenues from business correlated with cash equity volumes. Underlying revenues were down minus 6.2%  compared to Q4 2021 at EUR347 million  reflecting the resilience of our diversified revenue streams in a low volatility environment.Despite softer cash equity derivatives and MTS cash trading activity  the strength of our non-volume related businesses enabled us to report only a slight decline in total revenue. First non-volume-related revenue posted a strong performance overall. Notably  as I said earlier in listing and advanced data services in technology. Second  our trading businesses that are not related to equity markets strongly performed. We notably recorded strong growth year-on-year in power trading and a solid quarter in ForEx trading.Last  we efficiently manage our revenue capture and regained market share from October 2022 in cash trading operations. This translated into non-volume related revenue accounting for 60% of the total Q4 revenue  and covering 130% of underlying operating expenses excluding D&A.So Q4 2022 underlying operational expenses excluding D&A increased slightly to EUR159.2 million up plus 1.6%  compared to Q4 2021. And this reflect for cost disciplined approach to cost control and higher capitalized project costs offsetting inflationary pressures. Overall we reported an EBITDA  an adjusted EBITDA of EUR187.9 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.1%. This led to an adjusted EPS at EUR1.11 per share and an adjusted net income of EUR118.2 million. On a reported basis the EPS for this fourth quarter reached EUR0.93.Clearly ‚Äò22 was a year of transformation for Euronext and we made good progress in our integration process and synergy delivery. The migration of our Core Data Centre from Basildon in the U.K. to Bergamo in Italy was the first key milestone of our growth or Impact strategic plan. This migration combined with continued cost discipline enabled us to deliver EUR34.1 million cumulated run rate annual synergies at the end of 2022 in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.Looking forward  we expect to achieve around EUR70 million of our targeted synergies by the end of ‚Äò23 alone with the delivery of several key projects. First  next month we will significantly change the dimension of our unique European liquidity pool  because the migration of Italian cash market to Euronext state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq will benefit local and global trading members and will allow an alignment of fees.Second  the other Italian markets will migrate to the Optiq European liquidity pool starting in Q4 2023. And looking further cost synergies with the termination of the Millennium LSEG technology contract. Third  Euronext Clearing would become the CCP of choice for equity clearing by the end of this year  generating revenue synergies. And the following year by Q3 2024 Euronext Clearing will also clear Euronext listed derivatives.Those good progress on integration mean that we are able to upgrade our synergy target. We expect total run rate synergies in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group to reach EUR115 million by the end of ‚Äô24. This is EUR15 million more than the amount targeted until now. And this is almost 2 times the initial amount announced at the moment of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition.You may remember that in April ‚Äò21 we committed to deliver EUR60 million of synergies in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. Today we are confident that we will deliver almost a double EUR115 million of synergies in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. So that demonstrates once again the strong track record of the Euronext teams in delivering operating performance and operating leverage.On the next slide  I'd like to take a moment to tell you in more detail about one of our key strategic objectives related to clearing. It's a key strategic project. Last month we confirmed the planned European expansion of Euronext Clearing to all Euronext listed derivatives for Q3 2024. As a result Euronext served LCH SA  a notice of termination for the existing derivative clearing agreement on 16 January 2023.As we already announced  the related termination fee of approximately EUR36 million to be paid to LCH SA is part of the EUR150 million envelope of implementation cost related to the growth for Impact 2024 strategic plan. Therefore  this amount will be provisioned in our income statement as a non-underlying expense in Q1 2023 and will be payable in 2024. When we embarked on our ambitions Post Trade Strategy our aim was clear. To offer our clients the benefit of scale and harmonization‚Äôs across European markets  while still maintaining a robust local footprint in Euronext market.For all clients this will bring margin efficiencies with the implementation of a new value-add risk model and a single default fund. It will also bring efficiencies across all asset classes with transparency on data  particularly on settlement leveraging Euronext Securities target to securities settlement platform. So the expansion of Euronext Clearing is really critical as it will allow us to manage the entire trading value chain of our markets by the end of ‚Äô24  and it will generate significant revenue and cost synergies.Moving to slide nine  we continued to deploy capital efficiently in 2022 through a number of initiatives allowing us to better control our technology and develop new services. First  in March Euronext Securities acquired the General Meetings  Designated Representative and Shareholder's Registers activities of Spafid. This strategic partnership has contributed to the high growth  but had its services offered through Euronex Securities franchise.Secondly  we have internalized the technology powering MTS and Euronext Securities in Milan as part of our plan to integrate our full value chain and our technology. In addition  following the completion of the strategic review undertaken as part of the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group and our decision to divert from non-core asset  Euronext has disposed the U.S. subsidiary of MTS  MTS Markets International Inc.Importantly during this time  we have pursued very actively our deleveraging path  reaching 2.6 times net debt to EBITDA at the end of December 2022. And this compares to 3.2 times net debt to EBITDA at the closing of the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. Together with our strong cash generation capability  this brings us to around EUR1.5 billion of available capital at the end of December 2022. And our progress has been recognized by S&P that upgraded their outlook to positive in 2022. And as you have seen it yesterday evening  we have been upgraded to BBB plus.So we are very well advanced on our integration. We are confident in our ability to deliver upgraded synergies  because  once again this demonstrates the post-merger integration track record of Euronext teams. And this confidence combined with our favorable liquidity position enables us to continue exploring external growth. We would be looking for assets able to contribute to higher organic revenue growth to provide scalability and to improve exposure to non-volume related businesses. Obviously always in line with our rigorous capital allocation policy.Finally  I'd like to take a moment to highlight the great progress we have made with our Fit for 1.5 degree ESG commitment. We [Technical Difficulty] achievements of this SBTi target have already been implemented such as the migration of the Euronext Core Data Centre in Bergamo  which is powered 100% by renewable energy sources. We are also pleased to announce that Euronext has been included in the Euronext Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Euronext Equileap Gender Equality France 40  two indices showcasing European companies that demonstrate a strong role in improving gender equality. And we have continued to push for a broader transition in our markets. We have launched the CAC SBTi index  an index for grouping companies within the SBF 120 that have set emission reduction target approved as being in line with the Paris Agreement 1.5 degree before.So I now hand over to Giorgio Modica for the review of our fourth quarter performance.Giorgio ModicaThank you very much Stephane and good morning  everyone. Let's have now a look at the performance of Euronext in the fourth quarter of 2022. I'm now on slide 12. In the fourth quarter of 2022 Euronext demonstrated solid results reflecting the strong performance of advanced data services and listing combined with an efficient management of market share and revenue capture in a challenging trading environment for especially cash trading volumes.As a result  and as already mentioned by Stephane  Euronext underlying revenue income was only down 6.2%  compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 despite the relevant reduction of volumes  notably reflecting the strength of our diversified business mix. Briefly  listing revenue grew 3.1% resulting from a resilient equity and debt listing activity despite the tougher environment. We capture the majority of listing in Europe  remarkable this quarter were the high shares of company from outside of the Euronext market among our listing  accounting for around 40% of equity listing and demonstrating the international appeal of Euronext.Trading revenue was down 12.1% resulting from lower cash equity and MTS cash volume  partially offset by a record quarter for power trading and a good performance of FX trading. Post Trade revenue including -- excluding NTI was down 2.5% as a result of weaker equity clearing activity and a stabilized settlement activity.Advanced data Service revenue increased 7.3%. This was good performance across the offering both on real-time and non-real-time data  as well as on indices. Technology Solutions grew 1.8% driven by the good performance of colocation activity after the migration to the Bergamo Data Centre in June this year.In the fourth quarter of 2022 non-volume related revenue accounted  as Stephane said  for 60% of total Group revenue versus 58% the same quarter last year  reflecting high Advanced Data Services and Corporate Service revenue and revenues from services in general. Lastly  those non-volume related revenues cover 130% of our underlying operating expenses excluding D&A compared to 136% last year.Now I would like to move to the next slide  slide 13  for listing. Listing revenue was EUR53.5 million this quarter with an increase of 3.1% compared to the same quarter last year. This growth is driven by a higher annual fees  the strong performance of corporate service and the positive impact of primary and secondary listing revenue recognition over time. We have discussed already the impact on IFRS on listing revenues.In detail during the fourth quarter of 2022 Euronext maintained its leading position in Europe for primary equity listing counting 24 new listing of which  as I said  approximately 40% were international companies. In the fourth quarter of 2022 EUR310 million were raised on Euronext primary markets compared to a very strong Q4 2021 with EUR6.6 billion raised on our markets.As far as secondary issue are concerned EUR10.1 billion was raised in the fourth quarter of 2022  well above the same quarter last year. Euronext also reinforced its position as the leading venue for bond listing worldwide this quarter with over 53 000 bond listed across all Euronext market at the end of the year. And this despite a slowdown of the global bond listing activity due to the macroeconomic environment. This translated into EUR226.9 billion in debt raised on Euronext market during this quarter.Overall  this brings us to a total of EUR237.3 billion raised in equity and debt of Euronext market this quarter. Lastly  Corporate Service continued its growth trajectory across businesses despite slightly lower webcast activity in a post-pandemic environment.Let's have a look at our trading business on slide 14. I'm starting with cash trading. In the fourth quarter of 2022  we observed lower cash trading volumes  which were partially offset by efficient revenue capture and market share management  in particular we saw an uptick in market share from October 2022 not at detriment of revenue capture.Cash trading revenue was EUR65.1 million this quarter  a decrease of 17.9%  compared to the same quarter last year as a result of average daily volumes of EUR10.1 billion  a volume decrease of 17.2% and 3% fewer trading days this quarter. Average revenue capture over the quarter was at 0.50 basis point versus 0.49 basis point in the fourth quarter of 2021  reflecting the dilutive impact of Borsa Italiana market and larger average order size in line with pre-pandemic levels. As a reminder  we charge per value and per order explaining the dilutive impact of larger order size on our revenue capture.As I said  we reported an uptick in market share from October 2022 and Euronext market share on cash trading averaged 65.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022. In the past we were often asked about the sustainability of those metrics. This is why I would like to confirm to you that in 2023  we expect to maintain on our market  the market share greater or equal to 63% and our revenue capture to be around 0.52 basis point following the integration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq  considering current market condition and order size.Euronext has once again confirmed its position as the largest  the deepest  and the most stable liquidity pool in Europe offering the highest quality of executions with market participants. We are excited that our cash trading business will significantly change dimension with a migration of Italian cash market to Euronext state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq in the first quarter of 2023.Now  I would like to move to Derivatives trading. Derivatives trading revenues decreased 5.4% to EUR13.4 million this quarter as a result of softer volume environment  partially offset by a positive impact of volume mix on revenue capture and fee changes. Average daily volumes on financial derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2022 were down 12.7% from the same quarter last year  suffering from a strong comparison basis with high volatility in the fourth quarter of 2021.Commodities average daily volumes were down 17.2% in the fourth quarter of 2022  compared to the fourth quarter of 2021  reflecting a normalized trading environment. Over the quarter  the average revenue capture increased for derivatives to EUR0.34 per lot  up 12.5% from the fourth quarter of 2021  thanks to volume mix impact and fee changes.Lastly on Fixed Income trading. Fixed Income trading reported revenue at EUR22.1 million this quarter  compared to EUR24.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This reflects an economic environment in Europe favoring money market and therefore repo volumes. MTS reported an overall robust performance in market dominated by increasing interest rate  with continued strong traction for repo trading offset by lower cash trading volumes.In the fourth quarter of 2022 MTS cash reported EUR12.8 million of revenue with ADV down 32.7% to EUR15.4 billion and MTS Repo reported EUR5.6 million of revenue with term-adjusted ADV up 36% to EUR397 billion.Continuing on trading on slide 15. The fourth quarter of 2022 saw a solid performance of Euronext FX in terms of both revenues and average daily volume  benefiting from the continued positive momentum with a high volatility and good traction of our matching engine in Singapore. Euronext reported average spot FX trading daily volumes of $20.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022  up 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.Spot FX trading revenue increased 9.5%  compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 at EUR6.7 million. Power trading reported EUR8.9 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022  a growth of 4.7% year-on-year driven by dynamic volumes increased foot print in Nord Pool in Central Europe  U.K.  Ireland and a continued robust performance in the Nordics.In the fourth quarter of 2022 average daily volume day ahead power traded was 2.98 terawatt hours  up 7.9% with respect to the same quarter last year  and average daily intraday power traded was at 0.13-terawatt hour. This is an increase of 9% year-on-year. I would like to highlight the intraday trading volumes in Central and Western Europe reached record level this quarter.Moving to slide 16. Revenues from our Post Trade activities excluding net treasury income decreased 2.5% to EUR88.6 million. Clearing revenue was down 3.9% this quarter to EUR29 million as a result of dynamic bond clearing activity  partially offsetting weaker cash and derivative clearing activity.As announced with the Q2 2022 results  Euronext Clearing engaged in a partial disposal of its investment portfolio. We dispose the portfolio maturing after the 1st of May 2023 and kept the rest until maturity. The runoff for this portfolio is currently ongoing and almost completed. As a consequence  our net treasury income is not yet at cruising speed and this quarter amounted to EUR4.3 million. In this respect  I would like to confirm our target for NTI 2023. In the first quarter of 2023  we expect to reach 10 basis point margin similarly from the margin we have reached in the fourth quarter of 2022. And from the second quarter this year and onwards we will reach our cruising speeds at 20 basis points.I wanted to make a brief comment as well on the upgrade of S&P. What I wanted to highlight is that the upgrade of rating is not only linked to an improvement of leverage  but as well a reduction of clearing risk and our rank anchor rating moved from BBB to BBB plus as S&P has removed the notch downgrade for clearing and settlement risk. This gives us a significantly more upside as far as rating is concerned.Continuing on settlement and other Post Trade revenue including the activity of Euronext Security  the revenues were EUR59.6 million this quarter  down 1.9% year-on-year. This reflect the resilient top line of Euronext Securities  thanks to its diversified geographical footprint in a stabilized environment. For settlement  over the fourth quarter of 2022  the value of assets under custody at Euronext Securities increased to EUR6.3 billion.I'm now moving to the next slide  slide 17  Advanced Data Services reached record revenues of EUR54.5 million this quarter  up 7.3% year-on-year  driven by strong traction of our core data businesses and good momentum of Advanced Data solution franchise including quant research and indices. Investor service revenues were up EUR2.6 million this quarter  up 13.2% reflecting continued commercial expansion of the business. Lastly  Technology Solutions revenue was up 1.8% compared to the same quarter last year to EUR26.9 million  reflecting the good performance of colocation activity following the migration of Euronext Core Data Centre  and this more than offset the lower revenues from hosting services.Moving to the next slide  I'm now on slide 19. I wanted to give some highlights on our 2023 cost guidance. In 2023 Euronext expects its underlying expenses excluding D&A to be around EUR630 million  compared to the annualized second half 2022 underlying expenses excluding D&A of around EUR620 million. The slight increase solidly relates to growth initiative to develop our non-volume related fund business.In other words  we expect that the cost base of Euronext to remain stable as cost savings and synergies will entirely compensate inflation and business development costs. I would like also to add that on the revenue side  we have performed a deep review of our pricing strategy across products to reflect inflation. And we will have the effect of this activity in 2023.I would like as well to do a few comments on integration costs. Stephane has already partially covered that. Following the termination of our derivative clearing agreement  we will post the provision this quarter of around EUR36 million covering termination and migration costs. For the sake of clarity  this does not change our target of integration cost  which is set at EUR150 million. In addition  I would like to confirm our previous guideline in terms of integration cost per quarter that for 2023 will range in between EUR10 million and EUR15 million depending on the quarter.Moving now to the next slide. This brings us to the EBITDA bridge. Euronext adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was down 12% to EUR187.9 million  mainly from lower volume environment partially as we discussed offset by non-volume related revenue growth and maintain cost discipline in an inflationary environment. Indeed despite the pressures of inflation and despite the deployment of our strategic plan cost remain contained this quarter  as Stephane mentioned earlier  we beat our revised 2022 cost target of EUR612 million  initially set at the beginning of the year at EUR622 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased as a consequence by 3.5 points  compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 to 54.1%.Moving to slide 21 for the bridge on net income. Adjusted net income this quarter was down 18.2% to EUR118.2 million  resulting from lower EBITDA  partially offset by the following elements. First lower D&A as in the first quarter of 2021 we had some write-offs as the one of the brand name of VP Securities  with as well lower net financing expenses mainly linked to the positive impact of higher interest rates  there are many moving parts in this number  but in summary  the positive impact of the interest rate on our interest income reported in the fourth quarter of 2022 is higher than the benefit from the interest rate swap we had in the fourth quarter of 2021 and it was terminated in 2022.And then I would like to highlight as well higher results from equity investment  representing the contribution of LCH SA and the dividend received from Euroclear. As a reminder  in last year Euroclear paid its dividend in Q1 and Q3. I would like to highlight that the non-underlying cost in this bridge are mainly represented by D&A and more specifically related to the PPA amortization of our acquisition.Lastly  tax for the fourth quarter of 2022 was EUR38.5 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 27.3% for the quarter. Reported net income was EUR99.3 million  and adjusted EPS basic was down 18% this quarter  EUR1.11 per share  compared to an adjusted EPS basic as well of EUR1.35 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. This reflects higher number of outstanding share of the quarter compared to last year.Moving to slide 22 for the cash flow generation and leverage. The net operating cash flow post tax amounted for a negative EUR147.1 million  compared to a positive EUR145.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This negative flow was impacted by a change in working capital related to Nord Pool CCP activities for EUR276 million.As we will see in the next slide  the balancing item of this negative cash flow is a reduction of the cash in transit for EUR297 million. Excluding the impact of on working capital from Nord Pool and Euronext Clearing  CCP activities net operating cash flow post tax accounted for 55.3% of EBITDA.Our net debt to EBITDA as reminded by Stephane was at 2.6 times in the fourth quarter of 2022  compared to 4.3 times in the third quarter of 2022  that was positively impacted by higher cash in transit as we just discussed included in the cash and cash equivalents. Excluding the EUR49 million non-underlying one-off loss on NTI  the net debt to last 12 months reported EBITDA was at 2.4 times in the fourth quarter of 2022.Moving on to the slide 23 for the evolution of our liquidity position over the quarter. As described on previous slide  you can see the impact of the short movement in working capital related to Nord Pool CCP activities in the net operating cash flow. As an illustration  our liquidity position remains strong  above EUR1.5 billion  including the undrawn revolving credit facility for EUR600 million  and excluding the cash currently in transit.As Stephane highlighted  while the integration of Borsa Italiana is on track  we can look for external growth opportunities  thanks to this strong liquidity position and improvement in our rating profile.And this completes my presentation  and now I give the floor back to Stephane.Stephane BoujnahThank you  Giorgio. As you have seen 2022 was a real pivotal year  we took advantage of our diversified business model  our business model which is much more diversified than many people think. We strengthened our core business with continuous leadership not only on listing and on trading  but also a very strong development in other businesses. We maintained our trademark cost discipline in an inflationary environment  which has affected everyone.And we have put the key projects of the Borsa Italiana Group integration on a very good track  hence our commitments in terms of synergy delivery for the years to come. So 2023  ‚Äò22 has demonstrated that Euronext has the recipe for success  for cash flow generation even in tough environments. Also 2022 paved the way for future growth in Euronext now 2023 will be a real transformational year.First  our cash trading market share is expected to remain greater or equal to 63% and our revenue capture for the cash equity trading business to remain above what we call to 0.52 bps in 2023 after the Borsa Italiana markets migration to Optiq.Second our continued cost discipline and achieved synergies will enable us to offset inflation. The slight increase in cost only results from costs related to non-volume related revenue growth initiatives and savings and synergies entirely compensate inflation and business development cost. So the superior track record of Euronext in post-merger integration will translate -- will continue to translate in a strong cost discipline.Third  as a result  we have great  our 2024 run rate synergy target to reach almost twice the level of the first announced synergies back to the time of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition announcement to what will be EUR115 million of run rate synergies by the end of ‚Äò24. ‚Äò23 will be pivotal  as I said  with the delivery of the key strategic projects that have been highlighted by Giorgio and I early on. And the continued cost optimization that will lead to EUR70 million of cumulated run rate synergies at the end of '23.And fourth  combined with our fast deleveraging  since the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group and as demonstrated by the BBB plus upgrade by S&P announced yesterday evening  we are now in the right position to look for possible external growth in the respect obviously of our strong investment criteria of return on capital employed above WACC after three or five years -- three years to five years.So thanks for your attention. We are now ready to take your questions together with Giorgio Modica  Anthony Attia  the Global Head of Primary Markets and Post Trade  and Simon  Head of Cash and Derivatives trading.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question from line  Kyle Voigt from KBW. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Kyle VoigtHi  good morning. Maybe a couple of questions from me. First question is just on pricing  some of your peers globally have spoken about taking larger pricing adjustment in 2023 given the inflationary backdrop  and I believe you mentioned that in your prepared remarks that you also took some inflationary adjustments. Just wondering how you viewed pricing in 2023 versus prior years. And in which lines we should really expect the most material pricing adjustments to come through?And then also just a question on the synergy realization slide in the deck and the timeline there. Obviously  some of the key dates are for the fourth quarter of 2023  so quite late in the year. So when we think about your 2023 underlying cost guidance  I'm just trying to get a sense of what level of actual realized cost synergies are embedded within that as that may help us think about the expense trajectory into 2024. And given those timing of synergies  is it possible that underlying costs may actually be down in 2024 versus 2023? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahThank you. So  Giorgio will answer your two questions  the first on pricing and the second one on the phasing of synergy delivery.Giorgio ModicaSo thank you very much for your questions. So with respect to pricing  I guess that the best way to describe what we were going to do is that mostly price are going to be increased in the non-trading activities. And the increase that we will have are around  I would say  mid-single-digit than some slightly more  some slightly less. But this gives you a sense of how much our non-volume related business will grow in terms of pricing.And if you consider that 60% of our business is non-volume related  this gives you a bit of an idea of what would be the price increase impact on our top line next year  excluding any other variables. So it's around mid-single-digit time 60%. Then on the line  this price increase we laid  I mean  I believe I indirectly answered saying that it's not really going to be the trading lines  but the other line. So this is for the first question.When it comes to the synergies  the way I can answer your question is the following. Let's start from the synergies that we have delivered run rate this quarter. So at the end of December 2022  we have reached EUR34 million of run rate synergies. What this means is that part of the synergies will hit the P&L in 2023. And this is going as well to contribute to making sure as I described that the key cost of the organization will remain flat from a P&L perspective.Then coming to the delivery of synergies next year  a few elements  there is going to be an important moment with the migration of Optiq in the first quarter  and this will have -- impact our P&L right after the migration. But then  you are correct  there are other cost and savings that are going to be delivered in the fourth quarter this year with the impact on the P&L of next year.So then  my last comment is that  this year we will deliver a combination of revenues and cost synergies. And as far as the revenue synergies  again  I already mentioned the Optiq integration  but we will have as well the launch of our clearing activities on equities.Kyle VoigtThank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line  Mike Werner from UBS. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Mike WernerThank you very much for the presentation and the explanations  all very  very helpful. Two questions from me please. In terms of the market share in cash equity trading  and we know you've adjusted your pricing schedule  I think it was in November  we saw an uptick in market shares into the year end. The data that I collect  which certainly is not perfect implies that market shares have trended lower in January and ultimately in the first couple of days of February. So I was wondering if you can confirm if that's what you're seeing.And then B  just wondering  is this -- is that price adjustment in November  kind of  your final take  is this something where we could see further adjustments ultimately to protect the market share as we look at over the next couple of months?And then on the second question  just thinking about deleveraging  and I think the debt to EBITDA was 2.6 times at the end of this year  very similar level at the end of 2021. I know there was a bunch of restructuring costs throughout the year. But as we look out to 2023 kind of given your guidance on restructuring costs  how should we think about the pace of deleveraging throughout ‚Äò23  assuming no M&A or no other factors involved? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo  Simon Gallagher will answer your first question on market share and yield and prices. And Giorgio Modica will answer your question on deleveraging pace and phasing.Simon GallagherThank you  Stephane. So to answer the first question on market share  so you're right  we implemented a first batch of measures on pricing and liquidity programs in November last year  which was successful  which resulted in a three-point uplift in market share over the quarter. And certainly since the start of the year  what we're seeing is that volumes are soft  there is a lack of real economy liquidity in the market  which has had a slightly downward influence on market share because regulated markets tend to have a higher proportion of real economy flow than the alternative trading venues. And so  that's what we see as the primary explanation for the first quarter.To answer your second question  the answer is resolutely  no. This is obviously not the end of the pricing measures we are taking  and the changes in liquidity we are making. There will be further adjustments to the flagship liquidity schemes in March  alongside as Stephane and Giorgio mentioned the pricing adjustments to the Italian market post migrations. These price changes and liquidity schemes will not be yield dilutive. They will be pushing our liquidity providers a bit more and adjusting the intricacies of the LP schemes. So this is not the end of the story. Obviously  this is a very dynamic and ongoing process.Mike WernerThank you very much.Giorgio ModicaYes  when it comes to the deleveraging profile  I can confirm a few elements. Now  I believe you are the target for dividends  so it's EUR236 million. And then the other element is that we confirm two-thirds cash flow conversion post tax from EBITDA. So with these two elements  I believe that now we have  I mean  we have guided with respect to the non-underlying costs are related to the termination of the agreement. Those are the key elements of the equation. So again to summarize  around 66% cash flow conversion post tax  and EUR236 million of dividends to be expected in 2023.Mike WernerThank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line  Haley Tam from Credit Suisse. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Haley TamGood morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Could I ask a couple about the revenue capture please in the equity market. So first of all  the Q4 revenue yield of 0.5 basis points was a step down from 0.53 in Q3? And if I've heard you correctly  you're saying that the supplemental liquidity provider scheme adjustments you've made are not yield dilutive. So I wonder if you could help us walk through that step down from 0.53 to 0.5  please just to understand the dynamics there?And then the second question  just to understand your assumptions for 2023  market share more than 63% to revenue capture 0.52 basis points. Are both of those numbers for after the Borsa Italiana migration or are they numbers that I should assume for the average through the year? And I do know that 63% is less than the 65% market share you had in Q4. So I just wondered if you could comment on that? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahOkay  so Simon Gallagher will answer your two questions on the revenue capture and on the phasing of the market share evolutions.Simon GallagherThank you  Stephane. So I'll break down very precisely the variance in yield from 0.53 to 0.5. In the numbers are included a small number of non-equity items  so it's the Warrants and Certificates and ETFs notably. So if we break down the 0.03  0.01 of that was due to non-equity items this variance in volumes in non-equity businesses  which are ETFs and the Warrants and Certificates. So that leaves 0.02 basis points imputable to cash equity yield. Two-thirds of this 0.02 was due to changes in the order sizes.And so  how does this impact the 0.02? When markets tend to be a bit less  there's less volatility in the markets  order sizes as we've seen recently  order sizes tend to go up a little bit  which means there is less arbitrage opportunities from the electronic liquidity providers  which means order sizes go up in the market. And this interacts with certain features of our fee grid where we have fixed euro fees per executed order.And so this is two-thirds of that 0.02 is imputable to order sizes. One-third of the 0.02 can be imputable to other features of the fee grid  including partially to the SLP changes we made in the supplemental liquidity scheme. So if you break down -- if you break it down that way  the changes we make to the SLP scheme are largely immaterial in terms of impacts on yield. And there will be further yield accretive changes to the SLP scheme from the second quarter onwards.With respect to the second question  the market share number  I think can be seen as an average over the year as a base. And the yield  the revenue traction number is a -- and the market share is obviously a floor we see and is the minimum we are targeting. And the yield extraction number is post -- is the run rate post the Italy migration.Haley TamThank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Bruce HamiltonHi  good morning  and thanks very much for the presentation and Q&A. I guess firstly just going back to the synergies  obviously encouraging that you've increased those. But could you break out the EUR115 million between revenues and costs? And just going back to the earlier question  given the consensus assumes  I think a reduction in absolute costs in 2024  is that kind of consistent with the way you're thinking about the cost synergies?And then secondly on M&A and balance sheet flexibility. In terms of your sort of EUR1.5 billion of capacity  I can see on slide 23 you've laid out  how you get there. But what's the sort of net debt EBITDA that you would be comfortable going up to temporarily to do a deal? And then just an update on what the -- what you'd view your current WACC as  as well would be helpful. Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo Giorgio will answer your question on the synergies delivery on cost and on the balance sheet and debt capabilities.Giorgio ModicaSo let's start with the first one. I would like to highlight that the increase from EUR100 million to EUR115 million is mainly related to a better visibility on the opportunities on clearing. So this is the first element  then when it comes to the breakdown between cost and revenue  I will try to do my best  but there is a complexity is that  as we said from the beginning  the EUR115 million is an improvement of EBITDA  that includes sometimes project involving more revenue and more cost. So the best breakdown I can provide you with is the following.Let's start from the original target  the EUR60 million. The EUR60 million were broken down as follows  EUR45 million of cost savings and EUR15 million of revenue uplift. Now this EUR15 million revenue uplift  the significant portion of the EUR15 million is linked to the migration of Optiq. Part of which were going and the most relevant part were going to execute in 45 days. And this is clearly pure revenue synergies. Then the other buckets are around EUR10 million EBITDA coming from the migration to the center. And this is already embedded in our number  but involves more revenues  but as well more cost.And then the remainder that was originally accessed to be EUR30 million and now it's increased to EUR45 million is the clearing opportunity. And you will -- and then there are many moving parts because we'll clearly have more revenues  but as well we will need to upgrade and as we are doing the platform of Euronext Clearing. But on the other side  we will not have any more the costs that today we are paying to LCH SA  which are currently captured in our P&L. So this is the breakdown. Unfortunately  I cannot further break down the different project in between cost and revenues. So this is -- this I believe covers your first question.When it comes to the underlying cost of capital  I believe that Euronext is in line what we see as an average of analyst  and again  as I always stress  those are a point in time  so what I can say is that  I don't see a major deviation from what you analysts are taking as an average as our own cost of capital. And when it comes to the max leverage  what I would say is the following. And again  this is very tricky question  because it depends very much on the target you acquire that give -- would give us additional leverage.But as we commented in the past  we believe that in terms of pure debt capacity  we would have a capacity in the range between EUR1.5 billion and EUR2 billion. This is roughly speaking the standalone capabilities we would have to finance and impute that acquisition. And again  I would like to highlight that as you very well know rating and leverage consideration are very much target specific.Bruce HamiltonGreat  very helpful. Thank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line Enrico Bolzoni from JP Morgan. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Enrico BolzoniHi  thank you. Good morning. Sorry to go back once again to market share  just a clarification. I would like to understand the market share you are guiding is something that in case you should not be on track to achieve; you would implement some changes in pricing or something else to make sure that you hit it or it's rather you simply saying that in light of your proposition your pricing in your relationship with customer you will naturally achieve? So this is my first question.And then a more general one  possibly related to that. Can you just give any comment in terms of what you're seeing in terms of volume migrating to dark pools  because it seems like these are increasing. And also interestingly the average order size are going down  while historically they have been higher in dark pools. So I was just curious to hear from you on this subject.And then finally  I mean  a number of your peers in Europe and also outside of Europe are increasingly doing partnership with technology providers. So I was just curious to hear your thoughts here. Is this something that you consider as well or you have more -- you think you have internal capabilities to develop all the technology infrastructure that you need to support your growth? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo I will answer your third question on the relationship with the providers of data services and data storage. And Simon Gallagher will answer your question about the market share dynamics and the dark pool development. We have made the deliberate decision to internalize within Euronext and to locate within Europe the businesses that are the most critical ones to our strategy and the operations that are the most sensitive ones to our operational leverage and operational performance. That has led to migrate our Core Data Centre that used to be in Basildon to new -- brand new data center  100% powered by green energy in Bergamo near Milan.We do believe that core data processing  core software  core systems  core data storage  core applications must be located within the European Union and must be managed by Europeans. We do use for historical data storage one of those technology provider that has facilities located in the Republic of Ireland. We do not intend to have critical applications  critical software  critical matching engine related platforms located outside the European Union  nor being managed outside the Group. So this is a deliberate choice we have done  which is consistent with our strategy.Others have done different choices in a different environment with different sharing of value with partners  with different profile of future dependency on third party providers. We have not taken the choice  we have taken the choice to internalize that and that was not done at the compromise of anything in terms of financial performance as you have seen it over the past few years.Over to you  Simon  on the market share and volumes.Simon GallagherThank you  Stephane. So to answer the first question on the two numbers of 63% and 0.52. So this is obviously an equilibrium between these two numbers. And the aim of this equilibrium is to maximize euro revenue extraction from the franchise. We believe that these two numbers represent the optimal trade-off for this year  obviously there is some room  wiggle room around these numbers. But the primary aim here is to maintain our role and our ability to price full value within the franchise across the various pricing segments.I just want to make one point. So beyond the explicit fees of 0.52  what is behind a lot of this is the management of implicit costs for investors  which is the quality of execution on our market. And this has to do with the mark out  the liquidity of our markets  which is by all published papers vastly superior to the alternative market. So this explicit yield number is only a part of the story. And I'd even say sort of a minority part of the story. The bigger picture behind here is the design of our liquidity schemes and the partnerships we form with our partners in the electronic trading community.The second point about dark pools  there's been some small increase in these pools. I'd say two things  dark pools  if you look at the numbers remained very small features still of the European execution landscape. These are low-single-digit -- sorry  below 10% in terms of volumes and is constrained by regulation  right. So we have the 8% cap and the 4% cap on reference price trading venues.And the second thing  if you look at the revenue models of these pools  they actually charge less than that we do in the lead markets. Third point with respect to dark pools we are observing with great interest the movements in the regulatory landscape  and we will be very active in this space. And depending what's happened -- what happens there  there will be potential business opportunities for Euronext as well in the stock trading space. So I think that's what we can say there.Enrico BolzoniThank you very much.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line Ian White from Autonomous Research. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Ian WhiteHi  thanks for taking my questions. Just a few follow-ups from my side please. Can you just clarify a little bit  your appetite for M&A at this stage  from the discussion so far  I'm sort of taking away that you'd be happy to consider a transformational deal at this stage  even while the Borsa Italiana integration is still ongoing. Is that a fair reflection of your appetite for M&A please?Second question  just any revised thoughts at all around the medium-term financial guidance that you've given for out to FY ‚Äò24. And finally  just maybe a clarification please on the outlook for NII. I think you talked about getting to cruising speed 20 bps yield  but how have collateral balances trended there over the last sort of few months and what's the outlook there please? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo I will answer your first question on the M&A framework and Giorgio will answer the two other questions on financial guidance. The M&A objectives or the M&A framework remains the same. We want to continue the growth of the Euronext project in two directions. The first one is to remain open to single country or several country exchanges in Europe  who consider being part of a scalable project and who might be interested in joining the largest single liquidity pool in Europe and the largest single order book and the most powerful technology platform. So anything that would make Euronext more relevant for some European market infrastructure is clearly something that we will consider.The other avenue is always to pursue the diversification of our of our top line. The diversification of our revenue mix  because this call is very interesting. There are many questions on market share and yield of the business that represents 20% of our top line today. It's important  I appreciate that. But you may have noticed that over the past few years  we have done a significant effort to diversify in Post Trade  to diversify in other asset classes like energy  like ForEx  like in other services like corporate services in technology et cetera.So we -- the objective Post Trade by any M&A move will be diversification of our top line. And the other objective would be to accelerate growth to capture businesses that have a growth profile that can accelerate the growth profile of the combined entity. So we explore and we analyze all sort of situations. And clearly the fact that our deleveraging has increased  and that the rating has been improved yesterday evening to BBB plus.The fact that the synergies in Italy are in the very good track  hence the upgrade targeted -- that really target that we have shared with you  it gives us more confidence that we need to explore these opportunities again. But nothing very new or fundamental  just an improvement of the surrounding consensus around the same strategy. We'd always  always the same very rigorous framework that we want to deploy the capital of our shareholders in acquisitions that generate a return on capital employed above the WACC of the company between year three and five after synergies. So that's the M&A framework.Over to you  Giorgio on the mid-term financial profile and end of ‚Äò24 guidance.Giorgio ModicaAbsolutely. Let me start with the net treasury income. I will give you a few more details so that you can have a better view. So the first element  I wanted to highlight is that  with respect to when we discussed the last time around the average collateral has actually increased  what we have seen are level at around the EUR22 billion.And in the fourth quarter of last year  these EUR4.3 million that we have posted as NTI represent around zero point -- around 7 basis points. So slightly below the 10 we guided. And this is the result of the fact that interest rates increase more than anticipated. And as you know  during the fourth quarter we still had an important point of fixed income portfolio in run off  but then in terms of euro million this is very  very marginal.If we now move to the first quarter this year  what we will have in terms of P&L is going to be a revenue capture  which is going to be closer to the 10 bps I guided. And we might have in euro million a result  which is in between EUR5 million and EUR6 million. Then after that we will see  collateral should remain in the EUR20 billion type of a range  slightly more  slightly less. And the cruising speed in terms of NTI should be 20 basis points. Then this is as granular as I can be  if you have follow up question  happy to take them.When it comes to the target of 2024  the only one I can put  we will not change the target is that within our current target of EBITDA growth  given the environment we see room for having slightly more revenues for an environment where we will have slightly more cost. So this is more or less the trend  so 5% to 6% EBITDA CAGR remains unchanged  maybe depending on how the next two years will evolve  we might be in a situation where revenue growth is going to be higher and cost marginally higher.Ian WhiteGot it. That's helpful. Thank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line Johannes Thormann from HSBC. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Johannes ThormannGood morning  everybody. And some follow-up questions please. First of all on the clearing business again. First of all  why have you delay in the margin improvement from 10 bps to 20 bps? I'm still lacking to understand  and will it be really fixed end of this quarter  or will we probably get next call the message again  we have another quarter running in 10 bps. What is driving this because investors here this is probably  anyway so it's just the worst time of the market?And secondly  on your clearing initiative in general  especially for the cash clearing  what incentives are you giving to the customers to move your business to Euronext Clearing away from LCH  because as I understand in cash clearing the customer has major part of the choice?And last but not least on the cash trading market share  historically you were about 70%  now you seem to be satisfied with 63%  which is also the revenue opportunity for the clearing business. So you're reducing your own revenue opportunity. What is driving your assumption to be satisfied with 63%? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahOkay. So Giorgio will answer your -- the first part of your questions. And Anthony Attia  who is the Head of Post Trade operations will answer your questions on the incentives  the pricing of our operation -- clearing operations and our market share in equity  cash equity clearing.Giorgio ModicaSo  I would like to clarify one element  you seem to highlight the level of surprise  but in July 2022  we expressed a very clear guideline saying that  we would have had 20 basis point in the third quarter  then 10 basis point in the fourth and in the first quarter and then back again 20 basis point. And the result  so -- and we guided for around EUR20 billion level of collateral  which means implicitly that we guided for EUR10 million in the third quarter and EUR5 million in the fourth quarter. The actual result were EUR11 million in the third quarter and EUR4 million in the fourth quarter  which is  I would say  exactly identical to what we have guided in July 2022.So what is happening? And why did we get zero point -- sorry 7 basis point and not 10 basis point  simply that  when you have a small portion of your portfolio  which is fixed income  it means that the rate on the asset side will not change  whereas on the liability side where 100% of our ability are benchmarked to ECB rates  then you pay more. And this has a slightly dilutive impact on the level of NTI.Finally  on your question  is really true that we are going to have 20 basis point in the second quarter? And then  my answer is  yes. As a simple fact that in -- as I said  from the 1st of May 2023  we'll no longer hold any fixed income portfolio and for all of our assets and all our liabilities are going to be at variable rate. And therefore  we will make the spread between the interest we collect and interest we give back to clients. I hope this clarifies.Anthony AttiaGood morning. This is Anthony Attia. Thank you for your question. Let me detail for you the value proposition of our clearing internalization initiatives. They are five main points that I want to share with you. So first of all  we will offer the clearing services for cash equity for all our Euronext market excluding Oslo  but including Italy. So in the same default fund  on the same risk framework and the value-add risk model  we will be able to clear all our cash equity trade. This generate efficiencies on margin and default contribution to the client compared to the current fragmented situation.Second  we will be operating from a state-of-the-art clearing platform that we are currently developing with one connection for all the market. And the use of the extremely efficient set of technologies.Third part  we are working on offering competing clearing fees. There‚Äôs no need to get into the rest of the [Technical Difficulty] on from a clearing fee point of view. But it's the combination of these different factors that create this attractive value proposition.And last  thanks to our Post Trade investment on Euronext Securities  our CSDs  in particular in Milan  we will be able to offer extremely competitive settlement fees. And so the engagement we have with the clearing members presently show that we are in a very  very good position to succeed in the migration at the end of 2023. Thank you.Johannes ThormannThank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the last question from line Greg Simpson from BNP Paribas. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Greg SimpsonHi  good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in at the end. Maybe a follow-up on clearing  can you just talk about what the current market share of that LCH SA has in your cash markets? What are your expectations for when your next clearing goes live in Q4. And then you have fewer CCP in the background. So just interested in any thoughts on competition?And then a second question would be on  on the mid-single-digit price increases in the non-volume areas  can you share if there's any user feedback on this? Do customers generally just accept the price increases as they're essential or is there any signs that you just might try to say optimize the subscriptions  our market data for example. Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo  Giorgio on pricing  and Anthony on the competition on clearing.Anthony AttiaSo on clearing  so we do not comment market share element of LCH SA or the Euroclear Europe  you can direct your questions to them. Nevertheless the setup that will be out at the end of the year is complete for CCP setup  which means that by default the trade done on Euronext Optiq platform will be routed towards Euronext Clearing and if the buyer and the seller select another CCP then the trade will be relative to these other CCP. So far this preferred CCP model creates an incentive for the year  for the CCP of choice to clear the bulk of the trade  because it provide efficiencies the way I commented before.Giorgio ModicaThen when it comes to your question with respect to price increase  it's actually a complicated question  but let me try to answer. So in general terms  clients are not necessarily happy of price increases. However  it is important to highlight that the general environment is -- in this general environment price increase are very common  everyone is increasing prices and therefore as well clients are accustomed to increase their own prices to their clients and receive a request for price increasing inflationary environment. So this is the first element.And we have not received any sign where our price increase were considered to be excessive. And clearly  we have deeply assessed that  making sure that price increase were commensurate to the quality of the service we provide. So this is the first element. Then you seem to refer more specifically to market data. And on that specific angle  what I can tell you is that  if you look  for example  at our -- if you look for example at our results in the fourth quarter  you see that the 7%  a part of that 7% is related to an increase of users.It's related to an increase of streams  which is quite surprisingly in an industry where usually there is attrition in terms of clients and number of terminals. And this reflect the new way of a mix way of working  flat -- part from home and part in the office where sharing screen and terminal becomes more complicated. So to make a long story short  we did pass the price increase that was generally well accepted by clients.Stephane BoujnahSo thank you everyone. As two words of conclusion now  I want to highlight really in my -- what is my view is that -- are the key takeaways of where we are today. We deliver diversification  our revenues are more diversified than they have ever been  and we will continue to deliver diversification. We deliver cost discipline in environment  which is quite complicated with inflationary pressure and we will continue to deliver cost discipline. We deliver post-merger integration for real with major projects already delivered in relation to the acquisition of Borsa Italiana  and new ones will be delivered including within a few weeks‚Äô time with the Optiq migration in Italy.And we will therefore there continue to deliver revenue synergies and other post-merger integration projects. We have delivered deleveraging and we will continue to deliver deleveraging as demonstrated by the BBB plus upgrade announced yesterday by S&P. So we are extremely confident that this strong diversified cost discipline operating leverage focused company with great assets to expand the top line through the extraction of revenue synergies will continue to be extremely positioned to capture opportunities in ‚Äò23.Thank you very much.

However  each of the Alternative Consideration Instruments or Deferred Payment Rights are not subject to any adjustments after such an Alternative Consideration Instrument has been delivered or a Deferred Payment Right has been recorded to the shareholder but  instead  the adjustments will occur only if the distribution of funds or other corporate event entitling to the adjustment or if a record date with respect to any of the foregoing occurs prior to the settlement of relevant completion trades of the Tender Offer.Bain Capital Europe Fund VI  Security Trading  Fennogens and Corbis have given equity commitments to the Offeror to fund the Offeror for the purposes of the Tender Offer and the designated purpose of such equity commitments is to enable payment of the aggregate Cash Offer Price and redemption of the Alternative Consideration Instruments and payment of the Deferred Payment to holders of equity savings accounts by the Offeror.RECOMMENDATION BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CAVERIONThe Board of Directors of Caverion  represented by a quorum comprising the non-conflicted members of the Board of Directors  has unanimously decided to recommend in its statement issued on February 9  2023 pursuant to the Finnish Securities Markets Act (746/2012  as amended) and the Helsinki Takeover Code issued by the Finnish Securities Market Association (the ""Helsinki Takeover Code"") that the shareholders of Caverion accept the Tender Offer. The Board of Directors of Caverion has received an updated opinion  dated January 24  2023  of Caverion's exclusive financial adviser  Bank of America Europe DAC  Stockholm branch (""BofA Securities"")  to the effect that  as of the date of such opinion  the increased Offer Price to be paid to holders of Shares (other than Security Trading  Fennogens and Corbis and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the Improved Tender Offer  was fair from a financial point of view  to such holders  which opinion was based upon and subject to the assumptions made  procedures followed  matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken as more fully described in such opinion. The opinion of BofA Securities was provided for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors of Caverion and does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holders of Shares should act in connection with the Tender Offer or any related matter.THE ACCEPTANCE PROCEDURE OF THE TENDER OFFERAcceptance of the Tender Offer with Alternative Consideration may only be submitted on the business day following the publication of the Supplement Document  i.e. from February 13  2023.Before February 13  2023  acceptance of the Tender Offer can only be made with the Cash Offer Price. Each shareholder of Caverion whose acceptance of the Tender Offer has been submitted before February 13  2023  shall be deemed to have accepted the Tender Offer with the Cash Offer Price.If a shareholder of Caverion has submitted the acceptance of the Tender Offer before February 13  2023 in respect of the Shares held by him/her and wishes to elect the Alternative Consideration instead of the Cash Offer Price  such shareholder must submit a valid withdrawal of his/her earlier acceptance of the Tender Offer in accordance with instructions from the account operator and submit a duly executed acceptance form for the Alternative Consideration. Neither the Offeror nor Nordea (in its capacity as arranger and an account operator) will charge the shareholders for withdrawing their acceptance of the Tender Offer in order to accept the Alternative Consideration in such a situation.A shareholder may only choose to receive either the Alternative Consideration or the Cash Offer Price for all Shares held on the same book-entry account  and  consequently  shareholders may only tender for mixed consideration if the relevant Shares are held on separate book-entry accounts.The shareholders holding Shares on equity savings accounts who have selected the Alternative Consideration will receive  instead of the Alternative Consideration Instruments  non-transferable rights to payment from the Offeror  and to demonstrate these  the book-entries named as other rights will be recorded to a shareholder's equity savings account.Most Finnish account operators will send a new notice regarding the Tender Offer and related instructions to those who are registered as shareholders in the shareholders' register of Caverion maintained by Euroclear Finland. Shareholders of Caverion who do not receive such instructions from their account operator or asset manager should first contact their account operator or asset manager and can subsequently contact Nordea Bank Abp (""Nordea"") by sending an email to [email protected]  where such shareholders of Caverion can receive information on submitting their acceptance of the Tender Offer. Please note  however  that Nordea will not be engaging in communications relating to the Tender Offer with shareholders located within the United States. Shareholders who are located within the United States may contact their brokers for necessary information.Those shareholders of Caverion whose Shares are nominee-registered  and who wish to accept the Tender Offer  must effect such acceptance in accordance with the instructions given by the custodian of the nominee-registered shareholders. The Offeror will not send an acceptance form or any other documents related to the Tender Offer to these shareholders of Caverion.For more information on the acceptance procedure of the Tender Offer  see section ""Terms and Conditions of the Tender Offer - Acceptance Procedure of the Tender offer"" in the Supplement Document.

In particular  the financial information included in this stock exchange release has been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in Finland  which may not be comparable to the financial statements or financial information of U.S. companies. The Tender Offer is made to Caverion's shareholders resident in the United States on the same terms and conditions as those made to all other shareholders of Caverion to whom an offer is made. Any informational documents  including this stock exchange release  are being disseminated to U.S. shareholders on a basis comparable to the method that such documents are provided to Caverion's other shareholders.As permitted under the Tier I Exemption  the settlement of the Tender Offer is based on the applicable Finnish law provisions  which differ from the settlement procedures customary in the United States  particularly as regards to the time when payment of the consideration is rendered. The Tender Offer  which is subject to Finnish law  is being made to the U.S. shareholders in accordance with the applicable U.S. securities laws  and applicable exemptions thereunder  in particular the Tier I Exemption and the 802 Exemption. To the extent the Tender Offer is subject to U.S. securities laws  those laws only apply to U.S. shareholders and will not give rise to claims on the part of any other person. U.S. shareholders should consider that (whether paid initially in cash or upon redemption of any Alternative Consideration Instruments) the offer price for the Tender Offer is being paid in EUR and that no adjustment will be made based on any changes in the exchange rate.To the extent permissible under applicable law or regulations  the Offeror and its affiliates or its brokers and its brokers' affiliates (acting as agents for the Offeror or its affiliates  as applicable) may from time to time after the date of this stock exchange release and during the pendency of the Tender Offer  and other than pursuant to the Tender Offer  directly or indirectly purchase or arrange to purchase Shares or any securities that are convertible into  exchangeable for or exercisable for Shares. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. To the extent information about such purchases or arrangements to purchase is made public in Finland  such information will be disclosed by means of a press release or other means reasonably calculated to inform U.S. shareholders of Caverion of such information. In addition  the financial advisers to the Offeror may also engage in ordinary course trading activities in securities of Caverion  which may include purchases or arrangements to purchase such securities. To the extent required in Finland  any information about such purchases will be made public in Finland in the manner required by Finnish law.Neither the SEC nor any U.S. state securities commission has approved or disapproved the Tender Offer (including the offer of the Alternative Consideration Instruments)  passed upon the merits or fairness of the Tender Offer (including the offer of the Alternative Consideration Instruments)  or passed any comment upon the adequacy  accuracy or completeness of the disclosure in relation to the Tender Offer (including in relation to the Alternative Consideration Instruments).

The stock exchange's chairman Stephane Boujnah told Reuters:‚ÄúOne of the reasons why we are cautious about the use of datacenters of Microsoft  Google and Amazon for critical parts of what we do is because our core supervisors and regulators are themselves very cautious.‚ÄùHe added: ‚ÄúWhen it comes to strategic applications such as real-time data and operations of the market  we do not want them to be stored and operated by the datacenters of companies which have decision-making centers outside the EU  and physical infrastructure outside the EU.‚ÄùThe European Banking Authority filed recommendations on outsourcing to cloud service providers in late 2017. These address data security  location of data and data processing; access and audit rights; chain outsourcing; and exit strategies. They were designed to let financial institutions use the cloud while managing perceived risk.Lawyers at Pinsent Mason said in September that termination and exit of a contract  subcontracting  and audit rights remain potential pitfalls.International exchange Deutsche B√∂rse AG says that as well as running the Digital Asset Business Platform on Google‚Äôs servers  its contract is intended to help it speed up development of the D7 digital securities platform  and the duo plan to jointly build a data mesh for data distribution.Theodor Weimer  CEO at the exchange  said in an earnings call this week: ‚ÄúTokenization and digitization are very important trends for us  and we started to lay the foundation to expand into new asset classes and service offerings with a number of different initiatives. This will be accelerated by the strategic partnership with Google Cloud.‚ÄùWeimer added: ‚ÄúWe are targeting a public cloud exposure of around 70 percent  seven-zero percent  over time. In addition  we will be launching joint projects to accelerate the development of new and innovative platforms.‚ÄùWeimar said certain aspects of its business would remain based on its own servers. ‚ÄúLow latency trading and learning systems will remain on-premises.‚ÄùThe subject of data sovereignty is a sticky one for local cloud providers in Europe  but US rivals certainly appear to be winning the race for custom: US cloud titans account for almost three-quarters of cloud spending in the region.Not everyone is happy with the way that business is being won  certainly in the case of Microsoft  as several complaints about anti-competitive behavior against Redmond are now in the hands of EU regulators. ¬Æ,neutral,0.0,0.86,0.14,negative,0.0,0.14,0.86,True,English,"['US cloud providers services', 'Euronext', 'rivals', 'Deutsche B√∂rse AG', 'D7 digital securities platform', 'The European Banking Authority', 'Digital Asset Business Platform', 'largest financial derivatives exchange', 'US public cloud megacorps', 'The stock exchange', 'public cloud exposure', 'Low latency trading', 'Pan-European stock exchange', 'London Stock Exchange', 'new asset classes', 'local cloud providers', 'US cloud titans', 'cloud service providers', 'financial institutions', 'International exchange', 'preferred‚Äù cloud', 'cloud biz', 'service offerings', 'US rivals', 'cloud spending', 'financial regulators', 'decade-long agreement', 'next decade', 'previous deal', 'CME Group', 'Stephane Boujnah', 'critical parts', 'core supervisors', 'strategic applications', 'decision-making centers', 'physical infrastructure', 'audit rights', 'Pinsent Mason', 'potential pitfalls', 'earnings call', 'important trends', 'different initiatives', 'strategic partnership', 'joint projects', 'innovative platforms', 'learning systems', 'sticky one', 'several complaints', 'anti-competitive behavior', 'data sovereignty', 'historical data', 'real-time data', 'data security', 'data processing', 'data mesh', 'data distribution', 'Google Cloud', 'chain outsourcing', 'exit strategies', 'Theodor Weimer', 'seven-zero percent', 'EU regulators', '70 percent', 'Euronext', 'worries', 'compliance', 'contracts', 'echoes', 'world', 'Nasdaq', 'AWS', 'Microsoft', 'chairman', 'Reuters', 'reasons', 'use', 'datacenters', 'Amazon', 'operations', 'market', 'companies', 'recommendations', 'location', 'access', 'risk', 'Lawyers', 'September', 'termination', 'subcontracting', 'servers', 'development', 'duo', 'CEO', 'Tokenization', 'digitization', 'foundation', 'number', 'addition', 'Weimar', 'aspects', 'premises', 'subject', 'race', 'custom', 'three-quarters', 'region', 'everyone', 'way', 'case', 'Redmond', 'hands']",2023-02-10,2023-02-11,theregister.com

My name is Caroline  and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. [Operator Instructions] However  you will have the opportunity to ask questions at the end of the call. [Operator Instructions]I will now hand over to your host  Stephane Boujnah  Euronext's CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board joined by Giorgio Modica  Euronext's CFO to begin today's conference. Thank you.Giorgio ModicaGood morning  everybody and thank you for joining us this morning for the Euronext fourth quarter and full-year 2022 results conference call and webcast. I am Stephane Boujnah  CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext. And I will start with the highlights of the full year and the fourth quarter. Giorgio Modica  the Euronext CFO will then further develop the main business and the financial highlights of the fourth quarter.As an introduction  I would like to highlight three points. First  Euronext is stronger than ever. Euronext is now present in the full value chain and Euronext confirmed its leadership position in listing and in trading in Europe. In addition our revenue demonstrated strong resilience  thanks to our diversified business model.Second  we beat our 2022 cost guidance  thanks to cost discipline in an inflationary environment. Third  we are well-advanced in the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group and by the end of 2023  we will reach EUR70 million of cumulative run rate synergies. We are now in a position to upgrade our 2024 synergy target by EUR15 million to EUR115 million of annual run rate synergies.Let me give you some more detail on each of those points. First  as I said Euronext is today the leading listing venue in Europe for equity  and for that globally. And we are also the largest venue for equity trading in Europe representing 2 times the volume traded on the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Borse. We are now a top-ranking Post Trade infrastructure operator through Euronext Clearing and Euronext Securities. This is all the result of our diversification strategy. And this major transformation is reflected in our 2022 performance where 58% of our underlying revenue is now non-volume related.2022 was also a strong year in terms of financial performance. In 2022 Euronext reached record underlying revenues  an income above EUR1.4 billion. This is up plus 13%  compared to 2021. We generated plus EUR120.2 million additional revenue in 2022  compared to ‚Äò21  which was a very strong reference shows as you may remember. This strong 2022 performance was driven by the strong performance of non-volume related businesses and enhanced revenue capture.And in trading  we recorded a very strong year for power and for ForEx trading. The softer volume environment for cash equity trading in the second half of 2022 was clearly offset by significant and efficient management of yield and a real uptick in market share from October 2022. Our Post Trade franchise significantly benefited from the consolidation of Euronext Clearing and Euronext Securities Milan  which were acquired as part of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition in April ‚Äò21. The diversified business of the Euronext Securities allowed us to capture value as settlement activity stabilized in H2 2022.I would -- like especially to highlight the performance of our listing business  which grew by plus 15.1% and reported solid listing activities with 83 new listings in 2022. In particular  we welcomed 20 international companies  which in my view is the recognition that Euronext  Euronext market in Europe are now the venue of choice for listing in Europe. Furthermore our Advanced Data Services business increased by plus 15.5%  reflecting growth across the real-time and non-real-time data business  as well as index growth.Lastly  following the successful migration of our Core Data Centre to Bergamo in June 2022  we significantly scaled up our Technology Solutions business reaching over EUR100 million in revenue now. That's why  as mentioned earlier  the share of non-volume related revenue represented 58% of our top line in 2022 and accounted for 141% of operating costs excluding D&A.And that brings me to our ongoing focus on cost discipline on slide five with a bigger picture on financials. Thanks to strong cost discipline and several positive one-off impacts of the year  we overachieved or revised cost guidance of EUR612 million  down from an initial cost guidance  as you may remember it  up EUR622 million  because we reported EUR606.1 million of underlying expenses excluding D&A. And this was achieved despite inflationary pressures  despite pressure on supply chains that everyone experiences.Consequently  our 2022 adjusted EBITDA grew double-digit to EUR861.6 million. This translated into an adjusted EBITDA margin at 58.7%. Overall  this performance resulted in a plus 5.7% increase of adjusted net income to EUR555.3 million. Adjusted EPS was down minus 4.8% to EUR5.21 per share. And this reflects the higher number of outstanding shares of our 2022  compared to 2021.On a reported basis  net income is up plus 6% to EUR437.8 million. Consequently a dividend of EUR2.22 per share will be proposed at our upcoming Annual General Meeting in May. These dividend represent a payout ratio of 50% of reported net income adjusted for the EUR49 million pretax or EUR35 million post tax one-off loss related to the partial disposal of the Euronext Clearing portfolio announced in Q2 2022. And this dividend is EUR0.29 more than the ‚Äò21 dividend per share. It is an increase of plus 13%.Moving now to the Q4 performance on slide six. Euronext reported a solid fourth quarter for 2022. The quarter was marked by strong performance of Advanced Data Services  strong performance of listing activities offset by lower revenues from business correlated with cash equity volumes. Underlying revenues were down minus 6.2%  compared to Q4 2021 at EUR347 million  reflecting the resilience of our diversified revenue streams in a low volatility environment.Despite softer cash equity derivatives and MTS cash trading activity  the strength of our non-volume related businesses enabled us to report only a slight decline in total revenue. First non-volume-related revenue posted a strong performance overall. Notably  as I said earlier in listing and advanced data services in technology. Second  our trading businesses that are not related to equity markets strongly performed. We notably recorded strong growth year-on-year in power trading and a solid quarter in ForEx trading.Last  we efficiently manage our revenue capture and regained market share from October 2022 in cash trading operations. This translated into non-volume related revenue accounting for 60% of the total Q4 revenue  and covering 130% of underlying operating expenses excluding D&A.So Q4 2022 underlying operational expenses excluding D&A increased slightly to EUR159.2 million up plus 1.6%  compared to Q4 2021. And this reflect for cost disciplined approach to cost control and higher capitalized project costs offsetting inflationary pressures. Overall we reported an EBITDA  an adjusted EBITDA of EUR187.9 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.1%. This led to an adjusted EPS at EUR1.11 per share and an adjusted net income of EUR118.2 million. On a reported basis the EPS for this fourth quarter reached EUR0.93.Clearly ‚Äò22 was a year of transformation for Euronext and we made good progress in our integration process and synergy delivery. The migration of our Core Data Centre from Basildon in the U.K. to Bergamo in Italy was the first key milestone of our growth or Impact strategic plan. This migration combined with continued cost discipline enabled us to deliver EUR34.1 million cumulated run rate annual synergies at the end of 2022 in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.Looking forward  we expect to achieve around EUR70 million of our targeted synergies by the end of ‚Äò23 alone with the delivery of several key projects. First  next month we will significantly change the dimension of our unique European liquidity pool  because the migration of Italian cash market to Euronext state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq will benefit local and global trading members and will allow an alignment of fees.Second  the other Italian markets will migrate to the Optiq European liquidity pool starting in Q4 2023. And looking further cost synergies with the termination of the Millennium LSEG technology contract. Third  Euronext Clearing would become the CCP of choice for equity clearing by the end of this year  generating revenue synergies. And the following year by Q3 2024 Euronext Clearing will also clear Euronext listed derivatives.Those good progress on integration mean that we are able to upgrade our synergy target. We expect total run rate synergies in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group to reach EUR115 million by the end of ‚Äô24. This is EUR15 million more than the amount targeted until now. And this is almost 2 times the initial amount announced at the moment of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition.You may remember that in April ‚Äò21 we committed to deliver EUR60 million of synergies in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. Today we are confident that we will deliver almost a double EUR115 million of synergies in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. So that demonstrates once again the strong track record of the Euronext teams in delivering operating performance and operating leverage.On the next slide  I'd like to take a moment to tell you in more detail about one of our key strategic objectives related to clearing. It's a key strategic project. Last month we confirmed the planned European expansion of Euronext Clearing to all Euronext listed derivatives for Q3 2024. As a result Euronext served LCH SA  a notice of termination for the existing derivative clearing agreement on 16 January 2023.As we already announced  the related termination fee of approximately EUR36 million to be paid to LCH SA is part of the EUR150 million envelope of implementation cost related to the growth for Impact 2024 strategic plan. Therefore  this amount will be provisioned in our income statement as a non-underlying expense in Q1 2023 and will be payable in 2024. When we embarked on our ambitions Post Trade Strategy our aim was clear. To offer our clients the benefit of scale and harmonization‚Äôs across European markets  while still maintaining a robust local footprint in Euronext market.For all clients this will bring margin efficiencies with the implementation of a new value-add risk model and a single default fund. It will also bring efficiencies across all asset classes with transparency on data  particularly on settlement leveraging Euronext Securities target to securities settlement platform. So the expansion of Euronext Clearing is really critical as it will allow us to manage the entire trading value chain of our markets by the end of ‚Äô24  and it will generate significant revenue and cost synergies.Moving to slide nine  we continued to deploy capital efficiently in 2022 through a number of initiatives allowing us to better control our technology and develop new services. First  in March Euronext Securities acquired the General Meetings  Designated Representative and Shareholder's Registers activities of Spafid. This strategic partnership has contributed to the high growth  but had its services offered through Euronex Securities franchise.Secondly  we have internalized the technology powering MTS and Euronext Securities in Milan as part of our plan to integrate our full value chain and our technology. In addition  following the completion of the strategic review undertaken as part of the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group and our decision to divert from non-core asset  Euronext has disposed the U.S. subsidiary of MTS  MTS Markets International Inc.Importantly during this time  we have pursued very actively our deleveraging path  reaching 2.6 times net debt to EBITDA at the end of December 2022. And this compares to 3.2 times net debt to EBITDA at the closing of the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. Together with our strong cash generation capability  this brings us to around EUR1.5 billion of available capital at the end of December 2022. And our progress has been recognized by S&P that upgraded their outlook to positive in 2022. And as you have seen it yesterday evening  we have been upgraded to BBB plus.So we are very well advanced on our integration. We are confident in our ability to deliver upgraded synergies  because  once again this demonstrates the post-merger integration track record of Euronext teams. And this confidence combined with our favorable liquidity position enables us to continue exploring external growth. We would be looking for assets able to contribute to higher organic revenue growth to provide scalability and to improve exposure to non-volume related businesses. Obviously always in line with our rigorous capital allocation policy.Finally  I'd like to take a moment to highlight the great progress we have made with our Fit for 1.5 degree ESG commitment. We [Technical Difficulty] achievements of this SBTi target have already been implemented such as the migration of the Euronext Core Data Centre in Bergamo  which is powered 100% by renewable energy sources. We are also pleased to announce that Euronext has been included in the Euronext Equileap Eurozone 100 and the Euronext Equileap Gender Equality France 40  two indices showcasing European companies that demonstrate a strong role in improving gender equality. And we have continued to push for a broader transition in our markets. We have launched the CAC SBTi index  an index for grouping companies within the SBF 120 that have set emission reduction target approved as being in line with the Paris Agreement 1.5 degree before.So I now hand over to Giorgio Modica for the review of our fourth quarter performance.Giorgio ModicaThank you very much Stephane and good morning  everyone. Let's have now a look at the performance of Euronext in the fourth quarter of 2022. I'm now on slide 12. In the fourth quarter of 2022 Euronext demonstrated solid results reflecting the strong performance of advanced data services and listing combined with an efficient management of market share and revenue capture in a challenging trading environment for especially cash trading volumes.As a result  and as already mentioned by Stephane  Euronext underlying revenue income was only down 6.2%  compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 despite the relevant reduction of volumes  notably reflecting the strength of our diversified business mix. Briefly  listing revenue grew 3.1% resulting from a resilient equity and debt listing activity despite the tougher environment. We capture the majority of listing in Europe  remarkable this quarter were the high shares of company from outside of the Euronext market among our listing  accounting for around 40% of equity listing and demonstrating the international appeal of Euronext.Trading revenue was down 12.1% resulting from lower cash equity and MTS cash volume  partially offset by a record quarter for power trading and a good performance of FX trading. Post Trade revenue including -- excluding NTI was down 2.5% as a result of weaker equity clearing activity and a stabilized settlement activity.Advanced data Service revenue increased 7.3%. This was good performance across the offering both on real-time and non-real-time data  as well as on indices. Technology Solutions grew 1.8% driven by the good performance of colocation activity after the migration to the Bergamo Data Centre in June this year.In the fourth quarter of 2022 non-volume related revenue accounted  as Stephane said  for 60% of total Group revenue versus 58% the same quarter last year  reflecting high Advanced Data Services and Corporate Service revenue and revenues from services in general. Lastly  those non-volume related revenues cover 130% of our underlying operating expenses excluding D&A compared to 136% last year.Now I would like to move to the next slide  slide 13  for listing. Listing revenue was EUR53.5 million this quarter with an increase of 3.1% compared to the same quarter last year. This growth is driven by a higher annual fees  the strong performance of corporate service and the positive impact of primary and secondary listing revenue recognition over time. We have discussed already the impact on IFRS on listing revenues.In detail during the fourth quarter of 2022 Euronext maintained its leading position in Europe for primary equity listing counting 24 new listing of which  as I said  approximately 40% were international companies. In the fourth quarter of 2022 EUR310 million were raised on Euronext primary markets compared to a very strong Q4 2021 with EUR6.6 billion raised on our markets.As far as secondary issue are concerned EUR10.1 billion was raised in the fourth quarter of 2022  well above the same quarter last year. Euronext also reinforced its position as the leading venue for bond listing worldwide this quarter with over 53 000 bond listed across all Euronext market at the end of the year. And this despite a slowdown of the global bond listing activity due to the macroeconomic environment. This translated into EUR226.9 billion in debt raised on Euronext market during this quarter.Overall  this brings us to a total of EUR237.3 billion raised in equity and debt of Euronext market this quarter. Lastly  Corporate Service continued its growth trajectory across businesses despite slightly lower webcast activity in a post-pandemic environment.Let's have a look at our trading business on slide 14. I'm starting with cash trading. In the fourth quarter of 2022  we observed lower cash trading volumes  which were partially offset by efficient revenue capture and market share management  in particular we saw an uptick in market share from October 2022 not at detriment of revenue capture.Cash trading revenue was EUR65.1 million this quarter  a decrease of 17.9%  compared to the same quarter last year as a result of average daily volumes of EUR10.1 billion  a volume decrease of 17.2% and 3% fewer trading days this quarter. Average revenue capture over the quarter was at 0.50 basis point versus 0.49 basis point in the fourth quarter of 2021  reflecting the dilutive impact of Borsa Italiana market and larger average order size in line with pre-pandemic levels. As a reminder  we charge per value and per order explaining the dilutive impact of larger order size on our revenue capture.As I said  we reported an uptick in market share from October 2022 and Euronext market share on cash trading averaged 65.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022. In the past we were often asked about the sustainability of those metrics. This is why I would like to confirm to you that in 2023  we expect to maintain on our market  the market share greater or equal to 63% and our revenue capture to be around 0.52 basis point following the integration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq  considering current market condition and order size.Euronext has once again confirmed its position as the largest  the deepest  and the most stable liquidity pool in Europe offering the highest quality of executions with market participants. We are excited that our cash trading business will significantly change dimension with a migration of Italian cash market to Euronext state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform Optiq in the first quarter of 2023.Now  I would like to move to Derivatives trading. Derivatives trading revenues decreased 5.4% to EUR13.4 million this quarter as a result of softer volume environment  partially offset by a positive impact of volume mix on revenue capture and fee changes. Average daily volumes on financial derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2022 were down 12.7% from the same quarter last year  suffering from a strong comparison basis with high volatility in the fourth quarter of 2021.Commodities average daily volumes were down 17.2% in the fourth quarter of 2022  compared to the fourth quarter of 2021  reflecting a normalized trading environment. Over the quarter  the average revenue capture increased for derivatives to EUR0.34 per lot  up 12.5% from the fourth quarter of 2021  thanks to volume mix impact and fee changes.Lastly on Fixed Income trading. Fixed Income trading reported revenue at EUR22.1 million this quarter  compared to EUR24.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This reflects an economic environment in Europe favoring money market and therefore repo volumes. MTS reported an overall robust performance in market dominated by increasing interest rate  with continued strong traction for repo trading offset by lower cash trading volumes.In the fourth quarter of 2022 MTS cash reported EUR12.8 million of revenue with ADV down 32.7% to EUR15.4 billion and MTS Repo reported EUR5.6 million of revenue with term-adjusted ADV up 36% to EUR397 billion.Continuing on trading on slide 15. The fourth quarter of 2022 saw a solid performance of Euronext FX in terms of both revenues and average daily volume  benefiting from the continued positive momentum with a high volatility and good traction of our matching engine in Singapore. Euronext reported average spot FX trading daily volumes of $20.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022  up 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.Spot FX trading revenue increased 9.5%  compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 at EUR6.7 million. Power trading reported EUR8.9 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022  a growth of 4.7% year-on-year driven by dynamic volumes increased foot print in Nord Pool in Central Europe  U.K.  Ireland and a continued robust performance in the Nordics.In the fourth quarter of 2022 average daily volume day ahead power traded was 2.98 terawatt hours  up 7.9% with respect to the same quarter last year  and average daily intraday power traded was at 0.13-terawatt hour. This is an increase of 9% year-on-year. I would like to highlight the intraday trading volumes in Central and Western Europe reached record level this quarter.Moving to slide 16. Revenues from our Post Trade activities excluding net treasury income decreased 2.5% to EUR88.6 million. Clearing revenue was down 3.9% this quarter to EUR29 million as a result of dynamic bond clearing activity  partially offsetting weaker cash and derivative clearing activity.As announced with the Q2 2022 results  Euronext Clearing engaged in a partial disposal of its investment portfolio. We dispose the portfolio maturing after the 1st of May 2023 and kept the rest until maturity. The runoff for this portfolio is currently ongoing and almost completed. As a consequence  our net treasury income is not yet at cruising speed and this quarter amounted to EUR4.3 million. In this respect  I would like to confirm our target for NTI 2023. In the first quarter of 2023  we expect to reach 10 basis point margin similarly from the margin we have reached in the fourth quarter of 2022. And from the second quarter this year and onwards we will reach our cruising speeds at 20 basis points.I wanted to make a brief comment as well on the upgrade of S&P. What I wanted to highlight is that the upgrade of rating is not only linked to an improvement of leverage  but as well a reduction of clearing risk and our rank anchor rating moved from BBB to BBB plus as S&P has removed the notch downgrade for clearing and settlement risk. This gives us a significantly more upside as far as rating is concerned.Continuing on settlement and other Post Trade revenue including the activity of Euronext Security  the revenues were EUR59.6 million this quarter  down 1.9% year-on-year. This reflect the resilient top line of Euronext Securities  thanks to its diversified geographical footprint in a stabilized environment. For settlement  over the fourth quarter of 2022  the value of assets under custody at Euronext Securities increased to EUR6.3 billion.I'm now moving to the next slide  slide 17  Advanced Data Services reached record revenues of EUR54.5 million this quarter  up 7.3% year-on-year  driven by strong traction of our core data businesses and good momentum of Advanced Data solution franchise including quant research and indices. Investor service revenues were up EUR2.6 million this quarter  up 13.2% reflecting continued commercial expansion of the business. Lastly  Technology Solutions revenue was up 1.8% compared to the same quarter last year to EUR26.9 million  reflecting the good performance of colocation activity following the migration of Euronext Core Data Centre  and this more than offset the lower revenues from hosting services.Moving to the next slide  I'm now on slide 19. I wanted to give some highlights on our 2023 cost guidance. In 2023 Euronext expects its underlying expenses excluding D&A to be around EUR630 million  compared to the annualized second half 2022 underlying expenses excluding D&A of around EUR620 million. The slight increase solidly relates to growth initiative to develop our non-volume related fund business.In other words  we expect that the cost base of Euronext to remain stable as cost savings and synergies will entirely compensate inflation and business development costs. I would like also to add that on the revenue side  we have performed a deep review of our pricing strategy across products to reflect inflation. And we will have the effect of this activity in 2023.I would like as well to do a few comments on integration costs. Stephane has already partially covered that. Following the termination of our derivative clearing agreement  we will post the provision this quarter of around EUR36 million covering termination and migration costs. For the sake of clarity  this does not change our target of integration cost  which is set at EUR150 million. In addition  I would like to confirm our previous guideline in terms of integration cost per quarter that for 2023 will range in between EUR10 million and EUR15 million depending on the quarter.Moving now to the next slide. This brings us to the EBITDA bridge. Euronext adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was down 12% to EUR187.9 million  mainly from lower volume environment partially as we discussed offset by non-volume related revenue growth and maintain cost discipline in an inflationary environment. Indeed despite the pressures of inflation and despite the deployment of our strategic plan cost remain contained this quarter  as Stephane mentioned earlier  we beat our revised 2022 cost target of EUR612 million  initially set at the beginning of the year at EUR622 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased as a consequence by 3.5 points  compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 to 54.1%.Moving to slide 21 for the bridge on net income. Adjusted net income this quarter was down 18.2% to EUR118.2 million  resulting from lower EBITDA  partially offset by the following elements. First lower D&A as in the first quarter of 2021 we had some write-offs as the one of the brand name of VP Securities  with as well lower net financing expenses mainly linked to the positive impact of higher interest rates  there are many moving parts in this number  but in summary  the positive impact of the interest rate on our interest income reported in the fourth quarter of 2022 is higher than the benefit from the interest rate swap we had in the fourth quarter of 2021 and it was terminated in 2022.And then I would like to highlight as well higher results from equity investment  representing the contribution of LCH SA and the dividend received from Euroclear. As a reminder  in last year Euroclear paid its dividend in Q1 and Q3. I would like to highlight that the non-underlying cost in this bridge are mainly represented by D&A and more specifically related to the PPA amortization of our acquisition.Lastly  tax for the fourth quarter of 2022 was EUR38.5 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 27.3% for the quarter. Reported net income was EUR99.3 million  and adjusted EPS basic was down 18% this quarter  EUR1.11 per share  compared to an adjusted EPS basic as well of EUR1.35 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. This reflects higher number of outstanding share of the quarter compared to last year.Moving to slide 22 for the cash flow generation and leverage. The net operating cash flow post tax amounted for a negative EUR147.1 million  compared to a positive EUR145.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This negative flow was impacted by a change in working capital related to Nord Pool CCP activities for EUR276 million.As we will see in the next slide  the balancing item of this negative cash flow is a reduction of the cash in transit for EUR297 million. Excluding the impact of on working capital from Nord Pool and Euronext Clearing  CCP activities net operating cash flow post tax accounted for 55.3% of EBITDA.Our net debt to EBITDA as reminded by Stephane was at 2.6 times in the fourth quarter of 2022  compared to 4.3 times in the third quarter of 2022  that was positively impacted by higher cash in transit as we just discussed included in the cash and cash equivalents. Excluding the EUR49 million non-underlying one-off loss on NTI  the net debt to last 12 months reported EBITDA was at 2.4 times in the fourth quarter of 2022.Moving on to the slide 23 for the evolution of our liquidity position over the quarter. As described on previous slide  you can see the impact of the short movement in working capital related to Nord Pool CCP activities in the net operating cash flow. As an illustration  our liquidity position remains strong  above EUR1.5 billion  including the undrawn revolving credit facility for EUR600 million  and excluding the cash currently in transit.As Stephane highlighted  while the integration of Borsa Italiana is on track  we can look for external growth opportunities  thanks to this strong liquidity position and improvement in our rating profile.And this completes my presentation  and now I give the floor back to Stephane.Stephane BoujnahThank you  Giorgio. As you have seen 2022 was a real pivotal year  we took advantage of our diversified business model  our business model which is much more diversified than many people think. We strengthened our core business with continuous leadership not only on listing and on trading  but also a very strong development in other businesses. We maintained our trademark cost discipline in an inflationary environment  which has affected everyone.And we have put the key projects of the Borsa Italiana Group integration on a very good track  hence our commitments in terms of synergy delivery for the years to come. So 2023  ‚Äò22 has demonstrated that Euronext has the recipe for success  for cash flow generation even in tough environments. Also 2022 paved the way for future growth in Euronext now 2023 will be a real transformational year.First  our cash trading market share is expected to remain greater or equal to 63% and our revenue capture for the cash equity trading business to remain above what we call to 0.52 bps in 2023 after the Borsa Italiana markets migration to Optiq.Second our continued cost discipline and achieved synergies will enable us to offset inflation. The slight increase in cost only results from costs related to non-volume related revenue growth initiatives and savings and synergies entirely compensate inflation and business development cost. So the superior track record of Euronext in post-merger integration will translate -- will continue to translate in a strong cost discipline.Third  as a result  we have great  our 2024 run rate synergy target to reach almost twice the level of the first announced synergies back to the time of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition announcement to what will be EUR115 million of run rate synergies by the end of ‚Äò24. ‚Äò23 will be pivotal  as I said  with the delivery of the key strategic projects that have been highlighted by Giorgio and I early on. And the continued cost optimization that will lead to EUR70 million of cumulated run rate synergies at the end of '23.And fourth  combined with our fast deleveraging  since the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group and as demonstrated by the BBB plus upgrade by S&P announced yesterday evening  we are now in the right position to look for possible external growth in the respect obviously of our strong investment criteria of return on capital employed above WACC after three or five years -- three years to five years.So thanks for your attention. We are now ready to take your questions together with Giorgio Modica  Anthony Attia  the Global Head of Primary Markets and Post Trade  and Simon  Head of Cash and Derivatives trading.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question from line  Kyle Voigt from KBW. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Kyle VoigtHi  good morning. Maybe a couple of questions from me. First question is just on pricing  some of your peers globally have spoken about taking larger pricing adjustment in 2023 given the inflationary backdrop  and I believe you mentioned that in your prepared remarks that you also took some inflationary adjustments. Just wondering how you viewed pricing in 2023 versus prior years. And in which lines we should really expect the most material pricing adjustments to come through?And then also just a question on the synergy realization slide in the deck and the timeline there. Obviously  some of the key dates are for the fourth quarter of 2023  so quite late in the year. So when we think about your 2023 underlying cost guidance  I'm just trying to get a sense of what level of actual realized cost synergies are embedded within that as that may help us think about the expense trajectory into 2024. And given those timing of synergies  is it possible that underlying costs may actually be down in 2024 versus 2023? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahThank you. So  Giorgio will answer your two questions  the first on pricing and the second one on the phasing of synergy delivery.Giorgio ModicaSo thank you very much for your questions. So with respect to pricing  I guess that the best way to describe what we were going to do is that mostly price are going to be increased in the non-trading activities. And the increase that we will have are around  I would say  mid-single-digit than some slightly more  some slightly less. But this gives you a sense of how much our non-volume related business will grow in terms of pricing.And if you consider that 60% of our business is non-volume related  this gives you a bit of an idea of what would be the price increase impact on our top line next year  excluding any other variables. So it's around mid-single-digit time 60%. Then on the line  this price increase we laid  I mean  I believe I indirectly answered saying that it's not really going to be the trading lines  but the other line. So this is for the first question.When it comes to the synergies  the way I can answer your question is the following. Let's start from the synergies that we have delivered run rate this quarter. So at the end of December 2022  we have reached EUR34 million of run rate synergies. What this means is that part of the synergies will hit the P&L in 2023. And this is going as well to contribute to making sure as I described that the key cost of the organization will remain flat from a P&L perspective.Then coming to the delivery of synergies next year  a few elements  there is going to be an important moment with the migration of Optiq in the first quarter  and this will have -- impact our P&L right after the migration. But then  you are correct  there are other cost and savings that are going to be delivered in the fourth quarter this year with the impact on the P&L of next year.So then  my last comment is that  this year we will deliver a combination of revenues and cost synergies. And as far as the revenue synergies  again  I already mentioned the Optiq integration  but we will have as well the launch of our clearing activities on equities.Kyle VoigtThank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line  Mike Werner from UBS. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Mike WernerThank you very much for the presentation and the explanations  all very  very helpful. Two questions from me please. In terms of the market share in cash equity trading  and we know you've adjusted your pricing schedule  I think it was in November  we saw an uptick in market shares into the year end. The data that I collect  which certainly is not perfect implies that market shares have trended lower in January and ultimately in the first couple of days of February. So I was wondering if you can confirm if that's what you're seeing.And then B  just wondering  is this -- is that price adjustment in November  kind of  your final take  is this something where we could see further adjustments ultimately to protect the market share as we look at over the next couple of months?And then on the second question  just thinking about deleveraging  and I think the debt to EBITDA was 2.6 times at the end of this year  very similar level at the end of 2021. I know there was a bunch of restructuring costs throughout the year. But as we look out to 2023 kind of given your guidance on restructuring costs  how should we think about the pace of deleveraging throughout ‚Äò23  assuming no M&A or no other factors involved? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo  Simon Gallagher will answer your first question on market share and yield and prices. And Giorgio Modica will answer your question on deleveraging pace and phasing.Simon GallagherThank you  Stephane. So to answer the first question on market share  so you're right  we implemented a first batch of measures on pricing and liquidity programs in November last year  which was successful  which resulted in a three-point uplift in market share over the quarter. And certainly since the start of the year  what we're seeing is that volumes are soft  there is a lack of real economy liquidity in the market  which has had a slightly downward influence on market share because regulated markets tend to have a higher proportion of real economy flow than the alternative trading venues. And so  that's what we see as the primary explanation for the first quarter.To answer your second question  the answer is resolutely  no. This is obviously not the end of the pricing measures we are taking  and the changes in liquidity we are making. There will be further adjustments to the flagship liquidity schemes in March  alongside as Stephane and Giorgio mentioned the pricing adjustments to the Italian market post migrations. These price changes and liquidity schemes will not be yield dilutive. They will be pushing our liquidity providers a bit more and adjusting the intricacies of the LP schemes. So this is not the end of the story. Obviously  this is a very dynamic and ongoing process.Mike WernerThank you very much.Giorgio ModicaYes  when it comes to the deleveraging profile  I can confirm a few elements. Now  I believe you are the target for dividends  so it's EUR236 million. And then the other element is that we confirm two-thirds cash flow conversion post tax from EBITDA. So with these two elements  I believe that now we have  I mean  we have guided with respect to the non-underlying costs are related to the termination of the agreement. Those are the key elements of the equation. So again to summarize  around 66% cash flow conversion post tax  and EUR236 million of dividends to be expected in 2023.Mike WernerThank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line  Haley Tam from Credit Suisse. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Haley TamGood morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Could I ask a couple about the revenue capture please in the equity market. So first of all  the Q4 revenue yield of 0.5 basis points was a step down from 0.53 in Q3? And if I've heard you correctly  you're saying that the supplemental liquidity provider scheme adjustments you've made are not yield dilutive. So I wonder if you could help us walk through that step down from 0.53 to 0.5  please just to understand the dynamics there?And then the second question  just to understand your assumptions for 2023  market share more than 63% to revenue capture 0.52 basis points. Are both of those numbers for after the Borsa Italiana migration or are they numbers that I should assume for the average through the year? And I do know that 63% is less than the 65% market share you had in Q4. So I just wondered if you could comment on that? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahOkay  so Simon Gallagher will answer your two questions on the revenue capture and on the phasing of the market share evolutions.Simon GallagherThank you  Stephane. So I'll break down very precisely the variance in yield from 0.53 to 0.5. In the numbers are included a small number of non-equity items  so it's the Warrants and Certificates and ETFs notably. So if we break down the 0.03  0.01 of that was due to non-equity items this variance in volumes in non-equity businesses  which are ETFs and the Warrants and Certificates. So that leaves 0.02 basis points imputable to cash equity yield. Two-thirds of this 0.02 was due to changes in the order sizes.And so  how does this impact the 0.02? When markets tend to be a bit less  there's less volatility in the markets  order sizes as we've seen recently  order sizes tend to go up a little bit  which means there is less arbitrage opportunities from the electronic liquidity providers  which means order sizes go up in the market. And this interacts with certain features of our fee grid where we have fixed euro fees per executed order.And so this is two-thirds of that 0.02 is imputable to order sizes. One-third of the 0.02 can be imputable to other features of the fee grid  including partially to the SLP changes we made in the supplemental liquidity scheme. So if you break down -- if you break it down that way  the changes we make to the SLP scheme are largely immaterial in terms of impacts on yield. And there will be further yield accretive changes to the SLP scheme from the second quarter onwards.With respect to the second question  the market share number  I think can be seen as an average over the year as a base. And the yield  the revenue traction number is a -- and the market share is obviously a floor we see and is the minimum we are targeting. And the yield extraction number is post -- is the run rate post the Italy migration.Haley TamThank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Bruce HamiltonHi  good morning  and thanks very much for the presentation and Q&A. I guess firstly just going back to the synergies  obviously encouraging that you've increased those. But could you break out the EUR115 million between revenues and costs? And just going back to the earlier question  given the consensus assumes  I think a reduction in absolute costs in 2024  is that kind of consistent with the way you're thinking about the cost synergies?And then secondly on M&A and balance sheet flexibility. In terms of your sort of EUR1.5 billion of capacity  I can see on slide 23 you've laid out  how you get there. But what's the sort of net debt EBITDA that you would be comfortable going up to temporarily to do a deal? And then just an update on what the -- what you'd view your current WACC as  as well would be helpful. Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo Giorgio will answer your question on the synergies delivery on cost and on the balance sheet and debt capabilities.Giorgio ModicaSo let's start with the first one. I would like to highlight that the increase from EUR100 million to EUR115 million is mainly related to a better visibility on the opportunities on clearing. So this is the first element  then when it comes to the breakdown between cost and revenue  I will try to do my best  but there is a complexity is that  as we said from the beginning  the EUR115 million is an improvement of EBITDA  that includes sometimes project involving more revenue and more cost. So the best breakdown I can provide you with is the following.Let's start from the original target  the EUR60 million. The EUR60 million were broken down as follows  EUR45 million of cost savings and EUR15 million of revenue uplift. Now this EUR15 million revenue uplift  the significant portion of the EUR15 million is linked to the migration of Optiq. Part of which were going and the most relevant part were going to execute in 45 days. And this is clearly pure revenue synergies. Then the other buckets are around EUR10 million EBITDA coming from the migration to the center. And this is already embedded in our number  but involves more revenues  but as well more cost.And then the remainder that was originally accessed to be EUR30 million and now it's increased to EUR45 million is the clearing opportunity. And you will -- and then there are many moving parts because we'll clearly have more revenues  but as well we will need to upgrade and as we are doing the platform of Euronext Clearing. But on the other side  we will not have any more the costs that today we are paying to LCH SA  which are currently captured in our P&L. So this is the breakdown. Unfortunately  I cannot further break down the different project in between cost and revenues. So this is -- this I believe covers your first question.When it comes to the underlying cost of capital  I believe that Euronext is in line what we see as an average of analyst  and again  as I always stress  those are a point in time  so what I can say is that  I don't see a major deviation from what you analysts are taking as an average as our own cost of capital. And when it comes to the max leverage  what I would say is the following. And again  this is very tricky question  because it depends very much on the target you acquire that give -- would give us additional leverage.But as we commented in the past  we believe that in terms of pure debt capacity  we would have a capacity in the range between EUR1.5 billion and EUR2 billion. This is roughly speaking the standalone capabilities we would have to finance and impute that acquisition. And again  I would like to highlight that as you very well know rating and leverage consideration are very much target specific.Bruce HamiltonGreat  very helpful. Thank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line Enrico Bolzoni from JP Morgan. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Enrico BolzoniHi  thank you. Good morning. Sorry to go back once again to market share  just a clarification. I would like to understand the market share you are guiding is something that in case you should not be on track to achieve; you would implement some changes in pricing or something else to make sure that you hit it or it's rather you simply saying that in light of your proposition your pricing in your relationship with customer you will naturally achieve? So this is my first question.And then a more general one  possibly related to that. Can you just give any comment in terms of what you're seeing in terms of volume migrating to dark pools  because it seems like these are increasing. And also interestingly the average order size are going down  while historically they have been higher in dark pools. So I was just curious to hear from you on this subject.And then finally  I mean  a number of your peers in Europe and also outside of Europe are increasingly doing partnership with technology providers. So I was just curious to hear your thoughts here. Is this something that you consider as well or you have more -- you think you have internal capabilities to develop all the technology infrastructure that you need to support your growth? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo I will answer your third question on the relationship with the providers of data services and data storage. And Simon Gallagher will answer your question about the market share dynamics and the dark pool development. We have made the deliberate decision to internalize within Euronext and to locate within Europe the businesses that are the most critical ones to our strategy and the operations that are the most sensitive ones to our operational leverage and operational performance. That has led to migrate our Core Data Centre that used to be in Basildon to new -- brand new data center  100% powered by green energy in Bergamo near Milan.We do believe that core data processing  core software  core systems  core data storage  core applications must be located within the European Union and must be managed by Europeans. We do use for historical data storage one of those technology provider that has facilities located in the Republic of Ireland. We do not intend to have critical applications  critical software  critical matching engine related platforms located outside the European Union  nor being managed outside the Group. So this is a deliberate choice we have done  which is consistent with our strategy.Others have done different choices in a different environment with different sharing of value with partners  with different profile of future dependency on third party providers. We have not taken the choice  we have taken the choice to internalize that and that was not done at the compromise of anything in terms of financial performance as you have seen it over the past few years.Over to you  Simon  on the market share and volumes.Simon GallagherThank you  Stephane. So to answer the first question on the two numbers of 63% and 0.52. So this is obviously an equilibrium between these two numbers. And the aim of this equilibrium is to maximize euro revenue extraction from the franchise. We believe that these two numbers represent the optimal trade-off for this year  obviously there is some room  wiggle room around these numbers. But the primary aim here is to maintain our role and our ability to price full value within the franchise across the various pricing segments.I just want to make one point. So beyond the explicit fees of 0.52  what is behind a lot of this is the management of implicit costs for investors  which is the quality of execution on our market. And this has to do with the mark out  the liquidity of our markets  which is by all published papers vastly superior to the alternative market. So this explicit yield number is only a part of the story. And I'd even say sort of a minority part of the story. The bigger picture behind here is the design of our liquidity schemes and the partnerships we form with our partners in the electronic trading community.The second point about dark pools  there's been some small increase in these pools. I'd say two things  dark pools  if you look at the numbers remained very small features still of the European execution landscape. These are low-single-digit -- sorry  below 10% in terms of volumes and is constrained by regulation  right. So we have the 8% cap and the 4% cap on reference price trading venues.And the second thing  if you look at the revenue models of these pools  they actually charge less than that we do in the lead markets. Third point with respect to dark pools we are observing with great interest the movements in the regulatory landscape  and we will be very active in this space. And depending what's happened -- what happens there  there will be potential business opportunities for Euronext as well in the stock trading space. So I think that's what we can say there.Enrico BolzoniThank you very much.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line Ian White from Autonomous Research. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Ian WhiteHi  thanks for taking my questions. Just a few follow-ups from my side please. Can you just clarify a little bit  your appetite for M&A at this stage  from the discussion so far  I'm sort of taking away that you'd be happy to consider a transformational deal at this stage  even while the Borsa Italiana integration is still ongoing. Is that a fair reflection of your appetite for M&A please?Second question  just any revised thoughts at all around the medium-term financial guidance that you've given for out to FY ‚Äò24. And finally  just maybe a clarification please on the outlook for NII. I think you talked about getting to cruising speed 20 bps yield  but how have collateral balances trended there over the last sort of few months and what's the outlook there please? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo I will answer your first question on the M&A framework and Giorgio will answer the two other questions on financial guidance. The M&A objectives or the M&A framework remains the same. We want to continue the growth of the Euronext project in two directions. The first one is to remain open to single country or several country exchanges in Europe  who consider being part of a scalable project and who might be interested in joining the largest single liquidity pool in Europe and the largest single order book and the most powerful technology platform. So anything that would make Euronext more relevant for some European market infrastructure is clearly something that we will consider.The other avenue is always to pursue the diversification of our of our top line. The diversification of our revenue mix  because this call is very interesting. There are many questions on market share and yield of the business that represents 20% of our top line today. It's important  I appreciate that. But you may have noticed that over the past few years  we have done a significant effort to diversify in Post Trade  to diversify in other asset classes like energy  like ForEx  like in other services like corporate services in technology et cetera.So we -- the objective Post Trade by any M&A move will be diversification of our top line. And the other objective would be to accelerate growth to capture businesses that have a growth profile that can accelerate the growth profile of the combined entity. So we explore and we analyze all sort of situations. And clearly the fact that our deleveraging has increased  and that the rating has been improved yesterday evening to BBB plus.The fact that the synergies in Italy are in the very good track  hence the upgrade targeted -- that really target that we have shared with you  it gives us more confidence that we need to explore these opportunities again. But nothing very new or fundamental  just an improvement of the surrounding consensus around the same strategy. We'd always  always the same very rigorous framework that we want to deploy the capital of our shareholders in acquisitions that generate a return on capital employed above the WACC of the company between year three and five after synergies. So that's the M&A framework.Over to you  Giorgio on the mid-term financial profile and end of ‚Äò24 guidance.Giorgio ModicaAbsolutely. Let me start with the net treasury income. I will give you a few more details so that you can have a better view. So the first element  I wanted to highlight is that  with respect to when we discussed the last time around the average collateral has actually increased  what we have seen are level at around the EUR22 billion.And in the fourth quarter of last year  these EUR4.3 million that we have posted as NTI represent around zero point -- around 7 basis points. So slightly below the 10 we guided. And this is the result of the fact that interest rates increase more than anticipated. And as you know  during the fourth quarter we still had an important point of fixed income portfolio in run off  but then in terms of euro million this is very  very marginal.If we now move to the first quarter this year  what we will have in terms of P&L is going to be a revenue capture  which is going to be closer to the 10 bps I guided. And we might have in euro million a result  which is in between EUR5 million and EUR6 million. Then after that we will see  collateral should remain in the EUR20 billion type of a range  slightly more  slightly less. And the cruising speed in terms of NTI should be 20 basis points. Then this is as granular as I can be  if you have follow up question  happy to take them.When it comes to the target of 2024  the only one I can put  we will not change the target is that within our current target of EBITDA growth  given the environment we see room for having slightly more revenues for an environment where we will have slightly more cost. So this is more or less the trend  so 5% to 6% EBITDA CAGR remains unchanged  maybe depending on how the next two years will evolve  we might be in a situation where revenue growth is going to be higher and cost marginally higher.Ian WhiteGot it. That's helpful. Thank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the next question from line Johannes Thormann from HSBC. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Johannes ThormannGood morning  everybody. And some follow-up questions please. First of all on the clearing business again. First of all  why have you delay in the margin improvement from 10 bps to 20 bps? I'm still lacking to understand  and will it be really fixed end of this quarter  or will we probably get next call the message again  we have another quarter running in 10 bps. What is driving this because investors here this is probably  anyway so it's just the worst time of the market?And secondly  on your clearing initiative in general  especially for the cash clearing  what incentives are you giving to the customers to move your business to Euronext Clearing away from LCH  because as I understand in cash clearing the customer has major part of the choice?And last but not least on the cash trading market share  historically you were about 70%  now you seem to be satisfied with 63%  which is also the revenue opportunity for the clearing business. So you're reducing your own revenue opportunity. What is driving your assumption to be satisfied with 63%? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahOkay. So Giorgio will answer your -- the first part of your questions. And Anthony Attia  who is the Head of Post Trade operations will answer your questions on the incentives  the pricing of our operation -- clearing operations and our market share in equity  cash equity clearing.Giorgio ModicaSo  I would like to clarify one element  you seem to highlight the level of surprise  but in July 2022  we expressed a very clear guideline saying that  we would have had 20 basis point in the third quarter  then 10 basis point in the fourth and in the first quarter and then back again 20 basis point. And the result  so -- and we guided for around EUR20 billion level of collateral  which means implicitly that we guided for EUR10 million in the third quarter and EUR5 million in the fourth quarter. The actual result were EUR11 million in the third quarter and EUR4 million in the fourth quarter  which is  I would say  exactly identical to what we have guided in July 2022.So what is happening? And why did we get zero point -- sorry 7 basis point and not 10 basis point  simply that  when you have a small portion of your portfolio  which is fixed income  it means that the rate on the asset side will not change  whereas on the liability side where 100% of our ability are benchmarked to ECB rates  then you pay more. And this has a slightly dilutive impact on the level of NTI.Finally  on your question  is really true that we are going to have 20 basis point in the second quarter? And then  my answer is  yes. As a simple fact that in -- as I said  from the 1st of May 2023  we'll no longer hold any fixed income portfolio and for all of our assets and all our liabilities are going to be at variable rate. And therefore  we will make the spread between the interest we collect and interest we give back to clients. I hope this clarifies.Anthony AttiaGood morning. This is Anthony Attia. Thank you for your question. Let me detail for you the value proposition of our clearing internalization initiatives. They are five main points that I want to share with you. So first of all  we will offer the clearing services for cash equity for all our Euronext market excluding Oslo  but including Italy. So in the same default fund  on the same risk framework and the value-add risk model  we will be able to clear all our cash equity trade. This generate efficiencies on margin and default contribution to the client compared to the current fragmented situation.Second  we will be operating from a state-of-the-art clearing platform that we are currently developing with one connection for all the market. And the use of the extremely efficient set of technologies.Third part  we are working on offering competing clearing fees. There‚Äôs no need to get into the rest of the [Technical Difficulty] on from a clearing fee point of view. But it's the combination of these different factors that create this attractive value proposition.And last  thanks to our Post Trade investment on Euronext Securities  our CSDs  in particular in Milan  we will be able to offer extremely competitive settlement fees. And so the engagement we have with the clearing members presently show that we are in a very  very good position to succeed in the migration at the end of 2023. Thank you.Johannes ThormannThank you.OperatorThank you. We will take the last question from line Greg Simpson from BNP Paribas. The line is open now. Please go ahead.Greg SimpsonHi  good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in at the end. Maybe a follow-up on clearing  can you just talk about what the current market share of that LCH SA has in your cash markets? What are your expectations for when your next clearing goes live in Q4. And then you have fewer CCP in the background. So just interested in any thoughts on competition?And then a second question would be on  on the mid-single-digit price increases in the non-volume areas  can you share if there's any user feedback on this? Do customers generally just accept the price increases as they're essential or is there any signs that you just might try to say optimize the subscriptions  our market data for example. Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo  Giorgio on pricing  and Anthony on the competition on clearing.Anthony AttiaSo on clearing  so we do not comment market share element of LCH SA or the Euroclear Europe  you can direct your questions to them. Nevertheless the setup that will be out at the end of the year is complete for CCP setup  which means that by default the trade done on Euronext Optiq platform will be routed towards Euronext Clearing and if the buyer and the seller select another CCP then the trade will be relative to these other CCP. So far this preferred CCP model creates an incentive for the year  for the CCP of choice to clear the bulk of the trade  because it provide efficiencies the way I commented before.Giorgio ModicaThen when it comes to your question with respect to price increase  it's actually a complicated question  but let me try to answer. So in general terms  clients are not necessarily happy of price increases. However  it is important to highlight that the general environment is -- in this general environment price increase are very common  everyone is increasing prices and therefore as well clients are accustomed to increase their own prices to their clients and receive a request for price increasing inflationary environment. So this is the first element.And we have not received any sign where our price increase were considered to be excessive. And clearly  we have deeply assessed that  making sure that price increase were commensurate to the quality of the service we provide. So this is the first element. Then you seem to refer more specifically to market data. And on that specific angle  what I can tell you is that  if you look  for example  at our -- if you look for example at our results in the fourth quarter  you see that the 7%  a part of that 7% is related to an increase of users.It's related to an increase of streams  which is quite surprisingly in an industry where usually there is attrition in terms of clients and number of terminals. And this reflect the new way of a mix way of working  flat -- part from home and part in the office where sharing screen and terminal becomes more complicated. So to make a long story short  we did pass the price increase that was generally well accepted by clients.Stephane BoujnahSo thank you everyone. As two words of conclusion now  I want to highlight really in my -- what is my view is that -- are the key takeaways of where we are today. We deliver diversification  our revenues are more diversified than they have ever been  and we will continue to deliver diversification. We deliver cost discipline in environment  which is quite complicated with inflationary pressure and we will continue to deliver cost discipline. We deliver post-merger integration for real with major projects already delivered in relation to the acquisition of Borsa Italiana  and new ones will be delivered including within a few weeks‚Äô time with the Optiq migration in Italy.And we will therefore there continue to deliver revenue synergies and other post-merger integration projects. We have delivered deleveraging and we will continue to deliver deleveraging as demonstrated by the BBB plus upgrade announced yesterday by S&P. So we are extremely confident that this strong diversified cost discipline operating leverage focused company with great assets to expand the top line through the extraction of revenue synergies will continue to be extremely positioned to capture opportunities in ‚Äò23.Thank you very much.

Net interest in‚Ä¶,"(Alliance News) - Generalfinance Spa on Friday approved its draft financial statements for fiscal year 2022  reporting a net profit of EUR10.9 million  up from EUR9.5 million in 2021.The board also proposed a dividend of EUR0.43 per share.Net interest income 2022 amounted to EUR7.2 million from EUR6.2 million as of Dec. 31  2021  up 17 percent due mainly to the increase in loans disbursed  as well as the increase in market rates in the second half of the year  which resulted in higher interest income for the variable-rate advances component.By contrast  net interest and other banking income for the year just ended was EUR30.9 million  up from EUR23.9 million as of December 31  2021.As for capital ratios  the CET1 ratio was 14.55 percent  the TIER1 ratio was 14.55 percent  and the total capital ratio was 17.61 percent.With regard to the assigned debtors based in Russia  Ukraine  and Belarus  Generalfinance has an extremely limited total exposure as of December 31  2022  at approximately EUR100 000  a significant reduction from the December 31  2021 exposure of EUR2.6 million. Since the invasion of Ukraine  Generalfinance has suspended credit facilities related to assigned debtors operating in countries directly affected by the conflict.Equity as of December 31  2022 stood at EUR56.8 million  compared to EUR32.0 million as of December 31  2021.The change in equity is mainly determined by the capital increase carried out in the context of the IPO for about EUR20.2 million  the company explains in a note  after deducting the costs directly attributable to the transaction passed through equity  net of the related tax effect as well as the allocation of the profit for 2021 to reserves.Massimo Gianolli  chief executive officer of Generalfinance  said  ""The year 2022 was a key year in the life of our company; we completed  in agreement with our shareholder Cr√©dit Agricole Italia  the listing of Generalfinance's shares on Euronext Milan  Euronext STAR Milan Segment  a strategic operation for us  as it allowed us to raise EUR20 million in new capital.""""We subsequently approved a new three-year Business Plan  with which we intend to grow further within our core business  the financing of distressed businesses through the divestment of working capital. From a business point of view  in the year we recorded strong growth in the flow of disbursements  amounting to EUR1.67 billion up 50 percent on 2021  with revenues up 29 percent; this confirms the steady growth trend.""As for the future  the company expects ""further growth in results compared to those achieved in 2022 and in line with the objectives defined in the recent Strategic Plan.""General Finance on Friday closed 0.3 percent in the red at EUR7.18 per share.By Chiara Bruschi  Alliance News reporterComments and questions to redazione@alliancenews.comCopyright 2023 Alliance News IS Italian Service Ltd.

The vessel w‚Ä¶,"Transocean  a global leader in the offshore drilling industry  has made a non-controlling investment in DEME Group's subsidiary GSR  through the contribution of an ultra-deepwater drilling vessel and cash investment.The vessel will be converted for a system integration test to explore the technical and environmental feasibility of recovering nodules in ultra-deepwater .The alliance will strengthen GSR's subsea experience and thereby contribute to its leadership position in the deep seabed minerals sector.DEME Group NV (Euronext Brussels: DEME) today announced a strategic cooperation with Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG) that brings together DEME's Global Sea Mineral Resources' (""GSR"") leadership in ultra-deepwater mineral exploration and seafloor nodule collection technology with Transocean's world-class offshore expertise and capabilities.As part of its investment  Transocean is contributing the vessel 'Ocean Rig Olympia' for GSR's ongoing exploration work  a cash investment and engineering capacity. In return  Transocean is receiving a minoritystake  including a board seat  in GSR. Following the successful trial of GSR's pre-prototype seafloor nodule collector in 2021 at 4500m water depth  a key task ahead for GSR is a system integration test (""SIT"")  scheduled for 2025. The SIT - for which the converted ultra-deepwater vessel shall be instrumental - will entail a trial of a full-scale seafloor nodule collector and riser to lift the nodules to the surface vessel and is part of GSR's step-by-step and precautionary approach to project and technology development as the company explores the feasibility of commercial operations.""Transocean is a leader in the global offshore drilling industry and is well known for its ultra-deepwater expertise. We are proud to be working with them as we further explore the potential of deep seabed minerals  which may represent a better way of meeting future metal demand and expand diversity of supply. Critical metals  such as nickel  cobalt  copper  and manganese - found in polymetallic nodules - are key ingredients for a low-carbon future. Deep-seabed mining certainly won't replace land-based mining entirely  however  according to peer-reviewed scientific literature  these metals could be delivered with a 40% reduction of the carbon footprint  which is essential when combating climate change.""  said Kris Van Nijen  Managing Director of GSR.Chief Executive Officer Luc Vandenbulcke of DEME Group said: ""Since the International Energy Agency reported that society will need six times more metals by 2040 to become a net-zero society in 2050  there have been many national initiatives to secure the necessary supply of raw materials. From the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act  the Australian & Canadian Critical Minerals Strategy to the EU Critical Minerals Act  society is now fully aware of the geopolitical and environmental risk of the clean energy transition. As a result  the development of marine minerals has gained considerable momentum to help supply the responsible minerals needed to meet demand due to increased population  urbanization  and transition to a clean energy future and circular economy.

18285,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4577454-palm-harbour-capital-q4-2022-investor-letter,Palm Harbour Capital Q4 2022 Investor Letter,Palm Harbour Capital fund gained 9.7% gross of fees during the fourth quarter. Click here to read the full fund letter.,utah778Dear fellow investors and friends During the fourth quarter the fund gained 9.7% gross of fees[1]. We do not have a stated benchmark in our Key Investor Information Document (KIID) and therefore cannot comment on relative performance. We leave it up to you to decide. We note the above number appears in line with European benchmarks and significantly better than global benchmarks. We ended the quarter with a full year performance of -2.8% (-2.6% on a NAV basis 29 December 2022). Inception to quarter end return was 35.4% or 8.4% compounded annual return. Similarly  our last reported NAV at quarter-end was 13.39 (29/12/2022 +10.86% from the closest reported NAV at the third quarter end of 12.08 on 29/09/2022). We are extremely optimistic about our portfolio‚Äôs prospects and believe we will reach our compound return aspiration over time. Our fund‚Äôs composition is unlike any index  and we are unlikely to perform in a similar manner.The fourth quarter rhymed with the previous three quarters where the major themes remained inflation  interest rates  and recession. Similarly  our fund performed well  recovering from the previous quarter-end sell-off. However  we did suffer yet another late quarter-end sell-off  which prevented us from posting a positive year. Whilst not completely satisfied with our results (it is never pleasant to lose money if only on a mark-to-market basis rather than a permanent capital loss)  we are glad to see some sanity return to the markets. We find it disheartening that it took war and run-away inflation for central banks to even start to normalize interest rate policy (let alone their balance sheets). Our philosophy precludes us from buying the speculative momentum stocks so popular in the past few years  let alone the parade of nonsense from profitless tech stocks  mega (overpriced) IPOs  cryptos  NFTs  SPACs  and meme stocks. We are glad that these bubbles have deflated  if not yet gone away and some market participants even discuss sensible valuation again. Even high-quality stocks that were trading on nosebleed valuations have somewhat corrected. However  there is still a long way to go to bring the economy back into balance.The US stock market is merely trading around its standard long-term multiple and we have yet to see much in the way of earnings downgrades. In reality  the magnitude of the recent correction isn‚Äôt fierce: the S&P500 is where it was in 2021. Almost all bubbles have ended in a period of below average valuation where most speculators exit the market. Now  they appear merely to be on the sidelines.During the fourth quarter consumer price index measurement of inflation began to come in below expectations after several months of above expectation readings. The current narrative is that we are past peak inflation and that the long-sought ‚ÄúFed pivot‚Äù will occur in the second half of this year. That is to say that not only will the Fed not continue to increase but indeed even start to decrease the Fed funds rate. Thus  the market can go back to party mode  fueling asset price inflation (think real estate and stock market valuation multiples) and easing the pain of over-leveraged players dependent on easy money to make a profit. Many winners in the previous bubble are praying daily for this but we are skeptical.In previous letters we argued that inflation is quite complex and current inflation has many causes  some of which were temporary in nature and some that might be more permanent. For example  housing had skyrocketed on the back of record lower interest rates at the same time as there was post-Covid pent up demand (i.e.  this inflation input was almost solely caused by central banks poor timing). But with higher interest rates  the affordability of mortgages declines  and this leads to lower prices. This has started to come through in countries with adjustable mortgages  but is just beginning in those with more fixed term mortgages such as the USA (housing also is a lagging indicator in CPI). We think this is good for society. Housing should not change in value by 50% in two years (nor should single-family housing be an ‚Äúasset‚Äù traded by private equity firms - but that is another rant). Food inflation will only significantly reduce after a year or two of bumper growing seasons. Oil and gas are a function of the economy on the demand side yet supply remains constrained. As many expect a global recession and China is in the middle of a COVID reset oil has been on the back foot. We still believe there is a structural shortage after years of low capital expenditures and any economic upswing will cause significantly higher prices. We called out supply chain issues and freight to be temporary in nature and this has turned out to be mostly correct.On the other hand  corporations have learned that being completely dependent on just in time inventories  single suppliers or single countries is a bad idea. Resulting nearshoring and strengthening of supply chains requires higher working capital and this is inflationary. The green energy transition is very inflationary as we completely change the way we produce electricity  build cars  make cement  fertilizers  steel  and other inputs. The massive demand for batteries will continue to buoy many commodity prices as we replace the global fleet of cars. The monetary aspect of inflation is also far from recovering. Central bank balance sheets (Fed holds $8.6 trillion of interest-bearing assets versus <$1 trillion before Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008) remain swollen and have barely begun to unwind. This deluge of debt that must be digested by markets will keep pressure on rates unless the central banks reverse course ‚Äì which would likely lead us back to asset inflation and other significant distortions to the economy as it has for the past decade.A newer inflation topic that we are just developing a view on is wage inflation. We are incredulous that many central bankers believe they need to raise the unemployment rate to stifle inflation by causing job losses and loosening the labor market (i.e.  destroying employees current bargaining power against capital). We understand the concept of the wage inflation spiral of the 1970s (when unions were significantly stronger than they are today) but we simply do not believe we are in such a situation and the backdrop is completely different. There are many reasons to raise interest rates and keep them high but rising wages for low-paid workers so that they can eat and stay warm in winter isn‚Äôt one of them in our view. Perhaps this is a topic for another letter.Luckily  forecasting inflation that has very little to do with our investing strategy. The market‚Äôs preoccupation with the topics is a sideshow for us  however it does create volatility and volatility creates opportunities to buy high quality companies at bargain prices. We are heartened that more market participants are looking at valuation again  although for how long is anyone‚Äôs guess.Timing investments is always tricky  as noted in our previous letter we sold Brazilian credit rating agency Boa Vista as we thought an irrational player was damaging the market and we wanted some evidence that they returned to the normal behavior of an oligopoly. This proved to be ill-timed as Equifax made a bid for the company shortly after. Our other sale of the third quarter was the Greek refiner Motor Oil  which we sold after the government-imposed an irrational ‚Äúwindfall‚Äù tax on them based on their ‚Äúnormal‚Äù profitability using COVID years as the base. We were disgusted but the stock nevertheless went on to perform exceptionally during the fourth quarter.In the fourth quarter we added one significant position outlined later in this letter and two starter positions and sold our long-term holding in Ringmetall as we believed we were at peak earnings for this cycle.Our top performers of 2022 include OCI (OTC:OCINF  see our fourth quarter 2021 letter for why we thought 2022 would be great)  H&T (UK cost of living crisis) and Verallia (OTCPK:VRLAF  a new position taking advantage of the markets short-termism on energy prices and pricing power). Our top detractors were iHeartMedia (IHRT)  a levered radio and podcaster  RHI Magnesita (OTC:RMGNF)  which had a large working capital build and Esprinet  which suffered from a slowdown in IT spending in Italy.At quarter-end our portfolio had more than 117% upside to our estimated NAV and was trading at a weighted average P/E of 6x  FCF/EV yield of 20% and a return on tangible capital of 29%.Contributors Detractors Jost Werke +160 bps IHeartMedia (IHRT) -45 bps International Game Technology (IG) +141 bps [Undisclosed Position] -19 bps Verallia (OTCPK:VRLAF) +104 bps [Undisclosed Position] -17 bps RHI Magnesita (OTC:RMGNF) +101 bps Caltagirone -17 bps MTU Aero Engines (OTCPK:MTUAF) +79 bps Ibstock (OTCPK:IBJHF) -14 bps Click to enlargeThe top contributor during the fourth quarter was JOST Werke (+47% +160 bps)  the German truck and agricultural machinery supplier  which we introduced in our fourth quarter 2019 letter. JOST reported 22.8% sales growth for the first nine months which was translated into 15.4% growth in operating profits. Apparently  the company was able to compensate a weaker development in Europe  mainly due to raw materials inflation  energy costs and supply bottlenecks  with a strong operating performance in North America and Asia-Pacific. Following the strong performance  management raised its sales and earnings forecast for 2022  with sales expected to exceed the ‚Ç¨1.2 billion mark for the first time.The second largest contributor was International Game Technology (+32.3% +141 bps)  the Italian-American lottery and gaming machine technology provider  which we introduced in our first quarter 2020 letter. The Company posted a sales increase of 8% and profit contribution from all operating segments  primarily driven by global gaming. Although the margin was 2% lower versus the second quarter of 2022  it remained above the last 15 quarters average. Market concerns about the debt level should abate on improved operating performance and as the already announced disposals reduced leverage to 3.1x. It is worth noting that management hit their 2025 leverage target more than two years in advance  while returning $224 million to shareholders through midOctober 2022. Management confirmed the upper half of their fiscal year 2022 guidance which combined with an improved credit profile drove the share price higher. We still find the steady cashflows and low valuation very compelling.The third largest contributor was Verallia (+36.8% +104 bps)  a leading French glass packaging manufacturer  which we introduced in our second quarter 2022 letter. Following their second quarter guidance increase  they increase guidance again in the third quarter (Full year EBITDA guidance started at ‚Ç¨700 million and moved to ‚Ç¨750800 million after the second quarter and now sits at greater than ‚Ç¨820 million at the third quarter release) on the back of stellar earnings. They demonstrated their pricing power and highlighted the shortage of glass packaging in Europe. Furthermore  the company announced the purchase of Allied Glass in the UK  which gives them a beachhead to expand in the region. Verallia has almost fully recovered from the sell-off caused by the energy crisis and war in Ukraine but we still believe there is significant upside as its quality and growing cashflows are clearly underestimated.The fourth largest contributor was RHI Magnesita (+33.5% +101 bps)  the AustrianBrazilian refractories company  which we introduced in our second quarter 2019 letter. According to management  customer demand remains strong with price increases offsetting cost increases. Management also reported market share gains in the steel segment and stable market share in the industrial segment. Increasing net debt linked to the working capital remains a point of concern  especially given their use of working capital finance lines  but an expected cash release should normalize both over the coming quarters. Our thesis was predicated on the company having pricing power and not beholden solely to commodity prices as well as being linked to rather stable steel volumes versus highly cyclical steel pricing. Although they were a bit slow adjusting prices early on in this inflation cycle  they seem to have returned to normal margins and are maintaining them now. While we expect European steel volumes to perform poorly during this winter  other geographies such as India should partially offset this. We still believe the company is well positioned and poorly misunderstood by the market despite the stock being the largest inception to date detractor for the fund.The fifth significant contributor was MTU Aero Engines (+31.1% +79 bps)  the German aircraft engine manufacturer  which we introduced in our second quarter 2020 letter. The company reported solid third quarter earnings  held a capital markets day which surprised the market positively  brought forward the recovery to 2023 from 2024 and benefited at the end of the quarter from the Chinese government dropping its zero COVID policy which will inevitably help global air traffic.The top detractor was iHeartMedia (-24.3% -45 bps)  the American radio and podcasting company. The company is the highest levered business in our portfolio and has suffered on fears of an advertisement slowdown. Company insiders continue to buy stock in the market and the company as of yet  has not seen the drastic slow-down the market is predicting. With long debt maturities and a growing podcasting business  as well as likely interest from a major shareholder  we think the company can survive all but the harshest of recessions. If  on the other hand  there is even a couple years of moderate growth  the company could be worth many multiples of the current share price.The second largest detractor was a new undisclosed position (-5.5% -19 bps) in the fertilizer industry. We will likely discuss this position in future letters.The third largest detractor (-17 bps) was an undisclosed American furniture manufacturer. The loss is largely result of the decline in the US dollar. The company had been on our watch list for a couple of years. We seemed to have missed a decent COVID induced rally but as the stock retreated this year  a bid became public as the bidder said that the board would not engage with them and wanted to go to the shareholders. We decided to initiate a small position as we felt the company was trading at a large discount to intrinsic value and either the bidder would go hostile or the board would have to do something significant to realize value for shareholders. Quite bafflingly  the CEO has been buying stock both before the bid became public (but after the board was approached) and after the bid was made public. Time will tell  though a possible recession might push back this opportunity. We decided to build a small position.The fourth largest detractor was Caltagirone (-6.2% -17 bps)  the Italian holding company. We do not believe there was any significant news as both its major holdings Cementir and Generali reported decent earnings given the current situation. The minor loss is more likely due to the illiquidity of the stock in the illiquid month of December despite an increase in the sum-of-the-parts valuation discount.The fifth largest detractor was Ibstock (-6.9% -14 bps)  the British brick and concrete product manufacturer  which we introduced in our third quarter 2019 letter. In October2022 trading statement  the company reported trading ahead of expectations with robust demand patterns and strong operational performance supported by cost management initiatives and dynamic pricing to counter cost inflation. Management completed the share buyback program and increased full-year guidance. Despite positive update  the market remained concerned about the property market slowdown with home builders reporting drastic slowdown in bookings.LNA Sant√© (LNA FP)‚ÄúThrowing out the baby with the bathwater‚Äù whilst a clich√©  aptly describes the current share price of LNA Sant√© following a scandal at their much larger peer Orpea. Orpea‚Äôs wrongdoings and alleged wrongdoings were exposed in the book Les Fossoyeurs (The Gravediggers)  and led to a 93% share price decline during 2022 and will result in a complete financial restructuring. We believe LNA‚Äôs situation to be completely different and thus its share price reaction irrational.Le Noble Age (LNA) was established in 1990 with its first nursing home in France. Today  it is one of the leading care home operators in France  with activity in Belgium and Poland  with an authorized base of 9 996 beds. The company splits operations into Nursing Home (44% 2021 sales  5 033 operating beds  177 under transformation)  Medical & Rehabilitation  Psychiatric and Surgery (38% sales  2 688 operating  757 under transformation) and Home Care (9% Sales  580 operating  100 under transformation). On the Real Estate side  the company carries real estate assets on its balance sheet on a transitional basis until completion of a redevelopment and subsequently sells them to real estate investors. This strategy significantly differentiates the business model from that of peers Orpea and Korian. LNA‚Äôs in-house development team saves development money  allows the Group to transform the facility according to their own standards and offers them a discount on post-exit rent as they do not inflate the real estate values. Part of Orpea and Korian‚Äôs challenges  outside the book‚Äôs allegations  are their large portfolio holdings which are highly levered and whose values are being hit by higher interest rates.While optically nursing homes and medical centres shouldn‚Äôt have high barriers to entry  this is in fact not true. In France  operators are required to gain prior approval from local authorities before they can build  open  or operate a new nursing home. Since 2012  regulators in France have authorized  extensions aside  very few openings of new nursing homes. Authorizing new licenses simply increases state‚Äôs healthcare budget  since the government covers the salary cost of medical professionals and parts of other costs such as medical equipment. The existing regulatory framework offers a growth avenue through acquisition of existing licenses  small private or state-owned  while it protects incumbents from new entrants through blocking an at-scale new entrant. The state is also incentivized to sell existing licenses to private operators since that reduces the healthcare budget and improves the quality of services.While LNA looks like another levered nursing home operator  we don‚Äôt believe that the company faces the same credit risks as Orpea or Korian. In this case  real estate debt relates to properties bought for refurbishment and only stays for a short period of time on the balance sheet. Aside from that  the operating business is <2.0x levered. Management agrees and is buying back stock in the market. Regulatory risk is also less of a concern for LNA and management welcomed changes as they believe that any increase will allow the company to compete more efficiently and reduce budgeting discrepancies versus peers. Industry-wide staff shortages are a challenge for all operators. However  LNA‚Äôs reputation allows them to attract trained staff ahead of competition. Finally  inflation adjusted state funding  tariff renegotiations and minimal (<3% of sales and currently hedged) energy exposure will allow the company to navigate through inflationary headwinds.Whilst LNA Sant√© may face stricter regulation and some higher costs  we do not believe this justifies the 41% fall in the share price during 2022. The company is family owned and operated and we believe to be of significantly higher quality (and have more integrity) than their larger peers evidenced by occupancy rate recovery post-Covid and post-scandal (versus Orpea‚Äôs and Korian  which have not recovered to pre-Covid levels). Trading at a free cash flow yield of above 12% on 2024 numbers with a strong pipeline of additional beds and a demographic tailwind (ageing population)  we think the market will slowly recognize the value once the Orpea restructuring is past us and a few quarters of continued earnings resilience are achieved.As stated in our previous letter  we are currently not charging a management fee until the fund reaches a larger size. The founder‚Äôs class management fee will then be only 1% of assets. We do not charge entry or exit commissions despite our KIID saying it is theoretically possible.Our focus is and remains on the portfolio  but we do need to grow our assets to a sustainable level.

Click here to read the full fund letter.,utah778Dear fellow investors and friends During the fourth quarter the fund gained 9.7% gross of fees[1]. We do not have a stated benchmark in our Key Investor Information Document (KIID) and therefore cannot comment on relative performance. We leave it up to you to decide. We note the above number appears in line with European benchmarks and significantly better than global benchmarks. We ended the quarter with a full year performance of -2.8% (-2.6% on a NAV basis 29 December 2022). Inception to quarter end return was 35.4% or 8.4% compounded annual return. Similarly  our last reported NAV at quarter-end was 13.39 (29/12/2022 +10.86% from the closest reported NAV at the third quarter end of 12.08 on 29/09/2022). We are extremely optimistic about our portfolio‚Äôs prospects and believe we will reach our compound return aspiration over time. Our fund‚Äôs composition is unlike any index  and we are unlikely to perform in a similar manner.The fourth quarter rhymed with the previous three quarters where the major themes remained inflation  interest rates  and recession. Similarly  our fund performed well  recovering from the previous quarter-end sell-off. However  we did suffer yet another late quarter-end sell-off  which prevented us from posting a positive year. Whilst not completely satisfied with our results (it is never pleasant to lose money if only on a mark-to-market basis rather than a permanent capital loss)  we are glad to see some sanity return to the markets. We find it disheartening that it took war and run-away inflation for central banks to even start to normalize interest rate policy (let alone their balance sheets). Our philosophy precludes us from buying the speculative momentum stocks so popular in the past few years  let alone the parade of nonsense from profitless tech stocks  mega (overpriced) IPOs  cryptos  NFTs  SPACs  and meme stocks. We are glad that these bubbles have deflated  if not yet gone away and some market participants even discuss sensible valuation again. Even high-quality stocks that were trading on nosebleed valuations have somewhat corrected. However  there is still a long way to go to bring the economy back into balance.The US stock market is merely trading around its standard long-term multiple and we have yet to see much in the way of earnings downgrades. In reality  the magnitude of the recent correction isn‚Äôt fierce: the S&P500 is where it was in 2021. Almost all bubbles have ended in a period of below average valuation where most speculators exit the market. Now  they appear merely to be on the sidelines.During the fourth quarter consumer price index measurement of inflation began to come in below expectations after several months of above expectation readings. The current narrative is that we are past peak inflation and that the long-sought ‚ÄúFed pivot‚Äù will occur in the second half of this year. That is to say that not only will the Fed not continue to increase but indeed even start to decrease the Fed funds rate. Thus  the market can go back to party mode  fueling asset price inflation (think real estate and stock market valuation multiples) and easing the pain of over-leveraged players dependent on easy money to make a profit. Many winners in the previous bubble are praying daily for this but we are skeptical.In previous letters we argued that inflation is quite complex and current inflation has many causes  some of which were temporary in nature and some that might be more permanent. For example  housing had skyrocketed on the back of record lower interest rates at the same time as there was post-Covid pent up demand (i.e.  this inflation input was almost solely caused by central banks poor timing). But with higher interest rates  the affordability of mortgages declines  and this leads to lower prices. This has started to come through in countries with adjustable mortgages  but is just beginning in those with more fixed term mortgages such as the USA (housing also is a lagging indicator in CPI). We think this is good for society. Housing should not change in value by 50% in two years (nor should single-family housing be an ‚Äúasset‚Äù traded by private equity firms - but that is another rant). Food inflation will only significantly reduce after a year or two of bumper growing seasons. Oil and gas are a function of the economy on the demand side yet supply remains constrained. As many expect a global recession and China is in the middle of a COVID reset oil has been on the back foot. We still believe there is a structural shortage after years of low capital expenditures and any economic upswing will cause significantly higher prices. We called out supply chain issues and freight to be temporary in nature and this has turned out to be mostly correct.On the other hand  corporations have learned that being completely dependent on just in time inventories  single suppliers or single countries is a bad idea. Resulting nearshoring and strengthening of supply chains requires higher working capital and this is inflationary. The green energy transition is very inflationary as we completely change the way we produce electricity  build cars  make cement  fertilizers  steel  and other inputs. The massive demand for batteries will continue to buoy many commodity prices as we replace the global fleet of cars. The monetary aspect of inflation is also far from recovering. Central bank balance sheets (Fed holds $8.6 trillion of interest-bearing assets versus <$1 trillion before Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008) remain swollen and have barely begun to unwind. This deluge of debt that must be digested by markets will keep pressure on rates unless the central banks reverse course ‚Äì which would likely lead us back to asset inflation and other significant distortions to the economy as it has for the past decade.A newer inflation topic that we are just developing a view on is wage inflation. We are incredulous that many central bankers believe they need to raise the unemployment rate to stifle inflation by causing job losses and loosening the labor market (i.e.  destroying employees current bargaining power against capital). We understand the concept of the wage inflation spiral of the 1970s (when unions were significantly stronger than they are today) but we simply do not believe we are in such a situation and the backdrop is completely different. There are many reasons to raise interest rates and keep them high but rising wages for low-paid workers so that they can eat and stay warm in winter isn‚Äôt one of them in our view. Perhaps this is a topic for another letter.Luckily  forecasting inflation that has very little to do with our investing strategy. The market‚Äôs preoccupation with the topics is a sideshow for us  however it does create volatility and volatility creates opportunities to buy high quality companies at bargain prices. We are heartened that more market participants are looking at valuation again  although for how long is anyone‚Äôs guess.Timing investments is always tricky  as noted in our previous letter we sold Brazilian credit rating agency Boa Vista as we thought an irrational player was damaging the market and we wanted some evidence that they returned to the normal behavior of an oligopoly. This proved to be ill-timed as Equifax made a bid for the company shortly after. Our other sale of the third quarter was the Greek refiner Motor Oil  which we sold after the government-imposed an irrational ‚Äúwindfall‚Äù tax on them based on their ‚Äúnormal‚Äù profitability using COVID years as the base. We were disgusted but the stock nevertheless went on to perform exceptionally during the fourth quarter.In the fourth quarter we added one significant position outlined later in this letter and two starter positions and sold our long-term holding in Ringmetall as we believed we were at peak earnings for this cycle.Our top performers of 2022 include OCI (OTC:OCINF  see our fourth quarter 2021 letter for why we thought 2022 would be great)  H&T (UK cost of living crisis) and Verallia (OTCPK:VRLAF  a new position taking advantage of the markets short-termism on energy prices and pricing power). Our top detractors were iHeartMedia (IHRT)  a levered radio and podcaster  RHI Magnesita (OTC:RMGNF)  which had a large working capital build and Esprinet  which suffered from a slowdown in IT spending in Italy.At quarter-end our portfolio had more than 117% upside to our estimated NAV and was trading at a weighted average P/E of 6x  FCF/EV yield of 20% and a return on tangible capital of 29%.Contributors Detractors Jost Werke +160 bps IHeartMedia (IHRT) -45 bps International Game Technology (IG) +141 bps [Undisclosed Position] -19 bps Verallia (OTCPK:VRLAF) +104 bps [Undisclosed Position] -17 bps RHI Magnesita (OTC:RMGNF) +101 bps Caltagirone -17 bps MTU Aero Engines (OTCPK:MTUAF) +79 bps Ibstock (OTCPK:IBJHF) -14 bps Click to enlargeThe top contributor during the fourth quarter was JOST Werke (+47% +160 bps)  the German truck and agricultural machinery supplier  which we introduced in our fourth quarter 2019 letter. JOST reported 22.8% sales growth for the first nine months which was translated into 15.4% growth in operating profits. Apparently  the company was able to compensate a weaker development in Europe  mainly due to raw materials inflation  energy costs and supply bottlenecks  with a strong operating performance in North America and Asia-Pacific. Following the strong performance  management raised its sales and earnings forecast for 2022  with sales expected to exceed the ‚Ç¨1.2 billion mark for the first time.The second largest contributor was International Game Technology (+32.3% +141 bps)  the Italian-American lottery and gaming machine technology provider  which we introduced in our first quarter 2020 letter. The Company posted a sales increase of 8% and profit contribution from all operating segments  primarily driven by global gaming. Although the margin was 2% lower versus the second quarter of 2022  it remained above the last 15 quarters average. Market concerns about the debt level should abate on improved operating performance and as the already announced disposals reduced leverage to 3.1x. It is worth noting that management hit their 2025 leverage target more than two years in advance  while returning $224 million to shareholders through midOctober 2022. Management confirmed the upper half of their fiscal year 2022 guidance which combined with an improved credit profile drove the share price higher. We still find the steady cashflows and low valuation very compelling.The third largest contributor was Verallia (+36.8% +104 bps)  a leading French glass packaging manufacturer  which we introduced in our second quarter 2022 letter. Following their second quarter guidance increase  they increase guidance again in the third quarter (Full year EBITDA guidance started at ‚Ç¨700 million and moved to ‚Ç¨750800 million after the second quarter and now sits at greater than ‚Ç¨820 million at the third quarter release) on the back of stellar earnings. They demonstrated their pricing power and highlighted the shortage of glass packaging in Europe. Furthermore  the company announced the purchase of Allied Glass in the UK  which gives them a beachhead to expand in the region. Verallia has almost fully recovered from the sell-off caused by the energy crisis and war in Ukraine but we still believe there is significant upside as its quality and growing cashflows are clearly underestimated.The fourth largest contributor was RHI Magnesita (+33.5% +101 bps)  the AustrianBrazilian refractories company  which we introduced in our second quarter 2019 letter. According to management  customer demand remains strong with price increases offsetting cost increases. Management also reported market share gains in the steel segment and stable market share in the industrial segment. Increasing net debt linked to the working capital remains a point of concern  especially given their use of working capital finance lines  but an expected cash release should normalize both over the coming quarters. Our thesis was predicated on the company having pricing power and not beholden solely to commodity prices as well as being linked to rather stable steel volumes versus highly cyclical steel pricing. Although they were a bit slow adjusting prices early on in this inflation cycle  they seem to have returned to normal margins and are maintaining them now. While we expect European steel volumes to perform poorly during this winter  other geographies such as India should partially offset this. We still believe the company is well positioned and poorly misunderstood by the market despite the stock being the largest inception to date detractor for the fund.The fifth significant contributor was MTU Aero Engines (+31.1% +79 bps)  the German aircraft engine manufacturer  which we introduced in our second quarter 2020 letter. The company reported solid third quarter earnings  held a capital markets day which surprised the market positively  brought forward the recovery to 2023 from 2024 and benefited at the end of the quarter from the Chinese government dropping its zero COVID policy which will inevitably help global air traffic.The top detractor was iHeartMedia (-24.3% -45 bps)  the American radio and podcasting company. The company is the highest levered business in our portfolio and has suffered on fears of an advertisement slowdown. Company insiders continue to buy stock in the market and the company as of yet  has not seen the drastic slow-down the market is predicting. With long debt maturities and a growing podcasting business  as well as likely interest from a major shareholder  we think the company can survive all but the harshest of recessions. If  on the other hand  there is even a couple years of moderate growth  the company could be worth many multiples of the current share price.The second largest detractor was a new undisclosed position (-5.5% -19 bps) in the fertilizer industry. We will likely discuss this position in future letters.The third largest detractor (-17 bps) was an undisclosed American furniture manufacturer. The loss is largely result of the decline in the US dollar. The company had been on our watch list for a couple of years. We seemed to have missed a decent COVID induced rally but as the stock retreated this year  a bid became public as the bidder said that the board would not engage with them and wanted to go to the shareholders. We decided to initiate a small position as we felt the company was trading at a large discount to intrinsic value and either the bidder would go hostile or the board would have to do something significant to realize value for shareholders. Quite bafflingly  the CEO has been buying stock both before the bid became public (but after the board was approached) and after the bid was made public. Time will tell  though a possible recession might push back this opportunity. We decided to build a small position.The fourth largest detractor was Caltagirone (-6.2% -17 bps)  the Italian holding company. We do not believe there was any significant news as both its major holdings Cementir and Generali reported decent earnings given the current situation. The minor loss is more likely due to the illiquidity of the stock in the illiquid month of December despite an increase in the sum-of-the-parts valuation discount.The fifth largest detractor was Ibstock (-6.9% -14 bps)  the British brick and concrete product manufacturer  which we introduced in our third quarter 2019 letter. In October2022 trading statement  the company reported trading ahead of expectations with robust demand patterns and strong operational performance supported by cost management initiatives and dynamic pricing to counter cost inflation. Management completed the share buyback program and increased full-year guidance. Despite positive update  the market remained concerned about the property market slowdown with home builders reporting drastic slowdown in bookings.LNA Sant√© (LNA FP)‚ÄúThrowing out the baby with the bathwater‚Äù whilst a clich√©  aptly describes the current share price of LNA Sant√© following a scandal at their much larger peer Orpea. Orpea‚Äôs wrongdoings and alleged wrongdoings were exposed in the book Les Fossoyeurs (The Gravediggers)  and led to a 93% share price decline during 2022 and will result in a complete financial restructuring. We believe LNA‚Äôs situation to be completely different and thus its share price reaction irrational.Le Noble Age (LNA) was established in 1990 with its first nursing home in France. Today  it is one of the leading care home operators in France  with activity in Belgium and Poland  with an authorized base of 9 996 beds. The company splits operations into Nursing Home (44% 2021 sales  5 033 operating beds  177 under transformation)  Medical & Rehabilitation  Psychiatric and Surgery (38% sales  2 688 operating  757 under transformation) and Home Care (9% Sales  580 operating  100 under transformation). On the Real Estate side  the company carries real estate assets on its balance sheet on a transitional basis until completion of a redevelopment and subsequently sells them to real estate investors. This strategy significantly differentiates the business model from that of peers Orpea and Korian. LNA‚Äôs in-house development team saves development money  allows the Group to transform the facility according to their own standards and offers them a discount on post-exit rent as they do not inflate the real estate values. Part of Orpea and Korian‚Äôs challenges  outside the book‚Äôs allegations  are their large portfolio holdings which are highly levered and whose values are being hit by higher interest rates.While optically nursing homes and medical centres shouldn‚Äôt have high barriers to entry  this is in fact not true. In France  operators are required to gain prior approval from local authorities before they can build  open  or operate a new nursing home. Since 2012  regulators in France have authorized  extensions aside  very few openings of new nursing homes. Authorizing new licenses simply increases state‚Äôs healthcare budget  since the government covers the salary cost of medical professionals and parts of other costs such as medical equipment. The existing regulatory framework offers a growth avenue through acquisition of existing licenses  small private or state-owned  while it protects incumbents from new entrants through blocking an at-scale new entrant. The state is also incentivized to sell existing licenses to private operators since that reduces the healthcare budget and improves the quality of services.While LNA looks like another levered nursing home operator  we don‚Äôt believe that the company faces the same credit risks as Orpea or Korian. In this case  real estate debt relates to properties bought for refurbishment and only stays for a short period of time on the balance sheet. Aside from that  the operating business is <2.0x levered. Management agrees and is buying back stock in the market. Regulatory risk is also less of a concern for LNA and management welcomed changes as they believe that any increase will allow the company to compete more efficiently and reduce budgeting discrepancies versus peers. Industry-wide staff shortages are a challenge for all operators. However  LNA‚Äôs reputation allows them to attract trained staff ahead of competition. Finally  inflation adjusted state funding  tariff renegotiations and minimal (<3% of sales and currently hedged) energy exposure will allow the company to navigate through inflationary headwinds.Whilst LNA Sant√© may face stricter regulation and some higher costs  we do not believe this justifies the 41% fall in the share price during 2022. The company is family owned and operated and we believe to be of significantly higher quality (and have more integrity) than their larger peers evidenced by occupancy rate recovery post-Covid and post-scandal (versus Orpea‚Äôs and Korian  which have not recovered to pre-Covid levels). Trading at a free cash flow yield of above 12% on 2024 numbers with a strong pipeline of additional beds and a demographic tailwind (ageing population)  we think the market will slowly recognize the value once the Orpea restructuring is past us and a few quarters of continued earnings resilience are achieved.As stated in our previous letter  we are currently not charging a management fee until the fund reaches a larger size. The founder‚Äôs class management fee will then be only 1% of assets. We do not charge entry or exit commissions despite our KIID saying it is theoretically possible.Our focus is and remains on the portfolio  but we do need to grow our assets to a sustainable level.

The mood at the start of the year was expectant in terms of the ending of the COVID-19 pandemic of the past two years and the lifting of the restrictions  and the year began with strong economic growth. However  Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine in February  created a new kind of uncertainty in the world and the war resulted in human suffering.The war‚Äôs impacts could been seen in our operating environment as economic uncertainty  rising energy prices and interest rates and high inflation. These multiplier effects showed in SATO‚Äôs business operations during the reporting year. We have approximately 25 000 homes in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku. In addition  SATO has 522 apartments in St. Petersburg  which make up approximately one per cent of the value of our investment assets. Since the start of the war in Ukraine  we have been reviewing opportunities to withdraw from the Russian business operations and we are searching actively for a solution.Story continuesDespite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental apartments in Finland  and the urbanisation trend continues. The rise in mortgage interest rates coupled with the increase in energy and other costs had a partial impact on the growth in rental apartment demand. Now  also some of the people looking for an owner-occupied apartment may consider renting an apartment.The competition between rental housing providers is tough and a large number of new rental apartments has been built especially in the Helsinki metropolitan area in recent years. The historically high rate of housing construction is slowing. There are significantly fewer housing starts than before  but a large number of new apartments will be completed in 2023. This will maintain the tight competition for good tenants and keep rent increases moderate  despite the pressure for rent to increase in the future due to the rising cost level.During the reporting year  our investments in rental apartments were EUR 190.5 million (167.1). In 2022  we completed 191 rental apartments and 52 FlexHomes. On 31 December 2022  a total of 1 418 apartments were under construction. During the second half of the reporting year  we made a decision to refrain from launching any new construction projects. Our decision was based on the dramatic rise in the cost level for construction and property maintenance and the increase in financing costs  while rent development remained moderate due to the market situation.During the first half of the year  we made a decision to launch new non-subsidised rental apartment construction projects in Rykmentinpuisto in Tuusula  Skanssi in Turku and Finnoo in Espoo. The Rykmentinpuisto project is our first new apartment investment in Tuusula in 15 years and the Skanssi project is the first new apartment investment in Turku in five years.In April of the reporting year  we sold 2 009 rental apartments mainly in the Lahti  Jyv√§skyl√§ and Oulu areas to the Swedish investment company Heimstaden. The sale was consistent with our strategy of focusing our apartment investments on the Helsinki metropolitan area and its commuting area along the main railway  and in Tampere and Turku and their surrounding municipalities.We continued to develop the customer experience at SATO during the year. The economic occupancy rate improved compared to the previous year and was 95.2% (94.9). Our tenant turnover for the reporting year fell and our customer satisfaction improved. We clarified and simplified the processes and operating models related to the customer experience and focused especially on building a harmonised and seamless service experience. In addition to developing digital services  we invested in our presence near to the customers.During the reporting year  we continued our sustainability work and released our sustainability programme for 2023‚àí2026  our second ever. The themes of the sustainability programme are sustainable housing  thriving communities and sustainable profitability. Our vision is to be a leader in sustainable rental housing. In our own sustainability goals  we have committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).Last autumn  SATO became the first rental housing provider to join the Ostavastuullisesti.fi service  which provides sustainable service and products and tips for sustainable living. A sustainability panel consisting of outside experts in sustainable production and consumption selected six of SATO‚Äôs buildings: Lupajantie 2 in Mellunkyl√§  Helsinki; Jokiniityntie 28 in Kirkkonummi; Lincolninaukio 4 in Keimola  Vantaa; Kotkatie 6 in Espoo and Jokiniementie 46 and 48 in Ver√§j√§m√§ki  Helsinki to be featured on the website as more sustainable options. We also participated in Rakli‚Äôs Green Homes activities (which started up in 2022)  with altogether 1 100 Green Homes which had either geothermal heat or consumption-based water invoicing or both.During the reporting year  we focused on supporting the well-being of SATO personnel and encouraged SATO employees to learn and grow continually. Our goal is for each person to be able to come up with ideas in their work and develop solutions for future rental housing. We want for everyone at SATO to have the courage to reinvent themselves and the ability to succeed. During the year  the entire organisation adopted the objectives and key results (OKR) model with which we are working towards better setting of objectives  closer monitoring of results and openness. The constantly increasing complexity in the operating environment challenges both experts‚Äô and supervisors‚Äô competence and thinking. In order to provide support to this end  we launched supervisor training in the coaching management style during the reporting year.I wish to thank all SATO employees for their committed and excellent work. I also wish to thank our partners and the residents of our SATOhomes for their good co-operation during the past year.Report of the Board of DirectorsReport of the Board of Directors 1 January‚Äì31 December 2022Operating environmentThe year 2022 began with strong economic growth. Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine in February of the reporting year brought uncertainty to the economic outlook  dramatically raising the price of energy and accelerating inflation. The exceptionally high inflation forced the central banks to react by rapidly hiking interest rates. During the reporting year  the ECB raised its key interest rate four times after the summer and it was 2.50% at the end of 2022. Due to the high inflation  interest rate hikes are expected to continue in early 2023. Inflation is anticipated to stabilise during 2023.Employment development was strong in early 2022  but slowed down towards year-end due to economic challenges. During the reporting year  consumers‚Äô confidence weakened to a historically low level after the start of the year  which showed in private consumption. According to the projection made by the Bank of Finland on 16 December 2022  Finland‚Äôs economic growth in 2022 will be 1.9 % due to the good start to the year. In 2023  the increase in energy prices and the cost of living is predicted to cause the economy to slide into a slight downturn and shrink by 0.5%.Uncertainty and rising interest rates are slowing housing sales. According to the statistics released by the Central Federation of Finnish Real Estate Agencies in December 2022  sales volumes of new and old apartments clearly fell in November compared to the five-year average. According to Statistics Finland‚Äôs preliminary data in December  the prices of old owner-occupied apartments fell in November 2022 in the whole of Finland by 3.4% compared to November of the previous year.The economic situation will decelerate the historically high rate of construction. The number of issued building permits began to fall already in 2021  but plenty of new apartments were and will be completed in 2022 and 2023  which is maintaining tight competition for good tenants and keeping rent increases moderate. The increased cost level resulting from inflation does  however  create pressure to increase rents in the future.The lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and improving employment resulted in a positive turnaround in internal migration to large growth centres in 2022 and demand for rental apartments has begun to grow. This  and SATO‚Äôs investments in making renting more efficient and improving customer service  were visible as an increase in SATO‚Äôs occupancy rate. Also  economic uncertainty  upward pressure on interest rates and increasing consumer prices contributed to the increase in the demand for rental apartments.Despite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental apartments  and the urbanisation trend continues. Dense urban living near services and along good public transport connections is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. The Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy strong growth  while according to Statistics Finland‚Äôs population projection  Finland‚Äôs population will start declining in 2031. The Helsinki metropolitan area is expected to grow by over 200 000 new residents by 2040. Close to 80% of the area‚Äôs residents already live in one- to two-person households  and the number of small households continues to rise. The proportion of immigrants living in the capital area is predicted to grow from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. Aging populations typically move closer to growth centres and the services they offer  and they increasingly expect housing-related services.The change in the population structure and urbanisation create a stable foundation for demand for rental housing especially in the capital area and in Tampere and Turku. Outside of growth centres  the real prices of homes are declining  which makes acquiring an owner-occupied apartment in growth centres even more challenging for people coming from those areas.StrategyCustomer experience  sustainability and sustainable housing  and SATO employees lie at the core of SATO‚Äôs strategy. We want to be closely involved in our customers‚Äô daily lives in order to serve them in the best possible way. We build homes that stand the test of time and we take care of them in line with the life-cycle principles. We enable sustainable housing for our residents and encourage them to make sustainable choices in their daily lives. We want all SATO employees to be able to contribute ideas and participate in developing future housing solutions.SATO is a housing investment company whose basic product is a rental apartment in an apartment building. We focus our investments on growth centres: the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku  because in these areas demand for apartments is the highest and the increase in value is expected to be stable over the longer term. Our operations are geared towards profitable growth.During the reporting year  our strategy implementation focused especially on developing the customer experience  improving customer satisfaction and retention  and ensuring an excellent moving-in experience. We prepared a sustainability programme for 2023‚Äì2026  which is based on feedback from our stakeholders  such as personnel  customers and partners. The themes of the sustainability programme are sustainable housing  thriving communities and sustainable profitability. In our own sustainability goals  we have committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). With regard to our personnel  we focused on supporting work well-being and developing an inspiring employee experience  competence and a coaching management style.SATO has set maintaining its investment grade credit rating as a strategic goal. Our return on equity target is 8%. In addition  our strategic goal is to achieve a continuously improving Net Promoter Score (NPS) from our residents.According to SATO‚Äôs dividend policy  a maximum of 40% of the cash flow from operations will be paid in annual dividends  depending on the market situation  investment level  the development of the equity ratio and the solvency ratio.Net sales and profitIn 2022  consolidated net sales were EUR 291.2 million (298.3).Operating profit was EUR 198.9 million (304.5). The operating profit without the fair value change of investment properties was EUR 213.8 million (175.4). The change in fair value was EUR -14.9 million (129.1).Net financing costs totalled EUR -47.0 million (-45.1).Profit before taxes was EUR 151.9 million (259.4). Cash flow from operations (free cash flow after taxes excluding changes in fair value) amounted to EUR 141.3 million (107.9).Earnings per share were EUR 2.13 (3.64).Financial position and financingThe consolidated balance sheet totalled EUR 5 184.7 million (5 091.4) at the end of December. Equity was EUR 2 480.9 million (2 351.3). Equity per share was EUR 43.82 (41.53).The Group‚Äôs equity ratio was 47.8% (46.2) at the end of the year. EUR 137.3 million in new long-term financing was withdrawn and the solvency ratio was 40.7% (42.5) at the end of December.The Group‚Äôs return on equity was 5.0% (9.1). Return on invested capital was 4.3% (6.7).Cash and cash equivalents at the end of December totalled EUR 60.5 million (8.5). Interest-bearing liabilities at the end of December totalled EUR 2 145.7 million (2 169.5)  of which loans subject to market terms accounted for EUR 1 991.3 million (1 994.5). The loan itemisation is in note 26 of the financial statements. At the end of the reporting year  the average loan interest rate was 2.3% (1.7). Net financing costs totalled EUR -47.0 million(-45.1). The average maturity of loans was 3.3 years (4.0).The calculated impact of changes in the market value of interest hedging on equity was EUR 48.1 million (15.1). During the reporting year  SATO increased the proportion of unsecured loans to 88.1% of all loans. At the end of the year  the proportion of unencumbered assets was 89.2% of the balance sheet.Group structureSATO Corporation is the parent company of SATO Group. At the end of the reporting year  the parent company had a total of 21 subsidiaries engaged in business operations (23). Mergers took place during the year in order to clarify the Group structure.SATO Corporation‚Äôs majority shareholder is Balder Finska Otas AB  whose parent company is Fastighets AB Balder  which is quoted on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.Housing businessOur housing business includes rental activities  customer service  lifecycle management and maintenance. Effective rental activities and digital services provide home-seekers with quick access to a home  and the Group with a steadily increasing cash flow. High-quality maintenance operations ensure the comfort of residents and that the apartments stay in good condition and maintain their value. We serve our customers in daily housing issues through our customer-oriented service organisation.The competition between rental housing providers has become tighter  as a large volume of new rental apartments have been built in growth centres  especially in the Helsinki metropolitan area  in recent years. Tenants now have a wide array of choices and a successful customer experience is more important than ever. We try to respond to this challenge by adjusting the organisation and our service processes. We want to be closely involved in our customers‚Äô daily lives in order to serve them in the best possible way.During the reporting year we expanded the house expert model further in the Helsinki metropolitan area. At the end of the year  SATO employed 62 house experts and the model is now in use to its full extent in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku. The house experts take care of the technical building work on homes and buildings. The purpose of our house expert operating model is to create a better customer experience and more efficient maintenance.SATO had approximately 45 000 customers at the end of the reporting year. We measure our successes in customer encounters using the Net Promoter Score (NPS). Our customer satisfaction improved during the reporting year. We clarified and simplified the processes and operating models related to the customer experience and focused especially on building a harmonised and seamless service experience. We invested in developing digital services  as well as our presence near to the customers. We also established closer collaboration between SATO employees working at our residents‚Äô buildings and improved internal communications.The economic occupancy rate improved compared to the previous year and was 95.2% (94.9) on average in Finland. The external tenant turnover rate for rental apartments was 28.4% (31.2). Rental income decreased 2.4% and was EUR 291.2 million (298.3).The average monthly rent of SATO‚Äôs rental apartments in Finland at the end of the reporting year was EUR 17.84 per m2 (17.46).Net rental income for apartments was EUR 200.4 million (210.6).Investment propertiesOn 31 December 2022  SATO owned a total of 24 999 apartments (26 791). Altogether 191 rental apartments were completed and 1 was acquired. The total number of divested rental apartments was 2 021  of which 2 009 rental apartments were sold to the Swedish investment company Heimstaden.Fair valueThe development of the value of rental apartments is a key factor for SATO. The housing stock is focussed on areas and apartment sizes that are expected to grow in demand in the long term. The allocation of building repairs is based on life-cycle plans and repair need specifications.The fair value of investment properties at the end of December totalled EUR 5 044.2 million (5 032.8). The change in the value of investment properties  including investments and divestments in the financial year  was EUR 11.4 million (279.3).The external expert JLL Finland Oy (JLL) issues a biannual statement on the valuation methods applied by SATO  the appropriateness of sources of information used and the quality and credibility of the valuation for Finnish investment properties. JLL‚Äôs latest statement was issued on the valuation carried out on 31 December 2022. The criteria for the determination of the fair value are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.The change in value was influenced by the increase in yield requirements and the decrease in the fair value of St. Petersburg housing assets.At the end of the year  the Helsinki metropolitan area‚Äôs commuting area accounted for 87.3%  Tampere for 6.4% and Turku for 5.1%  and St. Petersburg for roughly 1.2% of the value of apartments.Investments  divestments and property developmentInvestment activities are used to manage the housing portfolio and prepare the ground for growth. SATO‚Äôs investments in the 2000s in non-subsidised rental apartments total more than EUR 3 billion. SATO acquires and builds entire rental buildings and single rental apartments. Property development allows for new investments in rental apartments in Finland. The rental potential and value of rental apartments owned by SATO are developed through renovation activities.Investments in rental apartments were EUR 190.5 million (167.1). Investments in the Helsinki metropolitan area represented 84.0% of all investments in the reporting year. Investments in new apartments represented 57.1% of the investments. In addition  on 31 December 2022  binding purchase agreements in Finland totalled EUR 114.3 million (96.8).During the reporting year  2 021 rental apartments (26) were divested in Finland. Their total value was EUR 210.6 million (7.9). In April of the reporting year  we sold 2 009 rental apartments mainly in the Lahti  Jyv√§skyl√§ and Oulu areas to the Swedish investment company Heimstaden. The sale was consistent with our strategy based on which SATO is focusing its apartment investments on the Helsinki metropolitan area and its commuting area along the main railway  and in Tampere and Turku and their surrounding municipalities.The book value of plot reserves totalled EUR 40.8 million (43.4) at the end of December. The value of new plots acquired by the end of December totalled EUR 18.4 million (15.5).The permitted building volume for about 1 450 apartments is being developed for the plots in the company‚Äôs housing portfolio. This allows SATO to utilise existing infrastructure  create a denser urban structure and thus bring more customers closer to services and public transport connections.We collaborate with cities when areas are being developed and new housing is planned for them. As a long-term owner  housing investor and housing provider  SATO wants to build nice homes  residential areas and pleasant urban areas for decades to come. During the reporting year  we continued the development of the Hakunila area in Vantaa and Finnoo in Espoo  for example. In Helsinki  we were involved in planning the Mellunpuisto project in Mellunkyl√§ and we continued our collaboration with VR to develop the area it owns in Ilmala. During the reporting year  plots in complementary planning areas developed by SATO were sold to construction companies and other partners  enabling the construction of approximately 175‚àí200 owner-occupied apartments and roughly 25 state-subsidised rental apartments  thus promoting a diverse residential area and urban structure.In May 2022  construction of non-subsidised rental apartments began in Rykmentinpuisto in Tuusula. The area is a collaboration by several parties and the area will include different types of housing. SATO is building 92 non-subsidised rental apartments in the area. The Rykmentinpuisto Pataljoonantie project is SATO‚Äôs first new apartment investment in Tuusula in more than 15 years.In August 2022  SATO signed a deed to buy from Lujatalo an apartment building which is being built in Skanssi  Turku. The eight-storey building under construction at the address Sorakatu 9 will have 77 new rental apartments. This is SATO‚Äôs first new apartment investment in Turku in five years. Construction was begun in August 2022 and the apartments will be ready for residents at the end of 2023.We are building 257 new rental apartments at Peijinkuja in Finnoo  Espoo. Construction began in August 2022 and the apartments will be completed in stages during autumn 2024. The project is based on long-term development work in which we drew up a new local plan with the City of Espoo for a property that SATO owns in the old low-rise area of Hannus  which formerly featured terraced houses. The area is being transformed into a new area called Finnoo. SATO‚Äôs goal is to continue developing the Finnoo area in the future.During the reporting year  new rental apartments were finished on Lupajantie in Mellunm√§ki  Helsinki and on Jokiniityntie in Kirkkonummi.Due to rising construction  maintenance and financing costs and the moderate rent development resulting from the competitive situation  we made a decision to refrain from launching new construction projects and we are postponing their launch.In 2022  we completed 191 rental apartments (235) and 0 owner-occupied apartments (71) and 52 FlexHomes (0) in Finland. On 31 December 2022  a total of 1 418 apartments (1 152) were under construction: 1 418 rental apartments (1 100) and 0 owner-occupied apartments (0) and 0 FlexHomes (52). FlexHome is a short-term ownership concept that enables home ownership with a small initial capital outlay and which the resident can purchase entirely for themselves within five years of completion.A total of EUR 92.4 million (93.6) was spent on repairing and upgrading apartments.At the end of December  SATO owned 522 apartments (525) in St. Petersburg. The economic occupancy rate of rental apartments in St. Petersburg was 92.4% (97.7) on average. Since the start of the war in Ukraine  we have been reviewing opportunities to withdraw from the Russian business operations. Based on our studies  a fast withdrawal is not possible. For this reason  SATO will continue to rent residential apartments in St. Petersburg until a way to withdraw has been found. The company is actively seeking a solution.SustainabilityOur sustainability work during the reporting year was guided by SATO‚Äôs strategy and our sustainability programme for 2019‚Äì2022  which emphasised carbon-neutral cities and the well-being of residents and neighbourhoods.Due to the energy crisis resulting from the war in Ukraine  we increased the efficiency of our energy saving measures and paid more attention to the temperatures of apartments than earlier. We monitor and regulate the heating of some 21 000 SATOhomes using AI. Our goal is to maintain a temperature of approximately 21 degrees in SATOhomes  which is a healthy and energy-efficient indoor temperature. In addition to our own energy saving measures  we actively provided our residents with guidance on energy saving opportunities in their day-to-day lives. At the end of the year  we provided our residents with instructions on how to prepare for possible blackouts in the exceptional energy situation.During the reporting year  we launched a development project related to waste and sorting  in which we surveyed our homes‚Äô waste-collection points and inspected their lighting  the number of waste bins and signage. Based on the survey  we targeted repairs at the sites that needed them and they will continue in upcoming years. Our housing advisors‚Äô tours focused on waste guidance during the year. We pilot tested a clothing collection point on Kauppakartanonkatu in Helsinki‚Äôs It√§keskus.Some of our sustainable development measures are described below under ‚ÄòImpacts on the environment and society‚Äô.In the autumn of 2022  an external sustainability panel chose six of SATO‚Äôs rental apartment buildings to be among the Ostavastuullisesti.fi website‚Äôs more sustainable choices. SATO was the first rental housing provider to be included in the Ostavastuullisesti.fi service. Our following buildings were assessed to be a more sustainable choice: Lupajantie 2 in Mellunkyl√§  Helsinki; Jokiniityntie 28 in Kirkkonummi; Lincolninaukio 4 in Keimola  Vantaa; Kotkatie 6 in Espoo and Jokiniementie 46 and 48 in Ver√§j√§m√§ki  Helsinki.In 2022  we took part in Rakli‚Äôs newly launched Green Homes activities. At the end of 2022  we had altogether 1 100 Green Homes which had either geothermal heat or consumption-based water invoicing or both.We participated for the eighth time in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) assessment. SATO received two stars on a scale of one to five. SATO‚Äôs score in the Standing Investments Benchmark (existing properties) fell by one point from last year (score now at 73)  while in the Development Benchmark (construction projects) SATO‚Äôs score rose to 75 points from 71 points last year. We report on our sustainability annually in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative‚Äôs (GRI) reporting guidelines  and the environmental sustainability figures presented in the report have been verified by an independent third party  i.e. KPMG Oy Ab.During the reporting year  we collaborated on a project with the non-profit organisations No Fixed Abode and the Rehabilitation Foundation to help participants in the project find two of life‚Äôs essentials ‚Äì a home and a job. By the end of 2022  10 people who had participated in the project were living in a SATOhome.During 2022  we updated the materiality analysis and released a new sustainability programme for 2023‚Äì2026. Our vision is to be a leader in sustainable rental housing during the programme period.In 2020 we committed to reporting in compliance with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and in 2021  we conducted an extensive assessment of the risks and opportunities arising from climate change for SATO‚Äôs entire supply chain. In the framework  the risks are divided into four main categories: transition risks  acute and chronic physical risks and social risks. At the same time  we carried out a scenario analysis to look into how the two- and four-degree scenarios affect society and how SATO should prepare for these changes. During the reporting year  risks caused by climate change were part of SATO‚Äôs general risk assessment that is conducted internally each year. In 2022  two reports were made to SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors on climate risks and opportunities and their impact.The Corporate Governance Statement is published separately from the Report of the Board of Directors. SATO‚Äôs Corporate Governance Statement  Code of Conduct and sustainability programme are available at sato.fi.Impacts on the environment and societyOur objective is to systematically reduce the negative impacts of our operations on the environment. We reduce the load on the environment by regularly and proactively taking care of and repairing homes and properties according to the life-cycle principle  and by building properties primarily in existing urban environments and near good public transport connections.The planning of SATO‚Äôs new rental apartments always takes into account energy efficiency and solutions that will last for decades. In new properties  SATO‚Äôs goal is energy class A (energy performance indicator 75 or below)  which is significantly better than that required by the building code (energy performance indicator 90). All of the buildings that were completed during the reporting year were energy class A. The average EPI for buildings begun during 2022 was 72 and all of the housing starts are energy class A.We are committed to the Energy Efficiency Agreement targets for the property sector  aiming for a reduction in the total consumption of electricity and heat of 10.5% from the 2015 baseline by 2025.The use of renewable energy in heating significantly reduces the in-use emissions of homes. At every new building and renovation site  we look into the possibility of geothermal heat. We currently have 17 properties that are carbon neutral in terms of electricity and heating. During the reporting year  geothermal heat was being built on 12 properties. In addition  six properties had a solar power plant and solar power plants were being built on nine properties. In 2022  building electricity consisted entirely of emission-free electricity.During 2022  SATO converted the heating system to geothermal heat at the last properties which still had fossil-fuel-based heating  thus taking us a significant step closer to our goal of achieving in-use carbon neutrality.Vantaa Energy and SATO signed an energy partnership agreement in February 2022. Together with Vantaa Energy  we are developing carbon-neutral energy solutions for buildings‚Äô heating and cooling  which will help us achieve our carbon neutrality target by 2030 for in-use energy consumption.During the reporting year  we continued to invest in energy efficiency improvements in SATOhomes in connection with renovations. In renovations  our goal is to improve energy efficiency by some 30% compared to earlier. Due to the rise in heating and electricity prices  energy costs rose overall.During the reporting year  specific energy consumption fell 4.1%  specific electricity consumption rose 7.1% and specific water consumption fell 2.0% compared to 2021. Specific emissions from SATO‚Äôs apartments fell by 9.3% compared to 2021 and were 28.2 (31.1) carbon dioxide equivalent kilograms per square metre. Emissions are calculated according to the absolute consumption of district heat. Electricity was generated from emission-free nuclear power.According to the Ministry of the Environment  the built environment causes approximately one third of Finland‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions. The construction industry  together with the real estate sector and their related services  employ more than half a million people and bring in tax revenues for society. The construction industry does  however  have negative impacts not only on the environment  but also society and people. Some well-known examples of the construction industry‚Äôs negative impacts are the grey economy  occupational safety and human rights-related violations  as well as irregularities in procurement and delivery chains. We regularly assess and predict the social  economic and environmental risks related to our operations. We try to systematically reduce the identified negative impacts  for example by following our Code of Conduct  by combating the grey economy  by conducting audits and internal control  and by continuously developing our operations. During 2022  we decided to survey the current state of our compliance function in order to gain an overall picture of our policies and commitments.SATO has a whistleblowing channel through which SATO employees and external stakeholders can anonymously report critical concerns.The Group‚Äôs sustainability programme is available in its entirety at sato.fi.Development activitiesSATO‚Äôs development activities during the reporting year focused on developing sales and customer experience processes and operating models  the renewal of the invoicing processes and improving the continuous development operating model. We invested in developing digital services  as well as our presence near to the customers  and in building a uniform and seamless service experience. Our goal is to serve our customers in the best way possible  regardless of time or place.Based on customer feedback  we also developed  during the reporting year  our processes involving the rental of a new home. The changes made daily work more efficient for our rental team  which also means even better service for our customers. We revamped the reservation of apartment viewings to make them more flexible for the customer and to pilot test the online reservation of viewings no matter the time or place. The apartment viewings were mostly held by our own viewing agents. We updated the apartment application process on the sato.fi website and in 2022 made it possible for our customers to apply for homes using the ‚Äòmore sustainable option‚Äô search criterion.In our development operations last year  we also focused on renewing the invoicing processes and we piloted a new invoicing system in summer 2022. The new system offers better opportunities to view up-to-date invoicing information and the plan is to roll it out in full in spring 2023.In developing the business  we adopted a continuous development model at SATO during the reporting year. We defined the roles related to the model and will develop the activities as smaller components rather than large units  which will speed up development work and allow processes to be improved more effectively.A total of EUR 3.2 million (3.2) was spent on development  corresponding to approximately 1.1% of net sales.Risk managementRisk management is used to ensure that risks impacting the company‚Äôs business are identified  managed and monitored. The main risks of SATO‚Äôs business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.SATO‚Äôs most significant risks are related to prolonged inflation and the resulting rise in interest rates. As a result of the war in Ukraine  the prices of energy  food  materials and commodities have increased dramatically and interest rates have risen. Higher cost of living can have a negative impact on consumers‚Äô purchasing power and ability to meet their obligations. If the strong growth in the cost of financing and maintenance costs continues and the market situation does not provide an opportunity to transfer the higher costs into rents in full  this can have a negative impact on the fair value of investment assets and the company‚Äôs ability to finance investments  which means that new investments and renovations will have to be postponed.The most significant risks in the renting of apartments are related to economic cycles and fluctuations in demand and supply. Market risk can increase the supply of rental housing to a point that it exceeds demand. This leads to rental housing vacancies and pressure to even out or lower the rent level especially for the old housing portfolio.A clear weakening in the housing market could have a negative impact on the market value of SATO‚Äôs housing portfolio. In accordance with its strategy  SATO focuses its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing its existing housing portfolio  thus ensuring the rental potential of its apartments and the development of their value.Changes in official regulations and legislation  as well as the uncertainty stemming from them  may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and thus on SATO‚Äôs business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and also calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group‚Äôs treasury policy  which has been approved by SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors. Our financial risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other long-term financing commitments. The company established a EUR 1.5 billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) bond programme in 2019.The means for managing the liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  committed credit facilities of EUR 700 million and a commercial paper programme of EUR 400 million. We increase the amount of reserves as the financing requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating rate loans form an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed and floating rate loans either by issuing fixed rate loans or by interest rate hedges. According to our treasury policy  our objective is to keep the ratio of fixed rate loans at over 60 % of debt portfolio after interest hedging.There are risks related to the business environment in our St. Petersburg operations  including currency risk. The consolidation of foreign currency-denominated assets in the consolidated financial statements also involves a translation risk. Possibilities of hedging the translation risk are evaluated in accordance with our financial policy. SATO has abstained from making new investments in Russia for a long time. Since the start of the war in Ukraine  the company has been reviewing opportunities to withdraw from the Russian business operations. Based on our studies  a fast withdrawal is not possible  which is why SATO will continue to rent residential apartments in St. Petersburg until a way to withdraw has been found. The company is actively seeking a solution. The Russian operating environment is expected to be extremely uncertain and it may cause disturbances in SATO‚Äôs business operations in Russia and with parties related to the Russian business. This can affect SATO‚Äôs ability to make payments to suppliers  its employees and authorities  and to receive payments from customers  which can have a significant adverse impact on SATO‚Äôs business operations in Russia.

The Board‚Äôs work is supported by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.In 2022  Antti Aarnio  M.Sc. (Tech.)  was SATO‚Äôs CEO.As the company‚Äôs auditor  the Annual General Meeting selected the audit firm Deloitte Oy  which appointed APA Aleksi Martamo as the auditor in charge. The auditor‚Äôs term in office is the financial year  and the auditor‚Äôs duties end at the closing of the next Annual General Meeting.Members of the Management GroupDuring the reporting period 2022  the Corporate Management Group consisted of Antti Aarnio  CEO  Arto Aalto  EVP  Investments  Markku Honkasalo  CFO  Janne Ojalehto  CCO (until 27 January 2023) and Elina Vaurasalo  EVP  Housing Business.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO‚Äôs business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence  the development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  the general competitive situation and interest rates.Employment development was strong in early 2022  but slowed down towards year-end due to economic challenges. During the reporting year  consumers‚Äô confidence weakened to a historically low level after the start of the year  which showed in private consumption. According to the projection made by the Bank of Finland on 16 December 2022  Finland‚Äôs economic growth in 2022 will be 1.9% due to the good start to the year. In 2023  the increase in energy prices and the cost of living is predicted to cause the economy to slide into a slight downturn and shrink by 0.5%.Uncertainty and rising interest rates are slowing housing sales. According to the statistics released by the Central Federation of Finnish Real Estate Agencies in December 2022  sales volumes of new and old apartments clearly fell in November compared to the five-year average. According to Statistics Finland‚Äôs preliminary data in December  the prices of old owner-occupied apartments fell in November 2022 in the whole of Finland by 3.4% compared to November of the previous year.The economic situation will decelerate the historically high rate of construction. The number of issued building permits began to fall already in 2021  but plenty of new apartments were and will be completed in 2022 and 2023  which is maintaining tight competition for good tenants and keeping rent increases moderate. The increased cost level resulting from inflation does  however  create pressure to increase rents in the future.The lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and improving employment resulted in a positive turnaround in internal migration to large growth centres in 2022 and demand for rental apartments has begun to grow. This  and SATO‚Äôs investments in making renting more efficient and improving customer service  were visible as an increase in SATO‚Äôs occupancy rate. Also  economic uncertainty  upward pressure on interest rates and increasing consumer prices contributed to the increase in the demand for rental apartments.As tenants have a wider array of choices  a successful customer experience is more important than ever. SATO is investing strongly in increasing its customer presence and developing digital services.In line with its majority shareholder‚Äôs operating model  SATO Corporation will not publish guidance on its 2023 earnings. The parent company of Balder Finska Otas AB is Fastighets AB Balder  which is quoted on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.Proposal of the Board of Directors for the distribution of profitOn 31 December 2022  the parent company‚Äôs distributable equity was EUR 512 557 145.56  of which profit for the period was EUR 129 644 613.16.

18298,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4577225-tessenderlo-adding-fertilizer-portfolio-steep-discount,Tessenderlo: Adding Fertilizer To Your Portfolio At A Steep Discount,Tessenderlo offers great value for investors seeking alpha as it is overlooked by most institutional investments and is hardly followed by analysts. Find out why the stock is a Buy.,"Thomas BarwickIntroTessenderlo (OTCPK:TSDOF) is my favorite value pick for 2023. The company offers great value for investors seeking alpha as it is overlooked by most institutional investments and is hardly followed by analysts. The company also checks all my boxes for a long-term investment position in my portfolio: qualitative management  secular growth tailwinds  extremely cheap valuation multiples (P/E of 6.5x  EV/EBITDA of 3.1x  EV/EBIT of 4.8x ‚Ä¶)  recurrent insider share purchases and very decent returns on capital (ROCE ~ 12% and rising).Despite the long-term bull case  I also expect record results for FY 2022 following record H1 results published earlier this year. The company is experiencing a strong tailwind due to high food commodity prices and thus high fertilizer prices. Fertilizer prices have soared last year due to supply chain disruptions reaching record highs. Although fertilizer prices will likely soften in the near term  they are expected to remain at very high levels throughout 2023 and beyond.Tessenderlo's primary listing is on Euronext Brussels where it's trading with TESSB as its ticker symbol. Buying shares through its primary listing is preferable above the OTC listing.Tessenderlo group's activitiesTessenderlo Group's activities are subdivided into four operating segments:The Agro segment combines activities in the production  trading and marketing of crop nutrition (liquid crop fertilizers and potassium sulfate fertilizers based on sulfur) as well as crop protection products.The Bio-valorization segment contains activities in animal by-product processing. This consists of PB Leiner (the production  trading and sales of gelatins and collagen peptides) and Akiolis (the rendering  production and sales of proteins and fats).The Industrial Solutions segment includes products  systems and solutions for the processing and treatment of water  including flocculation and precipitation (DYKA group). After the fusion with Picanol is completed  this division will also contain Picanol's industrial weaving machines' operations.The T-Power segment includes a 425 MW CCGT electricity power plant (Combined Cycle Gas Turbine)  which is located in Tessenderlo Belgium. The power plant is flexible and is designed to supply electricity when other energy sources (Nuclear  renewable  etc.) are insufficient to meet demand. This division is generating a steady income through a subsidized capacity remuneration mechanism (CRM).EBIT per business segment (Company press release - H1 Results)Booming fertilizer prices causing record resultsTessenderlo started 2022 with a very conservative outlook predicting earnings to be either flat or softly declining. But things quickly changed for the better and Tessenderlo could not keep silent until the first half-year results. In June the company released a positive profit warning stating a 10% EBITDA increase for FY 2022. This was a strong hint towards very strong H1 results which later occurred.H1 topline results & key figures (Company press release - H1 Results)All divisions surprisingly reported strong increases in profitability (+44% increase in EBIT). Especially the Agro segment stood out (+61% increase in EBIT) reflecting the highest fertilizer prices since 2008 and a strong dollar as a large part of their offset market is located in the US.H1 topline results & key figures per business segment (Company press release - H1 Results)Evolution of the Agro SegmentIn terms of profitability the agro segment accounts for more than half of the profit. The evolution of this segment is therefore discussed in this section.Agricultural prices reached new records in Q2 2022 as grain and fertilizer prices reached record highs following the war in Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine are important global crop producers. Remarkably  that fertilizer prices have been on the lift since the start of 2021. This is because agricultural commodity prices have been on the rise even before the war.Graph shows average retail price evolution for fertilizers (DTN Retail Fertilizer Trends)On the demand side high fertilizer prices are supported by high agricultural commodity prices and high farmer profitability.Global stock-to-use ratio & Global fertilizer inventories - Profitability of acres (K+S Investors presentation)On the supply side high fertilizer prices are supported by the lowest inventories in the last 10 years and a surge in raw material prices.Global stock-to-use ratio - Global fertilizer inventories (Mosaic's Q2 Investor presentation)It is expected that potassium-based fertilizer prices will remain historically high due to the disrupted supply chain in raw materials. Muriate Of Potash or MOP is Tessenderlo's most important raw material.Fertilizer Raw Material Prices (Bloomberg World Bank)The supply chain of raw materials is heavily disrupted as Belarus/Russia is providing around 40% of the world's MOP.Raw materials of fertilizers versus country of sourcing (UNComtrade - World Bank)At the release of the 2021 annual report in March '22  Tessenderlo stated that they are sourcing potash in Russia and Belarus for their European factories which have been restricted by EU sanctions against Russia/Belarus. In response they were forced to look for alternative sourcing starting from H2. Final results should further clarify their future MOP sourcing for their European operations and impact on cost/margins. For their US operations there is no impact expected.World potash supply in different scenarios (K+S investor's presentation / IFA)For the full year of 2022  I expect that the good performance of H1 is continued although at a slightly softer pace. For 2023 and beyond it is likely that retail prices will normalize but remain way above historical levels through structural rising demand and continued tight supply/inventories.The fertilizer segment remains an attractive business with solid long-term prospects as commodity prices for corn and soybeans and profitability for farmers are at high levels. The use of fertilizers is essential to ensure high crop yields and provide for the world's rising demand for basic food commodities. Investors of Tessenderlo are advised to closely follow up results and outlook of competitors such as Mosaic (MOS) and K+S (OTCQX:KPLUY) to gain leading insights into Tessenderlo's results/outlook.CEO and main shareholder Luc TackThe current owner and CEO  Luck Tack  is a very respectable entrepreneur and disciplined investor. He has a reputation for acquiring mismanaged businesses at very low prices. Subsequently  he invests his own blood  sweat and tears to successfully turn around these businesses by rigorously cutting SG&A costs and applying a buy-and-build strategy. In 2009 he bought a lion's share (around 90%) in Picanol  a small-cap enterprise on the verge of bankruptcy. Together with his business partner  Stefaan Haspeslagh (CFO)  he transformed Picanol into a staggering cash machine in the years after. This transformation was not unnoticed by other Belgian entrepreneurs and earned him the glorious title of 'Trends manager of the year' in 2014.With the cash that was stacked up in Picanol  he decided in 2013 to expand his entrepreneurial footprint and Picanol acquired a large stake of 28% in Tessenderlo from the French government. Over the years both Picanol (90% owned by Tack) and Luck Tack himself have been consistently buying shares of Tessenderlo on the open market bringing Picanol's share of ownership to around 50% and Luck Tack's ownership to around 6%.At the time Tack acquired his initial stake in Tessenderlo  the company's balance sheet and profitability were weak. Under the reign of the French government  Tessenderlo was heavily mismanaged for years through an unsustainable dividend policy while cutting back on investments year after year.In the years following the acquisition a cleanup followed. Since then there was a strong focus on cost controlling  disciplined capex investments and free cash flow. The quality of management is reflected in steadily increasing capital efficiency ratios and year-after-year increases in net profits. Tessenderlo's industrial segments are cyclical in nature. Yet capital efficiency (ROCE %) has been steadily increasing making a successful turn-around more visible year after year.Evolution of Return on Capital Employed (Tessenderlo's Annual Reports - Own Graph)Note: 2019 was a negative outlier caused by high losses on foreign currencies. Corrected for these effects ROCE was actually around 13% in 2019.Valuation multiples suggest a bargain priceIf you had been invested in Tessenderlo for the last 5 years you would not have been rewarded for your patience. The stock price is almost exactly at the same level as 5 years ago.Share price evolution of Tessenderlo (Yahoo Finance)The share price evolution does however not reflect the good performance in all divisions of the business. There is progress in all underlying profitability indicators (adj. EBITDA  EBIT and net profit). Free cash flows are typically more fluctuant and heavily dependent on CAPEX investment decisions. Still  free cash flows are also systemically trending up.Evolution EBITDA  EBIT  net profit & Free Cash Flow (Tessenderlo's annual reports - Own Graph. Note: 2022 estimates are based on the company's reviewed outlook)Yet this is not reflected in the share price which is trading at record-low historical multiples (P/E of 6.5x  EV/EBITDA of 3.1x  EV/EBIT of 4.8x). Conclusively valuation multiples are extremely low versus their historical levels. This is while the fundamentals and long-term prospects are solid and underlying businesses are growing at a steady pace. Investors that are getting in today are buying in at 50c on the dollar. And this does not account for an obvious outperformance versus their conservative 2022 outlook.Evolution of valuation multiples (Tessenderlo's Annual Reports - Own Calculations)Near term catalystsA dirt-cheap valuation does not necessarily guarantee that the share price will go up in the short term. Luckily there are several near-term catalysts that will allow investors to reinitiate their interest in the company:A successful merger between Picanol and TessenderloReinitiating dividendIncreased analyst coverageIncreased free floatReturn of institutional investorsThe Tessenderlo-Picanol merger sagaDespite the fact that no one will contest that the corporation is in far better form than it was ten years ago  there have been some worries over corporate governance.Tack attempted to combine Picanol and Tessenderlo in 2015. The transaction was set up as a takeover offer by Picanol on Tessenderlo through a share-swap agreement  valuing both companies on very similar multiples. Investors and analysts opposed the merger claiming the offer was not to the benefit of Tessenderlo's shareholders. They failed to see synergies between the two companies and also argued that the deal was structured so Tack wouldn't be paying a premium on Tessenderlo. Thus  the bid price was deemed to be too low. After analysts and institutional investors univocally shot down the terms of the deal Tack pulled back his offer and declared the deal dead and buried. After this event  the relation between Tack and investors & analysts has cooled down significantly. Consequently  institutional investors and funds sold off their holdings one by one  while Tack on the other hand consistently has been increasing his stake and the number of voting rights.Another reason for the long-lasting exit of institutional investors and funds has been the absence of a dividend payout since 2013. While the balance sheet was fully loaded in 2013 there has been an ongoing deleveraging since Tack entered Tessenderlo. Since his entrance into the capital  the focus of the group was always oriented toward generating free cash flows and disciplined capital allocation (also through acquisitions).Evolution of Net Financial Debt (NFD) over EBITDA. Note: The peak in net debt in 2018 was due to the large acquisition of T-power (328 M. ‚Ç¨). (Tessenderlo's Annual Reports - Own calculations)Currently  the balance sheet is rock solid carrying a small net cash position. Investors on the other hand are disappointed in the absence of a dividend while there is plenty of room for a reasonable payout. It certainly did not help that CFO Haspeslagh reacted as if he was stung by a wasp every time questions were raised at the annual shareholder meeting around reinitiating dividends.But it was obvious Tack would reattempt to merge both entities as he kept buying shares of Tessenderlo rigorously until his share in the voting rights surpassed the 70% benchmark. At that point there was very little that could stop Tack's merger plans. In July 2022 it then finally happened. 7 years after the first attempt to merge the two Tessenderlo launched a share-swap offer on Picanol. As a deal sweetener  Tessenderlo also promised to reinitiate the dividend after the merger is complete.Following the exchange offer  the Board of Directors will propose a dividend policy to the shareholders  taking into account the sustainable growth that is being pursued""After more than 99% of shareholders have already accepted the merger seems a done deal. The final closure will take place in March. My expectations are that this event will set a positive chain reaction in motion causing rediscovering of the stock. First of all  the merger will have a positive impact on the absolute free float (combining the free float of Picanol and Tessenderlo). In combination with its renewed dividend policy  the return of institutional investors and funds is therefore expected. In addition  I also believe a dividend will add to fading corporate governance concerns. This in turn will allow financial analysts to reinitiate coverage of the company.Takeaway messageBuying into Tessenderlo now is buying into a group with attractive growth perspectives at a very attractive price. My expectation is that the closing of a long-anticipated merger between Tessenderlo and Picanol will cause the rediscovering of the company over the course of 2023. A revaluation of the stock is therefore extremely likely.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Every day we are working to help our partners to improve water quality and make clean water available to millions of people worldwide. With our membrane module sales in 2022 alone  we enabled the production of 263 billion liter of clean water.We have made a strong start to 2023  with various recent breakthrough orders based on our dNF technology in  amongst others  Australia  China and Indonesia. For 2023  we have an outlook on total revenues of ‚Ç¨18m to ‚Ç¨22m  driven by strong market demand and expanding global sales presence  pilot projects that are converting into larger scale projects and by repeat business with our existing (OEM) partners.""Total revenues increased by 105% to ‚Ç¨8 354k in 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨4 069k in 2021. Revenues from the sale of goods increased by 138% to ‚Ç¨7 546k in 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨3 173k in 2021. Key drivers for the growth in gross income were a strong market demand  an increase in the number of full-scale projects that resulted from preceding pilot projects  as well as global sales force expansions and a growing number of OEM relationships  that are increasingly resulting in repeat projects for existing blue-chip clients.We experienced strongest growth in our Sustainable Industrial Water business line  with revenues from the sale of goods of ‚Ç¨4 977k in 2022  a growth of 140% compared to ‚Ç¨2 072k in 2021. NX Filtration benefitted from the pilots it had initiated since mid-2020  as well as from repeat projects from existing customers. We experienced strong traction with customers in  amongst others  the food & beverage and textile industries looking to reduce their water footprint and optimize their water systems in a sustainable way.Key projects in our Sustainable Industrial Water business line included wastewater reuse projects for  amongst others  Aquarius H2O Dynamics in India  Cross Textiles in Turkey and Practical Water Solutions in South Africa. Our commercial roll-out model is based on converting pilot projects into larger demo or full-scale projects  with subsequent repeat orders from existing clients  and periodic module replacements at existing plants. The year 2022 also marks the first replacement order for NX Filtration  which we supplied to Hidrofilt in Hungary for industrial wastewater treatment at the site of an aerospace multinational  that we first supplied in 2019.In the Clean Municipal Water business line  revenues from the sale of goods in 2022 were ‚Ç¨2 569k  a growth of 133% compared to ‚Ç¨1 101k in 2021. This growth was primarily driven by full-scale projects in Asia  whereas the focus in Europe and North America has been on pilots with leading players  with visibility on future large projects. Although our Sustainable Industrial Water business line is still the largest today  larger municipal projects are constituting an increasing part of our pipeline for future revenues.In our Clean Municipal Water business line  we realized repeat dNF projects with PT. Bayu for the production of drinking water in Indonesia  supplied our dNF modules to Ekopak for the extension of a water treatment project in Belgium  and received repeat orders from EcoAzur for drinking and wastewater treatment projects in Mexico. In the European and North American market  NX Filtration started various new pilot projects  amongst others with Suez in France related to micropollutants removal with our dNF technology and Vitens in the Netherlands  related to drinking water production from the IJssel river. We also continued our pilot projects with leading players such as Veolia in France  Aqualia and Aig√ºes de Barcelona in Spain and Service de l'Eau de Lausanne in Switzerland.Other income slightly declined from ‚Ç¨896k in 2021 to ‚Ç¨808k in 2022. This decline was driven by reduced government grants for innovation projects  partly offset by rental income from pilots growing from ‚Ç¨192k in 2021 to ‚Ç¨400k in 2022.Gross margin increased to 57.2% in 2022 from 55.0% in 2021. Gross margin was positively impacted by efficiencies resulting from the second spinning line that started-up during the first half of 2022 and positive product mix effects.EBITDA loss was ‚Ç¨8 549k in 2022 compared to an EBITDA loss of ‚Ç¨3 738k in 2021 (excluding IPO transaction costs)  reflecting ahead-of-the-curve investments to prepare the organization for the expected growth. Including IPO transaction costs  EBITDA loss for 2021 amounted to ‚Ç¨13 323k.Net loss was ‚Ç¨8 642k in 2022 compared to a net loss of ‚Ç¨4 103k in 2021 (excluding IPO transaction costs). Net loss including IPO transaction costs for 2021 was ‚Ç¨11 354k.Capex amounted to ‚Ç¨12 670k in 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨8 616k in 2021. Capex included investments in the ongoing capacity expansion at the existing locations  the purchase of land and development costs for the new megafactory and the expansion of NX Filtration's fleet of pilot systems. Additionally  NX Filtration capitalized ‚Ç¨914k of development costs which demonstrates the company's continued efforts to invest in innovations for the future.Net cash position at 31 December 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨104.3 million  compared to a net cash position of ‚Ç¨133.4 million at 31 December 2021.Operating cash flow was ‚Ç¨15 702k negative  compared to ‚Ç¨3 630k negative in 2021 (‚Ç¨13 215k negative including IPO transaction costs).Working capital(3)[3] increased to ‚Ç¨8 471k at 31 December 2022 versus ‚Ç¨1 062k at 31 December 2021  as a result of higher account receivables due to increasing sales volumes as well as increased inventory levels to meet the growing demand in 2023.Sustainability and a clear Environmental  Social and Governance (ESG) agenda are at the heart of NX Filtration's business. We passionately believe we have a responsibility to contribute positively to society and the environment. 2022 marked an important year for NX Filtration in terms of progress on this ESG agenda: we realized externally certified science-based CO 2 reduction targets  we obtained an independent ESG risk rating from Sustainalytics  in which we rank amongst the 13% best performers in our global subindustry peer group  we joined the United Nations Global Compact initiative  and installed a formal ESG Committee comprised of the two independent Supervisory Board members to formalize governance and oversight responsibilities with regard to sustainability  environmental  social  corporate governance and human capital matters.We continue to use our targeted ESG framework to address and monitor our impact along three pillars:Clean water for all : Our 2022 membrane sales can enable the production of 263 billion liters of clean water(4)[4]  which is equivalent to the drinking water supply for 48 million persons during one year. In 2022  NX Filtration enabled access to clean water across 30 countries. Avoiding emissions at our customers : With our membrane module sales in 2022  we enabled 3 578 ton CO2e savings during the deployment lifetime of our modules  by avoiding the use of 6.7 million kg of chemicals and saving 82 GWh energy compared to conventional technologies(5)[5]. Our internal initiatives : We have implemented various sustainability measures and initiatives around ESG related themes in our own operations  for our employees and our partners.In our Sustainability Report  that forms part of our Annual Report  we further elaborate on these and other ESG related aspects  as well as underlying assumptions and methodologies related to the above-mentioned metrics. Furthermore  our Sustainability Report includes our first Communication on Progress (CoP) on human rights in accordance with the UN Global Compact.NX Filtration made strong progress on all key strategic fronts  positioning us well for the substantial growth ahead of us  based on our rapidly growing pipeline of opportunities for the short  medium and long term.Further shaped our global organization  positioning us well for the substantial growth ahead of usIn our journey of fast growth  strengthening and growing our organization is amongst our top priorities. During 2022  our employee base has grown from 69 FTE to 135 FTE  which includes more than 15 nationalities. We entered various new countries with our own sales and engineering teams  including France  Germany  China  Japan and Indonesia. We established strong regional sales and engineering clusters across all continents headed by experienced industry hires. In April 2022  Tsunenobu Katsura (former Chairman of Hydranautics) joined us as new Sales Director for the Asia Pacific region. In May 2022  Tony Fuhrman (former Commercial Director of LG Water Solutions) joined us as new Sales Director for the Americas. Recently  at the start of 2023  Jelena Flokstra (former sales and business development EMEA at 3D printing company Hubs) joined us as new Sales Director for the EMEA region.Successful roll-out of pilot strategy  fully on track to reach our medium-term objective of 200 pilotsPilots play an important role in NX Filtration's commercial roll-out strategy  that is based on converting pilot projects into larger demo or full-scale projects  with subsequent repeat orders from existing clients  and periodic module replacements at existing plants. In 2022  NX Filtration initiated 167 pilot projects compared to 87 in 2021. On 31 December 2022  NX Filtration had 162 pilot systems in its fleet (85 at 31 December 2021). To facilitate a growing demand for its pilot systems  NX Filtration had placed orders to further expand its fleet to 190 pilot systems  therewith nearing closely to our medium-term objective of 200 pilot systems.We continue to be successful in turning these pilot projects into larger projects: in 2022 we delivered our dNF modules for 5 demo projects and 23 full-scale projects. Of these full-scale projects  17 were repeat orders from customers who had already worked with NX Filtration before. The year 2022 also marks the first replacement order for NX Filtration  which we supplied to Hidrofilt in Hungary for industrial wastewater treatment at the site of an aerospace multinational  that we first supplied in 2019.Started the construction of our upsized megafactory combining ultra-modern production techniques in a state-of-the-art facilityDuring 2022  NX Filtration started to benefit from its expanded capacity in its existing facilities. The commissioning of its second spinning line in the first half-year of 2022 resulted in a higher capacity (combined total capacity of approximately 10 000 membrane modules per year(6)[6]  compared to the capacity of approximately 2 500 membrane modules per year in 2021) and production efficiency improvements.We also started the construction of a new large-scale manufacturing facility. Due to strong anticipated client demand  NX Filtration decided to upsize the design of this megafactory with a higher initial capacity and allowing more space for future capacity additions. Improvements and lessons learned from our second spinning line have resulted in higher capacity estimates per spinning line. In addition  to create optimal flexibility for the future  we have decided to build a larger (more than 26 500 m2 production and more than 6 000 m2 office space) facility from the outset. These two factors allow us to kick off production with a higher initial capacity (approximately 50k(7)[7] membrane modules based on 4 spinning lines)  whilst leaving space for further capacity additions within the same facility (total targeted annual capacity of >120k(8)[8] membrane modules)  in addition to the existing capacity at the current locations. Total expected capex is higher than foreseen at the time of our IPO as a result of the larger plant design and current views on costs  but estimated capex per module capacity remains in line with previous estimates. Completion of the new megafactory is anticipated by the first quarter of 2024  and start-up during the first half-year of 2024.Further strengthened our technology position  with our breakthrough dNF technology continuing to be recognized by the industryWe are convinced that our breakthrough dNF membrane technology will play an important role in addressing global issues which center around water quality and water scarcity. It makes us proud that the breakthrough character of our membranes is also being recognized by various industry observers. NX Filtration supplied its technology to the Recolab project in Sweden  which received the 2022 Global Water Intelligence award for Wastewater Project of the Year. Recolab is the largest source-separated sanitation plant in the world using circular treatment. Key highlights recognized by the award were the energy-efficiency of the plant and the circular processes that recycle wastewater to drinking water quality.An important part of our innovation activity is related to the optimal deployment of our membrane modules at our customers. During 2022 we conducted a research project with PepsiCo on additional opportunities for dNF membranes within PepsiCo's facilities. We also participate in the European innovation project LIFE PRISTINE  led by Acciona  to eliminate emerging pollutants (including PFAS) from water sources. The project works on a sustainable alternative for the elimination of emerging pollutants in the water cycle.In 2022  we also made further progress on our patent portfolio  by adding a new patent family 'Method for creating a porous film through aqueous phase separation' that concerns an innovative application of nanolayers on our membranes.Driven by the strong market demand for our technology and supported by the additional equity capital that NX Filtration raised with its IPO in June 2021  we will continue to invest in our strategic priorities in 2023.In terms of people  we will continue to build on the strong global organization that we further shaped in 2022. We will also continue our strong focus on rolling-out pilot projects and converting these pilots into demo- and full-scale projects. We are fully on track to reach our medium-term objective of 200 pilot systems  and therewith gradually shifting our focus from rapid expansion of our pilot fleet towards optimal deployment for near  medium and long-term commercial opportunities. Moreover  we expect to increasingly benefit from repeat business with our existing (OEM) relationships.In terms of production  we will further benefit from the higher capacity and production efficiencies from our two existing production lines. In addition  2023 will be a key year for the construction of our new megafactory. Completion of this megafactory is anticipated by the first quarter of 2024 and start-up during the first half-year of 2024. By then  the additional capacity is needed to meet expected demand from our rapidly growing overall pipeline of opportunities for the medium term.ESG remains a key part of our overall mission while scaling up. NX Filtration considers high ESG standards of great importance for its long-term success  its workforce  its customers  the environment and society as a whole. The strong growth that NX Filtration is currently experiencing provides many opportunities to organize ESG aspects with the highest standards and impact from the outset.We are well-positioned for further growth in 2023  with various recent breakthrough orders with our dNF technology in Australia  China and Indonesia. We have an outlook on total revenues of ‚Ç¨18m to ‚Ç¨22m for 2023  driven by strong market demand and our expanding global sales presence. This targeted growth is largely driven by further roll-out of full-scale projects and by repeat business from our existing (OEM) clients.We remain fully committed to making an impact based on our mission 'clean and affordable water for all'  whilst offering strong sustainability benefits to our customers and providing an inspiring working environment for our employees.-The 2022 annual report is available on the Investor Relations section of the website www.nxfiltration.com.Analyst call / webcastNX Filtration will host an analyst call and webcast at 9:30 CEST on 10 February 2023 to comment on the 2022 results.

The mood at the start of the year was expectant in terms of the ending of the COVID-19 pandemic of the past two years and the lifting of the restrictions  and the year began with strong economic growth. However  Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine in February  created a new kind of uncertainty in the world and the war resulted in human suffering.The war‚Äôs impacts could been seen in our operating environment as economic uncertainty  rising energy prices and interest rates and high inflation. These multiplier effects showed in SATO‚Äôs business operations during the reporting year. We have approximately 25 000 homes in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku. In addition  SATO has 522 apartments in St. Petersburg  which make up approximately one per cent of the value of our investment assets. Since the start of the war in Ukraine  we have been reviewing opportunities to withdraw from the Russian business operations and we are searching actively for a solution.Despite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental apartments in Finland  and the urbanisation trend continues. The rise in mortgage interest rates coupled with the increase in energy and other costs had a partial impact on the growth in rental apartment demand. Now  also some of the people looking for an owner-occupied apartment may consider renting an apartment.The competition between rental housing providers is tough and a large number of new rental apartments has been built especially in the Helsinki metropolitan area in recent years. The historically high rate of housing construction is slowing. There are significantly fewer housing starts than before  but a large number of new apartments will be completed in 2023. This will maintain the tight competition for good tenants and keep rent increases moderate  despite the pressure for rent to increase in the future due to the rising cost level.During the reporting year  our investments in rental apartments were EUR 190.5 million (167.1). In 2022  we completed 191 rental apartments and 52 FlexHomes. On 31 December 2022  a total of 1 418 apartments were under construction. During the second half of the reporting year  we made a decision to refrain from launching any new construction projects. Our decision was based on the dramatic rise in the cost level for construction and property maintenance and the increase in financing costs  while rent development remained moderate due to the market situation.During the first half of the year  we made a decision to launch new non-subsidised rental apartment construction projects in Rykmentinpuisto in Tuusula  Skanssi in Turku and Finnoo in Espoo. The Rykmentinpuisto project is our first new apartment investment in Tuusula in 15 years and the Skanssi project is the first new apartment investment in Turku in five years.In April of the reporting year  we sold 2 009 rental apartments mainly in the Lahti  Jyv√§skyl√§ and Oulu areas to the Swedish investment company Heimstaden. The sale was consistent with our strategy of focusing our apartment investments on the Helsinki metropolitan area and its commuting area along the main railway  and in Tampere and Turku and their surrounding municipalities.We continued to develop the customer experience at SATO during the year. The economic occupancy rate improved compared to the previous year and was 95.2% (94.9). Our tenant turnover for the reporting year fell and our customer satisfaction improved. We clarified and simplified the processes and operating models related to the customer experience and focused especially on building a harmonised and seamless service experience. In addition to developing digital services  we invested in our presence near to the customers.During the reporting year  we continued our sustainability work and released our sustainability programme for 2023‚àí2026  our second ever. The themes of the sustainability programme are sustainable housing  thriving communities and sustainable profitability. Our vision is to be a leader in sustainable rental housing. In our own sustainability goals  we have committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).Last autumn  SATO became the first rental housing provider to join the Ostavastuullisesti.fi service  which provides sustainable service and products and tips for sustainable living. A sustainability panel consisting of outside experts in sustainable production and consumption selected six of SATO‚Äôs buildings: Lupajantie 2 in Mellunkyl√§  Helsinki; Jokiniityntie 28 in Kirkkonummi; Lincolninaukio 4 in Keimola  Vantaa; Kotkatie 6 in Espoo and Jokiniementie 46 and 48 in Ver√§j√§m√§ki  Helsinki to be featured on the website as more sustainable options. We also participated in Rakli‚Äôs Green Homes activities (which started up in 2022)  with altogether 1 100 Green Homes which had either geothermal heat or consumption-based water invoicing or both.During the reporting year  we focused on supporting the well-being of SATO personnel and encouraged SATO employees to learn and grow continually. Our goal is for each person to be able to come up with ideas in their work and develop solutions for future rental housing. We want for everyone at SATO to have the courage to reinvent themselves and the ability to succeed. During the year  the entire organisation adopted the objectives and key results (OKR) model with which we are working towards better setting of objectives  closer monitoring of results and openness. The constantly increasing complexity in the operating environment challenges both experts‚Äô and supervisors‚Äô competence and thinking. In order to provide support to this end  we launched supervisor training in the coaching management style during the reporting year.I wish to thank all SATO employees for their committed and excellent work. I also wish to thank our partners and the residents of our SATOhomes for their good co-operation during the past year.Report of the Board of DirectorsReport of the Board of Directors 1 January‚Äì31 December 2022Operating environmentThe year 2022 began with strong economic growth. Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine in February of the reporting year brought uncertainty to the economic outlook  dramatically raising the price of energy and accelerating inflation. The exceptionally high inflation forced the central banks to react by rapidly hiking interest rates. During the reporting year  the ECB raised its key interest rate four times after the summer and it was 2.50% at the end of 2022. Due to the high inflation  interest rate hikes are expected to continue in early 2023. Inflation is anticipated to stabilise during 2023.Employment development was strong in early 2022  but slowed down towards year-end due to economic challenges. During the reporting year  consumers‚Äô confidence weakened to a historically low level after the start of the year  which showed in private consumption. According to the projection made by the Bank of Finland on 16 December 2022  Finland‚Äôs economic growth in 2022 will be 1.9 % due to the good start to the year. In 2023  the increase in energy prices and the cost of living is predicted to cause the economy to slide into a slight downturn and shrink by 0.5%.Uncertainty and rising interest rates are slowing housing sales. According to the statistics released by the Central Federation of Finnish Real Estate Agencies in December 2022  sales volumes of new and old apartments clearly fell in November compared to the five-year average. According to Statistics Finland‚Äôs preliminary data in December  the prices of old owner-occupied apartments fell in November 2022 in the whole of Finland by 3.4% compared to November of the previous year.The economic situation will decelerate the historically high rate of construction. The number of issued building permits began to fall already in 2021  but plenty of new apartments were and will be completed in 2022 and 2023  which is maintaining tight competition for good tenants and keeping rent increases moderate. The increased cost level resulting from inflation does  however  create pressure to increase rents in the future.The lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and improving employment resulted in a positive turnaround in internal migration to large growth centres in 2022 and demand for rental apartments has begun to grow. This  and SATO‚Äôs investments in making renting more efficient and improving customer service  were visible as an increase in SATO‚Äôs occupancy rate. Also  economic uncertainty  upward pressure on interest rates and increasing consumer prices contributed to the increase in the demand for rental apartments.Despite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental apartments  and the urbanisation trend continues. Dense urban living near services and along good public transport connections is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. The Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy strong growth  while according to Statistics Finland‚Äôs population projection  Finland‚Äôs population will start declining in 2031. The Helsinki metropolitan area is expected to grow by over 200 000 new residents by 2040. Close to 80% of the area‚Äôs residents already live in one- to two-person households  and the number of small households continues to rise. The proportion of immigrants living in the capital area is predicted to grow from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. Aging populations typically move closer to growth centres and the services they offer  and they increasingly expect housing-related services.The change in the population structure and urbanisation create a stable foundation for demand for rental housing especially in the capital area and in Tampere and Turku. Outside of growth centres  the real prices of homes are declining  which makes acquiring an owner-occupied apartment in growth centres even more challenging for people coming from those areas.StrategyCustomer experience  sustainability and sustainable housing  and SATO employees lie at the core of SATO‚Äôs strategy. We want to be closely involved in our customers‚Äô daily lives in order to serve them in the best possible way. We build homes that stand the test of time and we take care of them in line with the life-cycle principles. We enable sustainable housing for our residents and encourage them to make sustainable choices in their daily lives. We want all SATO employees to be able to contribute ideas and participate in developing future housing solutions.SATO is a housing investment company whose basic product is a rental apartment in an apartment building. We focus our investments on growth centres: the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku  because in these areas demand for apartments is the highest and the increase in value is expected to be stable over the longer term. Our operations are geared towards profitable growth.During the reporting year  our strategy implementation focused especially on developing the customer experience  improving customer satisfaction and retention  and ensuring an excellent moving-in experience. We prepared a sustainability programme for 2023‚Äì2026  which is based on feedback from our stakeholders  such as personnel  customers and partners. The themes of the sustainability programme are sustainable housing  thriving communities and sustainable profitability. In our own sustainability goals  we have committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). With regard to our personnel  we focused on supporting work well-being and developing an inspiring employee experience  competence and a coaching management style.SATO has set maintaining its investment grade credit rating as a strategic goal. Our return on equity target is 8%. In addition  our strategic goal is to achieve a continuously improving Net Promoter Score (NPS) from our residents.According to SATO‚Äôs dividend policy  a maximum of 40% of the cash flow from operations will be paid in annual dividends  depending on the market situation  investment level  the development of the equity ratio and the solvency ratio.Net sales and profitIn 2022  consolidated net sales were EUR 291.2 million (298.3).Operating profit was EUR 198.9 million (304.5). The operating profit without the fair value change of investment properties was EUR 213.8 million (175.4). The change in fair value was EUR -14.9 million (129.1).Net financing costs totalled EUR -47.0 million (-45.1).Profit before taxes was EUR 151.9 million (259.4). Cash flow from operations (free cash flow after taxes excluding changes in fair value) amounted to EUR 141.3 million (107.9).Earnings per share were EUR 2.13 (3.64).Financial position and financingThe consolidated balance sheet totalled EUR 5 184.7 million (5 091.4) at the end of December. Equity was EUR 2 480.9 million (2 351.3). Equity per share was EUR 43.82 (41.53).The Group‚Äôs equity ratio was 47.8% (46.2) at the end of the year. EUR 137.3 million in new long-term financing was withdrawn and the solvency ratio was 40.7% (42.5) at the end of December.The Group‚Äôs return on equity was 5.0% (9.1). Return on invested capital was 4.3% (6.7).Cash and cash equivalents at the end of December totalled EUR 60.5 million (8.5). Interest-bearing liabilities at the end of December totalled EUR 2 145.7 million (2 169.5)  of which loans subject to market terms accounted for EUR 1 991.3 million (1 994.5). The loan itemisation is in note 26 of the financial statements. At the end of the reporting year  the average loan interest rate was 2.3% (1.7). Net financing costs totalled EUR -47.0 million(-45.1). The average maturity of loans was 3.3 years (4.0).The calculated impact of changes in the market value of interest hedging on equity was EUR 48.1 million (15.1). During the reporting year  SATO increased the proportion of unsecured loans to 88.1% of all loans. At the end of the year  the proportion of unencumbered assets was 89.2% of the balance sheet.Group structureSATO Corporation is the parent company of SATO Group. At the end of the reporting year  the parent company had a total of 21 subsidiaries engaged in business operations (23). Mergers took place during the year in order to clarify the Group structure.SATO Corporation‚Äôs majority shareholder is Balder Finska Otas AB  whose parent company is Fastighets AB Balder  which is quoted on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.Housing businessOur housing business includes rental activities  customer service  lifecycle management and maintenance. Effective rental activities and digital services provide home-seekers with quick access to a home  and the Group with a steadily increasing cash flow. High-quality maintenance operations ensure the comfort of residents and that the apartments stay in good condition and maintain their value. We serve our customers in daily housing issues through our customer-oriented service organisation.The competition between rental housing providers has become tighter  as a large volume of new rental apartments have been built in growth centres  especially in the Helsinki metropolitan area  in recent years. Tenants now have a wide array of choices and a successful customer experience is more important than ever. We try to respond to this challenge by adjusting the organisation and our service processes. We want to be closely involved in our customers‚Äô daily lives in order to serve them in the best possible way.During the reporting year we expanded the house expert model further in the Helsinki metropolitan area. At the end of the year  SATO employed 62 house experts and the model is now in use to its full extent in the Helsinki metropolitan area  Tampere and Turku. The house experts take care of the technical building work on homes and buildings. The purpose of our house expert operating model is to create a better customer experience and more efficient maintenance.SATO had approximately 45 000 customers at the end of the reporting year. We measure our successes in customer encounters using the Net Promoter Score (NPS). Our customer satisfaction improved during the reporting year. We clarified and simplified the processes and operating models related to the customer experience and focused especially on building a harmonised and seamless service experience. We invested in developing digital services  as well as our presence near to the customers. We also established closer collaboration between SATO employees working at our residents‚Äô buildings and improved internal communications.The economic occupancy rate improved compared to the previous year and was 95.2% (94.9) on average in Finland. The external tenant turnover rate for rental apartments was 28.4% (31.2). Rental income decreased 2.4% and was EUR 291.2 million (298.3).The average monthly rent of SATO‚Äôs rental apartments in Finland at the end of the reporting year was EUR 17.84 per m2 (17.46).Net rental income for apartments was EUR 200.4 million (210.6).Investment propertiesOn 31 December 2022  SATO owned a total of 24 999 apartments (26 791). Altogether 191 rental apartments were completed and 1 was acquired. The total number of divested rental apartments was 2 021  of which 2 009 rental apartments were sold to the Swedish investment company Heimstaden.Fair valueThe development of the value of rental apartments is a key factor for SATO. The housing stock is focussed on areas and apartment sizes that are expected to grow in demand in the long term. The allocation of building repairs is based on life-cycle plans and repair need specifications.The fair value of investment properties at the end of December totalled EUR 5 044.2 million (5 032.8). The change in the value of investment properties  including investments and divestments in the financial year  was EUR 11.4 million (279.3).The external expert JLL Finland Oy (JLL) issues a biannual statement on the valuation methods applied by SATO  the appropriateness of sources of information used and the quality and credibility of the valuation for Finnish investment properties. JLL‚Äôs latest statement was issued on the valuation carried out on 31 December 2022. The criteria for the determination of the fair value are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.The change in value was influenced by the increase in yield requirements and the decrease in the fair value of St. Petersburg housing assets.At the end of the year  the Helsinki metropolitan area‚Äôs commuting area accounted for 87.3%  Tampere for 6.4% and Turku for 5.1%  and St. Petersburg for roughly 1.2% of the value of apartments.Investments  divestments and property developmentInvestment activities are used to manage the housing portfolio and prepare the ground for growth. SATO‚Äôs investments in the 2000s in non-subsidised rental apartments total more than EUR 3 billion. SATO acquires and builds entire rental buildings and single rental apartments. Property development allows for new investments in rental apartments in Finland. The rental potential and value of rental apartments owned by SATO are developed through renovation activities.Investments in rental apartments were EUR 190.5 million (167.1). Investments in the Helsinki metropolitan area represented 84.0% of all investments in the reporting year. Investments in new apartments represented 57.1% of the investments. In addition  on 31 December 2022  binding purchase agreements in Finland totalled EUR 114.3 million (96.8).During the reporting year  2 021 rental apartments (26) were divested in Finland. Their total value was EUR 210.6 million (7.9). In April of the reporting year  we sold 2 009 rental apartments mainly in the Lahti  Jyv√§skyl√§ and Oulu areas to the Swedish investment company Heimstaden. The sale was consistent with our strategy based on which SATO is focusing its apartment investments on the Helsinki metropolitan area and its commuting area along the main railway  and in Tampere and Turku and their surrounding municipalities.The book value of plot reserves totalled EUR 40.8 million (43.4) at the end of December. The value of new plots acquired by the end of December totalled EUR 18.4 million (15.5).The permitted building volume for about 1 450 apartments is being developed for the plots in the company‚Äôs housing portfolio. This allows SATO to utilise existing infrastructure  create a denser urban structure and thus bring more customers closer to services and public transport connections.We collaborate with cities when areas are being developed and new housing is planned for them. As a long-term owner  housing investor and housing provider  SATO wants to build nice homes  residential areas and pleasant urban areas for decades to come. During the reporting year  we continued the development of the Hakunila area in Vantaa and Finnoo in Espoo  for example. In Helsinki  we were involved in planning the Mellunpuisto project in Mellunkyl√§ and we continued our collaboration with VR to develop the area it owns in Ilmala. During the reporting year  plots in complementary planning areas developed by SATO were sold to construction companies and other partners  enabling the construction of approximately 175‚àí200 owner-occupied apartments and roughly 25 state-subsidised rental apartments  thus promoting a diverse residential area and urban structure.In May 2022  construction of non-subsidised rental apartments began in Rykmentinpuisto in Tuusula. The area is a collaboration by several parties and the area will include different types of housing. SATO is building 92 non-subsidised rental apartments in the area. The Rykmentinpuisto Pataljoonantie project is SATO‚Äôs first new apartment investment in Tuusula in more than 15 years.In August 2022  SATO signed a deed to buy from Lujatalo an apartment building which is being built in Skanssi  Turku. The eight-storey building under construction at the address Sorakatu 9 will have 77 new rental apartments. This is SATO‚Äôs first new apartment investment in Turku in five years. Construction was begun in August 2022 and the apartments will be ready for residents at the end of 2023.We are building 257 new rental apartments at Peijinkuja in Finnoo  Espoo. Construction began in August 2022 and the apartments will be completed in stages during autumn 2024. The project is based on long-term development work in which we drew up a new local plan with the City of Espoo for a property that SATO owns in the old low-rise area of Hannus  which formerly featured terraced houses. The area is being transformed into a new area called Finnoo. SATO‚Äôs goal is to continue developing the Finnoo area in the future.During the reporting year  new rental apartments were finished on Lupajantie in Mellunm√§ki  Helsinki and on Jokiniityntie in Kirkkonummi.Due to rising construction  maintenance and financing costs and the moderate rent development resulting from the competitive situation  we made a decision to refrain from launching new construction projects and we are postponing their launch.In 2022  we completed 191 rental apartments (235) and 0 owner-occupied apartments (71) and 52 FlexHomes (0) in Finland. On 31 December 2022  a total of 1 418 apartments (1 152) were under construction: 1 418 rental apartments (1 100) and 0 owner-occupied apartments (0) and 0 FlexHomes (52). FlexHome is a short-term ownership concept that enables home ownership with a small initial capital outlay and which the resident can purchase entirely for themselves within five years of completion.A total of EUR 92.4 million (93.6) was spent on repairing and upgrading apartments.At the end of December  SATO owned 522 apartments (525) in St. Petersburg. The economic occupancy rate of rental apartments in St. Petersburg was 92.4% (97.7) on average. Since the start of the war in Ukraine  we have been reviewing opportunities to withdraw from the Russian business operations. Based on our studies  a fast withdrawal is not possible. For this reason  SATO will continue to rent residential apartments in St. Petersburg until a way to withdraw has been found. The company is actively seeking a solution.SustainabilityOur sustainability work during the reporting year was guided by SATO‚Äôs strategy and our sustainability programme for 2019‚Äì2022  which emphasised carbon-neutral cities and the well-being of residents and neighbourhoods.Due to the energy crisis resulting from the war in Ukraine  we increased the efficiency of our energy saving measures and paid more attention to the temperatures of apartments than earlier. We monitor and regulate the heating of some 21 000 SATOhomes using AI. Our goal is to maintain a temperature of approximately 21 degrees in SATOhomes  which is a healthy and energy-efficient indoor temperature. In addition to our own energy saving measures  we actively provided our residents with guidance on energy saving opportunities in their day-to-day lives. At the end of the year  we provided our residents with instructions on how to prepare for possible blackouts in the exceptional energy situation.During the reporting year  we launched a development project related to waste and sorting  in which we surveyed our homes‚Äô waste-collection points and inspected their lighting  the number of waste bins and signage. Based on the survey  we targeted repairs at the sites that needed them and they will continue in upcoming years. Our housing advisors‚Äô tours focused on waste guidance during the year. We pilot tested a clothing collection point on Kauppakartanonkatu in Helsinki‚Äôs It√§keskus.Some of our sustainable development measures are described below under ‚ÄòImpacts on the environment and society‚Äô.In the autumn of 2022  an external sustainability panel chose six of SATO‚Äôs rental apartment buildings to be among the Ostavastuullisesti.fi website‚Äôs more sustainable choices. SATO was the first rental housing provider to be included in the Ostavastuullisesti.fi service. Our following buildings were assessed to be a more sustainable choice: Lupajantie 2 in Mellunkyl√§  Helsinki; Jokiniityntie 28 in Kirkkonummi; Lincolninaukio 4 in Keimola  Vantaa; Kotkatie 6 in Espoo and Jokiniementie 46 and 48 in Ver√§j√§m√§ki  Helsinki.In 2022  we took part in Rakli‚Äôs newly launched Green Homes activities. At the end of 2022  we had altogether 1 100 Green Homes which had either geothermal heat or consumption-based water invoicing or both.We participated for the eighth time in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) assessment. SATO received two stars on a scale of one to five. SATO‚Äôs score in the Standing Investments Benchmark (existing properties) fell by one point from last year (score now at 73)  while in the Development Benchmark (construction projects) SATO‚Äôs score rose to 75 points from 71 points last year. We report on our sustainability annually in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative‚Äôs (GRI) reporting guidelines  and the environmental sustainability figures presented in the report have been verified by an independent third party  i.e. KPMG Oy Ab.During the reporting year  we collaborated on a project with the non-profit organisations No Fixed Abode and the Rehabilitation Foundation to help participants in the project find two of life‚Äôs essentials ‚Äì a home and a job. By the end of 2022  10 people who had participated in the project were living in a SATOhome.During 2022  we updated the materiality analysis and released a new sustainability programme for 2023‚Äì2026. Our vision is to be a leader in sustainable rental housing during the programme period.In 2020 we committed to reporting in compliance with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and in 2021  we conducted an extensive assessment of the risks and opportunities arising from climate change for SATO‚Äôs entire supply chain. In the framework  the risks are divided into four main categories: transition risks  acute and chronic physical risks and social risks. At the same time  we carried out a scenario analysis to look into how the two- and four-degree scenarios affect society and how SATO should prepare for these changes. During the reporting year  risks caused by climate change were part of SATO‚Äôs general risk assessment that is conducted internally each year. In 2022  two reports were made to SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors on climate risks and opportunities and their impact.The Corporate Governance Statement is published separately from the Report of the Board of Directors. SATO‚Äôs Corporate Governance Statement  Code of Conduct and sustainability programme are available at sato.fi.Impacts on the environment and societyOur objective is to systematically reduce the negative impacts of our operations on the environment. We reduce the load on the environment by regularly and proactively taking care of and repairing homes and properties according to the life-cycle principle  and by building properties primarily in existing urban environments and near good public transport connections.The planning of SATO‚Äôs new rental apartments always takes into account energy efficiency and solutions that will last for decades. In new properties  SATO‚Äôs goal is energy class A (energy performance indicator 75 or below)  which is significantly better than that required by the building code (energy performance indicator 90). All of the buildings that were completed during the reporting year were energy class A. The average EPI for buildings begun during 2022 was 72 and all of the housing starts are energy class A.We are committed to the Energy Efficiency Agreement targets for the property sector  aiming for a reduction in the total consumption of electricity and heat of 10.5% from the 2015 baseline by 2025.The use of renewable energy in heating significantly reduces the in-use emissions of homes. At every new building and renovation site  we look into the possibility of geothermal heat. We currently have 17 properties that are carbon neutral in terms of electricity and heating. During the reporting year  geothermal heat was being built on 12 properties. In addition  six properties had a solar power plant and solar power plants were being built on nine properties. In 2022  building electricity consisted entirely of emission-free electricity.During 2022  SATO converted the heating system to geothermal heat at the last properties which still had fossil-fuel-based heating  thus taking us a significant step closer to our goal of achieving in-use carbon neutrality.Vantaa Energy and SATO signed an energy partnership agreement in February 2022. Together with Vantaa Energy  we are developing carbon-neutral energy solutions for buildings‚Äô heating and cooling  which will help us achieve our carbon neutrality target by 2030 for in-use energy consumption.During the reporting year  we continued to invest in energy efficiency improvements in SATOhomes in connection with renovations. In renovations  our goal is to improve energy efficiency by some 30% compared to earlier. Due to the rise in heating and electricity prices  energy costs rose overall.During the reporting year  specific energy consumption fell 4.1%  specific electricity consumption rose 7.1% and specific water consumption fell 2.0% compared to 2021. Specific emissions from SATO‚Äôs apartments fell by 9.3% compared to 2021 and were 28.2 (31.1) carbon dioxide equivalent kilograms per square metre. Emissions are calculated according to the absolute consumption of district heat. Electricity was generated from emission-free nuclear power.According to the Ministry of the Environment  the built environment causes approximately one third of Finland‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions. The construction industry  together with the real estate sector and their related services  employ more than half a million people and bring in tax revenues for society. The construction industry does  however  have negative impacts not only on the environment  but also society and people. Some well-known examples of the construction industry‚Äôs negative impacts are the grey economy  occupational safety and human rights-related violations  as well as irregularities in procurement and delivery chains. We regularly assess and predict the social  economic and environmental risks related to our operations. We try to systematically reduce the identified negative impacts  for example by following our Code of Conduct  by combating the grey economy  by conducting audits and internal control  and by continuously developing our operations. During 2022  we decided to survey the current state of our compliance function in order to gain an overall picture of our policies and commitments.SATO has a whistleblowing channel through which SATO employees and external stakeholders can anonymously report critical concerns.The Group‚Äôs sustainability programme is available in its entirety at sato.fi.Development activitiesSATO‚Äôs development activities during the reporting year focused on developing sales and customer experience processes and operating models  the renewal of the invoicing processes and improving the continuous development operating model. We invested in developing digital services  as well as our presence near to the customers  and in building a uniform and seamless service experience. Our goal is to serve our customers in the best way possible  regardless of time or place.Based on customer feedback  we also developed  during the reporting year  our processes involving the rental of a new home. The changes made daily work more efficient for our rental team  which also means even better service for our customers. We revamped the reservation of apartment viewings to make them more flexible for the customer and to pilot test the online reservation of viewings no matter the time or place. The apartment viewings were mostly held by our own viewing agents. We updated the apartment application process on the sato.fi website and in 2022 made it possible for our customers to apply for homes using the ‚Äòmore sustainable option‚Äô search criterion.In our development operations last year  we also focused on renewing the invoicing processes and we piloted a new invoicing system in summer 2022. The new system offers better opportunities to view up-to-date invoicing information and the plan is to roll it out in full in spring 2023.In developing the business  we adopted a continuous development model at SATO during the reporting year. We defined the roles related to the model and will develop the activities as smaller components rather than large units  which will speed up development work and allow processes to be improved more effectively.A total of EUR 3.2 million (3.2) was spent on development  corresponding to approximately 1.1% of net sales.Risk managementRisk management is used to ensure that risks impacting the company‚Äôs business are identified  managed and monitored. The main risks of SATO‚Äôs business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.SATO‚Äôs most significant risks are related to prolonged inflation and the resulting rise in interest rates. As a result of the war in Ukraine  the prices of energy  food  materials and commodities have increased dramatically and interest rates have risen. Higher cost of living can have a negative impact on consumers‚Äô purchasing power and ability to meet their obligations. If the strong growth in the cost of financing and maintenance costs continues and the market situation does not provide an opportunity to transfer the higher costs into rents in full  this can have a negative impact on the fair value of investment assets and the company‚Äôs ability to finance investments  which means that new investments and renovations will have to be postponed.The most significant risks in the renting of apartments are related to economic cycles and fluctuations in demand and supply. Market risk can increase the supply of rental housing to a point that it exceeds demand. This leads to rental housing vacancies and pressure to even out or lower the rent level especially for the old housing portfolio.A clear weakening in the housing market could have a negative impact on the market value of SATO‚Äôs housing portfolio. In accordance with its strategy  SATO focuses its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing its existing housing portfolio  thus ensuring the rental potential of its apartments and the development of their value.Changes in official regulations and legislation  as well as the uncertainty stemming from them  may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and thus on SATO‚Äôs business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and also calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group‚Äôs treasury policy  which has been approved by SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors. Our financial risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other long-term financing commitments. The company established a EUR 1.5 billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) bond programme in 2019.The means for managing the liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  committed credit facilities of EUR 700 million and a commercial paper programme of EUR 400 million. We increase the amount of reserves as the financing requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating rate loans form an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed and floating rate loans either by issuing fixed rate loans or by interest rate hedges. According to our treasury policy  our objective is to keep the ratio of fixed rate loans at over 60 % of debt portfolio after interest hedging.There are risks related to the business environment in our St. Petersburg operations  including currency risk. The consolidation of foreign currency-denominated assets in the consolidated financial statements also involves a translation risk. Possibilities of hedging the translation risk are evaluated in accordance with our financial policy. SATO has abstained from making new investments in Russia for a long time. Since the start of the war in Ukraine  the company has been reviewing opportunities to withdraw from the Russian business operations. Based on our studies  a fast withdrawal is not possible  which is why SATO will continue to rent residential apartments in St. Petersburg until a way to withdraw has been found. The company is actively seeking a solution. The Russian operating environment is expected to be extremely uncertain and it may cause disturbances in SATO‚Äôs business operations in Russia and with parties related to the Russian business. This can affect SATO‚Äôs ability to make payments to suppliers  its employees and authorities  and to receive payments from customers  which can have a significant adverse impact on SATO‚Äôs business operations in Russia. If the Ukraine war is prolonged  doing business in Russia may have a negative impact on the company‚Äôs reputation and it may make doing business difficult in Finland and weaken the company‚Äôs ability to procure financing on the market. It may also have an adverse impact on the financial result or operations of SATO‚Äôs properties  not to mention on financing costs or values.A more detailed description of risks and risk management is available on the Group‚Äôs website www.sato.fi.Pending legal actionsSATO has no official procedures  legal actions or arbitration proceedings pending that would have a significant impact on the company‚Äôs financial standing or profitability  and SATO is not aware of any threat of such proceedings.SharesOn 31 December 2022  the share capital of SATO Corporation was EUR 4 442 192.00 and there were 56 783 067 shares.

If a shareholder chooses not to exercise their nomination right  the right will pass on to the next largest shareholder. The State Pension Fund  the company‚Äôs fourth largest shareholder on 1 October 2022  did not exercise its nomination right  and the right was passed to Erkka Valkila  the fifth largest shareholder. The Committee consisted of representatives of the following shareholders: Balder Finska Otas AB (Erik Selin)  Stichting Depositary APG Strategic Real Estate Pool (Hans Spikker)  Elo Mutual Pension Insurance Company (Hanna Hiidenpalo) and Erkka Valkila.Board of Directors  CEO and auditorsThe Annual General Meeting held on 24 March 2022 confirmed that the Board of Directors consists of six members.In 2022  the members of SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors were chairman Erik Selin and ordinary members Esa Lager  Tarja P√§√§kk√∂nen  Sharam Rahi  Johannus (Hans) Spikker and Timo Stenius.The Board of Directors convened 11 times in 2022. The Board‚Äôs work is supported by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.In 2022  Antti Aarnio  M.Sc. (Tech.)  was SATO‚Äôs CEO.As the company‚Äôs auditor  the Annual General Meeting selected the audit firm Deloitte Oy  which appointed APA Aleksi Martamo as the auditor in charge. The auditor‚Äôs term in office is the financial year  and the auditor‚Äôs duties end at the closing of the next Annual General Meeting.Members of the Management GroupDuring the reporting period 2022  the Corporate Management Group consisted of Antti Aarnio  CEO  Arto Aalto  EVP  Investments  Markku Honkasalo  CFO  Janne Ojalehto  CCO (until 27 January 2023) and Elina Vaurasalo  EVP  Housing Business.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO‚Äôs business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence  the development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  the general competitive situation and interest rates.Employment development was strong in early 2022  but slowed down towards year-end due to economic challenges. During the reporting year  consumers‚Äô confidence weakened to a historically low level after the start of the year  which showed in private consumption. According to the projection made by the Bank of Finland on 16 December 2022  Finland‚Äôs economic growth in 2022 will be 1.9% due to the good start to the year. In 2023  the increase in energy prices and the cost of living is predicted to cause the economy to slide into a slight downturn and shrink by 0.5%.Uncertainty and rising interest rates are slowing housing sales. According to the statistics released by the Central Federation of Finnish Real Estate Agencies in December 2022  sales volumes of new and old apartments clearly fell in November compared to the five-year average. According to Statistics Finland‚Äôs preliminary data in December  the prices of old owner-occupied apartments fell in November 2022 in the whole of Finland by 3.4% compared to November of the previous year.The economic situation will decelerate the historically high rate of construction. The number of issued building permits began to fall already in 2021  but plenty of new apartments were and will be completed in 2022 and 2023  which is maintaining tight competition for good tenants and keeping rent increases moderate. The increased cost level resulting from inflation does  however  create pressure to increase rents in the future.The lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and improving employment resulted in a positive turnaround in internal migration to large growth centres in 2022 and demand for rental apartments has begun to grow. This  and SATO‚Äôs investments in making renting more efficient and improving customer service  were visible as an increase in SATO‚Äôs occupancy rate. Also  economic uncertainty  upward pressure on interest rates and increasing consumer prices contributed to the increase in the demand for rental apartments.As tenants have a wider array of choices  a successful customer experience is more important than ever. SATO is investing strongly in increasing its customer presence and developing digital services.In line with its majority shareholder‚Äôs operating model  SATO Corporation will not publish guidance on its 2023 earnings.

With effect from 22 March 2018  the Numis Smaller Companies plus AIM (excluding Investment Companies) Index replaced the Numis Smaller Companies excluding AIM (excluding Investment Companies) Index as the Company‚Äôs Benchmark Index. From 1 December 2013 to 21 March 2018  the Company‚Äôs Benchmark Index was the Numis Smaller Companies excluding AIM (excluding Investment Companies) Index. Prior to 1 December 2013  the Company‚Äôs Benchmark Index was the Numis Smaller Companies plus AIM (excluding Investment Companies) Index. The performance of the Benchmark Indices during these periods has been blended to reflect these changes. CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT YEAR‚ÄôS HIGHLIGHTS NAV underperformed the Benchmark Index over one year by 13.6 percentage points;Share price underperformed the Benchmark Index over one year by 18.0 percentage points;Stronger NAV performance in the six months to 30 November 2022   outperforming the Benchmark Index by 2.4 percentage points;1 773 900 new shares were issued for a total consideration of ¬£16 550 000 and 2 051 000 ordinary shares were bought back into treasury for a total consideration of ¬£11 544 000  helping to reduce the volatility of the Company‚Äôs share rating;Share Price has remained close to NAV through most of a challenging year  trading at an average discount of -3.5%; andFinal dividend declared of 8.50p per share (2021: 8.00p) (All returns are in Sterling terms with dividends reinvested.) OVERVIEWIn the Half-Yearly Report  the Board recognised that it had been a particularly challenging period  the NAV having underperformed the benchmark by 16.9 percentage points over the six months to 31 May 2022. Our Manager‚Äôs growth style remained firmly out of favour throughout as investors switched allocations from strongly performing growth companies into energy  lower growth value and defensive stocks. The market rotation witnessed in the first quarter of 2022 therefore saw many of our high-quality growth portfolio holdings de-rate sharply and in many cases  with no material change in the investment thesis  trading or outlook. However  the Company has had a stronger second half of the financial year  regaining some ground and outperforming the index by 2.4 percentage points. This meant the full year result was largely a product of the underperformance seen in the first six months of the year. For the year to 30 November 2022  the Company‚Äôs NAV underperformed the benchmark by 13.6 percentage points. MARKET BACKGROUNDIn my report to shareholders this time last year  the UK had led the developed world with a successful vaccine roll-out and there was  to some extent  a degree of optimism as the spectre of COVID-19 dissipated and economic activity returned to more normal levels. However  although the uncertainty caused by COVID-19 related lockdowns had been removed  there were indications that there had been more longer-term structural damage to the UK economy. This damage became evident as companies reported supply chain bottle necks  labour shortages and rising operating costs  which were either absorbed  or in many cases  passed onto the consumer. As the UK economy struggled with the challenge of transitioning from a COVID-19 driven demand for goods over services model  to a more balanced goods and services-based economy  this supply pressure inevitably led to rising prices and in turn rising inflation. These inflationary forces were then exacerbated by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine in early 2022  triggering an energy supply shock  with Europe being hit hardest given its reliance on Russian gas. The resultant spike in wholesale energy prices  coupled with price hikes for agricultural commodities  pushed up the cost of many food staples  driving up two of the key elements of inflation to levels not seen in over 40 years. The notion of ‚Äòtransitionary inflation‚Äô was now firmly discredited and inflation not only persisted but continued to rise unabated throughout the financial year. At the time of writing UK inflation  as measured by the Consumer Price Index  is at 9.2%  having peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. The Bank of England took decisive action to combat soaring inflation by reiterating its commitment to the 2% inflation target ‚Äúat all costs‚Äù and implemented tighter monetary policy through several interest rate hikes during the year. Similar action was seen globally  as central banks sought to unwind decades of accommodating monetary policy resulting in excess market liquidity which has acted to stoke inflation. However  this action has negatively impacted UK growth forecasts and raised the likelihood of a more prolonged economic recession. The stock market responded by adjusting valuations downward to reflect this more challenging economic back drop and the compounding effect of a weakening pound  higher input costs and rising wages on corporate profit margins. This downward revaluation was particularly acute in the high-quality growth stocks within our portfolio  and many were materially re-rated  despite posting strong results and material trading updates. PERFORMANCEThe Board has been in close dialogue with our investment manager  Dan Whitestone  throughout the year. He has approached this challenging backdrop by reducing gearing in the portfolio  while continuing to focus on the high quality  financially strong  highly profitable  cash generative growth companies that can weather the storm and deliver for shareholders over the longer term. Over the twelve months to 30 November 2022  the Company‚Äôs NAV returned -31.1%  compared with a total return of -17.5% from the Company‚Äôs Benchmark Index  the Numis Smaller Companies plus AIM (excluding Investment Companies) Index  an underperformance of 13.6 percentage points. At the share price level  the return was -35.5%  resulting in an underperformance against the benchmark index of 18.0 percentage points during the year as the Company‚Äôs discount to NAV moved from a premium of 1.4% at the start of the financial year to a discount of 5.0% at the period end. This underperformance of the Benchmark Index will be very disappointing for shareholders but the Board is reassured by a stronger second half of the year in which our investment manager recouped some of the underperformance versus our benchmark index  outperforming the index by 2.4 percentage points. Moreover  as you will read in the Investment Manager‚Äôs report which follows  our portfolio manager is firmly of the view that the share price weakness experienced in the portfolio is not reflective of a material deterioration in the investment case for the stocks but a reflection of the market turbulence of 2022  where companies with higher growth prospects and more expensive valuations fell harder. This weak one year return should also be viewed in the context of strong results last year  with the Company returning +37.0%  and the longer-term performance delivered by the Company. Our NAV return has underperformed the Benchmark Index by -3.7% over three years  outperformed by 19.9% over five years and by 108.3% over ten years. The share price underperformed the Benchmark Index by -9.8% over three years  outperformed by 36.1% over five years and 166.2% over ten years. (All percentages calculated in Sterling terms with dividends reinvested.) As at close of business on 7 February 2023  the Company‚Äôs NAV had increased by 6.0%  compared to the Benchmark Index which increased by 3.7%. The share price over the same period increased by 9.2%. Further information on portfolio performance  positioning and the outlook for the forthcoming year can be found in the Investment Manager‚Äôs report below. I would like to take this opportunity to assure shareholders that although our full year results have been disappointing  both the Board and our Manager remain focused on achieving the Company‚Äôs objectives of providing shareholders with long-term capital growth and an attractive total return and remain confident in the investment approach and process. We thank shareholders for your loyalty and support. POLICY ON SHARE PRICE DISCOUNT/PREMIUMWe recognise that a widening of  and volatility in  the Company‚Äôs discount is viewed by some investors as a key disadvantage of investments trusts. The Board believes that the best way to address any discount over the longer term is to generate good performance and to create demand for the Company‚Äôs shares in the secondary market through effective marketing to drive awareness of the Company‚Äôs unique structure  robust investment process and long term investment track record in an attractive sector that is difficult to navigate. In support of this activity  and where deemed to be in shareholders‚Äô long-term interests  the Board may exercise its powers to issue or buy back shares with the objective of ensuring that neither an excessive discount or premium to NAV arises. The Board considers several factors in determining whether the discount or premium to NAV at which the Company‚Äôs shares trade is excessive or otherwise. These may include but are not limited to: whether the share rating is commensurate with the peer group of UK Smaller Companies and whether the Company‚Äôs shares are trading in normal market conditions; the ongoing attractiveness of the investment proposition  in particular the strength of the portfolio management team and process; and the strong long-term performance delivered for shareholders  both in absolute and relative terms. SHARE ISSUANCE AND BUY BACK ACTIVITYDuring the year to 30 November 2022 the Company‚Äôs share rating ranged between a discount to NAV of 14.3% and a premium to NAV of 2.7% and ended the year at a discount of 5.0% (30 November 2021: premium of 1.4%). The 12-month average discount as at 30 November 2022 was 3.5% (average premium 2021: 1.2%). During the first three months of the financial year  the Company issued a total of 1 773 900 new shares in response to market demand (2021: 13 917 035)  for a total consideration of ¬£16 550 000 including costs. As the UK equity market declined after Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine  the Company‚Äôs share rating moved from a premium to a discount to NAV and continued to widen. Following consultation with the Manager and the Company‚Äôs corporate broker  the Board determined that it was in shareholders‚Äô interests to buy back shares with the objective of ensuring that an excessive discount to NAV did not arise. The Company subsequently bought back a total of 2 051 000 ordinary shares for a total consideration of ¬£11 757 360. All shares were bought back at a discount to the prevailing NAV  were therefore accretive to existing shareholders  and were placed into Treasury for future re-issue. Since 30 November 2022 and up to the latest practicable date of 7 February 2023  a further 45 000 shares have been bought back for a total consideration of ¬£276 000. As at this date  the Company‚Äôs shares were trading at a discount of 2.0%. Despite what has been a challenging and volatile year  it is pleasing that the Company‚Äôs share rating has been relatively stable and has traded within a fairly tight range for most of the year. The Board believes that the issuance and buy back activity undertaken has been beneficial in reducing the volatility of our share rating and has been in shareholders‚Äô interest. As set out in the most recent Annual and Half Yearly reports  the extent and speed of further share issuance  especially given the recent volatility in markets  will be kept under review and there can therefore be no certainty that issuance will continue at the same level as it has in the past. As it does each year  the Board will once again seek at the Company‚Äôs Annual General Meeting (AGM) to renew the authorities granted by shareholders to issue or buy back shares. We encourage shareholders to vote in favour of these resolutions which are described in more detail in the Director‚Äôs Report contained within the Annual Report and Financial Statements. REVENUE RETURN AND DIVIDENDSThe revenue return per share for the year amounted to 12.95 pence per share  compared with 12.15 pence per share for the previous year. The Board recognises that  although the Company‚Äôs objective is capital growth  shareholders value consistency in the dividends paid by the Company; the Directors are therefore pleased to declare a proposed final dividend of 8.50 pence per share for the year ended 30 November 2022 (2021: 8.00p). This  together with the interim dividend of 2.60 pence per share paid on 26 August 2022  would give a total dividend for the year of 11.10 pence per share  increasing the total dividend distributed to shareholders in the prior financial year. This dividend will be paid on 31 March 2023  subject to shareholder approval at the forthcoming AGM  to shareholders on the Company‚Äôs register on 24 February 2023. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERSAs I mentioned in my Chairman‚Äôs statement in the Half-yearly Report  the Board recognises the benefits of diversity  including that of ethnicity  and in 2022 has complied with the Parker Review recommendation that FTSE 350 companies have at least one director from an ethnically diverse background by 2024. The Board has also considered the recommendations of the BEIS-sponsored FTSE Women Leaders Review. The review set new targets for FTSE 350 companies which are designed to achieve boards with 40% female representation (previously 33%) and at least one woman in the role of Chair or Senior Independent Director on the board by the end of 2025. I am pleased to report that the Board is now fully compliant with the recommendations of the Parker Review and the FTSE Women Leaders Review and following the conclusion of the AGM will have a 50:50 gender ratio. For the first time this year  we have also disclosed  amongst other data  the ethnicity of the Board. The disclosure can be found contained within the Annual Report and Financial Statements. As it does each year  and as required by the Corporate Governance Code  the Company undertook a comprehensive external Board evaluation this year. This resulted in a small number of proposals that the Company will adopt  notwithstanding that the overall conclusion was very positive in terms of the effectiveness of the Board  the skills  expertise and commitment of the Directors. The combination of our succession plan and structured search and selection process through which the Board identifies new appointments to the Board and the annual Board evaluation of their ongoing performance means that the Board remains confident that each Director is effectively discharging their role. The Board is also cognisant of the concept of ‚Äúoverboarding‚Äù and has considered the time commitment required by the Directors‚Äô other roles  taking into account their nature and complexity. The Board reviews this information annually for each Director  including my own as Chairman of the Board  to ensure that all Directors have sufficient capacity to carry out their role effectively. Before recommending a Director for re-election  their independence  attendance record and ongoing commitment to the affairs of the Company is also considered. A formal evaluation of the performance of the Board is also carried out each year  assisted by an external third party firm. Further information on the evaluation of the performance of the Board can be found within the Annual Report and Financial Statements. BOARD COMPOSITION AND DIVERSITYThe Board regularly considers its composition and that of its committees and has an ongoing succession plan in place designed to ensure that it retains an appropriate balance of skills  knowledge  experience  independence and diversity that meets or exceeds relevant best practice and the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code  including guidance on tenure and the composition of the Board‚Äôs committees. In accordance with the Board‚Äôs succession plan  and to continue to ensure we retain the experience  expertise and diversity that is expected of a company in the FTSE 250  the Board  through its Nomination Committee  agreed a search process to identify a new director using a third-party recruitment firm  Fletcher Jones. The Nomination Committee determined the selection criteria  the method of selection  and the recruitment and appointment process. Board diversity  including that of age  ethnicity and gender  was taken into account when establishing the search criteria and candidate profile. Following the completion of a thorough search and selection process  which identified several very high calibre candidates  I am delighted to welcome Glen Suarez to the Board. Glen was appointed on 9 January 2023 and brings a wealth of relevant industry knowledge and experience. He is a highly experienced Non-executive Director and Chairman and his appointment further strengthens and diversifies the existing board. Glen will also serve on the Company‚Äôs Audit  Nomination  Remuneration and Management Engagement Committees  and his appointment is subject to approval by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM. Further details of Glen‚Äôs background and experience  and that of all the Directors  can be found in their biographies contained within the Annual Report and Financial Statements. The Board‚Äôs policy on Board diversity and associated data can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement contained within the Annual Report and Financial Statements. Following nine years of diligent service on the Board  and having also chaired the Company‚Äôs Audit Committee during his tenure  Loudon Greenlees has advised the Board he will step down as a Director of the Company at the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Loudon for his invaluable contribution to the ongoing success of the Company  his wise counsel during his tenure  and in particular for his leadership of the Company‚Äôs Audit Committee  an important and demanding role which he has discharged to great effect over many years. In preparation for Loudon‚Äôs departure  the Board  through its Nomination Committee  has appointed Angela Lane as his successor and she will take on the role from the conclusion of the AGM. Angela is both an experienced Non-executive Director and Audit Committee Chairman. She has recent and relevant experience and is a Chartered Accountant. As a result  Angela stood down as Chairman of the Company‚Äôs Remuneration Committee and was succeeded in this role by Nigel Burton with effect from 1 December 2022. At the time of writing  and to facilitate an orderly transition  the Board consists of seven independent Non-executive Directors  a higher number than usual. This will reduce to six following Loudon‚Äôs retirement at the AGM. The Board will continue to keep its composition under close review. OUR APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL  SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) INTEGRATIONConsideration of material ESG issues is built into our Manager‚Äôs investment process and climate risk is considered to be a key part of investment risk  an approach your Board supports. The style of our investment manager naturally steers away from companies with weak balance sheets and poor cash flow which is a common characteristic of the few resource stocks in the benchmark index. It should be noted that the Company does not have an explicit mandate for sustainable  ESG or impact-focused investment  nor has it adopted exclusionary screens. The investment manager‚Äôs integration of ESG factors into his analysis is  though  an important lens through which to identify long term winners  just as poor ESG outcomes provide a useful tool in establishing candidates for the short book. Further information on the Manager‚Äôs approach to responsible investing can be found within the Annual Report and Financial Statements. ANNAUL GENERAL MEETINGThe Board is pleased to announce that the Company‚Äôs Annual General Meeting (AGM) will be held in person on Thursday  23 March 2023 at 12.00 p.m. at the offices of BlackRock at 12 Throgmorton Avenue  London  EC2N 2DL. Details of the business of the meeting are set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting contained within the Annual Report and Financial Statements. Prior to the formal business of the meeting  our Investment Manager will make a presentation to shareholders. This will be followed by a question and answer session. Shareholders who are unable to attend the meeting in person but who wish to follow the AGM proceedings can do so via a live webinar this year. Details on how to register  together with access details  will be available shortly on the Company‚Äôs website at: www.blackrock.com/uk/thrg or by contacting the Company Secretary at cosec@blackrock.com. It is not possible to attend  speak or vote via this medium and it is solely intended to provide shareholders with the ability to watch the proceedings. Nevertheless  I trust shareholders will find this new facility helpful. Additionally  if you are unable to attend you can exercise your right to vote by proxy or appoint a proxy to attend in your place. Details of how to do this are included on the AGM Proxy Card provided to shareholders with the annual report. If you hold your shares through a platform or nominees  you will need to contact them and ask them to appoint you as a proxy in respect of your shares in order to attend  speak and vote at the AGM. Further information on the business of this year's AGM can be found in the Notice of the AGM contained within the Annual Report and Financial Statements. SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATIONWe appreciate how important access to regular information is to our shareholders. To supplement our Company website  we now therefore offer shareholders the ability to sign up to the Trust Matters newsletter which includes information on the Company as well as news  views and insights on the investment trust market. Information on how to sign up is included on the inside front cover of the Annual Report and Financial Statements. As I did last year  and in the interest of fostering greater shareholder engagement and participation  I have sought to engage with shareholders who hold their shares through an intermediary or platform via the provisions of section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 and encouraged them to either attend the AGM or exercise their right to vote by proxy. I understand that certain retail platforms are now providing shareholders with the ability to vote electronically. The Board encourages all shareholders to exercise their vote. OUTLOOKAs we move into 2023  the Board shares our investment manager‚Äôs view that company specifics and the strong trading reported by many of the constituents of our portfolio can triumph over the macroeconomic malaise currently weighing heavily on UK smaller company valuations and growth stocks in particular. He continues to believe that we will  in time  see a return to the strong and consistent investment performance delivered to shareholders over many years. Our investment manager‚Äôs fundamental philosophy remains unchanged  with a continued focus on financially strong companies with innovative and disruptive business models and differentiated offerings which are capable of delivering sustained growth over time. This approach has served the Company well over many years and the Board remains fully supportive of our investment manager. CHRISTOPHER SAMUELChairman9 February 2023 INVESTMENT MANAGER‚ÄôS REPORT FOR THE 12 MONTHS ENDED 30 NOVEMBER 2022 MARKET REVIEW AND OVERALL INVESTMENT PERFORMANCEThe past 12 months has been a period characterised by steep market declines and high levels of volatility across many asset classes globally. The notable exception was the FTSE 100 Index which managed a gain of 11.3% in the 12 month period to the end of November 2022. The FTSE 250 Index fell by -12.5% on a total return basis and the Company‚Äôs benchmark  the Numis Smaller Companies plus AIM (excluding Investment Companies) Index fell by -17.5% during this period. As discussed in the Half Yearly Report  the first half of the year saw the UK stock market rotating away from highly priced ‚Äògrowth‚Äô shares towards lower growth ‚Äòvalue‚Äô and defensives. This was driven by concerns of higher inflation and energy supply shocks exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. In the second half of the year  the subsequent response by central bankers to raise interest rates stoked fears of a recession and markets declined further. As concerns around economic growth grew  UK small and mid-caps mirrored their US peers and performed poorly (down by -9.4%) to 31 May 2022. These sections of the market are perceived to be more cyclical and discretionary and were sold off to fund more ‚Äòdefensive‚Äô positions. Within the UK equity market  the effect of this can be seen in the gap between the performance year-to-date of the FTSE 100 Index (make up is over 50% in resources  staples and healthcare) and the FTSE 250 Index highlighted above and which is the largest dispersion on record. These numbers should give some measure of the extremes of positioning caused by the events of the past 12 months. The UK also saw notable Sterling weakness during the year  with economic weakness compounded by political uncertainty. It is disappointing to report a negative return for the Company and underperformance of the benchmark over this period. Many of our investments have been caught up in the market turbulence and fallen sharply regardless of the strength of their underlying operations and financial results. To be clear  we do make mistakes at the individual company level (the consequences of which are often very painful) but this is not a year where our poor performance can be attributed to lots of profit warnings or negative developments to investment theses. The underperformance has been driven by our style bias towards growth ‚Äì and the market devaluation of growth businesses. This is particularly frustrating as whilst we understand and agree with the logic to devalue loss-making and cash-consumptive speculative businesses as interest rates rise  many profitable and differentiated businesses have been unfairly punished too. Furthermore  it is with a sense of real irony that many companies with strong pricing power and no debt have fared far worse than peers who have inferior balance sheets and weaker track records of volume growth and margin expansion. Indeed  it is the latter that are far more exposed to inflationary cost pressures and higher interest charges eroding profitability and cashflows. We have continued to apply our robust investment process and most of our companies have continued to execute well operationally and financially through the year. Their share price falls reflect a change in valuation as the market reassesses the appropriate price ‚Äòto pay‚Äô for these type of businesses  in context of greater economic uncertainty and rising interest rates. We think it is far too simplistic to respond by dismissing the long book with words to the effect of ‚Äúwell surely they were all far too expensive to begin with‚Äù as we think this often belies their impressive track records of growth and returns  not to mention underestimating their prospects to grow their earnings significantly in time  and therefore fails to reflect the time horizon one needs to evaluate success of small and mid-cap growth companies. In hindsight  in 2022 the aggregate draw-down in valuation that has occurred was greater than expected  and whilst this has been very frustrating for us this year  it is fortunately also a source of optimism. Earnings expectations and company valuations have fallen a long way. The next few years will present new challenges we have not seen before  but we firmly believe the status quo is unsustainable and that those companies that can continue to deliver will be appropriately rewarded in time. Small and mid-cap does suffer during these market rotations but this asset class has proven to be an excellent driver of long-term investment returns since it was first established in 1955 and we believe that it will continue to support long-term performance. PERFORMANCE REVIEWThe past 12 months has been an extremely challenging period to navigate  particularly for our quality growth focused investment style. The Company‚Äôs NAV total return of -31.1% is disappointing and compares unfavourably to the benchmark total return of -17.5% and for that I would like to apologise to the Company‚Äôs loyal shareholders. While the long-term track record of the Company remains strong in both absolute and relative terms  the extent of underperformance has been more than I would have anticipated  particularly given the strength of trading that we have continued to see across a large portion of our long book. There are two broad drivers of the underperformance this year: i) a rotation away from quality growth towards value  and ii) elevated gross and net exposure at the start of the year magnifying the draw-down in performance. The primary driver of underperformance was the rotation from higher growth companies  and a broad de-rating across the UK small and mid-cap market. Extraordinarily we have had fewer company specific disappointments than usual but in the short-term share prices are also influenced by additional factors  including the macro and political environment  the discount rate  liquidity  and investor sentiment and flows which can override strong company specifics. It is these factors that have hurt. Over the longer-term  we believe growth in absolute value is all about the growth of cash-backed earnings and we take comfort that by continuing to focus on differentiated and profitable growth companies  that continue to meet and beat expectations  our patience will be rewarded with significant share price recoveries in these holdings. When looking over the second half of the financial year  we can see that performance certainly improved compared to the first half  and the outcome over the last 12 months has really been a result of the market moves that we experienced at the beginning of 2022. The market rotation saw a number of our core holdings  such as Gamma Communications  Auction Technology Group and YouGov  fall significantly due to the de-rating of growth shares  despite all reporting strong results with material upgrades in the case of Gamma and YouGov. The effect of this rotation/de-rating was amplified by the high gross and net exposure that the Company came into the year with. As a reminder  we were not making a call on a rising market. It reflected the strength of trading that many of our long positions had delivered in 2021  along with some huge positive revisions in their forecasts. Following many meetings with management teams  and various channel checks  we felt extremely confident that these companies would continue to deliver (which on average they have done). We reduced both the gross and net exposures in the summer; in retrospect  I recognise that de-risking sooner would have helped cushion relative performance. Whilst the short book made a positive contribution (+0.6%) the positive impact of this was reduced due to the elevated net positioning of the Company at the start of the year. It is important to note that within the world of UK small and mid-caps  liquidity can disappear just when you need it most. This did hamper us somewhat in the first few months when many of our investments sold off so sharply on low liquidity. At the point that the Company‚Äôs exposure had been reduced and de-ricked  we felt it was too risky to shareholders to increase our short exposure materially. In terms of stock specific detractors during the year  the largest  was IntegraFin  which we mentioned in the Half Yearly Report. It is a UK wealth management platform for financial advisers and disappointed the market over their guidance for costs. An attractive feature of this business had been high levels of recurring (and growing) revenues but the management felt it necessary to increase operating spend to deliver best in class service resulting in margins falling from their historic mid 40% range. This should not really change the fundamental long term investment case as a market share winner  but in the near term does raise questions around what the normalised margin will be. We reduced the position until there is further clarity on the medium-term margin. Elsewhere within Financials  our holding in Impax Asset Management fell as investors adjusted their earning expectations as broader markets fell despite the business continuing to see net inflows. We remain confident in their market leading franchise in sustainable investing  which we think will continue to take market share. Shares in Dechra Pharmaceuticals  a multi-year performer for this Company  were weak and can be attributed to the rising discount rate weighing on its valuation. In terms of positive contributors  4imprint Group delivered multiple upgrades during the year  with another 10% in the final month of our financial year  bringing the upgrades to forecasts in 2022 to 115%. 4imprint Group has seen an acceleration in market share gains after increased investment through COVID as well as adjusting their marketing efforts to more prominent ‚Äòabove-the-line advertising‚Äô to drive brand awareness. This has driven record revenue levels despite the promotional products industry remaining below its 2019 level. 4imprint still has a single digit percentage market share  leaving lots of runway for future market share gains. Ergomed  a specialist service provider to the pharmaceuticals industry  outperformed the market as it continues to deliver strong sales growth  particularly in North America. Recent acquisitions appear to be integrating well and the management team remain confident in their long-term strategic progress  which includes further expansion into new geographies. PORTFOLIO POSITIONING & OUTLOOKFinancial markets and macro data remain volatile and markets are likely to continue to be driven by inflation statistics and indications (or not) of slowing the pace of monetary tightening from central banks. This push and pull dynamic is likely to remain a recurring theme in the foreseeable future  but ultimately we continue to see evidence to support our thesis that inflation has peaked and is indeed falling and this will ultimately lead to the Federal Reserve (Fed) to adjust their course. Some of the largest contributors to headline inflation (energy and food) are now showing lower year-on-year increases and might even turn negative year-on- year as we move into the first quarter of 2023. At the time of writing  four of the seven categories in core inflation (core inflation strips out food and energy from headline inflation) saw price declines in November data. Based on the data we track  we see leading indicators for shelter  the last remaining large positive contributor to core inflation  also reducing. We are not predicting either an imminent pivot by the Fed  nor a return to the ultra-lax monetary policy of the 2020/2021 period. We suspect the Fed will not pivot until there is a CPI data showing inflation close to 2% on a year-on-year basis. Our current best guess is quarter three of 2023  but we are not betting the house on it and will be led by the data. The change from hiking 75bps to hiking only 50bps at the last meeting demonstrates the direction of travel here too. That said  we do not expect this to be a smooth process and the market is likely to remain sensitive to both inflation data and any indications of changes to Fed policy. Turning attention to the portfolio  we would urge investors not to conflate share price weakness with a deterioration in investment cases. Many of our investments have demonstrated incredible earnings resilience through 2022 despite the challenges they have faced from rising input costs  supply chain pressures and weakening demand. They continue to generate cash and have strong balance sheets. Valuations have been reset and we feel that right now there is an asymmetric risk/reward profile developing within the portfolio. That is not to say that we think the market has definitively bottomed  but we do think very much that the worst is behind us  and share prices are already pricing in extremely bearish scenarios with little attention (and value) ascribed to their long-term prospects  increasing profits and growing cash flows. This will return in time. Whilst we are always open to adding new short positions to the portfolio  we continue to believe the best value in the market today remains in well-financed companies with enduring long term organic growth prospects that will use this period to enhance their position to win more share. Industrials and Consumer Services are two of the sectors where we think some of the most differentiated and interesting investments reside and where we continue to deploy capital even though they are in the eye of the storm  so to speak  as investors grapple with headwinds to consumption and industrial activity. We look to the year ahead with optimism and are comforted by the strength of the holdings in the portfolio and our belief in the ability of our companies to navigate the upcoming environment. We will continue to follow our investment process that focuses on profitable  cash generative growth companies  many of which are now trading on low price to earnings multiples  with high single digit free cash flow yields and in many cases large percentages of their market capital in net cash. We believe the recovery potential in these shares is significant: in time share prices will follow earnings. We thank shareholders for your ongoing support.

Gross and Net Gearing as at 30 November 2022 were 109.3% and 104.3% respectively (2021: 124.1% and 118.7% respectively). Gross and Net Gearing are Alternative Performance Measures  see Glossary contained within the Annual Report and Financial Statements. 1 Fair value is determined as follows: ‚Äì Listed and AIM quoted investments are valued at bid prices where available  otherwise at published price quotations. ‚Äì The sum of the fair values of the long and short investment positions above is determined based on the difference between the purchase price or transaction price and value of the underlying shares in the contract (in effect the unrealised gains/(losses) on the exposed positions). The cost of securities held through long derivative positions directly in the market would have amounted to ¬£96 871 000 at the time of purchase  and subsequent market rises in prices have resulted in unrealised gains on the long derivative positions of ¬£2 731 000  resulting in the value of the total market exposure to the underlying securities increasing to ¬£99 602 000 as at 30 November 2022. ‚Äì The notional price of selling the securities to which exposure was gained via the short derivative positions would have been ¬£15 504 000 at the time of entering into the contract  and subsequent price rises have resulted in unrealised losses on the short derivative positions of ¬£133 000 and the value of the market exposure of these investments increasing to ¬£15 637 000 at 30 November 2022. If the short derivative positions had been closed on 30 November 2022 this would have resulted in a loss of ¬£133 000 for the Company. 2 Market exposure in the case of equity investments is the same as fair value. In the case of long and short derivative positions  it is the market value of the underlying shares to which the portfolio is exposed via the contract. 3 The gross market exposure column for cash and cash equivalents has been adjusted to assume the Company traded direct holdings  rather than exposure being gained through long and short derivative positions.

STRATEGIC REPORT The Directors present the Strategic Report of the Company for the year ended 30 November 2022. PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIESThe Company is a public company limited by shares which carries on business as an investment trust and its principal activity is portfolio investment. OBJECTIVEThe Company‚Äôs objective is to provide shareholders with long term capital growth and an attractive total return through investment primarily in UK smaller and mid-capitalisation companies traded on the London Stock Exchange. STRATEGY  BUSINESS MODEL  INVESTMENT POLICY AND INVESTMENT PROCESSThe Company invests in accordance with the objective given above. The Board is collectively responsible to shareholders for the long term success of the Company and is its governing body. There is a clear division of responsibility between the Board and the Manager  BlackRock Fund Managers Limited (BFM). Matters for the Board include setting the Company‚Äôs strategy  including its investment objective and policy  setting limits on gearing (both bank borrowings and the effect of derivatives)  capital structure  governance  and appointing and monitoring of performance of service providers  including the Manager. The Company‚Äôs business model follows that of an externally managed investment trust; therefore the Company does not have any employees and outsources its activities to third party service providers  including the Manager who is the principal service provider. The management of the investment portfolio and the administration of the Company have been contractually delegated to BFM. The Manager  operating under guidelines determined by the Board  has direct responsibility for the decisions relating to the day-to-day running of the Company and is accountable to the Board for the investment  financial and operating performance of the Company. Other service providers include the Depositary and the Fund Accountant  The Bank of New York Mellon (International) Limited  and the Registrar  Computershare Investor Services PLC. Details of the contractual terms with third party service providers are set out in the Directors‚Äô Report contained within the Annual Report and Financial Statements. INVESTMENT POLICYThe Company‚Äôs performance is measured against the Numis Smaller Companies plus AIM (excluding Investment Companies) Index (the Benchmark Index). The Investment Manager  BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited (BIM (UK))  may invest in companies outside the Benchmark Index without restriction  subject to the following limits. The Company may hold up to 15% of its gross assets  at the time of acquisition  in securities of companies which are listed or traded on a stock exchange outside the UK. In addition to the normal long only portfolio  the Company will likely hold a mixture of long and short contracts for difference (CFDs) and/or comparable equity derivatives that would result in a typical net market exposure of between 100% and 115%. In extremis  the Company could deploy the full 30% of permissible leverage into short CFDs and/or comparable equity derivatives  thereby reducing its overall net market exposure to 70%. The Company may also invest up to 2.5% of its net assets (measured at the time of investment) in unquoted securities  including securities issued by companies incorporated outside the United Kingdom. However  the Company may invest more than 2.5%  but no more than 3.75%  of its net assets (both measured at the time of investment)  in unquoted securities in circumstances where such investment is in an existing investee company and  in the Investment Manager‚Äôs opinion  a failure of the Company to make such investment would have a material adverse effect on the value of the Company‚Äôs investment in such investee company. In addition  the Company is permitted to employ leverage up to 30% of net assets  which it does primarily through the use of CFDs and/or comparable equity derivatives  rather than bank borrowings  therefore enabling the Company to have a maximum net market exposure of 130%. In normal circumstances the Company will likely hold a mixture of long and short CFDs and/or comparable equity derivatives that would result in a typical net market exposure of between 100% and 115%*. Portfolio risk will be mitigated by investment in a diversified portfolio of holdings. No more than 5% of the Company‚Äôs gross assets  at the time of acquisition  may be invested in any one single holding  excluding holdings in cash or money market funds  where up to 10% of the Company‚Äôs gross assets may be held. The Company may also invest in collective investment vehicles. However  the Company will not invest more than 10% of its gross assets  at the time of the acquisition  in other listed closed-ended investment funds  unless such companies have a stated investment policy not to invest more than 15% of their gross assets in other listed closed-ended investment funds  in which case the limit is 15% of gross assets. The Board‚Äôs policy is that net gearing  borrowings less cash  should not exceed 20% of gross assets. The Company expects to employ any leverage primarily through its use of CFDs and/or comparable equity derivatives. No material change will be made to the investment objective and policy without shareholder approval. * The AIC measures gearing at gross level  rather than net market exposure level (i.e. gearing is calculated as borrowings + long CFDs and/or comparable equity derivatives + short CFDs and/or comparable equity derivatives) and therefore the published gearing figures will be higher than the typical net market exposure of between 100% and 115%. INVESTMENT PROCESSA unique feature of the Company is that it has the ability to go both long and short up to approximately 30% of the Company‚Äôs net assets. Notwithstanding recent positive returns from UK small and mid-capitalisation companies  the sector has demonstrated considerable volatility over the past 20 years. Such an environment provides an attractive opportunity to add value via derivatives: instruments which can exploit share price moves whether up or down. As the maximum short portfolio exposure through derivatives is 30% of net assets  the Company will at all times retain an exposure to the market  as shown in the chart within the Annual Report and Financial Statements. In the course of their research the investment management team comes across companies which they judge are likely to underperform; the ability to take short positions therefore significantly enhances the opportunity to make money for shareholders. This is not possible in a conventional or long only portfolio. When markets are expected to rise in the medium term  the long/short strategy is used to generate additional market exposure through ensuring that the long exposure exceeds the short exposure in a range between 0% to 15% of the net assets of the Company. Rising or ‚Äòbull‚Äô markets have historically (in the UK) persisted for longer than falling or ‚Äòbear‚Äô markets. A typical net market exposure might therefore be between 100% and 115%. This is lower than the ‚Äògross exposure‚Äô  which is the combination of the long equity positions  plus the net of long and short derivative positions expressed as a percentage of net assets. ESG INTEGRATIONThe Manager defines Environmental  Social and Governance (ESG) integration as the practice of incorporating material ESG information and consideration of sustainability risks into investment decisions in order to enhance risk-adjusted returns. This statement does not imply that the Company has an ESG-aligned investment objective  but rather describes how ESG information is considered as part of the overall investment process. Of course  ESG information is not the sole consideration for investment decisions; instead  the Manager assesses a variety of economic and financial indicators which include ESG considerations in combination with other information in the research phase of the investment process to make investment decisions appropriate to their client‚Äôs objectives. This may also include relevant third party insight  as well as internal engagement commentary and input from BlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) on governance issues. The Investment Manager conducts regular portfolio reviews with the BlackRock Risk and Quantitative Analysis (RQA) team. These reviews include discussion of the portfolio's exposure to material ESG risks  as well as exposure to sustainability-related business involvements  climate-related metrics  traditional financial risks and other factors. The Manager‚Äôs approach to ESG integration is to broaden the total amount of information its investment professionals consider in order to improve investment analysis  seeking to meet or exceed economic return and financial risk targets. ESG factors can be useful and relevant indicators for investment purposes and can help portfolio managers with their decision-making through identifying potentially negative events or corporate behaviour. The Investment Manager works closely with BIS to assess the governance quality of companies and understand any potential issues  risks or opportunities. The Manager‚Äôs research team monitors differing levels of risk throughout the process and believes that avoiding major downside events can generate significant outperformance over the long term. Inputs from the RQA team are an integral part of the investment process. The RQA team analyse market and portfolio risk factors including stress tests  correlations  factor returns  cross-sectional volatility and attributions. The Manager‚Äôs evaluation procedures and financial analysis of the companies within the portfolio also take into account environmental  social and governance matters and other business issues. The Company does not meet the criteria for Article 8 or 9 products under the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and the investments underlying this financial product do not take into account the EU criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities. The Investment Manager has access to a range of data sources  including principal adverse indicator (PAI) data  when making decisions on the selection of investments. However  whilst BlackRock considers ESG risks for all portfolios and these risks may coincide with environmental or social themes associated with the PAIs. The Company does not commit to considering PAIs in driving the selection of its investments. Further information on the Manager‚Äôs approach to ESG and sustainability can be found in the report on Responsible Investing contained within the Annual Report and Financial Statements. PERFORMANCEThe Investment Manager‚Äôs report above includes a review of the main developments during the year  together with information on investment activity within the Company‚Äôs portfolio. RESULTS AND DIVIDENDSThe results for the Company are set out in the Statement of Comprehensive Income below. The total loss for the year  after taxation  was ¬£295 888 000 (2021: a profit of ¬£223 334 000) of which the revenue return amounted to ¬£13 257 000 (2021: ¬£11 446 000) and a capital loss of ¬£309 145 000 (2021: profit of ¬£211 888 000). Details of the dividends declared in respect of the year are set out in the Chairman‚Äôs Statement above. KEY PERFORANCE INDICATORSAt each Board meeting  the Directors consider a number of performance measures to assess the Company‚Äôs success in achieving its objectives. The key performance indicators (KPIs) used to measure the progress and performance of the Company over time  and which are comparable to those reported by other investment trusts  are set out in the table below. These KPIs fall within the definition of ‚ÄòAlternative Performance Measures‚Äô (APMs) under guidance issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)  and additional information explaining how these are calculated is set out in the Glossary contained within the Annual Report and Financial Statements. The Board monitors the KPIs at each meeting. Additionally  it regularly reviews a number of indices and ratios to understand the impact on the Company‚Äôs relative performance of the various components such as asset allocation and stock selection. This includes an assessment of the Company‚Äôs performance and ongoing charges against its peer group of investment trusts with similar investment objectives.Year ended30 November 2022 Year ended30 November 2021 Net asset value total return1 2 (31.1)% 37.0% Share price total return1 2 (35.5)% 38.8% Benchmark Index total return3 (17.5)% 24.5% (Discount)/premium to cum income net asset value2 (5.0)% 1.4% Revenue return per share 12.95p 12.15p Total dividend per share 11.10p 10.50p Ongoing charges2 4 0.54% 0.57% Ongoing charges including performance fees2 5 0.54% 1.38% 1 This measures the Company‚Äôs share price and NAV total return  which assumes dividends paid by the Company have been reinvested.2 Alternative Performance Measures  see Glossary contained within the Annual Report and Financial Statements.3 The Company's Benchmark Index is the Numis Smaller Companies plus AIM (excluding Investment Companies) Index.4 Ongoing charges represent the management fee and all other operating expenses  excluding the performance fee  finance costs  direct transaction costs  custody transaction charges  VAT recovered  taxation  prior year expenses written back and certain non-recurring items as a % of average daily net assets.5 Ongoing charges represent the management fee  performance fee and all other operating expenses  excluding finance costs  direct transaction costs  custody transaction charges  VAT recovered  taxation  prior year expenses written back and certain non-recurring items as a % of average daily net assets. SHARE PRICE DISCOUNT/PREMIUMThe Directors recognise that it is in the long term interests of shareholders that the Company‚Äôs shares do not trade at an excessive discount or premium to their prevailing NAV for any material length of time. In the year under review the discount/premium to NAV of the ordinary shares on a cum income basis has ranged between a discount of 14.3% and a premium of 2.7%  with the average being a discount of 3.5%. The shares ended the year at a discount of 5.0% on a cum income basis. As at 7 February 2023 the discount was 2.0%. As it does each year  the Board will also be seeking to renew the authority from shareholders at the AGM to issue new shares (or to reissue shares held in treasury) and to buy back shares. Further information on these powers and the Board's policy in this respect can also be found in the Chairman's Statement above. PRINCIPAL RISKSAs required by the UK Code of Corporate Governance  the Board has in place a robust  ongoing process to identify  assess and monitor the principal and emerging risks of the Company  including those that they consider would threaten its business model  future performance  solvency or liquidity. Emerging risks are considered by the Board as they come into view and are incorporated into the Company‚Äôs risk register where applicable. Additionally  the Manager considers emerging risks in numerous forums and the Risk and Quantitative Analysis team produces an annual risk survey. Any material risks of relevance to the Company identified through the annual risk survey will be communicated to the Board. A core element of this process is the Company‚Äôs risk register  which identifies the risks facing the Company and the likelihood and potential impact of each risk  together with the controls established for mitigation. A residual risk rating is calculated for each risk  which allows the effect of any mitigating procedures to be reflected in the register. The current risk register includes a range of risks spread between investment performance risk  income/dividend risk  legal & regulatory risk  counterparty risk  operational risk  market risk  political risk and financial risk. The risk register  its method of preparation and the operation of key controls in the Manager‚Äôs and third party service providers‚Äô systems of internal control are reviewed on a regular basis by the Audit Committee. In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the Manager‚Äôs and other third party service providers‚Äô risk management processes and how these apply to the Company‚Äôs business  the Audit Committee periodically receives presentations from BlackRock‚Äôs Internal Audit and Risk & Quantitative Analysis teams. Where produced  the Audit Committee also reviews summaries of the Service Organisation Control (SOC1) reports from the Company‚Äôs service providers. The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Company during the financial year  together with the potential effects  controls and mitigating factors  are set out in the table below. Principal Risk Mitigation/Control Investment performanceThe Board is responsible for:¬∑ setting the investment policy to fulfil the Company‚Äôs objectives; and¬∑ monitoring the performance of the Company‚Äôs Investment Manager and the strategy adopted.An inappropriate policy or strategy may lead to:¬∑ poor performance compared to the Company‚Äôs Benchmark Index  peer group or shareholder expectations;¬∑ a widening discount to NAV;¬∑ a reduction or permanent loss of capital; and¬∑ dissatisfied shareholders and reputational damage.To manage these risks the Board:¬∑ regularly reviews the Company‚Äôs investment mandate and long term strategy;¬∑ has set  and regularly reviews  the investment guidelines and has put in place appropriate limits on levels of gearing and the use of derivatives;¬∑ receives from the Investment Manager a regular explanation of stock selection decisions  portfolio gearing and any changes in gearing and the rationale for the composition of the investment portfolio;¬∑ receives from the Investment Manager regular reporting on the portfolio‚Äôs exposure through derivatives  including the extent to which the portfolio is geared in this manner and the value of any short positions;¬∑ monitors the maintenance of an adequate spread of investments in order to minimise the risks associated with particular sectors  based on the diversification requirements inherent in the Company‚Äôs investment policy; and¬∑ monitors the share price discount or premium to NAV.Market riskMarket risk arises from changes to the prices of the Company‚Äôs investments. It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding investments and derivatives. Market risk includes the potential impact of events which are outside the scope of the Company‚Äôs control  such as the UK‚Äôs decision to leave the European Union  Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the impacts of climate change.The Board carefully considers the diversification of the portfolio  asset allocation  stock selection  unquoted investments and levels of gearing on a regular basis and has set investment restrictions and guidelines which are monitored and reported on by the Investment Manager. The Board monitors the implementation and results of the investment process with the Investment Manager  and key market risk factors are discussed.The Board also recognises the benefits of a closed-end fund structure in extremely volatile markets such as those experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently the impact of Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine on the global economy. Unlike open-ended counterparts  closed-end funds are not obliged to sell down portfolio holdings at low valuations to meet liquidity requirements for redemptions. During times of elevated volatility and market stress  the ability of a closed-end fund structure to remain invested for the long term enables the Investment Manager to adhere to disciplined fundamental analysis from a bottom-up perspective and be ready to respond to dislocations in the market as opportunities present themselves.Income/dividend riskThe amount of dividends and future dividend growth will depend on the performance of the Company‚Äôs underlying portfolio holdings. Changes in the composition of the portfolio and any change in the tax treatment of the dividends or interest received by the Company may reduce the level of dividends received by shareholders.The Board monitors this risk through the receipt of detailed income forecasts and considers the level of income at each meeting. The Company also has a revenue reserve and powers to pay dividends from capital which could potentially be used to support the Company‚Äôs dividend if required. Financial riskThe Company‚Äôs investment activities expose it to a variety of financial risks that include market risk  foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. At 30 November 2022  the Company had approximately 33.5% of its gross asset value invested in AIM traded equity securities and 4.3% of its gross assets in international markets  and  by the very nature of its investment objective  largely invests in smaller companies. Liquidity in these securities can from time to time become constrained  making these investments difficult to realise at or near published prices.The Company is not materially exposed to foreign currency and interest rate risk. For mitigation of market risk  see above. There are also risks linked to the Company‚Äôs use of derivative transactions including long and short investment positions. Details are disclosed in note 11 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements  together with a summary of the policies for managing and controlling these risks in note 16 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements. Operational riskIn common with most other investment trust companies  the Company has no employees. The Company therefore relies upon the services provided by BlackRock (the Manager and AIFM) and The Bank of New York Mellon (International) Limited (the Depositary and Fund Accountant) who maintain the Company‚Äôs accounting records.Failure by any service provider to carry out its obligations to the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company‚Äôs performance. Disruption to the accounting  payment systems or custody records  as a result of a cyber-attack or otherwise  could impact the monitoring and reporting of the Company‚Äôs financial position.The security of the Company‚Äôs assets  dealing procedures  accounting records and maintenance of regulatory and legal requirements  depend on the effective operation of these systems.The Board reviews the overall performance of the Manager  Investment Manager and all other third party service providers and compliance with the investment management agreement on a regular basis.The Fund Accountant‚Äôs and the Manager‚Äôs internal control processes are regularly tested and monitored throughout the year and are evidenced through their Service Organisation Control (SOC 1) reports  which are subject to review by an Independent Service Assurance Auditor. The SOC 1 reports provide assurance in respect of the effective operation of internal controls.The Company‚Äôs financial instruments held in custody are subject to a strict liability regime and in the event of a loss of such financial instruments held in custody  the Depositary must return assets of an identical type or the corresponding amount  unless able to demonstrate that the loss was a result of an event beyond its reasonable control.The Board considers succession arrangements for key employees of the Manager and the Board also considers the business continuity arrangements of the Company‚Äôs key service providers on an ongoing basis and reviews these as part of its review of the Company‚Äôs risk register. In respect of the unprecedented risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of the ability of service providers to function effectively  the Board has received reports from key service providers setting out the measures that they have put in place to address the crisis  in addition to their existing business continuity framework. Having considered these arrangements and reviewed service levels since the crisis has evolved  the Board is confident that a good level of service has and will be maintained.The Board also receives regular updates from BlackRock‚Äôs internal audit function and the Company‚Äôs Audit Committee Chairman attends an annual briefing from the head of BlackRock‚Äôs internal audit function once a year. This is supplemented by a written report which describes the progress made against the current internal audit plan  any issues identified and the plan for the forthcoming year.Legal and regulatory riskThe Company has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs as an investment trust  subject to continuing to meet the relevant eligibility conditions  and operates as an investment trust in accordance with Chapter 4 of Part 24 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. As such  the Company is exempt from capital gains tax on the profits realised from the sale of its investments.Any breach of the relevant eligibility conditions could lead to the Company losing its investment trust status and being subject to corporation tax on capital gains realised within the Company‚Äôs portfolio. In such event the investment returns of the Company may be adversely affected. Any serious breach could result in the Company and/or the Directors being fined or the subject of criminal proceedings or the suspension of the Company‚Äôs shares which would in turn lead to a breach of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.Risk of regulatory changeAmongst other relevant laws and regulations  the Company is required to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006  the Alternative Investment Fund Managers‚Äô Directive (as retained and onshored in the UK)  the Market Abuse Regulation (also as retained and onshored in the UK)  the UK Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.The Investment Manager monitors investment movements  the level of forecast income and expenditure and the amount of proposed dividends  if any  to ensure that the provisions of Chapter 4 of Part 24 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 are not breached  and the results are reported to the Board at each meeting.Following authorisation under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers‚Äô Directive as retained and onshored in the UK (AIFMD)  the Company and its appointed Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM) are subject to the risks that the requirements of the AIFMD are not correctly complied with. The Board and the AIFM also monitor changes in government policy and legislation which may have an impact on the Company.Compliance with the accounting standards applicable to quoted companies and those applicable to investment trusts are also regularly monitored to ensure compliance.The Company Secretary and the Company‚Äôs professional advisers monitor developments in relevant laws and regulations and provide regular reports to the Board in respect of the Company‚Äôs compliance.The Market Abuse Regulation came into force across the EU on 3 July 2016 and has been retained and onshored in the UK following Brexit. The Board has taken steps to ensure that individual Directors (and their Persons Closely Associated) are aware of their obligations under the regulation and has updated internal processes  where necessary  to ensure the risk of non-compliance is effectively mitigated.Counterparty riskThe potential loss that the Company could incur if a counterparty is unable (or unwilling) to perform on its commitments. The Company‚Äôs investment policy also permits the use of both exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives (including contracts for difference).Due diligence is undertaken before contracts are entered into and exposures are diversified across a number of counterparties. The Board reviews the controls put in place by the Investment Manager to monitor and to minimise counterparty exposure  which include intra-day monitoring of exposures to ensure that these are within set limits.The Depositary is liable for restitution for the loss of financial instruments held in custody  unless it is able to demonstrate that the loss was due to an event beyond its reasonable control. VIABILITY STATEMENTThe Directors have assessed the prospects of the Company over a longer period than the 12 months referred to by the ‚ÄúGoing Concern‚Äù guidelines. The Board conducted this review for the period up to the AGM in 2028  being a five-year period from the date that this Annual Report will be approved by shareholders. This is generally the investment holding period investors consider while investing in the smaller companies‚Äô sector. The Board is cognisant of the uncertainty surrounding the potential duration of the Russia/Ukraine conflict  its impact on the global economy  and the prospects for the Company‚Äôs portfolio holdings. In making its assessment the Board has also considered the following factors: ¬∑ the Company‚Äôs principal risks as set out above; ¬∑ the impact of a significant fall in UK equity markets on the value of the Company‚Äôs investment portfolio in the light of the heightened volatility resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economy  inflation and interest rates  of Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine; ¬∑ the ongoing relevance of the Company‚Äôs investment objective; and ¬∑ the level of demand for the Company‚Äôs shares. The Directors have also considered the Company‚Äôs revenue and expense forecasts and the fact that expenses and liabilities are relatively stable. The Company also has a portfolio of investments which provides a level of cash receipts in the form of dividends and which are considered to be relatively realisable if required. The Directors reviewed the assumptions and considerations underpinning the Company‚Äôs existing going concern assertion (please see the disclosure in the Directors‚Äô Report contained within the Annual Report and Financial Statements)  which are based on: ¬∑ processes for monitoring costs; ¬∑ key financial ratios; ¬∑ evaluation of risk management and controls; ¬∑ compliance with the investment objective; ¬∑ the Company‚Äôs ability to meet its liabilities as they fall due; ¬∑ portfolio risk profile; ¬∑ share price discount to NAV; ¬∑ gearing; ¬∑ counterparty exposure and liquidity risk in the light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; ¬∑ the operational resilience of the Company and its key service providers and their ability to continue to provide a good level of service for the foreseeable future; and ¬∑ the effectiveness of business continuity plans in place for the Company and key service providers. The Company has a relatively liquid portfolio and largely fixed overheads (excluding any applicable performance fees) which comprise a very small percentage of net assets (0.54% excluding performance fees  0.54% including performance fees in 2022). The effective performance fee cap in the event that the NAV return exceeds the Benchmark Index return over the performance period is circa. 0.90% of the average gross assets over the two years and the applicable percentage to be applied to the outperformance of the NAV total return over the Benchmark Index return is 15%. In addition  the maximum cap on total management and performance fees is 1.25% of average gross assets (measured over a rolling two-year period). Therefore  the Board has concluded that the Company would be able to meet its ongoing operating costs as they fall due. On 30 December 2020  the UK and the EU signed the UK/EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (UK/EU Trade Agreement)  which applied from 1 January 2021 and set out the foundation of the economic and legal framework for trade between the UK and the EU. The UK‚Äôs exit from the EU has resulted in additional trade costs and disruptions in this trading relationship. The terms of the future relationship may cause continued uncertainty in the global financial markets  and could potentially adversely affect the performance of the Company. Volatility resulting from this uncertainty may mean that the returns of the Company‚Äôs investments are affected by market movements  the potential decline in the value of Sterling or Euro  and the potential downgrading of UK sovereign credit rating. The Directors have also considered the impact of potential changes in law  regulation and taxation and the matter of foreign exchange risk. They have determined that although there are a number of potential risks associated with the legal  fiscal and regulatory landscape they do not believe that this represents a material threat to the Company‚Äôs strategy and business model  nor do they believe that the Investment Manager will be materially impeded in achieving the Company‚Äôs investment objective. Based on the results of their analysis  the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment. SECTION 172 STATEMENT: PROMOTING THE SUCCESS OF BLACKROCK THROGMORTON TRUST PLC The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 require directors to explain more fully how they have discharged their duties under Section 172(1) of the Companies Act 2006 in promoting the success of their companies for the benefit of members as a whole. This enhanced disclosure covers how the Board has engaged with and understands the views of stakeholders and how stakeholders‚Äô needs have been taken into account  the outcome of this engagement and the impact that it has had on the Board‚Äôs decisions. As the Company is an externally managed investment company and does not have any employees or customers  the Board considers the main stakeholders in the Company to be the shareholders and the key service providers (being the Manager and Investment Manager  the Custodian  Depositary  Registrar and Broker). The reasons for this determination  and the Board‚Äôs overarching approach to engagement  are set out in the table below: Stakeholders Shareholders Manager and Investment Manager Other key service providers Continued shareholder support and engagement are critical to the continued existence of the Company and the successful delivery of its long-term strategy. The Board is focused on fostering good working relationships with shareholders and on understanding the views of shareholders in order to incorporate them into the Board‚Äôs strategy and objectives in delivering long-term growth and income.In turn  portfolio holdings are ultimately shareholders‚Äô assets  and the Board recognises the importance of good stewardship and communication with investee companies in meeting the Company‚Äôs investment objective and strategy. The Board‚Äôs main working relationship is with the Manager  who is responsible for the Company‚Äôs portfolio management (including asset allocation  stock and sector selection) and risk management  as well as ancillary functions such as administration  secretarial  accounting and marketing services. The Manager has sub-delegated portfolio management to the Investment Manager. Successful management of shareholders‚Äô assets by the Investment Manager is critical for the Company to successfully deliver its investment strategy and meet its objective. The Company is also reliant on the Manager as AIFM to provide support in meeting relevant regulatory obligations under the AIFMD and other relevant legislation. In order for the Company to function as an investment trust with a listing on the premium segment of the official list of the FCA and trade on the London Stock Exchange‚Äôs (LSE) main market for listed securities  the Board relies on a diverse range of advisors for support in meeting relevant obligations and safeguarding the Company‚Äôs assets. For this reason  the Board considers the Company‚Äôs Custodian  Depositary  Registrar and Broker to be stakeholders. The Board  either directly or through the Manager  maintains regular contact with its key external providers and receives regular reporting from them through the Board and Committee meetings  as well as outside of the regular meeting cycle. A summary of the key areas of engagement undertaken by the Board with its key stakeholders in the year under review and how Directors have acted upon this to promote the long term success of the Company are set out in the table below. Area of Engagement Issue Engagement Impact Investment mandate and objective The Board is committed to promoting the role and success of the Company in delivering on its investment mandate to shareholders over the long term. The Board also has responsibility to shareholders to ensure that the Company‚Äôs portfolio of assets is invested in line with the stated investment objective and in a way that ensures an appropriate balance between spread of risk and portfolio returns. The Board works closely with the Investment Manager throughout the year in further developing our investment strategy and underlying policies  not simply for the purpose of achieving the Company‚Äôs investment objective but in the interests of shareholders and future investors.The Board is kept advised in respect of the Manager‚Äôs consideration of ESG factors as part of the investment process; a summary of BlackRock‚Äôs approach to ESG matters is set out within the Annual Report and Financial Statements.Details regarding the Company‚Äôs NAV and share price performance can be found in the Chairman‚Äôs Statement and in the Strategic Report above.The portfolio activities undertaken by the Manager can be found in the Investment Manager‚Äôs Report above. Management of the share rating The Board believes that the best way of addressing the discount over the longer term is to continue to generate good performance and to create demand for the Company‚Äôs shares in the secondary market through broadening awareness of the Company‚Äôs unique structure. The Board believes that it is in shareholders‚Äô interests that the share price does not trade at an excessive premium or discount to NAV. Therefore  where deemed to be in shareholders‚Äô long term interests  it may exercise its powers to issue shares or buy back shares with the objective of ensuring that an excessive premium or discount does not arise. The Manager reports total return performance statistics to the Board on a regular basis  along with the portfolio yield and the impact of dividends paid on brought forward distributable reserves.The Board reviews the Company‚Äôs discount/premium to NAV on a regular basis and holds regular discussions with the Manager and the Company‚Äôs broker regarding the discount/premium level.The Board believes that the best way of maintaining the share rating at an optimal level over the long term is to create demand for the shares in the secondary market. To this end the Investment Manager is devoting considerable effort to broadening the awareness of the Company  particularly to wealth managers and to the wider retail shareholder market.The Manager provides the Board with feedback and key performance statistics regarding the success of the Company‚Äôs marketing initiatives.The average discount for the year to 30 November 2022 was 3.5%. During the year the Company‚Äôs share price has traded at a maximum discount of 14.3% and a maximum premium of 2.7%. Service levels of third party providers The Board acknowledges the importance of ensuring that the Company‚Äôs principal suppliers are providing a suitable level of service including: the Manager in respect of investment performance and delivering on the Company‚Äôs investment mandate; the Depositary in respect of its duties towards safeguarding the Company‚Äôs assets; the Registrar in its maintenance of the Company‚Äôs share register and dealing with investor queries and the Company‚Äôs Brokers in respect of the provision of advice and acti,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.14,0.17,0.69,True,English,"['BlackRock Throgmorton Trust Plc', 'Final Results', 'Final Results PR Summary Quotes Charts News Calendar Company Financials Consensus Funds', 'Official Publications Sector news BlackRock Throgmorton Trust Plc', 'Homepage Equities United Kingdom London Stock Exchange', 'BlackRock Throgmorton Trust plc News Summary', 'BlackRock Throgmorton Trust Swings', 'DTR 4.1 Annual Results Announcement', 'Other languages Press Releases', 'high-quality growth portfolio holdings', 'income net asset value', 'Blackrock Throgmorton NAV', 'net asset value3', 'multiple email addresses', 'Legal Entity Identifier', 'Article 5 Transparency Directive', 'lower growth value', 'Numis Smaller Companies', '3 Alternative Performance Measures', 'Net revenue profit', 'list Report Report', 'Annual performance figures', 'Investment Companies) Index', 'Ordinary share price3', 'Final dividend', 'Stronger NAV performance', 'Benchmark Index5 NAV', 'growth companies', 'portfolio movements', 'Annual Report', 'Net assets', 'The Company', 'growth style', '2,051,000 ordinary shares', 'Half-Yearly Report', 'HIGHLIGHTS NAV', 'PERFORMANCE RECORD', 'share issues', 'share buybacks', 'share rating', 'FY22 MT', 'Required fields', 'Revenue earnings', 'five years', 'Sterling terms', 'Financial Statements', 'Further details', '13.6 percentage points', '18.0 percentage points', 'six months', '2.4 percentage points', '1,773,900 new shares', 'total consideration', 'challenging period', '16.9 percentage points', 'defensive stocks', 'first quarter', 'many cases', 'benchmark AN', 'Benchmark Index2', 'Benchmark Indices', 'First name', 'one year', 'challenging year', 'average discount', 'market rotation', 'Total dividends', 'THRG', 'Loss', 'commas', 'Message', 'Information', 'accordance', '30 November', 'pence', 'premium', 'year3', 'share3', 'taxation', 'Interim', 'mid', 'Sources', 'Datastream', 'AIM', 'effect', '22 March', '1 December', '21 March', 'periods', 'changes', 'CHAIRMAN', 'treasury', 'volatility', 'returns', 'Board', '31 May', 'Manager', 'favour', 'investors', 'allocations', 'energy']",2023-02-10,2023-02-11,marketscreener.com

18304,EuroNext,Bing API,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4576368-buying-christian-dior-means-buying-lvmh-at-discount,Buying Christian Dior Means Buying LVMH At A 15% Discount (OTCMKTS:CHDRF),Christian Dior's primary listing is on Euronext Paris where it's trading with CDI as its ticker symbol. While the average daily volume sounds low with just 4 000 shares changing hands on a daily basis  this still represents a monetary value of 3.2M EUR per ...,"Sebastien Mercier/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionChristian Dior (OTCPK:CHDRF) (OTCPK:CHDRY) is one of France's most prominent fashion brands. As a higher-end brand  the margins are pretty spectacular and the free cash flow expressed as a percentage of the revenue is obviously much higher than ""normal"" clothing brands. And although you might suspect Dior owns the Dior luxury brands  it actually isn't the purpose of the company. Christian Dior is the mono-holding with a 41% stake in LVMH as its main asset. Both companies recently released its FY 2022 results so this is a good moment to have a look under the hood.Yahoo FinanceChristian Dior's primary listing is on Euronext Paris where it's trading with CDI as its ticker symbol. While the average daily volume sounds low with just 4 000 shares changing hands on a daily basis  this still represents a monetary value of 3.2M EUR per day. Negligible compared to the current market capitalization of in excess of 140B EUR but keep in mind the float only consists of just over 4 million shares.The cash flow profile remains strongChristian Dior consolidates its 41% ownership in French luxury group LVMH (OTCPK:LVMHF) (OTCPK:LVMUY) so perhaps investors should look at Christian Dior from the ""mono-holding"" perspective. The most valuable asset by far is the stake in LVMH. A slightly confusing ownership method as Dior is the investment holding which owns LVMH but the fashion brand name Dior is part of the LVMH empire. I will discuss the consolidated results so when I am referring to ""the company "" it really is about LVMH as underlying entity.During 2022  the total reported revenue was 79.2B EUR  an increase of 23% compared to the preceding year and a stunning 80% increase compared to the COVID year 2020. The total amount of COGS increased to just under 25B EUR which means the gross margin came in at almost 70%  or 54.2B EUR.Christian Dior Investor RelationsAs you could generally expect  the company spent a lot on marketing and selling expenses: In excess of 30% of the revenue was spent on marketing. Despite the 6B EUR increase in marketing efforts  the recurring operating profit increased to 21B EUR. The net income was 14.7B EUR on a consolidated basis but as Dior only owns about 41% of LVMH  we definitely need to deduct the net income attributable to the non-controlling interests (the other shareholders of LVMH).The attributable net income was 5.8B EUR or 32.13 EUR per share for the Dior shareholders.The cash flow statement obviously showed an equally strong result. The reported operating cash flow was 17.8B EUR but this includes a 3B EUR investment in the working capital position while it included 5.6B EUR in cash tax payments although only 5.4B EUR was owed based on the income statement. We should also deduct the 2.75B EUR in lease payments from the equation. On an adjusted basis  the operating cash flow was 18.25B EUR. The total capex was roughly 5B EUR resulting in a free cash flow result of 13.25B EUR on a consolidated basis.Christian Dior Investor RelationsThat's less than the net income of 14.7B EUR as Dior's (and LVMH's) capex was relatively high. Although the company recorded just 6.2B EUR in depreciation  its 5B EUR capex and 2.75B EUR lease payments indicate it spent a total of 7.75B EUR on these investments. That explains the discrepancy.The consolidation of the stake in LVMH is an issue  but fortunately it's easy enough to calculate Dior's net financial position by comparing the Dior balance sheet with the LVMH balance sheet. We know Dior's balance sheet contains 7.6B EUR in cash  10.4B EUR in long-term financial debt and 9.4B EUR in current financial debt (excluding lease liabilities) for a net debt of 12.2B EUR. The LVMH balance sheet (shown below) shows just 7.3B EUR in cash and roughly the same net financial debt numbers.LVMH Investor RelationsThis means there's approximately 300M EUR in net cash on the Dior level. We also know Dior owns 208.4M shares of LVMH.Investment thesisThis makes the approximate sum of the parts valuation relatively straightforward. Ignoring small rounding errors  the fair value of Dior is 208.4M * 807 EUR per share = 168.2B EUR. Adding in the 300M EUR in net cash on the Dior level results in a SOTP of roughly 168.5B EUR. We know Dior has 180.4M shares outstanding  resulting in a fair value of 934 EUR per share (give or take a few percent for rounding).This means that at the current share price of 792 EUR per share of Dior  you're essentially buying LVMH at a 15% discount. Dior owns 1.15 shares of LVMH per Dior share outstanding and thus offers an interesting possibility to indirectly invest in LVMH at a discount.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
