In the event that the share capital and the number of shares in the Company after registration of the share capital reduction and the rights issue fall below the proposed limits in the articles of association  the limits shall be adjusted to the extent necessary to enable registration.The resolution must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast at the meeting and the shares represented at the meeting in order to be valid.The board’s proposal for a resolution to reduce the share capital without withdrawal of shares for allocation to unrestricted equity (item 8)The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to reduce the Company's share capital to 917 439.22. The share capital will therefore be reduced by SEK 6 645 839.786801 for allocation to unrestricted equity and without withdrawal of shares.The reduction will be carried out in order to reduce the quota value of the shares in order to provide the Company with an increased amount of unrestricted equity through the proposed rights issue as set out in item 9 of the agenda. After the reduction  the Company's share capital will amount to SEK 917 439.22 divided on 91 743 922 shares (before the rights issue)  each share with a quota value of SEK 0.01.The decision to reduce the share capital can be implemented without obtaining the approval of the Swedish Companies Registration Office  as the Company is carrying out a rights issue increasing the share capital by a maximum of SEK 8 256 952.98  which means that neither the Company's restricted equity  nor its share capital  will be reduced.Resolutions under this item are subject to and conditional upon the general meeting also resolving on the amendment of the articles of association under item 7 and on the rights issue under item 9 on the agenda and that these resolutions are registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board’s proposal for a resolution on an issue of shares with preferential rights for the Company’s shareholders (item 9)The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on a new issue of a maximum of 825 695 298 shares resulting an increase in the share capital of a maximum of SEK 8 256 952.98 with preferential rights for existing shareholders. The resolution shall in addition be subject to the following conditions.The shares shall be subscribed for at a price of SEK 0.10  giving a total subscription price of SEK 82 569 529.80. The excess price shall be transferred to the free share premium fund.Shareholders who are registered in the Company’s share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB on the record date of 31 March 2023 will receive subscription rights for participation in the issue.The right to subscribe for shares shall  with preferential rights  be granted to those who are registered as shareholders in the Company on the record date for the new issue  whereby the holding of one (1) share entitles the holder to one (1) subscription right; one (1) subscription right entitles the holder to subscribe for nine (9) new shares.In the event that not all shares are subscribed for with the support of subscription rights  the board of directors shall  within the maximum amount of the rights issue  decide on the allocation of shares to those who subscribed for shares without the support of subscription rights in accordance with the following allocation criteria.In the first instance  allocation shall be made to those who subscribed for shares with the support of subscription rights  regardless of whether the subscriber was a shareholder on the record date or not  and in the event of oversubscription in proportion to the number of subscription rights exercised by each person to subscribe for shares and  to the extent that this cannot be done  by drawing of lots.In the second instance  allotment shall be made to other persons who have subscribed for shares without the support of subscription rights and  in the event that they are unable to obtain full allotment  in proportion to the number of shares that each person has notified for subscription and  to the extent that this cannot be done  by drawing of lots.In the third and final instance  any remaining shares shall be allocated to the persons who have subscribed in proportion to the size of the subscription commitment made and  to the extent that this cannot be done  by drawing of lots.Subscription of shares shall take place during a period of 14 days. The first day of the subscription period shall be two trading days after the date on which the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority has approved the prospectus drawn up in connection with the rights issue (but no later than 31 August 2023  to enable registration of the rights issue within six months of the date of the issue decision). However  the last day of the subscription period shall fall on a trading day. The Board of Directors is entitled to extend the subscription period.Payment for shares shall be made in cash or by set-off as stipulated in the board’s report regarding set-off  in accordance with Chapter 13 Section 7 of the Swedish Companies Act  which will provided in accordance with the information stated under the heading “Documents” below.Payment for shares subscribed for with preferential rights shall be made at the same time as subscription takes place during the subscription period. Payment for shares subscribed for without pre-emptive rights shall be made no later than three (3) banking days after the allotment notice has been sent to the subscriber. The Board of Directors has the right to extend the payment period.The new shares shall be entitled to dividend for the first time on the record date for dividend that falls closest after the shares issued in the rights issue have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and entered in the share registered maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB.Resolutions under this item are subject to and conditional upon the general meeting also resolving on the amendment of the articles of association under item 7 and on the reduction of the share capital under item 8 on the agenda and that these resolutions are registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board of directors  or the person appointed by the board  is entitled to make minor adjustments to the above resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or in relation to Euroclear Sweden AB.The board’s proposal for a resolution to authorise the board to resolve on an over-allotment issue (item 10)The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to authorise the board of directors  in addition to the authorisation resolved by the general meeting on 10 June 2022 which was registered by the Swedish Companies Registration Office on 16 June 2022  to resolve  on one occasion  to issue additional shares in the event of oversubscription in the proposed rights issue pursuant to item 9 (the ""Rights Issue"")  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights. The Company's share capital may be increased by a maximum of SEK 1 238 542.95 through a new issue of a maximum of 123 854 295 shares  corresponding to 15 per cent of the Rights Issue. The subscription price shall be SEK 0.10 per share  which corresponds to the subscription price in the Rights Issue. When allocating shares  the Board shall resolve on allocation in accordance with the principles for allocation in the Rights Issue. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to be able to take advantage of the possibility for the Company to raise additional issue proceeds in the event of an oversubscription of the Rights Issue.Resolution under this item is conditional upon the general meeting also deciding to approve the board’s proposal for the amendment of the articles of association under item 7  the reduction of share capital under item 8 and the Rights Issue under item 9.In order to be valid  the resolution must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast at the meeting and the shares represented at the meeting.Resolution to authorise the board of directors to undertake minor adjustments of the resolutions (item 11)The board of directors proposes that the extraordinary general meeting authorises the board  the CEO or the person otherwise designated by the board  to undertake such minor adjustments and clarifications of the decisions made at the extraordinary general meeting to the extent required for registration of the resolutions.OTHERNumber of shares and votes in the CompanyAs the date of this notice  the total number of registered shares in the Company is 91 743 922 representing a total of 91 743 922 votes.

Amendment of article 11 of the Articles of AssociationThe Board of Directors proposes that article 11 of the Articles of Association be amended to enable holding a general meeting entirely without a meeting venue as a so-called remote meeting in addition to the Company’s domicile of Helsinki. The proposal is based on the changes to the Finnish Companies Act  including the possibility to arrange remote general meetings ensuring that all participating shareholders are able to exercise their full shareholder rights  including the right to present questions and to vote  in real time during the general meeting  irrespective of the chosen general meeting format. The possibility to organise remote general meetings enables the Company to be prepared for rapidly changing conditions in the Company’s operating environment and society in general  due to for example pandemics. It is important for the Company to have means to offer its shareholders the possibility to exercise their shareholder rights and resolve on any matters presented to a general meeting under any circumstances.In its amended form  said provision of the Articles of Association would read as follows:“11. General MeetingThe General Meetings of the company are held in Helsinki.The Board of Directors may resolve on organising the General Meeting without a meeting venue whereby the shareholders exercise their full decision-making power in real time during the meeting using telecommunication connection and technical means.The Annual General Meeting shall be held within six months of the end of the accounting period.”17. Authorising the Board of Directors to resolve on the issuance of sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Board of Directors be authorised to resolve on one or more issuances of shares  including the right to issue new shares in the Company or to transfer the Company’s treasury shares. The authorisation would cover up to a total of 1 500 000 shares  corresponding to approximately 6.2 per cent of the Company’s registered total number of shares at the time of the proposal.The Board of Directors would also be authorised to resolve on the issuance of shares in deviation from the shareholders’ pre-emptive rights (directed issue) if there would be a weighty financial reason for such issuance. The authorisation could be used for material arrangements from the Company’s point of view  such as financing or carrying out business arrangements or investments or for other such purposes determined by the Board of Directors.The Board of Directors would be authorised to resolve on all other terms and conditions of the issuance of shares  including the payment period  grounds for the determination of the subscription price and subscription price or issuance of shares without consideration or that the subscription price may be paid besides in cash also by other assets either partially or entirely.The authorisation is proposed to be effective for 18 months from the close of the Annual General Meeting i.e. until 28 September 2024. If this authorisation is approved  it will revoke the share issuance authorisation granted to the Board of Directors by the Annual General Meeting on 28 March 2022.18. Authorising the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of the Company’s own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Board of Directors be authorised to decide  in one or several instalments  on the repurchase of maximum of 1 500 000 of the Company’s own shares. The proposed maximum number of shares corresponds to approximately 6.2 per cent of the Company’s registered total number of shares at the time of the proposal.The shares would be repurchased using the Company’s invested unrestricted shareholders’ equity  and thus  the repurchases will reduce funds available for distribution. The shares could be repurchased for developing the Company’s capital structure  for financing or carrying out potential corporate acquisitions or other business arrangements  to be used as a part of the Company’s remuneration or incentive plans or to be otherwise transferred further  retained by the Company as treasury shares  or cancelled  for example.In accordance with the resolution of the Board of Directors  the shares may be repurchased either through an offer to all shareholders on equal terms or through other means and otherwise than in proportion to the existing shareholdings of the Company as directed repurchases  if the Board of Directors deems that there are weighty financial reasons for such directed repurchases.The purchase price per share shall be the market price of the shares quoted on the trading venues where the Company’s shares are traded or at the price otherwise established on the market terms at the time of the repurchase.The Board of Directors shall resolve on all other matters related to the repurchase of the Company’s own shares  including on how shares will be repurchased. Among other means  derivatives may be used in acquiring the shares. The authorisation is proposed to be effective for 18 months from the close of the Annual General Meeting i.e. until 28 September 2024. If this authorisation is accepted  it shall cancel the authorisation to repurchase the Company’s shares granted to the Board of Directors by the Annual General Meeting on 28 March 2022.19.

The share capital will therefore be reduced by SEK 6 645 839.786801 for allocation to unrestricted equity and without withdrawal of shares.The reduction will be carried out in order to reduce the quota value of the shares in order to provide the Company with an increased amount of unrestricted equity through the proposed rights issue as set out in item 9 of the agenda. After the reduction  the Company's share capital will amount to SEK 917 439.22 divided on 91 743 922 shares (before the rights issue)  each share with a quota value of SEK 0.01.The decision to reduce the share capital can be implemented without obtaining the approval of the Swedish Companies Registration Office  as the Company is carrying out a rights issue increasing the share capital by a maximum of SEK 8 256 952.98  which means that neither the Company's restricted equity  nor its share capital  will be reduced.Resolutions under this item are subject to and conditional upon the general meeting also resolving on the amendment of the articles of association under item 7 and on the rights issue under item 9 on the agenda and that these resolutions are registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board’s proposal for a resolution on an issue of shares with preferential rights for the Company’s shareholders (item 9)The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on a new issue of a maximum of 825 695 298 shares resulting an increase in the share capital of a maximum of SEK 8 256 952.98 with preferential rights for existing shareholders.

The excess price shall be transferred to the free share premium fund.Shareholders who are registered in the Company’s share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB on the record date of 31 March 2023 will receive subscription rights for participation in the issue.The right to subscribe for shares shall  with preferential rights  be granted to those who are registered as shareholders in the Company on the record date for the new issue  whereby the holding of one (1) share entitles the holder to one (1) subscription right; one (1) subscription right entitles the holder to subscribe for nine (9) new shares.In the event that not all shares are subscribed for with the support of subscription rights  the board of directors shall  within the maximum amount of the rights issue  decide on the allocation of shares to those who subscribed for shares without the support of subscription rights in accordance with the following allocation criteria.In the first instance  allocation shall be made to those who subscribed for shares with the support of subscription rights  regardless of whether the subscriber was a shareholder on the record date or not  and in the event of oversubscription in proportion to the number of subscription rights exercised by each person to subscribe for shares and  to the extent that this cannot be done  by drawing of lots.In the second instance  allotment shall be made to other persons who have subscribed for shares without the support of subscription rights and  in the event that they are unable to obtain full allotment  in proportion to the number of shares that each person has notified for subscription and  to the extent that this cannot be done  by drawing of lots.In the third and final instance  any remaining shares shall be allocated to the persons who have subscribed in proportion to the size of the subscription commitment made and  to the extent that this cannot be done  by drawing of lots.Subscription of shares shall take place during a period of 14 days. The first day of the subscription period shall be two trading days after the date on which the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority has approved the prospectus drawn up in connection with the rights issue (but no later than 31 August 2023  to enable registration of the rights issue within six months of the date of the issue decision). However  the last day of the subscription period shall fall on a trading day. The Board of Directors is entitled to extend the subscription period.Payment for shares shall be made in cash or by set-off as stipulated in the board’s report regarding set-off  in accordance with Chapter 13 Section 7 of the Swedish Companies Act  which will provided in accordance with the information stated under the heading “Documents” below.Payment for shares subscribed for with preferential rights shall be made at the same time as subscription takes place during the subscription period. Payment for shares subscribed for without pre-emptive rights shall be made no later than three (3) banking days after the allotment notice has been sent to the subscriber. The Board of Directors has the right to extend the payment period.The new shares shall be entitled to dividend for the first time on the record date for dividend that falls closest after the shares issued in the rights issue have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and entered in the share registered maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB.Resolutions under this item are subject to and conditional upon the general meeting also resolving on the amendment of the articles of association under item 7 and on the reduction of the share capital under item 8 on the agenda and that these resolutions are registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board of directors  or the person appointed by the board  is entitled to make minor adjustments to the above resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or in relation to Euroclear Sweden AB.The board’s proposal for a resolution to authorise the board to resolve on an over-allotment issue (item 10)The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to authorise the board of directors  in addition to the authorisation resolved by the general meeting on 10 June 2022 which was registered by the Swedish Companies Registration Office on 16 June 2022  to resolve  on one occasion  to issue additional shares in the event of oversubscription in the proposed rights issue pursuant to item 9 (the ""Rights Issue"")  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights. The Company's share capital may be increased by a maximum of SEK 1 238 542.95 through a new issue of a maximum of 123 854 295 shares  corresponding to 15 per cent of the Rights Issue. The subscription price shall be SEK 0.10 per share  which corresponds to the subscription price in the Rights Issue. When allocating shares  the Board shall resolve on allocation in accordance with the principles for allocation in the Rights Issue. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to be able to take advantage of the possibility for the Company to raise additional issue proceeds in the event of an oversubscription of the Rights Issue.Resolution under this item is conditional upon the general meeting also deciding to approve the board’s proposal for the amendment of the articles of association under item 7  the reduction of share capital under item 8 and the Rights Issue under item 9.In order to be valid  the resolution must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast at the meeting and the shares represented at the meeting.Resolution to authorise the board of directors to undertake minor adjustments of the resolutions (item 11)The board of directors proposes that the extraordinary general meeting authorises the board  the CEO or the person otherwise designated by the board  to undertake such minor adjustments and clarifications of the decisions made at the extraordinary general meeting to the extent required for registration of the resolutions.OTHERNumber of shares and votes in the CompanyAs the date of this notice  the total number of registered shares in the Company is 91 743 922 representing a total of 91 743 922 votes.

Amendment of article 11 of the Articles of AssociationThe Board of Directors proposes that article 11 of the Articles of Association be amended to enable holding a general meeting entirely without a meeting venue as a so-called remote meeting in addition to the Company’s domicile of Helsinki. The proposal is based on the changes to the Finnish Companies Act  including the possibility to arrange remote general meetings ensuring that all participating shareholders are able to exercise their full shareholder rights  including the right to present questions and to vote  in real time during the general meeting  irrespective of the chosen general meeting format. The possibility to organise remote general meetings enables the Company to be prepared for rapidly changing conditions in the Company’s operating environment and society in general  due to for example pandemics. It is important for the Company to have means to offer its shareholders the possibility to exercise their shareholder rights and resolve on any matters presented to a general meeting under any circumstances.In its amended form  said provision of the Articles of Association would read as follows:“11. General MeetingThe General Meetings of the company are held in Helsinki.The Board of Directors may resolve on organising the General Meeting without a meeting venue whereby the shareholders exercise their full decision-making power in real time during the meeting using telecommunication connection and technical means.The Annual General Meeting shall be held within six months of the end of the accounting period.”17.

If this authorisation is approved  it will revoke the share issuance authorisation granted to the Board of Directors by the Annual General Meeting on 28 March 2022.18.

The proposed maximum number of shares corresponds to approximately 6.2 per cent of the Company’s registered total number of shares at the time of the proposal.The shares would be repurchased using the Company’s invested unrestricted shareholders’ equity  and thus  the repurchases will reduce funds available for distribution. The shares could be repurchased for developing the Company’s capital structure  for financing or carrying out potential corporate acquisitions or other business arrangements  to be used as a part of the Company’s remuneration or incentive plans or to be otherwise transferred further  retained by the Company as treasury shares  or cancelled  for example.In accordance with the resolution of the Board of Directors  the shares may be repurchased either through an offer to all shareholders on equal terms or through other means and otherwise than in proportion to the existing shareholdings of the Company as directed repurchases  if the Board of Directors deems that there are weighty financial reasons for such directed repurchases.The purchase price per share shall be the market price of the shares quoted on the trading venues where the Company’s shares are traded or at the price otherwise established on the market terms at the time of the repurchase.The Board of Directors shall resolve on all other matters related to the repurchase of the Company’s own shares  including on how shares will be repurchased. Among other means  derivatives may be used in acquiring the shares.

Learn More .It might surprise some investors to know that the FTSE offers exposure to companies operating in the cannabis sector. But while other indexes  namely those in the US  provide greater choice  UK investors in overseas-listed cannabis stocks were recently told they must sell.This is because of Euroclear  a custodian — or financial trading settlement business  is no longer prepared to support these shares. Those investing through Hargreaves Lansdown and AJ Bell were told they need to sell their overseas holdings by January 27. As such  three of the most sold stocks on the Hargreaves platform last week were North American marijuana companies.So  what are the options for me as a UK investor now? Let’s take a look.Types of cannabis stockCannabis can be something of a taboo subject. Recreational use has been perceived fairly negatively for some years  but this is a sector that’s creating some interesting opportunities for investors. Increasingly we’re seeing businesses turning to the plant to develop consumer and medical products.Cannabidiol (or CBD) is legal and has become very popular in Western markets. I’ve followed closely the rise of TRIP  a UK-based  unlisted CBD drinks and oil firm  which has grown phenomenally quickly in recent years. As the founder of a sumac-based drinks company  I’ve been very jealous of its growth!But what about listed firms rather than privately-held start-ups? Broadly  I can categorise the sector into three parts. There are growers and retailers  pharma and biotechs  and ancillary firms. There’s not a lot of choice out there for me. But it’s growing.What am I considering?Associated British Foods is best known for its ownership of Primark  but in 2017 the group signed a deal with GW Pharmaceuticals to supply M250 marijuana — non‐psychoactive cannabis — for drug development purposes.It’s one of the largest cannabis growers in the UK. It converted 45 acres of tomato greenhouse space to grow hemp plants.However  it’s certainly worth nothing that investing in Associated British Foods won’t give me much exposure to the sector. After all  it’s only a small part of the firm’s huge portfolio. So I wouldn’t buy this stock just for its cannabis business.But I’m looking more closely at Futura Medical.This pharmaceutical group develops cosmetic and pain-relief cannabis medical products. Using its proprietary DermaSys technology  the cannabis-derived ingredients  including CBD  can be turned in a gel and absorbed through the skin.However  this is an early-stage R&D firm. The MED3000 product for erectile dysfunction was granted a UKCA mark in 2022  meaning it complies with the country’s regulations — but it’s not on sale yet. The company exploring commercialisation opportunities for CBD products but it may be some time before they reach the market.Obviously firms that are yet to bring a product to market carry greater risk than those already selling  but Futura Medical is one I’m going to be keeping a very close eye on.In addition to Futura and Associated British Foods  there are several micro-caps  including Kanabo and Cellular Goods. Their development is certainly something I’ll continue watching in this highly promising sector. I’m not a buyer in the sector yet  but I’m tracking it closely.,neutral,0.09,0.91,0.0,mixed,0.17,0.05,0.79,True,English,"['2 FTSE cannabis stocks', 'green’ revolution', 'financial trading settlement business', 'early-stage R&D firm', 'North American marijuana companies', 'UK-based, unlisted CBD drinks', 'pain-relief cannabis medical products', 'Dr James Fox', 'The Motley Fool', 'Premium Investing Services', 'Motley Fool member', 'top analyst recommendations', 'Associated British Foods', 'tomato greenhouse space', 'proprietary DermaSys technology', 'promising marijuana industry', 'sumac-based drinks company', 'non‐psychoactive cannabis', 'drug development purposes', 'overseas-listed cannabis stocks', 'largest cannabis growers', 'cannabis business', 'M250 marijuana', 'CBD products', 'oil firm', 'Futura Medical', 'FTSE-listed stocks', 'free article', 'instant access', 'depth research', 'other indexes', 'Hargreaves Lansdown', 'AJ Bell', 'overseas holdings', 'Hargreaves platform', 'taboo subject', 'Recreational use', 'interesting opportunities', 'Western markets', 'three parts', 'GW Pharmaceuticals', 'hemp plants', 'small part', 'huge portfolio', 'cannabis-derived ingredients', 'erectile dysfunction', 'UKCA mark', 'commercialisation opportunities', 'greater risk', 'close eye', 'several micro-caps', 'Cellular Goods', 'cannabis sector', 'promising sector', 'UK investor', 'listed firms', 'ancillary firms', 'closer look', 'greater choice', 'recent years', 'pharmaceutical group', 'investors', 'buyer', 'opinions', 'resources', 'exposure', 'Euroclear', 'shares', 'January', 'options', 'Types', 'something', 'businesses', 'consumer', 'Cannabidiol', 'rise', 'TRIP', 'founder', 'growth', 'start-ups', 'retailers', 'biotechs', 'lot', 'ownership', 'Primark', 'deal', '45 acres', 'cosmetic', 'gel', 'skin', 'country', 'regulations', 'sale', 'time', 'addition', 'Kanabo']",2023-02-13,2023-02-13,fool.co.uk

Dr. Berger has been serving as Chief Medical Officer and Global Head of Development since he joined Sanofi in 2019  after an extensive and successful career at various other pharmaceutical companies including Genentech  Bayer and Amgen.Paul HudsonCEO  Sanofi“Under John’s leadership  our R&D organization has built a robust pipeline and sharpened its research focus  employing cutting-edge therapeutic platforms and creating a culture that responds to the urgent needs of patients. His contribution to our company’s transformation has helped pave the way for Sanofi’s emergence as a science-driven and innovation leader in our industry. As we continue to build an exciting Specialty Care and Vaccines portfolio  we look forward to the growing momentum of our pipeline. This is what we were aiming for when we laid our strategy in 2019  and the 2022 results we recently published confirmed our choices. 2023 will only strengthen our commitment to transform the practice of medicine.”Story continuesAbout SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

For more stocks  head on over to 5 Most Profitable European Stocks. In today’s ...,In this piece  we will take a look at the 11 most profitable European stocks. For more stocks  head on over to 5 Most Profitable European Stocks.In today's highly divided and turbulent political and economic environment  if there's one thing that everyone can agree on  it's that 2022 was not a good year for Europe. Just as Europeans (and the world) were recovering from the pain of the coronavirus and the lockdowns  the brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine started. This invasion shocked the global energy market and it made for a rude awakening for Europe which had come to rely on easily accessible Russian gas and oil. As nations scuttered to diversify their energy supply chains  inflation surged across the European nations. In the Eurozone area  which does not include the United Kingdom  inflation from July to December was caused primarily by soaring energy prices. In fact  data from Eurostat shows that energy inflation peaked in October 2022  when prices grew by 4.4% - more than a full percentage higher than the next biggest item which was food (2.47%).These top two contributors to inflation were because of the Russian invasion since both Russia and Ukraine are among the largest grain producers in the world. Data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) shows that Ukraine was the world's fourth largest corn exporter and the fifth largest wheat exporter in April 2022 - only a couple of months after the Russian invasion. So naturally  a disruption in Ukraine creates a scarcity  which has been alleviated to an extent now after diplomatic efforts.Europe's biggest economy  Germany  was the most impacted by the energy disruptions. The German economy  which is a European powerhouse and dominated by large automakers such as Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (OTCMKTS:BMWYY)  was still stuttering to maintain growth as recently as December 2022. Data from the German federal statistics office showed that the December slowdown managed to surprise analysts. German industrial production dropped by 3.1% over the previous month  while analysts had expected it to slow down by 'only' 0.7%. Highlighting the addiction to Russian energy  the energy intensive sectors dropped by an even larger 6.1% in December. For the full year  the German industry slowed down by 5% over 2019 - the last 'normal' year the world has witnessed since the coronavirus pandemic broke out. Overall  the GDP grew by 1.9% in 2022  down from the 2.6% growth that was recorded in 2021.Another European nation - and one that isn't part of the EU - that saw blistering inflation last year is the United Kingdom. The U.K.'s consumer price index (CPI) soared to 9.6% in October - the same year that the Eurozone as a whole also saw its prices peak. This shattered a three-decade old record for a country that had seen such high levels previously in November 2022 when the inflation sat at 9.2%. Once again  this was also fueled by high energy costs  since gas prices in Britain rose by an unbelievable 128.9% in December 2022 while electricity prices jumped by 65.4%. The U.K. was doubly hit  as a global economic slowdown and the strength of the U.S. dollar drove down the value of the British Pound. Since the country is a net importer  a cheaper pound makes imports more expensive  and further burdens an already troubled population.Turning towards the corporate sector  high prices also affected firms' daily business operations. The difficulties of October are clear in the performance of the flagship British FTSE stock market. Called the 'footsie'  this index opened 2022 at 7 485 points but would tank to 6 826 by mid-October to mark an 8% drop. For the Euronext 100  the drop would be more painful. This index closed at 1 361 points in December 2021 and then dropped to 1 114 in October which saw it bleed 18% of its value. The French CAC 40 and the German DAX wouldn't fare any better either. The CAC 40 also dropped by 18% between January and October 2022  and the DAX bled an even larger 24% of its value in the same time period.Zooming in on the German industry  the automotive giant Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) saw its profit drop by a whopping 28% in the second quarter of 2022. Things did not improve much in the next quarter either  as the firm posted another profit drop of 26.5% during the third quarter.With these details in mind  it becomes crucial to look at which European companies managed to survive a brutal year and are among the top profit makers. Out of the 11 firms in our list today  the top three are Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)  TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE)  and A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S (OTCMKTS:AMKBY).11 Most Profitable European StocksImage credit: Pixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyIn order to sift out the most profitable European stocks  we took a look at different sectors such as shipping  automotive manufacturing  energy  telecommunications  and healthcare to identify the biggest companies.

The demand for assets that were considered as cheap at the start of 2023 (CLO spread compression was lagging the spread compression observed on most of the broader credit markets in Q4 2022) was strong and led the way to a solid January performance  after a disappointing December.At the end of January  the situation with regards to Loans fundamentals and CLOs is unchanged and still relatively supportive: default rates are low (0.4% for European loans and 0.8% for US loans on a last-12-month basis) and earnings are coming in slightly better than expected.Q4 2022 earning season is again illustrating our view that inflation can provide some benefits: it erodes the value of debt (hence facilitating refinancings and reducing the occurrence of defaults) and helps passing higher costs through to clients (it is easier to adjust selling prices to maintain some profitability when overall prices move versus when they are flat).Regarding 2023 expected default rates  the consensus amongst rating agencies and bank research publications appears to be that default rates may reach somewhere between 2.5 to 5% for both US and European loans. Our house view remains at the bottom of this range. We believe that these expectations are predominantly model based and that those models incorporate the shape of the yield curve (which is highly inverted in the US) as an indicator of the extent of the potential recession. Models also incorporate the pace in interest rates hikes through 2022 (we fully agree that this parameter makes sense) but totally ignore the benefit of inflation.Story continuesMost of our CLO positions paid cashflows in January; it was again a good month payments-wise: Volta received the equivalent of €9.8m of interests and coupons. Over the usual 6-month-basis time frame Volta received €24.3m of interest and coupons  ie. a 21.6% annualized cash flow to NAV.Given that defaults are still materializing at a low pace (remember that rating agencies were expecting default rates to be in the 2 to 2.5% range for 2022) - even if we are wrong and if default rates reach the higher end of the above-mentioned range – we consider CLO Equity quarterly payments being negatively impacted in 2023 as a very remote risk. On this front  we see an increased number of loan refinancings (amend-and-extend) enabling CLOs that are still reinvesting to increase the WAS (Weighted Average Spread) of their underlying loan books. All other things being equal  the higher the WAS the higher the cashflow distributed to the Equity.Volta’s underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** were as follow: +2.4% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +5.9% for CLO Equity tranches  +5.1% for CLO Debt tranches; and +6.3% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (which represent circa 2.2% of the fund’s NAV).No significant purchases were made in January although Volta was drawn by €1.75m from the European warehouse we opened in October (this drawn amount corresponds to settlement of loans purchased in October/November).As at the end of January 2023  Volta’s NAV was €225.2m or €6.16 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 1.81% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 1.23% as at 30 November 2022  0.58% was at 30 September 2022.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

Feb. 13  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Guerbet  a global leader in medical imaging with more than 30 years of experience in MRI  announced today the commercial launch and dosing of the first patient with Elucirem™ (gadopiclenol) injection following FDA approval in 2022. This next generation GBCA from Guerbet  highly stable macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)  has the highest relaxivity in its class for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is indicated for use in adults and children aged 2 years and older.1 4 Elucirem™ requires only half the gadolinium dose of conventional non-specific GBCAs  addressing practitioners' concerns about gadolinium exposure.2 3 The first dosing took place at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia  PA.""As a leader in the field of GBCA-based MRI imaging agents  we are proud to mark the first usage of Elucirem™. This milestone is the first of many for this novel new product  which has proven to be a promising step forward for the scientific and digital imaging community "" said David Hale  Chief Executive Officer at Guerbet.Elucirem™ (Gadopiclenol) injection is used to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system (brain  spine  and associated tissues) and the body (head and neck  thorax  abdomen  pelvis  and musculoskeletal system).1 Guerbet received FDA approval of Elucirem™ (NDA 216986) on September 21  2022 after priority review  a designation assigned to applications for drugs that provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of serious conditions compared to available therapies.5Story continuesGBCAs improve the contrast between lesions and surrounding tissues by accelerating the relaxation of protons thanks to interaction with gadolinium atoms. Gadopiclenol  the active drug substance of Elucirem™  has been designed to enable twice as much interaction  resulting in the highest relaxivity among all non-specific GBCAs.4 This allows use at half the conventional gadolinium dose to reveal high quality images.""Having the ability to use a lower dose of gadolinium  while seeing the diagnostic value and good tolerance during the MRI would be a significant improvement for the practice of neuroradiology "" said the study's principal investigator  Dr. Laurie A. Loevner  Division Chief  Neuroradiology and Professor of Radiology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.Elucirem is manufactured by Liebel-Flarsheim™ Company LLC  a Guerbet Group company  in Raleigh  North Carolina.About GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

Avoid use of GBCAs in these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrasted MRI or other modalities. The risk for NSF appears highest among patients with:Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (for example  age >60 years  hypertension or diabetes)  estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through laboratory testing.Indications and UsageELUCIREM™ (gadopiclenol) injection is indicated in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system (brain  spine  and associated tissues)  and the body (head and neck  thorax  abdomen  pelvis  and musculoskeletal system).ContraindicationsHistory of hypersensitivity reactions to ELUCIREMWarnings and PrecautionsNephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis: GBCAs increase the risk for NSF among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic  severe kidney disease as well as patients with acute kidney injury.Hypersensitivity Reactions: With GBCAs  serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred. In most cases  initial symptoms occurred within minutes of GBCA administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Before ELUCIREM administration  assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media  bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to ELUCIREM.Gadolinium Retention: Gadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. Consequences of gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established. Pathologic and clinical consequences of GBCA administration and retention in skin and other organs have been established in patients with impaired renal function. While clinical consequences of gadolinium retention have not been established in patients with normal renal function  certain patients might be at higher risk. These include patients requiring multiple lifetime doses  pregnant and pediatric patients  and patients with inflammatory conditions. Consider the retention characteristics of the agent when choosing a GBCA for these patients. Minimize repetitive GBCA imaging studies  particularly closely spaced studies when possibleAcute Kidney Injury: In patients with chronically reduced renal function  acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with the use of GBCAs. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with increasing dose of the contrast agent. Do not exceed the recommended dose.Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions: Injection site reactions such as injection site pain have been reported in the clinical studies with ELUCIREM. Extravasation during ELUCIREM administration may result in tissue irritation. Ensure catheter and venous patency before the injection of ELUCIREM.Interference with Visualization of Lesions Visible with Non-Contrast MRI: As with any GBCA  ELUCIREM may impair the visualization of lesions seen on non-contrast MRI. Therefore  caution should be exercised when Gadopiclenol MRI scans are interpreted without a companion non-contrast MRI scan.Adverse Reactions:In clinical trials  the most frequent adverse reactions that occurred in > 0.2% of patients who received ELUCIREM included: injection site pain  headache  nausea  injection site warmth  injection site coldness  dizziness  and localized swelling. Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency ≤ 0.2% in patients who received 0.05 mmol/kg BWELUCIREM included: maculopapular rash  vomiting  worsened renal impairment  feeling hot  pyrexia  oral paresthesia  dysgeusia  diarrhea  pruritus  allergic dermatitis  erythema  injection site paresthesia  Cystatin C increase  and blood creatinine increase.Use in Specific PopulationsPregnancy: GBCAs cross the human placenta and result in fetal exposure and gadolinium retention. There are no available data on ELUCIREM use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects  miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.Lactation: There are no data on the presence of ELUCIREM in human milk  the effects on the breastfed infant  or the effects on milk production. However  published lactation data on other GBCAs indicate that 0.01 to 0.04% of the maternal gadolinium dose is excreted in breast milk.Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of ELUCIREM have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age.Geriatric Use: This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney  and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.Renal Impairment: In patients with renal impairment  the exposure of gadopiclenol is increased compared to patients with normal renal function. This may increase the risk of adverse reactions such as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. No dose adjustment of ELUCIREM is recommended for patients with renal impairment. ELUCIREM can be removed from the body by hemodialysisYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

While maintenance revenue is still limited (€0.6 million)  it also continues to grow significantly  up 20% in 2022. The new PCSTORM contract for maintaining the platform in operating condition will generate a significant increase in recurring revenue over the coming months.Relative decline in “legacy” business revenue to €5.3 million : the legacy business (telecom operator solutions)  which requires little or no further capital expenditure  still accounts for 30% of annual revenue after a limited €0.5 million decline in 2022. Licence sales  which are intrinsically non-recurring  were down €1 million year on year (a new contract won in 2021 in North America significantly affected the comparison with 2022) and amounted to €0.9 million in 2022. “Legacy” services (€0.9 million) remained stable  while recurring maintenance revenue increased €0.5 million to €3.5 million in 2022._ OUTLOOK: PROFITABLE GROWTH AND STABLE FINANCIAL STRUCTUREAs announced  revenue growth was stronger in the second half (up €0.6 million or 7% to €9.5 million) than the first half (up €0.3 million or 4% to €8.1 million)  which should enable the Group to achieve another year of profitable growth thanks to strong second half operating margins and earnings  an improvement on the first half.Current 2023 revenue projections are satisfactory  even though the level of growth versus 2022 is not yet certain.Although several major projects are still underway  mainly in Southern Europe and UK  the volume and timing of the first orders have not yet been finalised  although they could still have a positive impact on the 2023 financial year. New business partnerships  particularly in the United States  are also showing promise and could pave the way for the first major deployments of the Group's technology (platforms) in North and South America.Recurring revenue from the legacy business is expected to remain stable in 2023. Furthermore  a number of platform migration projects in Europe and the United States could take shape over the coming months  generating slight growth in business.While major technical developments on team on mission are still in progress  they are expected to stabilise over the coming months. The Group will then be able to continue to invest in the deployment and development of team on the run in line with the “end-to-end” developments carried out in 2022: FSM modules (Field Service Management: management  organisation  coordination and optimisation of field services) and “geofencing” (virtual physical barriers and the associated alarm system).These developments further enhance the value of the solution  already highly comprehensive  thereby meeting the multiple requirements expressed by industrial giants operating in the aeronautics  transport and energy sectors.All of these developments are carried out in secure  scalable and sovereign technical architectures  which are important differentiators compared to the other solutions on the market. The integrated collaborative suite  advanced telephony features  SDKs and the various APIs available bring real operational value to the solution  thereby freeing it from the current technical and organisational constraints.The Group is therefore still aiming to maintain strong and profitable growth momentum and secure the human and technological resources required to achieve this. While the speed of widespread adoption of new critical communications and business-critical technologies remains unknown  the Group  which has become a major player in these areas thanks to the suitability and technological edge of its software solutions  remains ideally positioned to take advantage of the inevitable future growth of these markets.Next financial release: 2022 earnings  Monday 20 March 2023______________________________________________________________________________________________________About STREAMWIDE (Euronext Growth: ALSTW)A major player for 20 years in the critical communications market  STREAMWIDE has successfully developed its Team on mission (mission critical) and Team on the run (business critical) software solutions for administrations and businesses.These solutions for smartphones and PCs  offered in a SaaS model or on Premise  benefit from numerous functionalities such as the multimedia group discussions  VoIP  push-to-talk (MCPTT and MCx new generation 4G / 5G LTE)  geolocation  digitization and automation of business processes.

His contribution to our company’s transformation has helped pave the way for Sanofi’s emergence as a science-driven and innovation leader in our industry. As we continue to build an exciting Specialty Care and Vaccines portfolio  we look forward to the growing momentum of our pipeline. This is what we were aiming for when we laid our strategy in 2019  and the 2022 results we recently published confirmed our choices. 2023 will only strengthen our commitment to transform the practice of medicine.”About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

This growth was driven by its historic customers  notably in Latin America  the full-year contribution of sales of Distimp lines and the consolidation of Spine Innovations revenue from the second half of 2022.Spineway accordingly confirms the pertinence of its strategy based on more profitable markets (Europe  Australia) and Premium implant ranges.Operations accompanied by increased investmentThe gross margin continued to improve  rising by 1.4 points to 69% of revenue  generating a gross profit of €5.1 million. The intensification of investments necessary for development (regulatory and scientific expenses  increased R&D and marketing activities  larger headcount) and expenses related to the integration of Spine Innovations took operating expenses to €12.4 million. As a result  operating loss was € (3.2) million. Not impacted by insignificant net financial income and non-recurring expenses  net loss was € (3.1) million  compared with € (1.6) million in 2021  loss which didn’t included Spine Innovations.Sound financial structureThe Group’s financial structure remains sound  with cash of €5.5 million and cash net of financial liabilities of €4.1 million for total equity of €22.0 million as of December 31  2022.Confirmed ambitionsAs announced in its strategic plan  the Group has been able to increase its added value  significantly strengthen its teams and extend its geographical footprint.With an enhanced products range  Spine Innovations innovative disc prostheses and Distimp premium products lines  the Spineway group has entered a new phase of its history.For Stéphane Le Roux  Spineway CEO: “After a complex period  Spineway’ s resurgence is underway. 2022 was the year when our strategic choices paid off. Although the bottom line remains penalized by the need for investments  strong sales growth in France and internationally backs up our determination to return to breakeven in the medium term and will help the Spineway group to achieve its aim of becoming the innovative player in the less invasive treatment of spinal pathologies.”With its soundly established new assets  Spineway confirms its aim of becoming the innovative player in France and internationally  leader in less invasive spine treatments.Next event : April 13  2023 – Q1 2023 revenueSPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR PEA-SME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.com.This press release has been prepared in both English and French.

Without a major change in the circumstances  this trajectory should take us above the symbolic threshold of €1 billion in annual revenue for the entire 2022-2023financial year."" in €m 2021-2022 2022-2023 Change Organic 3rd quarter (to December 31) change* First quarter revenue 187.16 238.45 +27.4% +28.0% Second quarter revenue 189.14 238.75 +26.2% +28.7% Third quarter revenue 212.66 259.31 +21.9% +23.2% Nine-month revenue 588.96 736.51 +25.1% +26.5% Of which: France 276.32 308.80 +13.0% +13.0% Of which : International 315.64 427.71 +35.5% +38 1% * excluding external growth and exchange rate effects (exchange rate 2021-2022 applied to 2022-2023 revenue) The SII group  a specialist in engineering businesses  posted revenue of €259.3 million for the third quarter of the 2022-2023 financial year  a 21.9% increase. This performance is fully in line with the first half of the year. With the exception of Spain  all geographical entities contributed to this growth  fuelled by a continued high activity rate and ongoing commercial development. 1 / 3F I N A N C I A L R E L E A S E Constant growth in France In France  the SII group's third-quarter revenue totalled €109.6 million and achieved organic growth (+13.0%) of the same scale as in the first half of the year. For the first nine months overall  revenue totalled €308.8 million in France.

On this front  we see an increased number of …,"Volta Finance Limited (VTA / VTAS) – January 2023 monthly reportNOT FOR RELEASE  DISTRIBUTION  OR PUBLICATION  IN WHOLE OR PART  IN OR INTO THE UNITED STATES*****Guernsey  13 February 2023AXA IM has published the Volta Finance Limited (the “Company” or “Volta Finance” or “Volta”) monthly report for January 2023. The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYVolta Finance is pleased report a strong performance of +5.5%  for the first month of 2023.Although the CLO market is accustomed to a “January rally” the moves recorded in January 2023 were well above what might have been expected. Indeed  many investors were hesitant to invest in either CLO Debt or Equity tranches towards the end of 2022 but with the start of a new calendar year  the risk/reward perception shifted and translated into significant buying interest across the board. The demand for assets that were considered as cheap at the start of 2023 (CLO spread compression was lagging the spread compression observed on most of the broader credit markets in Q4 2022) was strong and led the way to a solid January performance  after a disappointing December.At the end of January  the situation with regards to Loans fundamentals and CLOs is unchanged and still relatively supportive: default rates are low (0.4% for European loans and 0.8% for US loans on a last-12-month basis) and earnings are coming in slightly better than expected.Q4 2022 earning season is again illustrating our view that inflation can provide some benefits: it erodes the value of debt (hence facilitating refinancings and reducing the occurrence of defaults) and helps passing higher costs through to clients (it is easier to adjust selling prices to maintain some profitability when overall prices move versus when they are flat).Regarding 2023 expected default rates  the consensus amongst rating agencies and bank research publications appears to be that default rates may reach somewhere between 2.5 to 5% for both US and European loans. Our house view remains at the bottom of this range. We believe that these expectations are predominantly model based and that those models incorporate the shape of the yield curve (which is highly inverted in the US) as an indicator of the extent of the potential recession. Models also incorporate the pace in interest rates hikes through 2022 (we fully agree that this parameter makes sense) but totally ignore the benefit of inflation.Most of our CLO positions paid cashflows in January; it was again a good month payments-wise: Volta received the equivalent of €9.8m of interests and coupons. Over the usual 6-month-basis time frame Volta received €24.3m of interest and coupons  ie. a 21.6% annualized cash flow to NAV.Given that defaults are still materializing at a low pace (remember that rating agencies were expecting default rates to be in the 2 to 2.5% range for 2022) - even if we are wrong and if default rates reach the higher end of the above-mentioned range – we consider CLO Equity quarterly payments being negatively impacted in 2023 as a very remote risk. On this front  we see an increased number of loan refinancings (amend-and-extend) enabling CLOs that are still reinvesting to increase the WAS (Weighted Average Spread) of their underlying loan books. All other things being equal  the higher the WAS the higher the cashflow distributed to the Equity.Volta’s underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** were as follow: +2.4% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +5.9% for CLO Equity tranches  +5.1% for CLO Debt tranches; and +6.3% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (which represent circa 2.2% of the fund’s NAV).No significant purchases were made in January although Volta was drawn by €1.75m from the European warehouse we opened in October (this drawn amount corresponds to settlement of loans purchased in October/November).As at the end of January 2023  Volta’s NAV was €225.2m or €6.16 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 1.81% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 1.23% as at 30 November 2022  0.58% was at 30 September 2022.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

Avoid use of GBCAs in these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrasted MRI or other modalities. The risk for NSF appears highest among patients with:Chronic  severe kidney disease (GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 )  orAcute kidney injury.Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (for example  age >60 years  hypertension or diabetes)  estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through laboratory testing.Indications and UsageELUCIREM™ (gadopiclenol) injection is indicated in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system (brain  spine  and associated tissues)  and the body (head and neck  thorax  abdomen  pelvis  and musculoskeletal system).ContraindicationsHistory of hypersensitivity reactions to ELUCIREMWarnings and PrecautionsNephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis: GBCAs increase the risk for NSF among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs.

Hypersensitivity Reactions: With GBCAs  serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred. In most cases  initial symptoms occurred within minutes of GBCA administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Before ELUCIREM administration  assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media  bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to ELUCIREM.With GBCAs  serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred.

Before ELUCIREM administration  assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media  bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to ELUCIREM. Gadolinium Retention: Gadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. Consequences of gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established. Pathologic and clinical consequences of GBCA administration and retention in skin and other organs have been established in patients with impaired renal function. While clinical consequences of gadolinium retention have not been established in patients with normal renal function  certain patients might be at higher risk. These include patients requiring multiple lifetime doses  pregnant and pediatric patients  and patients with inflammatory conditions. Consider the retention characteristics of the agent when choosing a GBCA for these patients.

Extravasation during ELUCIREM administration may result in tissue irritation. Ensure catheter and venous patency before the injection of ELUCIREM. Interference with Visualization of Lesions Visible with Non-Contrast MRI: As with any GBCA  ELUCIREM may impair the visualization of lesions seen on non-contrast MRI. Therefore  caution should be exercised when Gadopiclenol MRI scans are interpreted without a companion non-contrast MRI scan.Adverse Reactions:In clinical trials  the most frequent adverse reactions that occurred in > 0.2% of patients who received ELUCIREM included: injection site pain  headache  nausea  injection site warmth  injection site coldness  dizziness  and localized swelling. Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency ≤ 0.2% in patients who received 0.05 mmol/kg BWELUCIREM included: maculopapular rash  vomiting  worsened renal impairment  feeling hot  pyrexia  oral paresthesia  dysgeusia  diarrhea  pruritus  allergic dermatitis  erythema  injection site paresthesia  Cystatin C increase  and blood creatinine increase.Use in Specific PopulationsPregnancy: GBCAs cross the human placenta and result in fetal exposure and gadolinium retention.
