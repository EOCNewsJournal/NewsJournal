In the event that the share capital and the number of shares in the Company after registration of the share capital reduction and the rights issue fall below the proposed limits in the articles of association  the limits shall be adjusted to the extent necessary to enable registration.The resolution must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast at the meeting and the shares represented at the meeting in order to be valid.The board’s proposal for a resolution to reduce the share capital without withdrawal of shares for allocation to unrestricted equity (item 8)The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to reduce the Company's share capital to 917 439.22. The share capital will therefore be reduced by SEK 6 645 839.786801 for allocation to unrestricted equity and without withdrawal of shares.The reduction will be carried out in order to reduce the quota value of the shares in order to provide the Company with an increased amount of unrestricted equity through the proposed rights issue as set out in item 9 of the agenda. After the reduction  the Company's share capital will amount to SEK 917 439.22 divided on 91 743 922 shares (before the rights issue)  each share with a quota value of SEK 0.01.The decision to reduce the share capital can be implemented without obtaining the approval of the Swedish Companies Registration Office  as the Company is carrying out a rights issue increasing the share capital by a maximum of SEK 8 256 952.98  which means that neither the Company's restricted equity  nor its share capital  will be reduced.Resolutions under this item are subject to and conditional upon the general meeting also resolving on the amendment of the articles of association under item 7 and on the rights issue under item 9 on the agenda and that these resolutions are registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board’s proposal for a resolution on an issue of shares with preferential rights for the Company’s shareholders (item 9)The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on a new issue of a maximum of 825 695 298 shares resulting an increase in the share capital of a maximum of SEK 8 256 952.98 with preferential rights for existing shareholders.

The excess price shall be transferred to the free share premium fund.Shareholders who are registered in the Company’s share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB on the record date of 31 March 2023 will receive subscription rights for participation in the issue.The right to subscribe for shares shall  with preferential rights  be granted to those who are registered as shareholders in the Company on the record date for the new issue  whereby the holding of one (1) share entitles the holder to one (1) subscription right; one (1) subscription right entitles the holder to subscribe for nine (9) new shares.In the event that not all shares are subscribed for with the support of subscription rights  the board of directors shall  within the maximum amount of the rights issue  decide on the allocation of shares to those who subscribed for shares without the support of subscription rights in accordance with the following allocation criteria.In the first instance  allocation shall be made to those who subscribed for shares with the support of subscription rights  regardless of whether the subscriber was a shareholder on the record date or not  and in the event of oversubscription in proportion to the number of subscription rights exercised by each person to subscribe for shares and  to the extent that this cannot be done  by drawing of lots.In the second instance  allotment shall be made to other persons who have subscribed for shares without the support of subscription rights and  in the event that they are unable to obtain full allotment  in proportion to the number of shares that each person has notified for subscription and  to the extent that this cannot be done  by drawing of lots.In the third and final instance  any remaining shares shall be allocated to the persons who have subscribed in proportion to the size of the subscription commitment made and  to the extent that this cannot be done  by drawing of lots.Subscription of shares shall take place during a period of 14 days. The first day of the subscription period shall be two trading days after the date on which the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority has approved the prospectus drawn up in connection with the rights issue (but no later than 31 August 2023  to enable registration of the rights issue within six months of the date of the issue decision). However  the last day of the subscription period shall fall on a trading day. The Board of Directors is entitled to extend the subscription period.Payment for shares shall be made in cash or by set-off as stipulated in the board’s report regarding set-off  in accordance with Chapter 13 Section 7 of the Swedish Companies Act  which will provided in accordance with the information stated under the heading “Documents” below.Payment for shares subscribed for with preferential rights shall be made at the same time as subscription takes place during the subscription period. Payment for shares subscribed for without pre-emptive rights shall be made no later than three (3) banking days after the allotment notice has been sent to the subscriber. The Board of Directors has the right to extend the payment period.The new shares shall be entitled to dividend for the first time on the record date for dividend that falls closest after the shares issued in the rights issue have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and entered in the share registered maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB.Resolutions under this item are subject to and conditional upon the general meeting also resolving on the amendment of the articles of association under item 7 and on the reduction of the share capital under item 8 on the agenda and that these resolutions are registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board of directors  or the person appointed by the board  is entitled to make minor adjustments to the above resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or in relation to Euroclear Sweden AB.The board’s proposal for a resolution to authorise the board to resolve on an over-allotment issue (item 10)The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to authorise the board of directors  in addition to the authorisation resolved by the general meeting on 10 June 2022 which was registered by the Swedish Companies Registration Office on 16 June 2022  to resolve  on one occasion  to issue additional shares in the event of oversubscription in the proposed rights issue pursuant to item 9 (the ""Rights Issue"")  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights.

The subscription price shall be SEK 0.10 per share  which corresponds to the subscription price in the Rights Issue. When allocating shares  the Board shall resolve on allocation in accordance with the principles for allocation in the Rights Issue. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to be able to take advantage of the possibility for the Company to raise additional issue proceeds in the event of an oversubscription of the Rights Issue.Resolution under this item is conditional upon the general meeting also deciding to approve the board’s proposal for the amendment of the articles of association under item 7  the reduction of share capital under item 8 and the Rights Issue under item 9.In order to be valid  the resolution must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast at the meeting and the shares represented at the meeting.Resolution to authorise the board of directors to undertake minor adjustments of the resolutions (item 11)The board of directors proposes that the extraordinary general meeting authorises the board  the CEO or the person otherwise designated by the board  to undertake such minor adjustments and clarifications of the decisions made at the extraordinary general meeting to the extent required for registration of the resolutions.OTHERNumber of shares and votes in the CompanyAs the date of this notice  the total number of registered shares in the Company is 91 743 922 representing a total of 91 743 922 votes.

Amendment of article 11 of the Articles of AssociationThe Board of Directors proposes that article 11 of the Articles of Association be amended to enable holding a general meeting entirely without a meeting venue as a so-called remote meeting in addition to the Company’s domicile of Helsinki. The proposal is based on the changes to the Finnish Companies Act  including the possibility to arrange remote general meetings ensuring that all participating shareholders are able to exercise their full shareholder rights  including the right to present questions and to vote  in real time during the general meeting  irrespective of the chosen general meeting format. The possibility to organise remote general meetings enables the Company to be prepared for rapidly changing conditions in the Company’s operating environment and society in general  due to for example pandemics. It is important for the Company to have means to offer its shareholders the possibility to exercise their shareholder rights and resolve on any matters presented to a general meeting under any circumstances.In its amended form  said provision of the Articles of Association would read as follows:“11. General MeetingThe General Meetings of the company are held in Helsinki.The Board of Directors may resolve on organising the General Meeting without a meeting venue whereby the shareholders exercise their full decision-making power in real time during the meeting using telecommunication connection and technical means.The Annual General Meeting shall be held within six months of the end of the accounting period.”17.

If this authorisation is approved  it will revoke the share issuance authorisation granted to the Board of Directors by the Annual General Meeting on 28 March 2022.18.

The proposed maximum number of shares corresponds to approximately 6.2 per cent of the Company’s registered total number of shares at the time of the proposal.The shares would be repurchased using the Company’s invested unrestricted shareholders’ equity  and thus  the repurchases will reduce funds available for distribution. The shares could be repurchased for developing the Company’s capital structure  for financing or carrying out potential corporate acquisitions or other business arrangements  to be used as a part of the Company’s remuneration or incentive plans or to be otherwise transferred further  retained by the Company as treasury shares  or cancelled  for example.In accordance with the resolution of the Board of Directors  the shares may be repurchased either through an offer to all shareholders on equal terms or through other means and otherwise than in proportion to the existing shareholdings of the Company as directed repurchases  if the Board of Directors deems that there are weighty financial reasons for such directed repurchases.The purchase price per share shall be the market price of the shares quoted on the trading venues where the Company’s shares are traded or at the price otherwise established on the market terms at the time of the repurchase.The Board of Directors shall resolve on all other matters related to the repurchase of the Company’s own shares  including on how shares will be repurchased. Among other means  derivatives may be used in acquiring the shares. The authorisation is proposed to be effective for 18 months from the close of the Annual General Meeting i.e. until 28 September 2024.

In the event that the share capital and the number of shares in the Company after registration of the share capital reduction and the rights issue fall below the proposed limits in the articles of association  the limits shall be adjusted to the extent necessary to enable registration.The resolution must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast at the meeting and the shares represented at the meeting in order to be valid.The board’s proposal for a resolution to reduce the share capital without withdrawal of shares for allocation to unrestricted equity (item 8)The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to reduce the Company's share capital to 917 439.22. The share capital will therefore be reduced by SEK 6 645 839.786801 for allocation to unrestricted equity and without withdrawal of shares.The reduction will be carried out in order to reduce the quota value of the shares in order to provide the Company with an increased amount of unrestricted equity through the proposed rights issue as set out in item 9 of the agenda. After the reduction  the Company's share capital will amount to SEK 917 439.22 divided on 91 743 922 shares (before the rights issue)  each share with a quota value of SEK 0.01.The decision to reduce the share capital can be implemented without obtaining the approval of the Swedish Companies Registration Office  as the Company is carrying out a rights issue increasing the share capital by a maximum of SEK 8 256 952.98  which means that neither the Company's restricted equity  nor its share capital  will be reduced.Resolutions under this item are subject to and conditional upon the general meeting also resolving on the amendment of the articles of association under item 7 and on the rights issue under item 9 on the agenda and that these resolutions are registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board’s proposal for a resolution on an issue of shares with preferential rights for the Company’s shareholders (item 9)The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on a new issue of a maximum of 825 695 298 shares resulting an increase in the share capital of a maximum of SEK 8 256 952.98 with preferential rights for existing shareholders. The resolution shall in addition be subject to the following conditions.The shares shall be subscribed for at a price of SEK 0.10  giving a total subscription price of SEK 82 569 529.80. The excess price shall be transferred to the free share premium fund.Shareholders who are registered in the Company’s share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB on the record date of 31 March 2023 will receive subscription rights for participation in the issue.The right to subscribe for shares shall  with preferential rights  be granted to those who are registered as shareholders in the Company on the record date for the new issue  whereby the holding of one (1) share entitles the holder to one (1) subscription right; one (1) subscription right entitles the holder to subscribe for nine (9) new shares.In the event that not all shares are subscribed for with the support of subscription rights  the board of directors shall  within the maximum amount of the rights issue  decide on the allocation of shares to those who subscribed for shares without the support of subscription rights in accordance with the following allocation criteria.In the first instance  allocation shall be made to those who subscribed for shares with the support of subscription rights  regardless of whether the subscriber was a shareholder on the record date or not  and in the event of oversubscription in proportion to the number of subscription rights exercised by each person to subscribe for shares and  to the extent that this cannot be done  by drawing of lots.In the second instance  allotment shall be made to other persons who have subscribed for shares without the support of subscription rights and  in the event that they are unable to obtain full allotment  in proportion to the number of shares that each person has notified for subscription and  to the extent that this cannot be done  by drawing of lots.In the third and final instance  any remaining shares shall be allocated to the persons who have subscribed in proportion to the size of the subscription commitment made and  to the extent that this cannot be done  by drawing of lots.Subscription of shares shall take place during a period of 14 days. The first day of the subscription period shall be two trading days after the date on which the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority has approved the prospectus drawn up in connection with the rights issue (but no later than 31 August 2023  to enable registration of the rights issue within six months of the date of the issue decision). However  the last day of the subscription period shall fall on a trading day. The Board of Directors is entitled to extend the subscription period.Payment for shares shall be made in cash or by set-off as stipulated in the board’s report regarding set-off  in accordance with Chapter 13 Section 7 of the Swedish Companies Act  which will provided in accordance with the information stated under the heading “Documents” below.Payment for shares subscribed for with preferential rights shall be made at the same time as subscription takes place during the subscription period. Payment for shares subscribed for without pre-emptive rights shall be made no later than three (3) banking days after the allotment notice has been sent to the subscriber. The Board of Directors has the right to extend the payment period.The new shares shall be entitled to dividend for the first time on the record date for dividend that falls closest after the shares issued in the rights issue have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and entered in the share registered maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB.Resolutions under this item are subject to and conditional upon the general meeting also resolving on the amendment of the articles of association under item 7 and on the reduction of the share capital under item 8 on the agenda and that these resolutions are registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board of directors  or the person appointed by the board  is entitled to make minor adjustments to the above resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or in relation to Euroclear Sweden AB.The board’s proposal for a resolution to authorise the board to resolve on an over-allotment issue (item 10)The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to authorise the board of directors  in addition to the authorisation resolved by the general meeting on 10 June 2022 which was registered by the Swedish Companies Registration Office on 16 June 2022  to resolve  on one occasion  to issue additional shares in the event of oversubscription in the proposed rights issue pursuant to item 9 (the ""Rights Issue"")  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights. The Company's share capital may be increased by a maximum of SEK 1 238 542.95 through a new issue of a maximum of 123 854 295 shares  corresponding to 15 per cent of the Rights Issue. The subscription price shall be SEK 0.10 per share  which corresponds to the subscription price in the Rights Issue. When allocating shares  the Board shall resolve on allocation in accordance with the principles for allocation in the Rights Issue. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to be able to take advantage of the possibility for the Company to raise additional issue proceeds in the event of an oversubscription of the Rights Issue.Resolution under this item is conditional upon the general meeting also deciding to approve the board’s proposal for the amendment of the articles of association under item 7  the reduction of share capital under item 8 and the Rights Issue under item 9.In order to be valid  the resolution must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast at the meeting and the shares represented at the meeting.Resolution to authorise the board of directors to undertake minor adjustments of the resolutions (item 11)The board of directors proposes that the extraordinary general meeting authorises the board  the CEO or the person otherwise designated by the board  to undertake such minor adjustments and clarifications of the decisions made at the extraordinary general meeting to the extent required for registration of the resolutions.OTHERNumber of shares and votes in the CompanyAs the date of this notice  the total number of registered shares in the Company is 91 743 922 representing a total of 91 743 922 votes. The Company holds no own shares.Shareholders’ right to informationShareholders are informed of their right under Chapter 7  Section 32 of the Swedish Companies Act to request information about circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item of business on the agenda and about circumstances that may affect the assessment of the Company's financial situation.

This growth was driven by its historic customers  notably in Latin America  the full-year contribution of sales of Distimp lines and the consolidation of Spine Innovations revenue from the second half of 2022.Spineway accordingly confirms the pertinence of its strategy based on more profitable markets (Europe  Australia) and Premium implant ranges.Operations accompanied by increased investmentThe gross margin continued to improve  rising by 1.4 points to 69% of revenue  generating a gross profit of €5.1 million.

As a result  operating loss was € (3.2) million. Not impacted by insignificant net financial income and non-recurring expenses  net loss was € (3.1) million  compared with € (1.6) million in 2021  loss which didn’t included Spine Innovations.Story continuesSound financial structureThe Group’s financial structure remains sound  with cash of €5.5 million and cash net of financial liabilities of €4.1 million for total equity of €22.0 million as of December 31  2022.Confirmed ambitionsAs announced in its strategic plan  the Group has been able to increase its added value  significantly strengthen its teams and extend its geographical footprint.With an enhanced products range  Spine Innovations innovative disc prostheses and Distimp premium products lines  the Spineway group has entered a new phase of its history.For Stéphane Le Roux  Spineway CEO: “After a complex period  Spineway’ s resurgence is underway. 2022 was the year when our strategic choices paid off. Although the bottom line remains penalized by the need for investments  strong sales growth in France and internationally backs up our determination to return to breakeven in the medium term and will help the Spineway group to achieve its aim of becoming the innovative player in the less invasive treatment of spinal pathologies.”With its soundly established new assets  Spineway confirms its aim of becoming the innovative player in France and internationally  leader in less invasive spine treatments.Next event : April 13  2023 – Q1 2023 revenueSPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR PEA-SME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.com.This press release has been prepared in both English and French.

As we continue to build an exciting Specialty Care and Vaccines portfolio  we look forward to the growing momentum of our pipeline.

For more stocks  head on over to 5 Most Profitable European Stocks. In today’s ...,In this piece  we will take a look at the 11 most profitable European stocks. For more stocks  head on over to 5 Most Profitable European Stocks.In today's highly divided and turbulent political and economic environment  if there's one thing that everyone can agree on  it's that 2022 was not a good year for Europe. Just as Europeans (and the world) were recovering from the pain of the coronavirus and the lockdowns  the brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine started. This invasion shocked the global energy market and it made for a rude awakening for Europe which had come to rely on easily accessible Russian gas and oil. As nations scuttered to diversify their energy supply chains  inflation surged across the European nations. In the Eurozone area  which does not include the United Kingdom  inflation from July to December was caused primarily by soaring energy prices. In fact  data from Eurostat shows that energy inflation peaked in October 2022  when prices grew by 4.4% - more than a full percentage higher than the next biggest item which was food (2.47%).These top two contributors to inflation were because of the Russian invasion since both Russia and Ukraine are among the largest grain producers in the world. Data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) shows that Ukraine was the world's fourth largest corn exporter and the fifth largest wheat exporter in April 2022 - only a couple of months after the Russian invasion. So naturally  a disruption in Ukraine creates a scarcity  which has been alleviated to an extent now after diplomatic efforts.Europe's biggest economy  Germany  was the most impacted by the energy disruptions. The German economy  which is a European powerhouse and dominated by large automakers such as Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (OTCMKTS:BMWYY)  was still stuttering to maintain growth as recently as December 2022. Data from the German federal statistics office showed that the December slowdown managed to surprise analysts. German industrial production dropped by 3.1% over the previous month  while analysts had expected it to slow down by 'only' 0.7%. Highlighting the addiction to Russian energy  the energy intensive sectors dropped by an even larger 6.1% in December. For the full year  the German industry slowed down by 5% over 2019 - the last 'normal' year the world has witnessed since the coronavirus pandemic broke out. Overall  the GDP grew by 1.9% in 2022  down from the 2.6% growth that was recorded in 2021.Another European nation - and one that isn't part of the EU - that saw blistering inflation last year is the United Kingdom. The U.K.'s consumer price index (CPI) soared to 9.6% in October - the same year that the Eurozone as a whole also saw its prices peak. This shattered a three-decade old record for a country that had seen such high levels previously in November 2022 when the inflation sat at 9.2%. Once again  this was also fueled by high energy costs  since gas prices in Britain rose by an unbelievable 128.9% in December 2022 while electricity prices jumped by 65.4%. The U.K. was doubly hit  as a global economic slowdown and the strength of the U.S. dollar drove down the value of the British Pound. Since the country is a net importer  a cheaper pound makes imports more expensive  and further burdens an already troubled population.Turning towards the corporate sector  high prices also affected firms' daily business operations. The difficulties of October are clear in the performance of the flagship British FTSE stock market. Called the 'footsie'  this index opened 2022 at 7 485 points but would tank to 6 826 by mid-October to mark an 8% drop. For the Euronext 100  the drop would be more painful. This index closed at 1 361 points in December 2021 and then dropped to 1 114 in October which saw it bleed 18% of its value. The French CAC 40 and the German DAX wouldn't fare any better either. The CAC 40 also dropped by 18% between January and October 2022  and the DAX bled an even larger 24% of its value in the same time period.Zooming in on the German industry  the automotive giant Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) saw its profit drop by a whopping 28% in the second quarter of 2022. Things did not improve much in the next quarter either  as the firm posted another profit drop of 26.5% during the third quarter.With these details in mind  it becomes crucial to look at which European companies managed to survive a brutal year and are among the top profit makers. Out of the 11 firms in our list today  the top three are Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)  TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE)  and A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S (OTCMKTS:AMKBY).11 Most Profitable European StocksImage credit: Pixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyIn order to sift out the most profitable European stocks  we took a look at different sectors such as shipping  automotive manufacturing  energy  telecommunications  and healthcare to identify the biggest companies.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYVolta Finance is pleased report a strong performance of +5.5%  for the first month of 2023.Although the CLO market is accustomed to a “January rally” the moves recorded in January 2023 were well above what might have been expected. Indeed  many investors were hesitant to invest in either CLO Debt or Equity tranches towards the end of 2022 but with the start of a new calendar year  the risk/reward perception shifted and translated into significant buying interest across the board. The demand for assets that were considered as cheap at the start of 2023 (CLO spread compression was lagging the spread compression observed on most of the broader credit markets in Q4 2022) was strong and led the way to a solid January performance  after a disappointing December.At the end of January  the situation with regards to Loans fundamentals and CLOs is unchanged and still relatively supportive: default rates are low (0.4% for European loans and 0.8% for US loans on a last-12-month basis) and earnings are coming in slightly better than expected.Q4 2022 earning season is again illustrating our view that inflation can provide some benefits: it erodes the value of debt (hence facilitating refinancings and reducing the occurrence of defaults) and helps passing higher costs through to clients (it is easier to adjust selling prices to maintain some profitability when overall prices move versus when they are flat).Regarding 2023 expected default rates  the consensus amongst rating agencies and bank research publications appears to be that default rates may reach somewhere between 2.5 to 5% for both US and European loans. Our house view remains at the bottom of this range. We believe that these expectations are predominantly model based and that those models incorporate the shape of the yield curve (which is highly inverted in the US) as an indicator of the extent of the potential recession. Models also incorporate the pace in interest rates hikes through 2022 (we fully agree that this parameter makes sense) but totally ignore the benefit of inflation.Story continuesMost of our CLO positions paid cashflows in January; it was again a good month payments-wise: Volta received the equivalent of €9.8m of interests and coupons. Over the usual 6-month-basis time frame Volta received €24.3m of interest and coupons  ie. a 21.6% annualized cash flow to NAV.Given that defaults are still materializing at a low pace (remember that rating agencies were expecting default rates to be in the 2 to 2.5% range for 2022) - even if we are wrong and if default rates reach the higher end of the above-mentioned range – we consider CLO Equity quarterly payments being negatively impacted in 2023 as a very remote risk. On this front  we see an increased number of loan refinancings (amend-and-extend) enabling CLOs that are still reinvesting to increase the WAS (Weighted Average Spread) of their underlying loan books. All other things being equal  the higher the WAS the higher the cashflow distributed to the Equity.Volta’s underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** were as follow: +2.4% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +5.9% for CLO Equity tranches  +5.1% for CLO Debt tranches; and +6.3% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (which represent circa 2.2% of the fund’s NAV).No significant purchases were made in January although Volta was drawn by €1.75m from the European warehouse we opened in October (this drawn amount corresponds to settlement of loans purchased in October/November).As at the end of January 2023  Volta’s NAV was €225.2m or €6.16 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 1.81% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 1.23% as at 30 November 2022  0.58% was at 30 September 2022.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

Feb. 13  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Guerbet  a global leader in medical imaging with more than 30 years of experience in MRI  announced today the commercial launch and dosing of the first patient with Elucirem™ (gadopiclenol) injection following FDA approval in 2022. This next generation GBCA from Guerbet  highly stable macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)  has the highest relaxivity in its class for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is indicated for use in adults and children aged 2 years and older.1 4 Elucirem™ requires only half the gadolinium dose of conventional non-specific GBCAs  addressing practitioners' concerns about gadolinium exposure.2 3 The first dosing took place at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia  PA.""As a leader in the field of GBCA-based MRI imaging agents  we are proud to mark the first usage of Elucirem™. This milestone is the first of many for this novel new product  which has proven to be a promising step forward for the scientific and digital imaging community "" said David Hale  Chief Executive Officer at Guerbet.Elucirem™ (Gadopiclenol) injection is used to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system (brain  spine  and associated tissues) and the body (head and neck  thorax  abdomen  pelvis  and musculoskeletal system).1 Guerbet received FDA approval of Elucirem™ (NDA 216986) on September 21  2022 after priority review  a designation assigned to applications for drugs that provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of serious conditions compared to available therapies.5Story continuesGBCAs improve the contrast between lesions and surrounding tissues by accelerating the relaxation of protons thanks to interaction with gadolinium atoms. Gadopiclenol  the active drug substance of Elucirem™  has been designed to enable twice as much interaction  resulting in the highest relaxivity among all non-specific GBCAs.4 This allows use at half the conventional gadolinium dose to reveal high quality images.""Having the ability to use a lower dose of gadolinium  while seeing the diagnostic value and good tolerance during the MRI would be a significant improvement for the practice of neuroradiology "" said the study's principal investigator  Dr. Laurie A. Loevner  Division Chief  Neuroradiology and Professor of Radiology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.Elucirem is manufactured by Liebel-Flarsheim™ Company LLC  a Guerbet Group company  in Raleigh  North Carolina.About GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

Avoid use of GBCAs in these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrasted MRI or other modalities. The risk for NSF appears highest among patients with:Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (for example  age >60 years  hypertension or diabetes)  estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through laboratory testing.Indications and UsageELUCIREM™ (gadopiclenol) injection is indicated in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system (brain  spine  and associated tissues)  and the body (head and neck  thorax  abdomen  pelvis  and musculoskeletal system).ContraindicationsHistory of hypersensitivity reactions to ELUCIREMWarnings and PrecautionsNephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis: GBCAs increase the risk for NSF among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic  severe kidney disease as well as patients with acute kidney injury.Hypersensitivity Reactions: With GBCAs  serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred. In most cases  initial symptoms occurred within minutes of GBCA administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Before ELUCIREM administration  assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media  bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to ELUCIREM.Gadolinium Retention: Gadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. Consequences of gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established. Pathologic and clinical consequences of GBCA administration and retention in skin and other organs have been established in patients with impaired renal function. While clinical consequences of gadolinium retention have not been established in patients with normal renal function  certain patients might be at higher risk. These include patients requiring multiple lifetime doses  pregnant and pediatric patients  and patients with inflammatory conditions. Consider the retention characteristics of the agent when choosing a GBCA for these patients. Minimize repetitive GBCA imaging studies  particularly closely spaced studies when possibleAcute Kidney Injury: In patients with chronically reduced renal function  acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with the use of GBCAs. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with increasing dose of the contrast agent. Do not exceed the recommended dose.Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions: Injection site reactions such as injection site pain have been reported in the clinical studies with ELUCIREM. Extravasation during ELUCIREM administration may result in tissue irritation. Ensure catheter and venous patency before the injection of ELUCIREM.Interference with Visualization of Lesions Visible with Non-Contrast MRI: As with any GBCA  ELUCIREM may impair the visualization of lesions seen on non-contrast MRI. Therefore  caution should be exercised when Gadopiclenol MRI scans are interpreted without a companion non-contrast MRI scan.Adverse Reactions:In clinical trials  the most frequent adverse reactions that occurred in > 0.2% of patients who received ELUCIREM included: injection site pain  headache  nausea  injection site warmth  injection site coldness  dizziness  and localized swelling. Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency ≤ 0.2% in patients who received 0.05 mmol/kg BWELUCIREM included: maculopapular rash  vomiting  worsened renal impairment  feeling hot  pyrexia  oral paresthesia  dysgeusia  diarrhea  pruritus  allergic dermatitis  erythema  injection site paresthesia  Cystatin C increase  and blood creatinine increase.Use in Specific PopulationsPregnancy: GBCAs cross the human placenta and result in fetal exposure and gadolinium retention. There are no available data on ELUCIREM use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects  miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.Lactation: There are no data on the presence of ELUCIREM in human milk  the effects on the breastfed infant  or the effects on milk production. However  published lactation data on other GBCAs indicate that 0.01 to 0.04% of the maternal gadolinium dose is excreted in breast milk.Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of ELUCIREM have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age.Geriatric Use: This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney  and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.Renal Impairment: In patients with renal impairment  the exposure of gadopiclenol is increased compared to patients with normal renal function. This may increase the risk of adverse reactions such as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. No dose adjustment of ELUCIREM is recommended for patients with renal impairment. ELUCIREM can be removed from the body by hemodialysisYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

While maintenance revenue is still limited (€0.6 million)  it also continues to grow significantly  up 20% in 2022. The new PCSTORM contract for maintaining the platform in operating condition will generate a significant increase in recurring revenue over the coming months.Relative decline in “legacy” business revenue to €5.3 million : the legacy business (telecom operator solutions)  which requires little or no further capital expenditure  still accounts for 30% of annual revenue after a limited €0.5 million decline in 2022. Licence sales  which are intrinsically non-recurring  were down €1 million year on year (a new contract won in 2021 in North America significantly affected the comparison with 2022) and amounted to €0.9 million in 2022. “Legacy” services (€0.9 million) remained stable  while recurring maintenance revenue increased €0.5 million to €3.5 million in 2022._ OUTLOOK: PROFITABLE GROWTH AND STABLE FINANCIAL STRUCTUREAs announced  revenue growth was stronger in the second half (up €0.6 million or 7% to €9.5 million) than the first half (up €0.3 million or 4% to €8.1 million)  which should enable the Group to achieve another year of profitable growth thanks to strong second half operating margins and earnings  an improvement on the first half.Current 2023 revenue projections are satisfactory  even though the level of growth versus 2022 is not yet certain.Although several major projects are still underway  mainly in Southern Europe and UK  the volume and timing of the first orders have not yet been finalised  although they could still have a positive impact on the 2023 financial year. New business partnerships  particularly in the United States  are also showing promise and could pave the way for the first major deployments of the Group's technology (platforms) in North and South America.Recurring revenue from the legacy business is expected to remain stable in 2023. Furthermore  a number of platform migration projects in Europe and the United States could take shape over the coming months  generating slight growth in business.While major technical developments on team on mission are still in progress  they are expected to stabilise over the coming months. The Group will then be able to continue to invest in the deployment and development of team on the run in line with the “end-to-end” developments carried out in 2022: FSM modules (Field Service Management: management  organisation  coordination and optimisation of field services) and “geofencing” (virtual physical barriers and the associated alarm system).These developments further enhance the value of the solution  already highly comprehensive  thereby meeting the multiple requirements expressed by industrial giants operating in the aeronautics  transport and energy sectors.All of these developments are carried out in secure  scalable and sovereign technical architectures  which are important differentiators compared to the other solutions on the market. The integrated collaborative suite  advanced telephony features  SDKs and the various APIs available bring real operational value to the solution  thereby freeing it from the current technical and organisational constraints.The Group is therefore still aiming to maintain strong and profitable growth momentum and secure the human and technological resources required to achieve this. While the speed of widespread adoption of new critical communications and business-critical technologies remains unknown  the Group  which has become a major player in these areas thanks to the suitability and technological edge of its software solutions  remains ideally positioned to take advantage of the inevitable future growth of these markets.Next financial release: 2022 earnings  Monday 20 March 2023______________________________________________________________________________________________________About STREAMWIDE (Euronext Growth: ALSTW)A major player for 20 years in the critical communications market  STREAMWIDE has successfully developed its Team on mission (mission critical) and Team on the run (business critical) software solutions for administrations and businesses.These solutions for smartphones and PCs  offered in a SaaS model or on Premise  benefit from numerous functionalities such as the multimedia group discussions  VoIP  push-to-talk (MCPTT and MCx new generation 4G / 5G LTE)  geolocation  digitization and automation of business processes.

Sanofi announced today that Dr. John Reed  its Global Head of R&D  will be leaving the company to pursue a new opportunity outside Sanofi. The company warmly thanks Dr. Reed for his leadership over these last years. Since joining Sanofi in 2018  John has laid the foundation for the company’s R&D transformation. He helped reshape Sanofi’s discovery and development of therapeutics  focusing efforts on first and best in class medicines that have the potential to transform the practice of medicine and improve the lives of people with serious diseases  whilst managing the integration and development of new technology platforms and partnerships  and driving R&D productivity.In 2023  Sanofi will launch two first or best-in-class medicines that will address major needs in hemophilia and respiratory syncytial virus.

In the event that the share capital and the number of shares in the Company after registration of the share capital reduction and the rights issue fall below the proposed limits in the articles of association  the limits shall be adjusted to the extent necessary to enable registration.The resolution must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast at the meeting and the shares represented at the meeting in order to be valid.The board’s proposal for a resolution to reduce the share capital without withdrawal of shares for allocation to unrestricted equity (item 8)The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to reduce the Company's share capital to 917 439.22. The share capital will therefore be reduced by SEK 6 645 839.786801 for allocation to unrestricted equity and without withdrawal of shares.The reduction will be carried out in order to reduce the quota value of the shares in order to provide the Company with an increased amount of unrestricted equity through the proposed rights issue as set out in item 9 of the agenda. After the reduction  the Company's share capital will amount to SEK 917 439.22 divided on 91 743 922 shares (before the rights issue)  each share with a quota value of SEK 0.01.The decision to reduce the share capital can be implemented without obtaining the approval of the Swedish Companies Registration Office  as the Company is carrying out a rights issue increasing the share capital by a maximum of SEK 8 256 952.98  which means that neither the Company's restricted equity  nor its share capital  will be reduced.Resolutions under this item are subject to and conditional upon the general meeting also resolving on the amendment of the articles of association under item 7 and on the rights issue under item 9 on the agenda and that these resolutions are registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board’s proposal for a resolution on an issue of shares with preferential rights for the Company’s shareholders (item 9)The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on a new issue of a maximum of 825 695 298 shares resulting an increase in the share capital of a maximum of SEK 8 256 952.98 with preferential rights for existing shareholders. The resolution shall in addition be subject to the following conditions.The shares shall be subscribed for at a price of SEK 0.10  giving a total subscription price of SEK 82 569 529.80. The excess price shall be transferred to the free share premium fund.Shareholders who are registered in the Company’s share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB on the record date of 31 March 2023 will receive subscription rights for participation in the issue.The right to subscribe for shares shall  with preferential rights  be granted to those who are registered as shareholders in the Company on the record date for the new issue  whereby the holding of one (1) share entitles the holder to one (1) subscription right; one (1) subscription right entitles the holder to subscribe for nine (9) new shares.In the event that not all shares are subscribed for with the support of subscription rights  the board of directors shall  within the maximum amount of the rights issue  decide on the allocation of shares to those who subscribed for shares without the support of subscription rights in accordance with the following allocation criteria.In the first instance  allocation shall be made to those who subscribed for shares with the support of subscription rights  regardless of whether the subscriber was a shareholder on the record date or not  and in the event of oversubscription in proportion to the number of subscription rights exercised by each person to subscribe for shares and  to the extent that this cannot be done  by drawing of lots.In the second instance  allotment shall be made to other persons who have subscribed for shares without the support of subscription rights and  in the event that they are unable to obtain full allotment  in proportion to the number of shares that each person has notified for subscription and  to the extent that this cannot be done  by drawing of lots.In the third and final instance  any remaining shares shall be allocated to the persons who have subscribed in proportion to the size of the subscription commitment made and  to the extent that this cannot be done  by drawing of lots.Subscription of shares shall take place during a period of 14 days. The first day of the subscription period shall be two trading days after the date on which the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority has approved the prospectus drawn up in connection with the rights issue (but no later than 31 August 2023  to enable registration of the rights issue within six months of the date of the issue decision). However  the last day of the subscription period shall fall on a trading day. The Board of Directors is entitled to extend the subscription period.Payment for shares shall be made in cash or by set-off as stipulated in the board’s report regarding set-off  in accordance with Chapter 13 Section 7 of the Swedish Companies Act  which will provided in accordance with the information stated under the heading “Documents” below.Payment for shares subscribed for with preferential rights shall be made at the same time as subscription takes place during the subscription period. Payment for shares subscribed for without pre-emptive rights shall be made no later than three (3) banking days after the allotment notice has been sent to the subscriber. The Board of Directors has the right to extend the payment period.The new shares shall be entitled to dividend for the first time on the record date for dividend that falls closest after the shares issued in the rights issue have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and entered in the share registered maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB.Resolutions under this item are subject to and conditional upon the general meeting also resolving on the amendment of the articles of association under item 7 and on the reduction of the share capital under item 8 on the agenda and that these resolutions are registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board of directors  or the person appointed by the board  is entitled to make minor adjustments to the above resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or in relation to Euroclear Sweden AB.The board’s proposal for a resolution to authorise the board to resolve on an over-allotment issue (item 10)The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to authorise the board of directors  in addition to the authorisation resolved by the general meeting on 10 June 2022 which was registered by the Swedish Companies Registration Office on 16 June 2022  to resolve  on one occasion  to issue additional shares in the event of oversubscription in the proposed rights issue pursuant to item 9 (the ""Rights Issue"")  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights. The Company's share capital may be increased by a maximum of SEK 1 238 542.95 through a new issue of a maximum of 123 854 295 shares  corresponding to 15 per cent of the Rights Issue. The subscription price shall be SEK 0.10 per share  which corresponds to the subscription price in the Rights Issue. When allocating shares  the Board shall resolve on allocation in accordance with the principles for allocation in the Rights Issue. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to be able to take advantage of the possibility for the Company to raise additional issue proceeds in the event of an oversubscription of the Rights Issue.Resolution under this item is conditional upon the general meeting also deciding to approve the board’s proposal for the amendment of the articles of association under item 7  the reduction of share capital under item 8 and the Rights Issue under item 9.In order to be valid  the resolution must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast at the meeting and the shares represented at the meeting.Resolution to authorise the board of directors to undertake minor adjustments of the resolutions (item 11)The board of directors proposes that the extraordinary general meeting authorises the board  the CEO or the person otherwise designated by the board  to undertake such minor adjustments and clarifications of the decisions made at the extraordinary general meeting to the extent required for registration of the resolutions.OTHERNumber of shares and votes in the CompanyAs the date of this notice  the total number of registered shares in the Company is 91 743 922 representing a total of 91 743 922 votes.

He has previously held leading positions within Cevian Capital and worked at Danske Bank.A presentation of the proposed Board can be found at the company's website www.skf.com. Colleen Repplier has declined re-election at the Annual General Meeting 2023.Proposal under item 16The Board of Directors has prepared a Remuneration report which is proposed to be approved by the Annual General Meeting. The Remuneration report is available on the company's website  www.skf.com.Proposal under item 17The main contents of the Board of Directors' proposal are stated below. The complete proposal is available at the company and at the company's website  www.skf.com.At the Annual General Meeting in 2008 the SKF Group introduced a long-term performance share programme for senior managers and key employees. Since then  the Annual General Meeting has resolved each year upon a performance share programme.The Board proposes  in order to continue to link the long-term interests of the participants and the shareholders  strengthening the SKF Group's ability to attract and retain the best people and to contribute to the SKF Group's business strategy  its long-term interests and sustainability  that a decision be taken at the Annual General Meeting 2023 on SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023.The programme is proposed to cover not more than 225 senior managers and key employees in the SKF Group with an opportunity to be allotted  free of charge  SKF B shares in accordance with the following principal terms and guidelines. Under the programme  not more than in total 1 000 000 SKF B shares may be allotted.The allotment of shares shall be related to the level of achievement of the Total Value Added (TVA) target  as defined by the Board  and SKF's CDP Climate Change score target[1]. The TVA performance measure is weighted 80% and the CDP Climate Change score performance measure is weighted 20%.TVA performance measureTVA is a simplified  economic value-added model promoting greater operating profit  capital efficiency and profitable growth. TVA is the operating profit  less the pre-tax cost of capital.Over the three-year programme period (2023-2025)  the TVA performance target range is set annually by the Board against the baseline of the actual TVA achieved in the previous year. The overall performance achievement for the TVA performance measure of the programme is the average of achievements of the annual TVA targets. In order for allocation of shares to take place  the average TVA development must exceed a certain minimum level (the threshold level). In addition to the threshold level  a target level is set. Maximum allotment is awarded if the target level is reached or exceeded. By way of example  if the TVA achievement year 1 is 80%  year 2 is 100% and year 3 is 0%  the overall performance achievement of the programme would then be 60% (80%+100%+0% / 3).CDP Climate Change score performance measureCDP is a global non-profit organization known for its assessments and scoring methodology to evaluate companies' disclosure and performance relating to climate change and environmental impact. The CDP Climate Change score is based on an extensive questionnaire requiring disclosure and performance in the following categories: business strategy  financial planning & scenario analysis  emissions reduction initiatives  energy  governance  opportunity disclosure  risk disclosure  risk management processes  scope 1 & 2 emissions  scope 3 emissions  targets  and value chain engagement.This comprehensive assessment and the resulting score are known across the investor and customer communities as a credible third-party view on companies' approaches to climate change. The score ranges from A (leadership level) to D- (disclosure level). SKF received an A- in 2022 which is in the leadership band. This is higher than the Europe regional average of B  and higher than the metal product manufacturing sector average of C. The score is set annually and the bar is raised every year  reflecting increasing stakeholder expectations. SKF's performance achievement and CDP score will therefore require continuous improvements.The overall performance achievement for the CDP Climate Change score is the weighted average of the annual performance achievement  based on the following criteria:SKF's CDP Climate Change score Performance achievement A 100 % A- 75 % B 50 % <B 0 %For example  if SKF's CDP score is B year 1  A- year 2 and A year 3  the overall performance achievement for the full programme period is 75% (50%+75%+100% / 3).Provided that the performance measures of the programme are fully met  the participants of the programme may be allotted up to the following maximum number of shares per person within the various key groups:CEO and President – shares corresponding to a value of 75% of the fixed base salaryOther members of Group Management – shares corresponding to 55% of the fixed base salary or 13 000 shares  whichever is higherManagers of large business units and similar – 4 500 sharesOther senior managers – 3 000 sharesOther key persons – 1 250 sharesIf the total outcome of the programme exceeds the threshold level for allotment of shares but the final allotment is below 5% of the target level  payment will be made in cash instead of shares  whereupon the amount of the cash payment shall correspond to the value of the shares calculated on the basis of the closing price for SKF's B share the day before settlement.Allotment of shares requires that the employment of a person covered by the programme is not terminated before the end of the programme period. If all the conditions included in SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023 are met  allotment of shares shall be made free of charge following the expiry of the three-year calculation period  i.e. during 2026.Before the number of shares to be allotted is finally determined  the Board shall examine whether the allotment is reasonable considering SKF's financial results and position  the conditions on the stock market as well as other circumstances  and if not  as determined by the Board  reduce the number of shares to be awarded to the lower number of shares deemed appropriate by the Board.The Board is furthermore entitled to introduce an alternative incentive solution for employees in countries where participation in SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023 is not appropriate. Such alternative incentive solution shall  as far as practicable  be formulated employing the same conditions as SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023.The company has 455 351 068 shares in issue when this notice is issued. In order to comply with the obligations of SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023  a maximum number of 1 000 000 B shares are required  corresponding to approximately 0.2% of the total number of outstanding shares.Assuming maximum allocation under the Performance Share Programme 2023 and a share price of SEK 199  the cost  including social security cost  is estimated at approximately MSEK 239. On the basis of a share price of SEK 275  the cost  including social security cost  is estimated at approximately MSEK 330. In addition  the administrative costs are estimated at approximately MSEK 2.The Board does not propose for the time being to take any action to hedge SKF's obligations under the programme. Delivery of shares under the programme shall not take place until 2026._______________Number of shares and votes  and documentationWhen this notice is issued  the total number of shares in the company are 455 351 068  represented by 29 403 933 series A shares and 425 947 135 series B shares  with a total number of votes of 71 998 646.5.

The Remuneration report is available on the company's website  www.skf.com.Proposal under item 17The main contents of the Board of Directors' proposal are stated below. The complete proposal is available at the company and at the company's website  www.skf.com.At the Annual General Meeting in 2008 the SKF Group introduced a long-term performance share programme for senior managers and key employees. Since then  the Annual General Meeting has resolved each year upon a performance share programme.The Board proposes  in order to continue to link the long-term interests of the participants and the shareholders  strengthening the SKF Group's ability to attract and retain the best people and to contribute to the SKF Group's business strategy  its long-term interests and sustainability  that a decision be taken at the Annual General Meeting 2023 on SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023.The programme is proposed to cover not more than 225 senior managers and key employees in the SKF Group with an opportunity to be allotted  free of charge  SKF B shares in accordance with the following principal terms and guidelines. Under the programme  not more than in total 1 000 000 SKF B shares may be allotted.The allotment of shares shall be related to the level of achievement of the Total Value Added (TVA) target  as defined by the Board  and SKF's CDP Climate Change score target[1]. The TVA performance measure is weighted 80% and the CDP Climate Change score performance measure is weighted 20%.TVA performance measureTVA is a simplified  economic value-added model promoting greater operating profit  capital efficiency and profitable growth. TVA is the operating profit  less the pre-tax cost of capital.Over the three-year programme period (2023-2025)  the TVA performance target range is set annually by the Board against the baseline of the actual TVA achieved in the previous year. The overall performance achievement for the TVA performance measure of the programme is the average of achievements of the annual TVA targets. In order for allocation of shares to take place  the average TVA development must exceed a certain minimum level (the threshold level). In addition to the threshold level  a target level is set. Maximum allotment is awarded if the target level is reached or exceeded. By way of example  if the TVA achievement year 1 is 80%  year 2 is 100% and year 3 is 0%  the overall performance achievement of the programme would then be 60% (80%+100%+0% / 3).CDP Climate Change score performance measureCDP is a global non-profit organization known for its assessments and scoring methodology to evaluate companies' disclosure and performance relating to climate change and environmental impact. The CDP Climate Change score is based on an extensive questionnaire requiring disclosure and performance in the following categories: business strategy  financial planning & scenario analysis  emissions reduction initiatives  energy  governance  opportunity disclosure  risk disclosure  risk management processes  scope 1 & 2 emissions  scope 3 emissions  targets  and value chain engagement.This comprehensive assessment and the resulting score are known across the investor and customer communities as a credible third-party view on companies' approaches to climate change. The score ranges from A (leadership level) to D- (disclosure level). SKF received an A- in 2022 which is in the leadership band. This is higher than the Europe regional average of B  and higher than the metal product manufacturing sector average of C. The score is set annually and the bar is raised every year  reflecting increasing stakeholder expectations. SKF's performance achievement and CDP score will therefore require continuous improvements.The overall performance achievement for the CDP Climate Change score is the weighted average of the annual performance achievement  based on the following criteria:SKF's CDP Climate Change score Performance achievement A 100 % A- 75 % B 50 % 0 %For example  if SKF's CDP score is B year 1  A- year 2 and A year 3  the overall performance achievement for the full programme period is 75% (50%+75%+100% / 3).Provided that the performance measures of the programme are fully met  the participants of the programme may be allotted up to the following maximum number of shares per person within the various key groups:CEO and President – shares corresponding to a value of 75% of the fixed base salaryOther members of Group Management – shares corresponding to 55% of the fixed base salary or 13 000 shares  whichever is higherManagers of large business units and similar – 4 500 sharesOther senior managers – 3 000 sharesOther key persons – 1 250 sharesIf the total outcome of the programme exceeds the threshold level for allotment of shares but the final allotment is below 5% of the target level  payment will be made in cash instead of shares  whereupon the amount of the cash payment shall correspond to the value of the shares calculated on the basis of the closing price for SKF's B share the day before settlement.Allotment of shares requires that the employment of a person covered by the programme is not terminated before the end of the programme period. If all the conditions included in SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023 are met  allotment of shares shall be made free of charge following the expiry of the three-year calculation period  i.e. during 2026.Before the number of shares to be allotted is finally determined  the Board shall examine whether the allotment is reasonable considering SKF's financial results and position  the conditions on the stock market as well as other circumstances  and if not  as determined by the Board  reduce the number of shares to be awarded to the lower number of shares deemed appropriate by the Board.The Board is furthermore entitled to introduce an alternative incentive solution for employees in countries where participation in SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023 is not appropriate. Such alternative incentive solution shall  as far as practicable  be formulated employing the same conditions as SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023.The company has 455 351 068 shares in issue when this notice is issued. In order to comply with the obligations of SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023  a maximum number of 1 000 000 B shares are required  corresponding to approximately 0.2% of the total number of outstanding shares.Assuming maximum allocation under the Performance Share Programme 2023 and a share price of SEK 199  the cost  including social security cost  is estimated at approximately MSEK 239.

The Remuneration report is available on the company's website  www.skf.com.Proposal under item 17The main contents of the Board of Directors' proposal are stated below. The complete proposal is available at the company and at the company's website  www.skf.com.At the Annual General Meeting in 2008 the SKF Group introduced a long-term performance share programme for senior managers and key employees. Since then  the Annual General Meeting has resolved each year upon a performance share programme.The Board proposes  in order to continue to link the long-term interests of the participants and the shareholders  strengthening the SKF Group's ability to attract and retain the best people and to contribute to the SKF Group's business strategy  its long-term interests and sustainability  that a decision be taken at the Annual General Meeting 2023 on SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023.The programme is proposed to cover not more than 225 senior managers and key employees in the SKF Group with an opportunity to be allotted  free of charge  SKF B shares in accordance with the following principal terms and guidelines. Under the programme  not more than in total 1 000 000 SKF B shares may be allotted.The allotment of shares shall be related to the level of achievement of the Total Value Added (TVA) target  as defined by the Board  and SKF's CDP Climate Change score target[1]. The TVA performance measure is weighted 80% and the CDP Climate Change score performance measure is weighted 20%.TVA performance measureTVA is a simplified  economic value-added model promoting greater operating profit  capital efficiency and profitable growth. TVA is the operating profit  less the pre-tax cost of capital.Over the three-year programme period (2023-2025)  the TVA performance target range is set annually by the Board against the baseline of the actual TVA achieved in the previous year. The overall performance achievement for the TVA performance measure of the programme is the average of achievements of the annual TVA targets. In order for allocation of shares to take place  the average TVA development must exceed a certain minimum level (the threshold level). In addition to the threshold level  a target level is set. Maximum allotment is awarded if the target level is reached or exceeded. By way of example  if the TVA achievement year 1 is 80%  year 2 is 100% and year 3 is 0%  the overall performance achievement of the programme would then be 60% (80%+100%+0% / 3).CDP Climate Change score performance measureCDP is a global non-profit organization known for its assessments and scoring methodology to evaluate companies' disclosure and performance relating to climate change and environmental impact. The CDP Climate Change score is based on an extensive questionnaire requiring disclosure and performance in the following categories: business strategy  financial planning & scenario analysis  emissions reduction initiatives  energy  governance  opportunity disclosure  risk disclosure  risk management processes  scope 1 & 2 emissions  scope 3 emissions  targets  and value chain engagement.This comprehensive assessment and the resulting score are known across the investor and customer communities as a credible third-party view on companies' approaches to climate change. The score ranges from A (leadership level) to D- (disclosure level). SKF received an A- in 2022 which is in the leadership band. This is higher than the Europe regional average of B  and higher than the metal product manufacturing sector average of C. The score is set annually and the bar is raised every year  reflecting increasing stakeholder expectations. SKF's performance achievement and CDP score will therefore require continuous improvements.The overall performance achievement for the CDP Climate Change score is the weighted average of the annual performance achievement  based on the following criteria:SKF's CDP Climate Change score Performance achievement A 100 % A- 75 % B 50 % 0 %For example  if SKF's CDP score is B year 1  A- year 2 and A year 3  the overall performance achievement for the full programme period is 75% (50%+75%+100% / 3).Provided that the performance measures of the programme are fully met  the participants of the programme may be allotted up to the following maximum number of shares per person within the various key groups:CEO and President – shares corresponding to a value of 75% of the fixed base salaryOther members of Group Management – shares corresponding to 55% of the fixed base salary or 13 000 shares  whichever is higherManagers of large business units and similar – 4 500 sharesOther senior managers – 3 000 sharesOther key persons – 1 250 sharesIf the total outcome of the programme exceeds the threshold level for allotment of shares but the final allotment is below 5% of the target level  payment will be made in cash instead of shares  whereupon the amount of the cash payment shall correspond to the value of the shares calculated on the basis of the closing price for SKF's B share the day before settlement.Allotment of shares requires that the employment of a person covered by the programme is not terminated before the end of the programme period. If all the conditions included in SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023 are met  allotment of shares shall be made free of charge following the expiry of the three-year calculation period  i.e. during 2026.Before the number of shares to be allotted is finally determined  the Board shall examine whether the allotment is reasonable considering SKF's financial results and position  the conditions on the stock market as well as other circumstances  and if not  as determined by the Board  reduce the number of shares to be awarded to the lower number of shares deemed appropriate by the Board.The Board is furthermore entitled to introduce an alternative incentive solution for employees in countries where participation in SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023 is not appropriate. Such alternative incentive solution shall  as far as practicable  be formulated employing the same conditions as SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023.The company has 455 351 068 shares in issue when this notice is issued. In order to comply with the obligations of SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023  a maximum number of 1 000 000 B shares are required  corresponding to approximately 0.2% of the total number of outstanding shares.Assuming maximum allocation under the Performance Share Programme 2023 and a share price of SEK 199  the cost  including social security cost  is estimated at approximately MSEK 239. On the basis of a share price of SEK 275  the cost  including social security cost  is estimated at approximately MSEK 330. In addition  the administrative costs are estimated at approximately MSEK 2.The Board does not propose for the time being to take any action to hedge SKF's obligations under the programme. Delivery of shares under the programme shall not take place until 2026._______________Number of shares and votes  and documentationWhen this notice is issued  the total number of shares in the company are 455 351 068  represented by 29 403 933 series A shares and 425 947 135 series B shares  with a total number of votes of 71 998 646.5.

The Company thus announces that it will not take steps to convene a general meeting with dissolution as an agenda item (or take preparatory actions to that effect) until the Supreme Court has rendered a judgment in the aforementioned proceedings  and it will update the market by then.The above is without prejudice to the Company's previous communication of 13 January 2023  in which it was confirmed that the Company will not hold a general meeting with the dissolution on the agenda nor issue any invitation for a general meeting with the dissolution on the agenda until the President of the Court will have rendered a decision about the interim measures requested by the claimants in respect of the dissolution of the Company.Story continuesA detailed overview of the current proceedings is available on the Company website at: https://www.nyrstarnv.be/en/investors/restructuring/summary-of-ongoing-proceedings.About Nyrstar NVThe Company is incorporated in Belgium and listed on Euronext Brussels under the symbol NYR.

Almost to the day seven years after launching a simple web site to sell solar panel installations more easily in Norway  we stand here with a massive operation that helps hundreds of Europeans in 13 countries to go solar every week. Following a year of records for solar energy and green subsidy packages to consumers being strengthened across Europe  the timing for uplisting is perfect.

First results of the trial are expected mid-2023.Funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  the VLA1553-321 adolescent trial is intended to support the label extension in this age group following a potential initial regulatory approval in adults from the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) in the United States (U.S).Valneva completed rolling submission of the Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. FDA for approval of VLA1553 in persons aged 18 years and above in December 20221. If BLA filing is accepted and approved  VLA1553 could become the first chikungunya vaccine to be marketed in the U.S. Valneva reported final pivotal Phase 3 data for VLA1553 in March 20222 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20223. The Company also recently reported positive antibody persistence data with a 99% seroresponse rate 12 months after a single-dose vaccination4.The VLA1553-321 adolescent trial is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Europe and Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in endemic populations.Conducted in collaboration between Instituto Butantan and Valneva  VLA1553-321 is a double-blinded  multi-center  randomized and placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial. 754 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years were vaccinated following randomization at a 2:1 ratio to receive either VLA1553 or placebo. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate safety and immunogenicity 28 days following a single vaccination with VLA1553. Participants will be evaluated for the primary endpoint and followed up to twelve months. The study will also provide the first systematic safety and immunogenicity data in participants previously exposed to chikungunya.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “Recruitment completion in this study is an important milestone for the overall program. We reported compelling pivotal Phase 3 results in adults and in the elderly  and we are now looking forward to obtaining results in adolescents later this year. Chikungunya virus is a major  growing public health threat which has already impacted over 100 countries and affected millions worldwide  yet no vaccine or specific treatment is currently available to prevent this debilitating disease.”Dr. Esper Georges Kallas  President of Instituto Butantan  which will develop  manufacture and market VLA1553 in Low- and Middle-Income Countries  commented  “the achievement of this goal is a major milestone to expand the vaccine indication in adolescents. Based on a single-dose schedule  the VLA1553 chikungunya vaccine could become a key tool to prevent the chikungunya disease in endemics areas and fight the disease-induced public health burden.”Dr. Melanie Saville  Director of Vaccine Research & Development at CEPI  which provided funding for this study  added  “Millions of people have been affected by chikungunya and  today  over a billion people live in areas where chikungunya outbreaks occur. The progress Valneva has made to date brings the world one step closer towards a safe and effective vaccine against this debilitating disease  for which there is currently no specific treatment nor vaccine licenced for human use. Data from this Phase 3 study will help to ensure that the people most affected by this virus can benefit from this product and help regulators assess this important vaccine candidate.”To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15535. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20196  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.Brazil had an exponential increase of chikungunya cases in 2021 in comparison to 2020  according to data from the Brazilian Vigilance Health Secretary (SVS). At the beginning of December 2021  90 147 chikungunya cases had been registered compared to 78 808 over the same period in the previous year. The three states that most registered cases of the disease were Pernambuco (29 700 cases)  São Paulo (18 100 cases) and Paraíba (9 000 cases)  respectively. In 2021  São Paulo which is the most populous state in the country  went from 468 cases to 18 156 cases compared to 20207.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat. As of September 2020  there were more than 3 million reported cases in the Americas7 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after three to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. It is estimated that over three quarters of the world’s population live in areas at-risk of CHIKV transmission8. High risk areas of infection are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are currently endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 100 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 20229 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202210.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA155311. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201912  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.About Phase 3 study VLA1553-321VLA1553-321 is a prospective  double-blinded  multicenter  randomized  placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 trial conducted in 754 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old in Brazil. VLA1553 or placebo will be administered as a single intramuscular immunization to participants who will be randomized into two study groups at a 2:1 ratio. The primary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the adult dose of VLA1553 28 days following a single vaccination. Secondary objectives of the trial will include assessment of safety and immunogenicity up to twelve months following a single vaccination with VLA1553. The study will also provide safety and immunogenicity data in participants previously exposed to chikungunya.Additional information  including a detailed description of the study design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04650399).About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

These results reinforce the importance of this immunotherapy-tyrosine kinase inhibitor regimen for patients and its potential to help change survival expectations for patients with this challenging cancer.”In the CheckMate -9ER trial  OS (overall survival) benefits were maintained at over three-years of follow-up.1 Median OS was significantly higher for patients on Cabometyx in combination with nivolumab versus sunitinib  at 49.5 versus 35.5 months respectively [hazard ratio (HR) 0.70 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56–0.87]  p=0.0014)]  demonstrating a 30% reduction in the risk of death.1 Additionally  median OS improved by 11.8 months since the previous data cut at 32.9 months median follow-up.1Patients treated with Cabometyx in combination with nivolumab  versus those on sunitinib  also experienced benefits in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR; cancer shrinking with treatment):1Median PFS was almost doubled at 16.6 versus 8.4 months for Cabometyx in combination with nivolumab versus sunitinib respectively (HR 0.58 [95% CI 0.48–0.71]  p<0.0001).ORR was doubled with Cabometyx in combination with nivolumab versus sunitinib (95% CI  56% [50–61] versus 28% [24–34]). Responses also continued to be more durable with the combination  with a median DoR (duration of response) of 23.1 months compared to 15.2 months with sunitinib.Complete Response (CR) more than doubled for patients receiving Cabometyx in combination with nivolumab (12%) compared to those receiving sunitinib (5%).The safety profile identified in the CheckMate -9ER trial was consistent with that previously observed.Results were also assessed by the following International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk scores: favorable  intermediate  intermediate/poor and poor. Benefits were seen with Cabometyx in combination with nivolumab across all efficacy measures (OS  PFS  ORR and CR)  regardless of IMDC risk.1“At Ipsen  our goal is for people to live longer and live well with cancer and these results reinforce the value Cabometyx can bring to patients with advanced RCC when combined with immunotherapy in the first-line setting ” said Steven Hildemann  M.D. PhD  Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer  Head of Global Medical Affairs and Global Patient Safety. “The results from the CheckMate -9ER study continue to demonstrate sustained  now three-year long-term benefits for people living with advanced renal cell carcinoma across the most meaningful efficacy measures and risk scores  adding to the body of evidence we have for Cabometyx plus nivolumab. We sincerely thank the patients who participated in the trial  their families and their healthcare teams.”Six additional abstracts will be presented at ASCO GU assessing the benefits of Cabometyx in aRCC and non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (nccRCC). These include:The CaboCombo trial  which is a prospective  international  non-interventional study of first-line Cabometyx plus nivolumab for the treatment of patients with aRCC. This study will gather real-world evidence on the first-line use of Cabometyx plus nivolumab and demonstrates Ipsen’s commitment to advancing the evidence base on treatment options for people living with aRCC. 3Cohort 10 of the COSMIC-021 trial  which evaluates Cabometyx in combination with atezolizumab in nccRCC  and further assesses Cabometyx’s potential when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors. 7A biomarker analysis from the CheckMate -9ER trial showing that at 44-month median follow-up  median PFS and OS were improved with Cabometyx plus nivolumab versus sunitinib  regardless of PD-L1 status.4ENDSMore information can be found during the presentation sessions outlined below:Lead author/Presenter Indication Abstract title Presentation number/timing (PST) Laurence Albiges aRCC CaboPoint: Interim results from a Phase II study of cabozantinib after checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC)2 Oral and PosterAbstract #606Sat 18 Feb8:25 – 8:20 AMRapid Abstract Session: Renal and Rare Tumors Philippe Barthélémy aRCC CaboCombo: a prospective international non-interventional study of first-line cabozantinib plus nivolumab for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma3 PosterAbstract #TPS740Sat 18 Feb7:00 – 8:00 AM; 12:30 – 2:00 PMTrials in Progress Poster Session C: Renal Cell Cancer; Adrenal  Penile  Urethral  and Testicular Cancers Mauricio Burotto aRCC Nivolumab plus cabozantinib versus sunitinib for first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC): 3-year follow-up from the Phase III CheckMate -9ER trialError!

A total of 651 patients (23% favorable risk  58% intermediate risk  20% poor risk; 25% PD-L1 ≥1%) were randomized to Cabometyx plus nivolumab (n= 323) versus sunitinib (n= 328). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). The primary efficacy analysis compared the doublet combination versus sunitinib in all randomized patients. The trial is sponsored by Bristol Myers Squibb and Ono Pharmaceutical Co and co-funded by Exelixis  Ipsen and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.About the CaboCombo trial13CaboCombo is a prospective  international  real-world non-interventional study to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of Cabometyx and nivolumab in combination as a first-line treatment in adults with aRCC with clear cell-component  according to real-world clinical practice. A total of 311 patients will be enrolled across 70 centers in countries where the Cabometyx and nivolumab combination has marketing authorization and reimbursement. The decision to prescribe the combination will be made prior to  and independently from  the decision to enroll patients in the trial. The primary endpoint is real-world landmark overall survival assessed 18 months after the combination initiation. The CaboCombo study is sponsored by Ipsen.About the COSMIC-021 trial14COSMIC-021 is a multicenter  Phase Ib  open-label study that was divided into two parts: a dose-escalation phase and an expansion cohort phase. In the expansion phase  the trial enrolled 24 cohorts in 12 tumor types: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  RCC  urothelial carcinoma (UC)  castration-resistant prostate cancer  hepatocellular carcinoma  triple-negative breast cancer  epithelial ovarian cancer  endometrial cancer  gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma  colorectal adenocarcinoma  head and neck cancer  and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Exelixis is the study sponsor of COSMIC-021. Both Ipsen and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) have opted in to participate in the trial and are contributing to the funding for this study under the terms of the companies’ respective collaboration agreements with Exelixis. Roche is providing atezolizumab for the trial.About Cabometyx (cabozantinib)Cabozantinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)  including VEGFRs  MET  RET and the TAM family (TYRO3  MER  AXL). These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and pathologic processes such as oncogenesis  metastasis  tumor angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow)  drug resistance  modulation of immune activities and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment.Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx outside of the U.S. and Japan. Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx for all future indications in Japan. Exelixis holds the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Cabometyx in the U.S.In over 60 countries outside of the United States and Japan  including in the European Union (E.U.)  Cabometyx is currently indicated as:Monotherapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma: as first-line treatment of adult patients with intermediate or poor risk in adults following prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapyIn combination with nivolumab for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma in adultsMonotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC)  refractory or not eligible to radioactive iodine (RAI) who have progressed during or after prior systemic therapyMonotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in adults who have previously been treated with sorafenib.The detailed recommendations for the use of Cabometyx are described in the Summary of Product Characteristics (EU SmPC) and in the U.S. Prescribing Information (USPI).About IpsenIpsen is a global mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons and also taking into consideration assessment delays of certain clinical trials in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances  new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

The award follows a competitive tender.JCDecaux has operated the advertising space in Terminal 1 of BLR Airport since it opened in 2008  pioneering the first-ever use of digital screens in an Indian airport. This new contract extends JCDecaux’s footprint to the newly opened Terminal 2 (T2). Market studies project BLR Airport’s to reach 80 million passengers per year within the decade (vs. 33.7 million in 2019 and 10 million in 2008)  cementing its position as a global airport hub.With T2 now open for business  JCDecaux has committed to deliver a wide-ranging advertising portfolio including uniquely designed new displays and iconic digital furniture.

BLR Airport is India’s third largest airport behind Delhi and Mumbai  recording a sustained increase in passenger traffic (average annual growth of +13% pre-Covid-19  and the highest global growth in 2018 with a +29% increase). Thanks to the sharp increase in domestic traffic  BLR Airport is expected to have more than 50 million annual passengers in five years and 70 million within the next decade. The airport won the title of ‘Best Regional Airport in India and South Asia’ during the 2022 Skytrax World Airport Awards.JCDecaux  which entered the Indian market in 2006 with the iconic bus shelter concession in New Delhi  now operates in the country’s four main cities (Delhi  Mumbai  Bengaluru and Chennai) across several segments (street furniture  airports  metros and shopping centres).Kenneth Guldjberg  Bangalore International Airport Ltd’s (BIAL) Chief Commercial Officer  said: “We are pleased to continue our partnership with JCDecaux who have emerged as a successful bidder  with their capability to deliver world-class advertising through the use of innovation and sustainability which complements BIAL’s 4 key pillars on which T2 is being developed.

These results reinforce the importance of this immunotherapy-tyrosine kinase inhibitor regimen for patients and its potential to help change survival expectations for patients with this challenging cancer.”Story continuesIn the CheckMate -9ER trial  OS (overall survival) benefits were maintained at over three-years of follow-up.1 Median OS was significantly higher for patients on Cabometyx in combination with nivolumab versus sunitinib  at 49.5 versus 35.5 months respectively [hazard ratio (HR) 0.70 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56–0.87]  p=0.0014)]  demonstrating a 30% reduction in the risk of death.1 Additionally  median OS improved by 11.8 months since the previous data cut at 32.9 months median follow-up.1Patients treated with Cabometyx in combination with nivolumab  versus those on sunitinib  also experienced benefits in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR; cancer shrinking with treatment):1Median PFS was almost doubled at 16.6 versus 8.4 months for Cabometyx in combination with nivolumab versus sunitinib respectively (HR 0.58 [95% CI 0.48–0.71]  p<0.0001).ORR was doubled with Cabometyx in combination with nivolumab versus sunitinib (95% CI  56% [50–61] versus 28% [24–34]). Responses also continued to be more durable with the combination  with a median DoR (duration of response) of 23.1 months compared to 15.2 months with sunitinib.Complete Response (CR) more than doubled for patients receiving Cabometyx in combination with nivolumab (12%) compared to those receiving sunitinib (5%).The safety profile identified in the CheckMate -9ER trial was consistent with that previously observed.Results were also assessed by the following International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk scores: favorable  intermediate  intermediate/poor and poor. Benefits were seen with Cabometyx in combination with nivolumab across all efficacy measures (OS  PFS  ORR and CR)  regardless of IMDC risk.1“At Ipsen  our goal is for people to live longer and live well with cancer and these results reinforce the value Cabometyx can bring to patients with advanced RCC when combined with immunotherapy in the first-line setting ” said Steven Hildemann  M.D. PhD  Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer  Head of Global Medical Affairs and Global Patient Safety. “The results from the CheckMate -9ER study continue to demonstrate sustained  now three-year long-term benefits for people living with advanced renal cell carcinoma across the most meaningful efficacy measures and risk scores  adding to the body of evidence we have for Cabometyx plus nivolumab. We sincerely thank the patients who participated in the trial  their families and their healthcare teams.”Six additional abstracts will be presented at ASCO GU assessing the benefits of Cabometyx in aRCC and non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (nccRCC). These include:The CaboCombo trial  which is a prospective  international  non-interventional study of first-line Cabometyx plus nivolumab for the treatment of patients with aRCC.

A total of 651 patients (23% favorable risk  58% intermediate risk  20% poor risk; 25% PD-L1 ≥1%) were randomized to Cabometyx plus nivolumab (n= 323) versus sunitinib (n= 328). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). The primary efficacy analysis compared the doublet combination versus sunitinib in all randomized patients. The trial is sponsored by Bristol Myers Squibb and Ono Pharmaceutical Co and co-funded by Exelixis  Ipsen and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.About the CaboCombo trial13CaboCombo is a prospective  international  real-world non-interventional study to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of Cabometyx and nivolumab in combination as a first-line treatment in adults with aRCC with clear cell-component  according to real-world clinical practice. A total of 311 patients will be enrolled across 70 centers in countries where the Cabometyx and nivolumab combination has marketing authorization and reimbursement. The decision to prescribe the combination will be made prior to  and independently from  the decision to enroll patients in the trial. The primary endpoint is real-world landmark overall survival assessed 18 months after the combination initiation. The CaboCombo study is sponsored by Ipsen.About the COSMIC-021 trial14COSMIC-021 is a multicenter  Phase Ib  open-label study that was divided into two parts: a dose-escalation phase and an expansion cohort phase. In the expansion phase  the trial enrolled 24 cohorts in 12 tumor types: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  RCC  urothelial carcinoma (UC)  castration-resistant prostate cancer  hepatocellular carcinoma  triple-negative breast cancer  epithelial ovarian cancer  endometrial cancer  gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma  colorectal adenocarcinoma  head and neck cancer  and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Exelixis is the study sponsor of COSMIC-021. Both Ipsen and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) have opted in to participate in the trial and are contributing to the funding for this study under the terms of the companies’ respective collaboration agreements with Exelixis. Roche is providing atezolizumab for the trial.About Cabometyx (cabozantinib)Cabozantinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)  including VEGFRs  MET  RET and the TAM family (TYRO3  MER  AXL). These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and pathologic processes such as oncogenesis  metastasis  tumor angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow)  drug resistance  modulation of immune activities and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment.Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx outside of the U.S. and Japan. Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx for all future indications in Japan. Exelixis holds the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Cabometyx in the U.S.In over 60 countries outside of the United States and Japan  including in the European Union (E.U.)  Cabometyx is currently indicated as:Monotherapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma: as first-line treatment of adult patients with intermediate or poor risk in adults following prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapyIn combination with nivolumab for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma in adultsMonotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC)  refractory or not eligible to radioactive iodine (RAI) who have progressed during or after prior systemic therapyMonotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in adults who have previously been treated with sorafenib.The detailed recommendations for the use of Cabometyx are described in the Summary of Product Characteristics (EU SmPC) and in the U.S. Prescribing Information (USPI).About IpsenIpsen is a global mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons and also taking into consideration assessment delays of certain clinical trials in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances  new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

Simultaneously  Gilbert Dupont (Groupe Société Générale) initiated coverage of the stock with a note entitled “Reverse merger for the best”.The research reports are available on the website of the brokers: https://www.midcaps.portzamparc.fr; https://www.gilbertdupont.fr .About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company focused on (i) the development of innovative products to address high unmet needs in orthopedics and (ii) exploiting the possibilities offered by the therapeutic use of arsenic salts (mainly arsenic trioxide (ATO)) for patients with autoimmune diseases. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAPr.

The Company thus announces that it will not take steps to convene a general meeting with dissolution as an agenda item (or take preparatory actions to that effect) until the Supreme Court has rendered a judgment in the aforementioned proceedings  and it will update the market by then.The above is without prejudice to the Company's previous communication of 13 January 2023  in which it was confirmed that the Company will not hold a general meeting with the dissolution on the agenda nor issue any invitation for a general meeting with the dissolution on the agenda until the President of the Court will have rendered a decision about the interim measures requested by the claimants in respect of the dissolution of the Company.A detailed overview of the current proceedings is available on the Company website at: https://www.nyrstarnv.be/en/investors/restructuring/summary-of-ongoing-proceedings.About Nyrstar NVThe Company is incorporated in Belgium and listed on Euronext Brussels under the symbol NYR.

The abstract is entitled: “Obefazimod upregulates miR-124 and downregulates the expression of some cytokines in blood and rectal biopsies of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.”The Congress of ECCO is one of the world’s leading conferences focused on Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD)  such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.Prof. Hartmut J. Ehrlich  M.D.  CEO of Abivax  said: “After the recent publication of the data in the journal Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology  we are excited by the selection of our abstract for a poster presentation at the ECCO Congress. We believe the blood and biopsy data validates and extends obefazimod’s novel and potent anti-inflammatory mechanism of action. It complements our scientific findings released on our clinical Phase 2a and Phase 2b induction and maintenance results that were generated with obefazimod for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The scientific publication and the selection of the abstract show the increasing interest of the scientific community with respect to the novel mechanism of action of our lead molecule and its potential to efficiently  durably and safely treat UC patients.”Abivax Poster Presentation at the 18th Congress of ECCOSession date: Friday  March 3  2023Session name: Guided Poster SessionPresentation number: P001Session time: 12:30 - 1:30pm CETSession hall: Poster Exhibition  Hall B5&6​Presenter: Julien Santo  Ph.D.  Director of Translational Research at AbivaxAbivax recently published a scientific article  highlighting obefazimod’s novel mechanism of action and its capacity to treat patients with moderate to severe UC  in the peer-reviewed journal Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology (CTG) entitled: “ABX464 (obefazimod) up-regulates miR-124 to reduce pro-inflammatory markers in inflammatory bowel diseases.” [1]*****About Abivax (www.abivax.com)Abivax is a Phase 3 clinical stage biotechnology company  focused on developing therapeutics that modulate the immune system to treat patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

The net loss is similar to that of 2021  with an expense structure more focused on production activities. The development of our projects and the growth of our production capacity are being monitored by several oil companies  particularly Shell  with which we have signed a partnership agreement.”Marc Delcourt  co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies  explained: “Developing such an innovative value chain is an extraordinarily ambitious challenge. We are proud of our achievements in 2022. The latest campaign at Pomacle enabled us to produce around 1.5 tonnes of isobutene in just a week  representing 75% of maximum capacity. These improvements are fundamental because they reduce our production costs  which remain high  and strengthen the technical documentation necessary for the financing of the next plantn which will have much higher capacity and be run by ViaViridia  the subsidiary specially created for this purpose in December.”Group Profit & Loss AccountConsolidated financial statements (€ thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Operating income 1 715 3 881 3 276 of which sales 698 101 64 of which subsidies 895 3 024 3 072 of which change in inventory -118 731 - other 240 25 140 Operating expenses 14 907 17 229 16 332 Operating profit (loss) -13 192 -13 348 -13 056 EBITDA -11 367 -11 093 -9 777 Financial profit (loss) -95 -131 -184 Non-recurring items -147 -2 -172 Income tax (research tax credit) -1 447 -1 708 -2 264 Net income (loss) -11 986 -11 773 -11 1482022 revenue breaks down into €98 000 in sales of LAST® make-up products and €600 000 in sales split between (i) the sale of Isonaturane® samples for referencing and pilot formulation with several cosmetics companies including L’Oréal  (ii) the delivery of isobutene derivatives to several oil companies including Shell and Repsol  and (iii) various services including a research agreement signed with Shell at the end of the year. Subsidies were down due to the phasing out of the five projects obtained between 2017 and 2018 that received European funding.Story continuesBreakdown of operating expenses (€ thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Personnel costs 4 291 4 091 4 057 Industrialisation/Commercialisation 6 713 8 117 4 675 Laboratory 343 680 929 Rent and maintenance 850 834 1 027 Intellectual Property 323 562 693 Depreciation and amortisation 699 1 474 3 279 Other 1 688 1 471 1 672 Total 14 907 17 229 16 332Operating expenses dropped by over €2 million between 2021 and 2022.

The demonstrator that operated for four years in Leuna  Germany  used this process. In 2021  the decision was taken to create a production unit on the Pomacle-Bazancourt site using an “2-steps process”. This variation allows the use of conventional fermenters for a large part of the process. Ultimately  the “2-steps process” allows Global Bioenergies to produce on an industrial and commercial scale without having to make the considerable investments required to finance the specific fermenters for the “direct pathway”.Expenditure on the downstream production chain – corresponding to the conversion of isobutene into derivatives – is lower than in previous years as it is now confined to commercial production purposes  whereas in previous years it largely reflected the prevailing R&D challenges.Work on scaling up the process to ever-higher levels is intensifying: in 2022  over €1.1 million was allocated to studies relating to the prospective new plant run by the ViaViridia subsidiary.Finally  a significant investment was made in 2021 for the launch of the LAST® brand  producing finished goods  compliance testing – particularly for Isonaturane® 12 – addressing regulatory issues and marketing and communications. Expenses were contained in 2022 thanks to efforts to insource the various functions; by contrast  the business line’s revenue increased from €41 000 in 2021 to €98 000 in 2022.Group Balance SheetAssets (€ thousands) 31/12/2022 31/12/2021 Liabilities (€ thousands) 31/12/2022 31/12/2021 Intangible assets 539 800 Capital 749 743 Tangible assets 3 611 637 Share premium 16 029 29 289 Assets under construction 401 1 897 Balance carried forward -2 708 -4 697 Financial assets 1 546 1 544 Profit (loss) -11 986 -11 773 Equipment subsidies 463 - NON-CURRENT ASSETS 6 097 4 879 EQUITY 2 547 13 562 IBN  derivatives and finished products inventories 2 342 1 820 PROVISIONS 110 61 R&D consumables inventories 250 223 Receivables 3 647 3 524 Conditional advances and loans 11 486 12 454 Cash 8 768 20 931 Trade payables 5 580 3 520 Marketable securities 173 147 Tax and social security liabilities 886 1 185 Prepaid expenses 300 261 Other debts and deferred income 968 1 003 CURRENT ASSETS 15 480 26 907 PAYABLES and DEFERRED INCOME 18 921 18 163 TOTAL ASSETS 21 577 31 785 TOTAL LIABILITIES 21 577 31 785Fixed assets increased due to the commissioning of the Pomacle unit. Inventories of isobutene and derivatives increased due to the start of production of the first batch of Isonaturane®  to be delivered during the first half  notably to L’Oréal  which has ordered most of it. The gross cash position was €8.8 million.The negative retained earnings balance was allocated to the share premium by resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders on 2 June 2022. This accounting manoeuvre  which has no impact on equity  clarifies the presentation of the accounts and facilitates access to public financing. Trade payables increased as a result of the negotiation of more favourable payment terms for the Company in connection with the initiation of production activities.Highlights of 2022 and recent eventsCommissioning of a commercial Isonaturane® production line2022 saw production start on the first batch of Isonaturane® 12 during the summer  following orders placed by several major cosmetics companies  including L’Oréal  in June.For the first time since the Company’s creation  a commercial production process has been implemented. This production was made possible by the roll-out of an entirely French chain  coordinated by Global Bioenergies. The process is broken down into five steps carried out by five tollers  with Global Bioenergies teams involved in the second – and most decisive – step  during which isobutene is produced. This step is carried out at the Pomacle unit  the construction and commissioning of which were two of the major objectives achieved by Global Bioenergies in 2022. The Grand Est regional authority participated in the financing of this unit by granting Global Bioenergies a €500 000 subsidy as part of the France Relance plan.Global Bioenergies’ Isonaturane® 12 stands out in the world of cosmetic ingredients for its particularly high selling price. The fact that it is the first cosmetic grade isododecane of natural origin gives it a very high added value. This molecule  traditionally derived from oil  is essential for longwear  water-resistant and low transfer make-up. When incorporated to achieve these characteristics  it is the main ingredient  representing between 25% and 50% of the formulation.Isonaturane® 12 thus opens the way to naturalness in the so-called “longwear” make-up segment  which represents a quarter of the global make-up market. The selling price of Isonaturane® 12 benefits from the specific characteristics of the make-up sector:Limited volumes compared to other cosmetic applications - a make-up product represents only a few grams of formulated ingredients. A single tonne of Isonaturane ® 12 can switch the equivalent of 500 000 units of lipstick or mascara to natural ingredients. This limits the Company’s exposure to feedstock and energy price fluctuations.Very small proportion (less than 1%) of the cost of ingredients in the selling price of a finished make-up product.Recognition of Global Bioenergies’ cosmetic productsThe LAST® brand was first honoured by the prestigious judges of Marie Claire magazine  which awarded it the Prix d’Excellence France prize in the “Research and Innovation” category early in the year. LAST® is the world’s first make-up brand to incorporate Isonaturane® 12 and as such to combine naturalness and long-lasting performance.Then  in November  Isonaturane® 12 was rewarded at the 2022 In-CosmeticsTM Asia event in Bangkok. An independent panel of international cosmetics industry experts met to award the best innovations in cosmetic ingredients. Isonaturane® 12 received the Silver Award at the event. As a reminder  In-CosmeticsTM Asia is the Asian version of the world’s largest cosmetic ingredients trade show  welcoming exhibitors and visitors from over 70 countries and bringing the latest developments in the field to the heart of Asia.Interest in Global Bioenergies’ solutions among oil companiesIn June  Global Bioenergies announced that it had received its first order for isobutene derivatives from major oil company Shell  for performance testing. Following the success of these tests  the two companies formalised the start of a collaboration to develop low-carbon  high-octane road fuels in November. In September  Spanish oil company Repsol placed an order with Global Bioenergies for a batch of ETBE  a compound widely used in petrol formulations  combining isobutene and ethanol to produce a high-octane molecule. The ETBE supplied by Global Bioenergies was produced by converting wood residue into isobutene  combined with renewable ethanol  resulting in the formulation of the first fully renewable ETBE.As a reminder  from its early stages  Global Bioenergies has been looking to increase the number of resources that can be used in its process. Successfully converting wood residue into isobutene is a major innovation  which was developed by the European consortium REWOFUEL  which began four years’ work in 2018 and wound it up in 2022. Global Bioenergies coordinated this European project  which received a total of €13.8 million in funding from the European Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. Project partners included Repsol  as well as Sekab  Fibenol  SkyNRG  Neste  Peab  IPSB  Technip FMC  Metex NoovistaGo and Energie Institut JKU.During the REWOFUEL project  batches of renewable aviation fuels were produced and transferred to SkyNRG  a leading player in the field. These batches advanced Global Bioenergies’ efforts to certify the process for the eventual production of aviation fuels  subject to the improvement of the process to bring the costs to a level compatible with commercial operation in this area. After several years of work  the Company hopes to soon be recognised as the developer of the eighth technology in the world to receive ASTM certification.Strengthened commitment in favor of sustainable developmentSeveral actions have been undertaken to support Global Bioenergies' CSR ambitions  whether in favor of the Environment  Social/Societal  Governance or relations with External Stakeholders. In particular  a carbon assesment covering scopes 1 and 2 of the Evry laboratory's activities has been carried out  even as the laboratory's energy consumption has been reduced by 20% between 2021 and 2022 due to various actions. This first action anticipates the deployment of a similar approach for existing and future production units. A CSR Project Manager position has been created and filled to formalize efforts in a sustainable development strategy. The Ethifinance agency has recognized these efforts by increasing by 16 points the Gaïa rating  the ESG performance benchmark for small and medium sized companies listed in Europe. With a rating of 56/100  Global Bioenergies now exceeds the national average of 53/100 encompassing 391 companies.About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors. After launching the first long-lasting and natural make-up brand LAST® in 2021  Global Bioenergies is now marketing Isonaturane® 12  its key ingredient  to major cosmetics companies to improve the naturalness of their formulas whilst improving their carbon footprint. In the long run  Global Bioenergies is also aiming at cutting CO 2 emissions in the aviation and road sector and thereby curb global warming.

LTD (""CTTQ"")  a subsidiary of Sino Biopharm  in connection with the previously announced licensing and collaboration agreement dated September 21  2022.Cash and cash equivalents at year end also included the €25.0 million tranche of the previously announced unsecured loan agreement executed with the European Investment Bank (""EIB"") on May 16  2022  which the Company received on December 8  2022  the €9.3 million gross proceeds (€8.8 million net proceeds) raised through the Company's At-The-Market (""ATM"") Program on June 15  2022  and the proceeds of three previously announced loan agreements with a syndicate of French banks for a total amount of €5.3 million. One of the loans was contracted as part of a French state-guaranteed loan facility with Bpifrance  and the two other loans were obtained as part of a French state stimulus economic plan granted by Crédit Agricole Champagne-Bourgogne and Société Générale.Research and development (""R&D"") expenses for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased generally in line with the increase recorded during the first three quarters of 2022  and amounted to €60.5 million for the full year 2022  compared to €48.5 million in 2021. This increase was driven mostly by the costs associated with the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in NASH  including a full twelve months of operation for the U.S. affiliate and  to a lesser extent  with the LEGEND Phase IIa combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin in patients with NASH and type 2 diabetes (""T2D"").Net cash used in operating activities amounted to (€44.9) million for the full year 2022  compared to (€47.7) million in 2021. Net cash used in operating expenses in 2022 was driven primarily by R&D expenses  partially offset by the upfront payment received from CTTQ.Net cash generatedfrom (used in) investing activities amounted to (€8.9) million for the full year 2022 compared to (€1.8) million net cash used for the same period in 2021. The variance is mainly due to the change in short term deposits between both periods.Netcash generated from financing activities amounted to €37.3 million for the full year 2022 compared to €25.4 million for 2021. Net cash generated from financing activities in 2022 has been driven by the proceeds of the first tranche of €25 million from the EIB loan  proceeds of €9.3 million from the sale of securities through the Company's ATM program and proceeds of €5.3 million from three French state partially guaranteed loans  as described above.For the full year 2022  the Company recorded a negative exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents of (€1.0) million versus a positive effect of €4.8 million for 2021  due to the strengthening of USD versus Euro.Considering its current R&D and clinical development programs  the Company estimates that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits should allow the Company to fund its operations through the fourth quarter of 20232. This cash runway estimate does not include the conditional second tranche of €25.0 million of the EIB loan agreement3.RevenuesThe Company's revenues for the full year 2022 amounted to €12.2 million  as compared to €4.2 million for 2021. The revenues recorded in 2022 were driven mostly by the Company's development agreement with CTTQ  executed on September 21  2022  and revenues recorded in 2021 primarily consisted of a €4.0 million milestone payment for a milestone that was recorded following the launch by AbbVie of the Phase IIb clinical trial with cedirogant. As previously disclosed  this trial of cedirogant has since been discontinued by AbbVie and the partnership with AbbVie has been terminated.Next key milestones expectedPublication of the topline results of the investigator-initiated study with lanifibranor in patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (""NAFLD"") and T2D - planned for the first quarter of 2023Publication of the topline results of the LEGEND Phase IIa combination trial of lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin in patients with NASH and T2D - planned for the second half of 2023Last Patient First Visit of the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in NASH - targeted for the second half of 2023Upcoming investor conference participationCowen 43 rd Annual Health Care Conference - March 6-8 - Boston  MAAnnual Health Care Conference - March 6-8 - Boston  MA Guggenheim Health Altitudes Summit 2023 - March 13-16 - Telluride  ColoradoEvercore ISI NASH Renaissance - March 30 - VirtualKempen Life Sciences Conference - April 25-26 - AmsterdamUpcoming scientific conference participationGlobal NASH - March 2-3 - LondonAEEH - March 15-17 _ MadridLiver Connect conference - March 23-26 - Huntington Beach   CAAASLD Emerging topic: NASH Cirrhosis from mechanisms to management - March 25-26- Los Angeles  CANext financial results publicationFull-Year 2022 financial results: Wednesday  March 29  2023 (after U.S. market close)About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH  mucopolysaccharidoses (""MPS"") and other diseases with significant unmet medical need.

Simultaneously  Gilbert Dupont (Groupe Société Générale) initiated coverage of the stock with a note entitled “Reverse merger for the best”.The research reports are available on the website of the brokers: https://www.midcaps.portzamparc.fr; https://www.gilbertdupont.fr .About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company focused on (i) the development of innovative products to address high unmet needs in orthopedics and (ii) exploiting the possibilities offered by the therapeutic use of arsenic salts (mainly arsenic trioxide (ATO)) for patients with autoimmune diseases. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.Story continuesFor further information  please contact:BioSenic SAPr.

The milestone was celebrated by representatives from all of Otovo’s European markets  in addition to founder and CEO Andreas Thorsheim.— Almost to the day seven years after launching a shabby web site to sell solar panel installations more easily in Norway  we stand here with a massive operation that helps hundreds of Europeans go solar every week. I could not be prouder of the people of Otovo that have taken us here  and I am excited about the future we are building for energy in Europe  he says.Otovo’s entry on the Oslo Stock Exchange follows a year of rapid expansion and growth. The company entered six new markets with a combined addressable market of 1.5 million residential solar installations per year  bringing Otovo’s footprint to 13 European markets.The OSE entry comes on the heels of the company’s recently announced debt and equity financing package of EUR 125 million. From its first pre-seed round in February 2016 Otovo has raised EUR 120 million in equity and EUR 100 million in debt.— In 2022 wind and solar overtook fossil gas in the EU electricity market for the first time. 47 per cent more solar was added than in 2021 and Otovo grew at four times that pace. We see green subsidy packages to consumers being strengthened across many markets  enhancing a trend where solar energy sets records every year in Europe  Thorsheim remarks.— Today’s event marks Otovo’s entry to the big leagues. We enter a stage where we will focus on efficiency at scale  getting more panels and batteries out more cheaply  to the benefit of consumers  energy markets and our investors  says Thorsheim.The last day of trading on Euronext Growth Oslo was February 13th and the first day of trading on the Oslo Stock Exchange’s Main List is February 14th.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,positive,0.85,0.13,0.02,True,English,"['Oslo Stock Exchange', 'big leagues', 'main list', 'Otovo', '1.5 million residential solar installations', 'Oslo Stock Exchange', 'shabby web site', 'green subsidy packages', 'solar panel installations', 'EU electricity market', 'Euronext Growth Oslo', 'first pre-seed round', 'six new markets', 'equity financing package', 'CEO Andreas Thorsheim', 'residential solar company', 'European solar market', 'The OSE entry', 'addressable market', 'European markets', 'first time', 'many markets', 'solar energy', 'record breaking', 'Main List', 'massive operation', 'rapid expansion', 'fossil gas', 'four times', 'big leagues', 'first day', 'energy markets', 'last day', 'Otovo', 'trading', 'milestone', 'representatives', 'addition', 'founder', 'Norway', 'hundreds', 'Europeans', 'people', 'future', 'year', 'footprint', 'heels', 'debt', 'February', 'wind', '47 per', 'pace', 'consumers', 'trend', 'records', 'event', 'stage', 'efficiency', 'scale', 'panels', 'batteries', 'benefit', 'investors', '2022']",2023-02-14,2023-02-14,pv-magazine.com
