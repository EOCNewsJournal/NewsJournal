He has previously held leading positions within Cevian Capital and worked at Danske Bank.A presentation of the proposed Board can be found at the company's website www.skf.com. Colleen Repplier has declined re-election at the Annual General Meeting 2023.Proposal under item 16The Board of Directors has prepared a Remuneration report which is proposed to be approved by the Annual General Meeting. The Remuneration report is available on the company's website  www.skf.com.Proposal under item 17The main contents of the Board of Directors' proposal are stated below. The complete proposal is available at the company and at the company's website  www.skf.com.At the Annual General Meeting in 2008 the SKF Group introduced a long-term performance share programme for senior managers and key employees. Since then  the Annual General Meeting has resolved each year upon a performance share programme.The Board proposes  in order to continue to link the long-term interests of the participants and the shareholders  strengthening the SKF Group's ability to attract and retain the best people and to contribute to the SKF Group's business strategy  its long-term interests and sustainability  that a decision be taken at the Annual General Meeting 2023 on SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023.The programme is proposed to cover not more than 225 senior managers and key employees in the SKF Group with an opportunity to be allotted  free of charge  SKF B shares in accordance with the following principal terms and guidelines. Under the programme  not more than in total 1 000 000 SKF B shares may be allotted.The allotment of shares shall be related to the level of achievement of the Total Value Added (TVA) target  as defined by the Board  and SKF's CDP Climate Change score target[1]. The TVA performance measure is weighted 80% and the CDP Climate Change score performance measure is weighted 20%.TVA performance measureTVA is a simplified  economic value-added model promoting greater operating profit  capital efficiency and profitable growth. TVA is the operating profit  less the pre-tax cost of capital.Over the three-year programme period (2023-2025)  the TVA performance target range is set annually by the Board against the baseline of the actual TVA achieved in the previous year. The overall performance achievement for the TVA performance measure of the programme is the average of achievements of the annual TVA targets. In order for allocation of shares to take place  the average TVA development must exceed a certain minimum level (the threshold level). In addition to the threshold level  a target level is set. Maximum allotment is awarded if the target level is reached or exceeded. By way of example  if the TVA achievement year 1 is 80%  year 2 is 100% and year 3 is 0%  the overall performance achievement of the programme would then be 60% (80%+100%+0% / 3).CDP Climate Change score performance measureCDP is a global non-profit organization known for its assessments and scoring methodology to evaluate companies' disclosure and performance relating to climate change and environmental impact. The CDP Climate Change score is based on an extensive questionnaire requiring disclosure and performance in the following categories: business strategy  financial planning & scenario analysis  emissions reduction initiatives  energy  governance  opportunity disclosure  risk disclosure  risk management processes  scope 1 & 2 emissions  scope 3 emissions  targets  and value chain engagement.This comprehensive assessment and the resulting score are known across the investor and customer communities as a credible third-party view on companies' approaches to climate change. The score ranges from A (leadership level) to D- (disclosure level). SKF received an A- in 2022 which is in the leadership band. This is higher than the Europe regional average of B  and higher than the metal product manufacturing sector average of C. The score is set annually and the bar is raised every year  reflecting increasing stakeholder expectations. SKF's performance achievement and CDP score will therefore require continuous improvements.The overall performance achievement for the CDP Climate Change score is the weighted average of the annual performance achievement  based on the following criteria:SKF's CDP Climate Change score Performance achievement A 100 % A- 75 % B 50 % <B 0 %For example  if SKF's CDP score is B year 1  A- year 2 and A year 3  the overall performance achievement for the full programme period is 75% (50%+75%+100% / 3).Provided that the performance measures of the programme are fully met  the participants of the programme may be allotted up to the following maximum number of shares per person within the various key groups:CEO and President – shares corresponding to a value of 75% of the fixed base salaryOther members of Group Management – shares corresponding to 55% of the fixed base salary or 13 000 shares  whichever is higherManagers of large business units and similar – 4 500 sharesOther senior managers – 3 000 sharesOther key persons – 1 250 sharesIf the total outcome of the programme exceeds the threshold level for allotment of shares but the final allotment is below 5% of the target level  payment will be made in cash instead of shares  whereupon the amount of the cash payment shall correspond to the value of the shares calculated on the basis of the closing price for SKF's B share the day before settlement.Allotment of shares requires that the employment of a person covered by the programme is not terminated before the end of the programme period. If all the conditions included in SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023 are met  allotment of shares shall be made free of charge following the expiry of the three-year calculation period  i.e. during 2026.Before the number of shares to be allotted is finally determined  the Board shall examine whether the allotment is reasonable considering SKF's financial results and position  the conditions on the stock market as well as other circumstances  and if not  as determined by the Board  reduce the number of shares to be awarded to the lower number of shares deemed appropriate by the Board.The Board is furthermore entitled to introduce an alternative incentive solution for employees in countries where participation in SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023 is not appropriate. Such alternative incentive solution shall  as far as practicable  be formulated employing the same conditions as SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023.The company has 455 351 068 shares in issue when this notice is issued. In order to comply with the obligations of SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023  a maximum number of 1 000 000 B shares are required  corresponding to approximately 0.2% of the total number of outstanding shares.Assuming maximum allocation under the Performance Share Programme 2023 and a share price of SEK 199  the cost  including social security cost  is estimated at approximately MSEK 239. On the basis of a share price of SEK 275  the cost  including social security cost  is estimated at approximately MSEK 330. In addition  the administrative costs are estimated at approximately MSEK 2.The Board does not propose for the time being to take any action to hedge SKF's obligations under the programme. Delivery of shares under the programme shall not take place until 2026._______________Number of shares and votes  and documentationWhen this notice is issued  the total number of shares in the company are 455 351 068  represented by 29 403 933 series A shares and 425 947 135 series B shares  with a total number of votes of 71 998 646.5.

Since then  the Annual General Meeting has resolved each year upon a performance share programme.The Board proposes  in order to continue to link the long-term interests of the participants and the shareholders  strengthening the SKF Group's ability to attract and retain the best people and to contribute to the SKF Group's business strategy  its long-term interests and sustainability  that a decision be taken at the Annual General Meeting 2023 on SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023.The programme is proposed to cover not more than 225 senior managers and key employees in the SKF Group with an opportunity to be allotted  free of charge  SKF B shares in accordance with the following principal terms and guidelines. Under the programme  not more than in total 1 000 000 SKF B shares may be allotted.The allotment of shares shall be related to the level of achievement of the Total Value Added (TVA) target  as defined by the Board  and SKF's CDP Climate Change score target[1]. The TVA performance measure is weighted 80% and the CDP Climate Change score performance measure is weighted 20%.TVA performance measureTVA is a simplified  economic value-added model promoting greater operating profit  capital efficiency and profitable growth. TVA is the operating profit  less the pre-tax cost of capital.Over the three-year programme period (2023-2025)  the TVA performance target range is set annually by the Board against the baseline of the actual TVA achieved in the previous year. The overall performance achievement for the TVA performance measure of the programme is the average of achievements of the annual TVA targets. In order for allocation of shares to take place  the average TVA development must exceed a certain minimum level (the threshold level). In addition to the threshold level  a target level is set. Maximum allotment is awarded if the target level is reached or exceeded. By way of example  if the TVA achievement year 1 is 80%  year 2 is 100% and year 3 is 0%  the overall performance achievement of the programme would then be 60% (80%+100%+0% / 3).CDP Climate Change score performance measureCDP is a global non-profit organization known for its assessments and scoring methodology to evaluate companies' disclosure and performance relating to climate change and environmental impact. The CDP Climate Change score is based on an extensive questionnaire requiring disclosure and performance in the following categories: business strategy  financial planning & scenario analysis  emissions reduction initiatives  energy  governance  opportunity disclosure  risk disclosure  risk management processes  scope 1 & 2 emissions  scope 3 emissions  targets  and value chain engagement.This comprehensive assessment and the resulting score are known across the investor and customer communities as a credible third-party view on companies' approaches to climate change. The score ranges from A (leadership level) to D- (disclosure level). SKF received an A- in 2022 which is in the leadership band. This is higher than the Europe regional average of B  and higher than the metal product manufacturing sector average of C. The score is set annually and the bar is raised every year  reflecting increasing stakeholder expectations. SKF's performance achievement and CDP score will therefore require continuous improvements.The overall performance achievement for the CDP Climate Change score is the weighted average of the annual performance achievement  based on the following criteria:SKF's CDP Climate Change score Performance achievement A 100 % A- 75 % B 50 % <B 0 %For example  if SKF's CDP score is B year 1  A- year 2 and A year 3  the overall performance achievement for the full programme period is 75% (50%+75%+100% / 3).Provided that the performance measures of the programme are fully met  the participants of the programme may be allotted up to the following maximum number of shares per person within the various key groups:CEO and President – shares corresponding to a value of 75% of the fixed base salaryOther members of Group Management – shares corresponding to 55% of the fixed base salary or 13 000 shares  whichever is higherManagers of large business units and similar – 4 500 sharesOther senior managers – 3 000 sharesOther key persons – 1 250 sharesIf the total outcome of the programme exceeds the threshold level for allotment of shares but the final allotment is below 5% of the target level  payment will be made in cash instead of shares  whereupon the amount of the cash payment shall correspond to the value of the shares calculated on the basis of the closing price for SKF's B share the day before settlement.Allotment of shares requires that the employment of a person covered by the programme is not terminated before the end of the programme period. If all the conditions included in SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023 are met  allotment of shares shall be made free of charge following the expiry of the three-year calculation period  i.e. during 2026.Before the number of shares to be allotted is finally determined  the Board shall examine whether the allotment is reasonable considering SKF's financial results and position  the conditions on the stock market as well as other circumstances  and if not  as determined by the Board  reduce the number of shares to be awarded to the lower number of shares deemed appropriate by the Board.The Board is furthermore entitled to introduce an alternative incentive solution for employees in countries where participation in SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023 is not appropriate. Such alternative incentive solution shall  as far as practicable  be formulated employing the same conditions as SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023.The company has 455 351 068 shares in issue when this notice is issued. In order to comply with the obligations of SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023  a maximum number of 1 000 000 B shares are required  corresponding to approximately 0.2% of the total number of outstanding shares.Assuming maximum allocation under the Performance Share Programme 2023 and a share price of SEK 199  the cost  including social security cost  is estimated at approximately MSEK 239. On the basis of a share price of SEK 275  the cost  including social security cost  is estimated at approximately MSEK 330. In addition  the administrative costs are estimated at approximately MSEK 2.The Board does not propose for the time being to take any action to hedge SKF's obligations under the programme. Delivery of shares under the programme shall not take place until 2026._______________Number of shares and votes  and documentationWhen this notice is issued  the total number of shares in the company are 455 351 068  represented by 29 403 933 series A shares and 425 947 135 series B shares  with a total number of votes of 71 998 646.5.

The complete proposal is available at the company and at the company's website  www.skf.com.At the Annual General Meeting in 2008 the SKF Group introduced a long-term performance share programme for senior managers and key employees. Since then  the Annual General Meeting has resolved each year upon a performance share programme.The Board proposes  in order to continue to link the long-term interests of the participants and the shareholders  strengthening the SKF Group's ability to attract and retain the best people and to contribute to the SKF Group's business strategy  its long-term interests and sustainability  that a decision be taken at the Annual General Meeting 2023 on SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023.The programme is proposed to cover not more than 225 senior managers and key employees in the SKF Group with an opportunity to be allotted  free of charge  SKF B shares in accordance with the following principal terms and guidelines. Under the programme  not more than in total 1 000 000 SKF B shares may be allotted.The allotment of shares shall be related to the level of achievement of the Total Value Added (TVA) target  as defined by the Board  and SKF's CDP Climate Change score target[1]. The TVA performance measure is weighted 80% and the CDP Climate Change score performance measure is weighted 20%.TVA performance measureTVA is a simplified  economic value-added model promoting greater operating profit  capital efficiency and profitable growth. TVA is the operating profit  less the pre-tax cost of capital.Over the three-year programme period (2023-2025)  the TVA performance target range is set annually by the Board against the baseline of the actual TVA achieved in the previous year. The overall performance achievement for the TVA performance measure of the programme is the average of achievements of the annual TVA targets. In order for allocation of shares to take place  the average TVA development must exceed a certain minimum level (the threshold level). In addition to the threshold level  a target level is set. Maximum allotment is awarded if the target level is reached or exceeded. By way of example  if the TVA achievement year 1 is 80%  year 2 is 100% and year 3 is 0%  the overall performance achievement of the programme would then be 60% (80%+100%+0% / 3).CDP Climate Change score performance measureCDP is a global non-profit organization known for its assessments and scoring methodology to evaluate companies' disclosure and performance relating to climate change and environmental impact. The CDP Climate Change score is based on an extensive questionnaire requiring disclosure and performance in the following categories: business strategy  financial planning & scenario analysis  emissions reduction initiatives  energy  governance  opportunity disclosure  risk disclosure  risk management processes  scope 1 & 2 emissions  scope 3 emissions  targets  and value chain engagement.This comprehensive assessment and the resulting score are known across the investor and customer communities as a credible third-party view on companies' approaches to climate change. The score ranges from A (leadership level) to D- (disclosure level). SKF received an A- in 2022 which is in the leadership band. This is higher than the Europe regional average of B  and higher than the metal product manufacturing sector average of C. The score is set annually and the bar is raised every year  reflecting increasing stakeholder expectations. SKF's performance achievement and CDP score will therefore require continuous improvements.The overall performance achievement for the CDP Climate Change score is the weighted average of the annual performance achievement  based on the following criteria:SKF's CDP Climate Change score Performance achievement A 100 % A- 75 % B 50 % 0 %For example  if SKF's CDP score is B year 1  A- year 2 and A year 3  the overall performance achievement for the full programme period is 75% (50%+75%+100% / 3).Provided that the performance measures of the programme are fully met  the participants of the programme may be allotted up to the following maximum number of shares per person within the various key groups:CEO and President – shares corresponding to a value of 75% of the fixed base salaryOther members of Group Management – shares corresponding to 55% of the fixed base salary or 13 000 shares  whichever is higherManagers of large business units and similar – 4 500 sharesOther senior managers – 3 000 sharesOther key persons – 1 250 sharesIf the total outcome of the programme exceeds the threshold level for allotment of shares but the final allotment is below 5% of the target level  payment will be made in cash instead of shares  whereupon the amount of the cash payment shall correspond to the value of the shares calculated on the basis of the closing price for SKF's B share the day before settlement.Allotment of shares requires that the employment of a person covered by the programme is not terminated before the end of the programme period. If all the conditions included in SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023 are met  allotment of shares shall be made free of charge following the expiry of the three-year calculation period  i.e. during 2026.Before the number of shares to be allotted is finally determined  the Board shall examine whether the allotment is reasonable considering SKF's financial results and position  the conditions on the stock market as well as other circumstances  and if not  as determined by the Board  reduce the number of shares to be awarded to the lower number of shares deemed appropriate by the Board.The Board is furthermore entitled to introduce an alternative incentive solution for employees in countries where participation in SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023 is not appropriate. Such alternative incentive solution shall  as far as practicable  be formulated employing the same conditions as SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023.The company has 455 351 068 shares in issue when this notice is issued. In order to comply with the obligations of SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023  a maximum number of 1 000 000 B shares are required  corresponding to approximately 0.2% of the total number of outstanding shares.Assuming maximum allocation under the Performance Share Programme 2023 and a share price of SEK 199  the cost  including social security cost  is estimated at approximately MSEK 239.

The Company thus announces that it will not take steps to convene a general meeting with dissolution as an agenda item (or take preparatory actions to that effect) until the Supreme Court has rendered a judgment in the aforementioned proceedings  and it will update the market by then.The above is without prejudice to the Company's previous communication of 13 January 2023  in which it was confirmed that the Company will not hold a general meeting with the dissolution on the agenda nor issue any invitation for a general meeting with the dissolution on the agenda until the President of the Court will have rendered a decision about the interim measures requested by the claimants in respect of the dissolution of the Company.Story continuesA detailed overview of the current proceedings is available on the Company website at: https://www.nyrstarnv.be/en/investors/restructuring/summary-of-ongoing-proceedings.About Nyrstar NVThe Company is incorporated in Belgium and listed on Euronext Brussels under the symbol NYR.

This corresponds to an estimated market capitalisation of NOK 2.3 billion.Andreas Torsheim  founder and CEO of Otovo  said: ""Today's event marks Otovo's entry to the big leagues. Almost to the day seven years after launching a simple web site to sell solar panel installations more easily in Norway  we stand here with a massive operation that helps hundreds of Europeans in 13 countries to go solar every week. Following a year of records for solar energy and green subsidy packages to consumers being strengthened across Europe  the timing for uplisting is perfect.

First results of the trial are expected mid-2023.Funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  the VLA1553-321 adolescent trial is intended to support the label extension in this age group following a potential initial regulatory approval in adults from the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) in the United States (U.S).Valneva completed rolling submission of the Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. FDA for approval of VLA1553 in persons aged 18 years and above in December 20221. If BLA filing is accepted and approved  VLA1553 could become the first chikungunya vaccine to be marketed in the U.S. Valneva reported final pivotal Phase 3 data for VLA1553 in March 20222 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20223. The Company also recently reported positive antibody persistence data with a 99% seroresponse rate 12 months after a single-dose vaccination4.The VLA1553-321 adolescent trial is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Europe and Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in endemic populations.Conducted in collaboration between Instituto Butantan and Valneva  VLA1553-321 is a double-blinded  multi-center  randomized and placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial. 754 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years were vaccinated following randomization at a 2:1 ratio to receive either VLA1553 or placebo. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate safety and immunogenicity 28 days following a single vaccination with VLA1553. Participants will be evaluated for the primary endpoint and followed up to twelve months. The study will also provide the first systematic safety and immunogenicity data in participants previously exposed to chikungunya.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “Recruitment completion in this study is an important milestone for the overall program. We reported compelling pivotal Phase 3 results in adults and in the elderly  and we are now looking forward to obtaining results in adolescents later this year. Chikungunya virus is a major  growing public health threat which has already impacted over 100 countries and affected millions worldwide  yet no vaccine or specific treatment is currently available to prevent this debilitating disease.”Dr. Esper Georges Kallas  President of Instituto Butantan  which will develop  manufacture and market VLA1553 in Low- and Middle-Income Countries  commented  “the achievement of this goal is a major milestone to expand the vaccine indication in adolescents. Based on a single-dose schedule  the VLA1553 chikungunya vaccine could become a key tool to prevent the chikungunya disease in endemics areas and fight the disease-induced public health burden.”Dr. Melanie Saville  Director of Vaccine Research & Development at CEPI  which provided funding for this study  added  “Millions of people have been affected by chikungunya and  today  over a billion people live in areas where chikungunya outbreaks occur. The progress Valneva has made to date brings the world one step closer towards a safe and effective vaccine against this debilitating disease  for which there is currently no specific treatment nor vaccine licenced for human use. Data from this Phase 3 study will help to ensure that the people most affected by this virus can benefit from this product and help regulators assess this important vaccine candidate.”To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15535. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20196  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.Brazil had an exponential increase of chikungunya cases in 2021 in comparison to 2020  according to data from the Brazilian Vigilance Health Secretary (SVS). At the beginning of December 2021  90 147 chikungunya cases had been registered compared to 78 808 over the same period in the previous year. The three states that most registered cases of the disease were Pernambuco (29 700 cases)  São Paulo (18 100 cases) and Paraíba (9 000 cases)  respectively. In 2021  São Paulo which is the most populous state in the country  went from 468 cases to 18 156 cases compared to 20207.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat. As of September 2020  there were more than 3 million reported cases in the Americas7 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after three to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. It is estimated that over three quarters of the world’s population live in areas at-risk of CHIKV transmission8. High risk areas of infection are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are currently endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 100 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 20229 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202210.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA155311. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201912  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.About Phase 3 study VLA1553-321VLA1553-321 is a prospective  double-blinded  multicenter  randomized  placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 trial conducted in 754 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old in Brazil. VLA1553 or placebo will be administered as a single intramuscular immunization to participants who will be randomized into two study groups at a 2:1 ratio. The primary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the adult dose of VLA1553 28 days following a single vaccination. Secondary objectives of the trial will include assessment of safety and immunogenicity up to twelve months following a single vaccination with VLA1553. The study will also provide safety and immunogenicity data in participants previously exposed to chikungunya.Additional information  including a detailed description of the study design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04650399).About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

Before the emergence of COVID-19 CEPI’s priority diseases included Ebola virus  Lassa virus  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus  Nipah virus  Rift Valley Fever and chikungunya virus. CEPI also invested in platform technologies that can be used for rapid vaccine and immunoprophylactic development against unknown pathogens (Disease X).CEPI has moved with great urgency and in coordination with WHO in response to the emergence of COVID-19. CEPI has initiated 9 partnerships to develop vaccines against the novel coronavirus. The programmes will leverage rapid response platforms already supported by CEPI as well as new partnerships. The aim is to advance COVID-19 vaccine candidates into clinical testing as quickly as possible.CEPI  alongside Gavi and the World Health Organisation  co-leads the vaccines pillar of the ACT Accelerator – known as COVAX – which is working to develop  distribute and deploy COVID-19 vaccines to the world.

Simultaneously  Gilbert Dupont (Groupe Société Générale) initiated coverage of the stock with a note entitled “Reverse merger for the best”.The research reports are available on the website of the brokers: https://www.midcaps.portzamparc.fr; https://www.gilbertdupont.fr .About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company focused on (i) the development of innovative products to address high unmet needs in orthopedics and (ii) exploiting the possibilities offered by the therapeutic use of arsenic salts (mainly arsenic trioxide (ATO)) for patients with autoimmune diseases. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAPr.

The net loss is similar to that of 2021  with an expense structure more focused on production activities. The development of our projects and the growth of our production capacity are being monitored by several oil companies  particularly Shell  with which we have signed a partnership agreement.”Marc Delcourt  co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies  explained: “Developing such an innovative value chain is an extraordinarily ambitious challenge. We are proud of our achievements in 2022. The latest campaign at Pomacle enabled us to produce around 1.5 tonnes of isobutene in just a week  representing 75% of maximum capacity. These improvements are fundamental because they reduce our production costs  which remain high  and strengthen the technical documentation necessary for the financing of the next plantn which will have much higher capacity and be run by ViaViridia  the subsidiary specially created for this purpose in December.”Group Profit & Loss AccountConsolidated financial statements (€ thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Operating income 1 715 3 881 3 276 of which sales 698 101 64 of which subsidies 895 3 024 3 072 of which change in inventory -118 731 - other 240 25 140 Operating expenses 14 907 17 229 16 332 Operating profit (loss) -13 192 -13 348 -13 056 EBITDA -11 367 -11 093 -9 777 Financial profit (loss) -95 -131 -184 Non-recurring items -147 -2 -172 Income tax (research tax credit) -1 447 -1 708 -2 264 Net income (loss) -11 986 -11 773 -11 1482022 revenue breaks down into €98 000 in sales of LAST® make-up products and €600 000 in sales split between (i) the sale of Isonaturane® samples for referencing and pilot formulation with several cosmetics companies including L’Oréal  (ii) the delivery of isobutene derivatives to several oil companies including Shell and Repsol  and (iii) various services including a research agreement signed with Shell at the end of the year.

The demonstrator that operated for four years in Leuna  Germany  used this process. In 2021  the decision was taken to create a production unit on the Pomacle-Bazancourt site using an “2-steps process”. This variation allows the use of conventional fermenters for a large part of the process. Ultimately  the “2-steps process” allows Global Bioenergies to produce on an industrial and commercial scale without having to make the considerable investments required to finance the specific fermenters for the “direct pathway”.Expenditure on the downstream production chain – corresponding to the conversion of isobutene into derivatives – is lower than in previous years as it is now confined to commercial production purposes  whereas in previous years it largely reflected the prevailing R&D challenges.Work on scaling up the process to ever-higher levels is intensifying: in 2022  over €1.1 million was allocated to studies relating to the prospective new plant run by the ViaViridia subsidiary.Finally  a significant investment was made in 2021 for the launch of the LAST® brand  producing finished goods  compliance testing – particularly for Isonaturane® 12 – addressing regulatory issues and marketing and communications. Expenses were contained in 2022 thanks to efforts to insource the various functions; by contrast  the business line’s revenue increased from €41 000 in 2021 to €98 000 in 2022.Group Balance SheetAssets (€ thousands) 31/12/2022 31/12/2021 Liabilities (€ thousands) 31/12/2022 31/12/2021 Intangible assets 539 800 Capital 749 743 Tangible assets 3 611 637 Share premium 16 029 29 289 Assets under construction 401 1 897 Balance carried forward -2 708 -4 697 Financial assets 1 546 1 544 Profit (loss) -11 986 -11 773 Equipment subsidies 463 - NON-CURRENT ASSETS 6 097 4 879 EQUITY 2 547 13 562 IBN  derivatives and finished products inventories 2 342 1 820 PROVISIONS 110 61 R&D consumables inventories 250 223 Receivables 3 647 3 524 Conditional advances and loans 11 486 12 454 Cash 8 768 20 931 Trade payables 5 580 3 520 Marketable securities 173 147 Tax and social security liabilities 886 1 185 Prepaid expenses 300 261 Other debts and deferred income 968 1 003 CURRENT ASSETS 15 480 26 907 PAYABLES and DEFERRED INCOME 18 921 18 163 TOTAL ASSETS 21 577 31 785 TOTAL LIABILITIES 21 577 31 785Fixed assets increased due to the commissioning of the Pomacle unit. Inventories of isobutene and derivatives increased due to the start of production of the first batch of Isonaturane®  to be delivered during the first half  notably to L’Oréal  which has ordered most of it. The gross cash position was €8.8 million.The negative retained earnings balance was allocated to the share premium by resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders on 2 June 2022. This accounting manoeuvre  which has no impact on equity  clarifies the presentation of the accounts and facilitates access to public financing. Trade payables increased as a result of the negotiation of more favourable payment terms for the Company in connection with the initiation of production activities.Highlights of 2022 and recent eventsCommissioning of a commercial Isonaturane® production line2022 saw production start on the first batch of Isonaturane® 12 during the summer  following orders placed by several major cosmetics companies  including L’Oréal  in June.For the first time since the Company’s creation  a commercial production process has been implemented. This production was made possible by the roll-out of an entirely French chain  coordinated by Global Bioenergies. The process is broken down into five steps carried out by five tollers  with Global Bioenergies teams involved in the second – and most decisive – step  during which isobutene is produced. This step is carried out at the Pomacle unit  the construction and commissioning of which were two of the major objectives achieved by Global Bioenergies in 2022. The Grand Est regional authority participated in the financing of this unit by granting Global Bioenergies a €500 000 subsidy as part of the France Relance plan.Global Bioenergies’ Isonaturane® 12 stands out in the world of cosmetic ingredients for its particularly high selling price. The fact that it is the first cosmetic grade isododecane of natural origin gives it a very high added value. This molecule  traditionally derived from oil  is essential for longwear  water-resistant and low transfer make-up. When incorporated to achieve these characteristics  it is the main ingredient  representing between 25% and 50% of the formulation.Isonaturane® 12 thus opens the way to naturalness in the so-called “longwear” make-up segment  which represents a quarter of the global make-up market. The selling price of Isonaturane® 12 benefits from the specific characteristics of the make-up sector:Limited volumes compared to other cosmetic applications - a make-up product represents only a few grams of formulated ingredients. A single tonne of Isonaturane ® 12 can switch the equivalent of 500 000 units of lipstick or mascara to natural ingredients. This limits the Company’s exposure to feedstock and energy price fluctuations.Very small proportion (less than 1%) of the cost of ingredients in the selling price of a finished make-up product.Recognition of Global Bioenergies’ cosmetic productsThe LAST® brand was first honoured by the prestigious judges of Marie Claire magazine  which awarded it the Prix d’Excellence France prize in the “Research and Innovation” category early in the year. LAST® is the world’s first make-up brand to incorporate Isonaturane® 12 and as such to combine naturalness and long-lasting performance.Then  in November  Isonaturane® 12 was rewarded at the 2022 In-CosmeticsTM Asia event in Bangkok. An independent panel of international cosmetics industry experts met to award the best innovations in cosmetic ingredients. Isonaturane® 12 received the Silver Award at the event. As a reminder  In-CosmeticsTM Asia is the Asian version of the world’s largest cosmetic ingredients trade show  welcoming exhibitors and visitors from over 70 countries and bringing the latest developments in the field to the heart of Asia.Interest in Global Bioenergies’ solutions among oil companiesIn June  Global Bioenergies announced that it had received its first order for isobutene derivatives from major oil company Shell  for performance testing. Following the success of these tests  the two companies formalised the start of a collaboration to develop low-carbon  high-octane road fuels in November. In September  Spanish oil company Repsol placed an order with Global Bioenergies for a batch of ETBE  a compound widely used in petrol formulations  combining isobutene and ethanol to produce a high-octane molecule. The ETBE supplied by Global Bioenergies was produced by converting wood residue into isobutene  combined with renewable ethanol  resulting in the formulation of the first fully renewable ETBE.As a reminder  from its early stages  Global Bioenergies has been looking to increase the number of resources that can be used in its process. Successfully converting wood residue into isobutene is a major innovation  which was developed by the European consortium REWOFUEL  which began four years’ work in 2018 and wound it up in 2022. Global Bioenergies coordinated this European project  which received a total of €13.8 million in funding from the European Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. Project partners included Repsol  as well as Sekab  Fibenol  SkyNRG  Neste  Peab  IPSB  Technip FMC  Metex NoovistaGo and Energie Institut JKU.During the REWOFUEL project  batches of renewable aviation fuels were produced and transferred to SkyNRG  a leading player in the field. These batches advanced Global Bioenergies’ efforts to certify the process for the eventual production of aviation fuels  subject to the improvement of the process to bring the costs to a level compatible with commercial operation in this area. After several years of work  the Company hopes to soon be recognised as the developer of the eighth technology in the world to receive ASTM certification.Strengthened commitment in favor of sustainable developmentSeveral actions have been undertaken to support Global Bioenergies' CSR ambitions  whether in favor of the Environment  Social/Societal  Governance or relations with External Stakeholders. In particular  a carbon assesment covering scopes 1 and 2 of the Evry laboratory's activities has been carried out  even as the laboratory's energy consumption has been reduced by 20% between 2021 and 2022 due to various actions. This first action anticipates the deployment of a similar approach for existing and future production units. A CSR Project Manager position has been created and filled to formalize efforts in a sustainable development strategy. The Ethifinance agency has recognized these efforts by increasing by 16 points the Gaïa rating  the ESG performance benchmark for small and medium sized companies listed in Europe. With a rating of 56/100  Global Bioenergies now exceeds the national average of 53/100 encompassing 391 companies.About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors. After launching the first long-lasting and natural make-up brand LAST® in 2021  Global Bioenergies is now marketing Isonaturane® 12  its key ingredient  to major cosmetics companies to improve the naturalness of their formulas whilst improving their carbon footprint. In the long run  Global Bioenergies is also aiming at cutting CO 2 emissions in the aviation and road sector and thereby curb global warming.

Amendment of the Articles of AssociationThe Board of Directors to the Annual General Meeting proposes that an addition is made to the Articles of Association to allow the Board of Directors  at their discretion  to arrange a General Meeting as a virtual meeting without a meeting venue.

The Finnish Companies Act requires that shareholders can exercise their full rights in virtual meetings with equal rights to those in customary General Meetings. Pursuant to the proposal of the Board of Directors  section 8 § of the Articles of Association would read after the addition as follows (addition in italics):""8 § Annual General MeetingThe Annual General Meeting shall be held within six (6) months from the termination of the financial year  at a date specified by the Board of Directors.

He has argued the central bank is sacrificing economic growth to chase unrealistically low inflation targets.""I think the country has an economic  even fiscal structure that is not structurally compatible with the pricing we are observing today in our yield curve "" Ceron said in a Reuters interview. ""Nobody wants to force the market  but we don't have to simply passively accept it  especially in moments of stress.""Ceron said the Treasury's liquidity cushion  which ended 2022 at 1.176 trillion reais ($226 billion)  allows the government to stay out of the market when it detects speculative movements.Ceron said the cost of long-term debt versus shorter durations has widened by 1.5 percentage points since the approval last year of new spending by ex-President Jair Bolsonaro's government in the midst of his re-election campaign.""Our long-term interest is 1.5 points above what it usually was. Our short-term interest is also under pressure. It is at a high level from the point of view of the cost of debt "" he said. ""When this comes down  it is important  it eases the debt management process.""Ceron stressed Brazil's government aims to regain its investment-grade debt rating in 2026 and believes the approval of a proposed tax reform this year will boost it by one step on rating agencies' scale for sovereign debt.Brazil's Treasury has already signaled it is planning an foreign currency bond sale linked to environmental criteria.Ceron said the operation should take place in the second half of the year. The value is not likely to exceed $2 billion  and there is a chance of it being split between two tranches.He said the issuance will probably be used for general budget purposes  with a return linked to Brazil's performance on environmental metrics  as a way ""to continue giving visibility to the improvements that the country can achieve on this front"".The government is also looking at measures to boost foreign investment in Brazil's domestic public debt. Within 1-1/2 to 2 years  Ceron forecast government bonds in Brazilian reais will be traded on the Belgium-based Euroclear platform  for example. Today that trading is done only on a Treasury platform.A task force to be set up with the central bank will begin preparations to make that viable  aiming to attract both institutional investors and individuals  he said.($1 = 5.1990 reais) (Reporting by Marcela Ayres Editing by Brad Haynes and Lincoln Feast.)",neutral,0.01,0.57,0.43,mixed,0.23,0.19,0.58,True,English,"['current yield curve', 'Brazil', 'Treasury', 'debt', 'secretary', 'President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva', 'foreign currency bond sale', 'Treasury Secretary Rogerio Ceron', 'low inflation targets', 'ex-President Jair Bolsonaro', ""rating agencies' scale"", 'general budget purposes', '1-1/2 to 2 years', 'Belgium-based Euroclear platform', 'benchmark interest rate', 'debt management process', 'investment-grade debt rating', 'domestic public debt', 'foreign investment', 'domestic debt', 'long-term interest', 'short-term interest', 'Treasury platform', 'long-term debt', 'sovereign debt', 'potential investors', 'yield curve', 'central bank', 'economic growth', 'fiscal structure', 'liquidity cushion', 'speculative movements', 'shorter durations', '1.5 percentage points', 'new spending', 'election campaign', 'high level', 'tax reform', 'one step', 'environmental criteria', 'second half', 'two tranches', 'environmental metrics', 'task force', 'institutional investors', 'Marcela Ayres', 'Brad Haynes', 'Lincoln Feast', '1.176 trillion reais', 'Brazilian reais', 'Reuters interview', 'government bonds', '5.1990 reais', 'BRASILIA', 'pricing', 'Tuesday', 'economy', 'fundamentals', 'criticism', 'six-year', 'country', 'Nobody', 'market', 'moments', 'stress', 'cost', 'approval', 'midst', 'pressure', 'operation', 'place', 'value', 'chance', 'issuance', 'return', 'performance', 'way', 'visibility', 'improvements', 'front', 'measures', 'example', 'trading', 'preparations', 'individuals']",2023-02-14,2023-02-15,marketscreener.com

New election of Johan Thorell. Erik Langby has declined re-election.In accordance with the recommendation of the Audit Committee  the Nomination Committee proposes that Deloitte AB be elected as Auditor of the Company for the period until the end of the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2024. If Deloitte AB is elected as Auditor in Charge  the audit firm intends to appoint the authorised public accountant Hans Warén to sign the Auditor's Report.For the following reasons  the Audit Committee recommends the election of Deloitte AB. Atrium Ljungberg has on behalf of the Board of Directors and its Audit Committee conducted an audit procurement based on a tender procedure. The participants in the tender consisted of KPMG  PwC  Ernst & Young and Deloitte. Deloitte has relevant experience from listed real estate companies and fully meets Atrium Ljungberg's requirements in terms of competence  resources  quality  and tools. Deloitte AB has also made the most attractive offer compared to the other three audit firms that participated in the tender in terms of team  audit profile  working methods and level of fees. The Audit Committee has confirmed that the recommendation is free from third party influence and that it is not the result of any conditions restricting the choice of auditors.At the General Meeting 2020 it was resolved to adopt Guidelines for remuneration of the Senior Executives of the Company. In accordance with Chapter 8  section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act the Board of Directors shall prepare a report for each financial year detailing unpaid and outstanding compensation that is covered under the Guidelines. The remuneration report shall be presented at the General Meeting for approval. The Board of Directors proposes that the remuneration report for the financial year 2022 is approved by the General Meeting. The report is available on the Company's website www.al.se.The Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting authorises the Board of Directors  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting on one or more occasions  to decide on the issue of new Class B shares corresponding to a maximum of 10 per cent of the Company's share capital with or without disapplying the shareholders' preferential rights. An issue may be made against cash payment  by set-off or by contribution in kind. In the case of disapplying shareholders' preferential rights  the shares will be issued at market terms and conditions.The purpose of the authorisation  and the reason for any departure from shareholders' pre- emptive rights  is to enable timely and cost-efficient new share issues  with the aim of financing the acquisition of properties or businesses by the Company  or to carry out other investments.New share issues under this authorisation  departing from shareholders' pre-emptive rights  shall be based on a market-based subscription price that reflects market conditions at the time of issue.Both the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are authorised to make such minor adjustments to the decision as may prove necessary for the registration of the decision with the Companies Registration Office. Resolution to authorise the Board to take decisions on issues of new shares requires the support of shareholders who represent at least two thirds of the stated votes as well as the shares that are represented at the Meeting.The Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors until the next Annual General Meeting  on one or more occasions  to resolve on repurchasing so many Class B shares that the Company's holding at no time exceeds 10 percent of all shares in the Company. The shares shall be acquired on Nasdaq Stockholm and only at a price within the price range registered at any given time  i.e. the range between the highest bid price and the lowest offer price  or through a public offer to all shareholders  whereby the purchase shall be made at a price equivalent to the lowest quoted share price at the time and a maximum of 150 per cent of the current quoted share price. Payment for shares repurchased shall be in cash. The Board may resolve to repurchase its own shares within the context of a repurchase program in accordance with Article 5 of the EU Market Abuse Regulation  provided the purpose of the acquisition is merely to reduce the Company's share capital.Furthermore  the Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors until the next Annual General Meeting  on one or more occasions  to resolve on the transfer of own Class B shares. The number of Class B shares transferred may not exceed the total number of shares held by the Company at any time. Transfers may be conducted on or outside Nasdaq Stockholm  including a right to resolve upon deviations from the shareholders' preferential rights. The transfer of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm shall be conducted at a price within the registered price range at the time of the transfer. The transfer of shares outside Nasdaq Stockholm shall be made at a price in cash or value in property received that in all material respect corresponds to the share price at the time of the transfer of the Class B shares in the Company.The purpose of the above authorisations is to give the Board of Directors greater scope to act when working with the Company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value and that the Company in a time efficient manner shall be able to make payment with own Class B shares in connection with possible acquisitions of properties or businesses that the Company may undertake. The purpose of the authorisation is also to be able to use the proceeds from the divestment of own shares in Class B in connection with  for example  investments in the Company's own ongoing or future projects and any acquisitions of properties or companies that the Company may undertake.Both the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are authorised to make such minor adjustments to the decision as may prove necessary for the registration of the decision with the Companies Registration Office. A valid resolution requires the support of shareholders representing at least two-thirds of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the Meeting.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that § 7 of the Articles of Association shall read as follows: ""One or two auditors and a maximum of two deputy auditors shall be appointed at the Annual General Meeting to audit the management of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director and the Company's accounts and annual report.""The reason for the proposed change is that the Company's Audit Committee recommends that the Auditor be appointed annually.Both the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are authorised to make such minor adjustments to the decision as may prove necessary for the registration of the decision with the Companies Registration Office. A valid resolution requires the support of shareholders representing at least two-thirds of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the Meeting.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the Company extends and expands the loan subsidy programme for a maximum of seven Senior Executives of the Company. The programme involves a gross salary-based interest rate financing of loans for share purchases in the Company. The gross salary increase shall correspond to an amount  net of tax  equal to the interest expense incurred in connection with taking out a loan with a bank designated by the Company for the purpose of financing the purchase of Class B shares in the Company on Nasdaq Stockholm. The gross salary increase is conditional on continued employment and may be available for a maximum of five years. Furthermore  the gross salary increase shall cease if the shares acquired with the support of the financing are disposed of. If part of the investment is disposed of  the gross salary increase is reduced proportionally. The gross salary increase can at most correspond to interest compensation for a loan of SEK 2.5 million for Senior Executives of the Company. However  a maximum loan amount of SEK 6 million applies to the Managing Director. The Company's annual cost for the loan subsidy programme as described above is estimated to approximately SEK 3.3 million including social security contributions at full participation and with an assumed annual interest rate of five per cent.The purpose of the bonus programme is to stimulate shareholding in the Company by Senior Executives and thereby strengthen Management's long-term interest in a good share price performance. The Board of Directors believes that the introduction of a program as described above is beneficial to Atrium Ljungberg AB's shareholders.The Annual Report for the financial year 2022 and the Board of Directors' statement in respect of the above proposal regarding profit distribution and authorisation to purchase own shares will be available at the Company as from 1 March 2023 at the address Smedjegatan 2C in Nacka and on the Company's website www.al.se. The Annual Report will also be distributed to shareholders prior to the Annual General Meeting and can be ordered by telephone +46 8 615 89 00 or by e-mail: info@al.se.

The Remuneration report is available on the company's website  www.skf.com.Proposal under item 17The main contents of the Board of Directors' proposal are stated below. The complete proposal is available at the company and at the company's website  www.skf.com.At the Annual General Meeting in 2008 the SKF Group introduced a long-term performance share programme for senior managers and key employees. Since then  the Annual General Meeting has resolved each year upon a performance share programme.The Board proposes  in order to continue to link the long-term interests of the participants and the shareholders  strengthening the SKF Group's ability to attract and retain the best people and to contribute to the SKF Group's business strategy  its long-term interests and sustainability  that a decision be taken at the Annual General Meeting 2023 on SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023.The programme is proposed to cover not more than 225 senior managers and key employees in the SKF Group with an opportunity to be allotted  free of charge  SKF B shares in accordance with the following principal terms and guidelines. Under the programme  not more than in total 1 000 000 SKF B shares may be allotted.The allotment of shares shall be related to the level of achievement of the Total Value Added (TVA) target  as defined by the Board  and SKF's CDP Climate Change score target[1]. The TVA performance measure is weighted 80% and the CDP Climate Change score performance measure is weighted 20%.TVA performance measureTVA is a simplified  economic value-added model promoting greater operating profit  capital efficiency and profitable growth. TVA is the operating profit  less the pre-tax cost of capital.Over the three-year programme period (2023-2025)  the TVA performance target range is set annually by the Board against the baseline of the actual TVA achieved in the previous year. The overall performance achievement for the TVA performance measure of the programme is the average of achievements of the annual TVA targets. In order for allocation of shares to take place  the average TVA development must exceed a certain minimum level (the threshold level). In addition to the threshold level  a target level is set. Maximum allotment is awarded if the target level is reached or exceeded. By way of example  if the TVA achievement year 1 is 80%  year 2 is 100% and year 3 is 0%  the overall performance achievement of the programme would then be 60% (80%+100%+0% / 3).CDP Climate Change score performance measureCDP is a global non-profit organization known for its assessments and scoring methodology to evaluate companies' disclosure and performance relating to climate change and environmental impact. The CDP Climate Change score is based on an extensive questionnaire requiring disclosure and performance in the following categories: business strategy  financial planning & scenario analysis  emissions reduction initiatives  energy  governance  opportunity disclosure  risk disclosure  risk management processes  scope 1 & 2 emissions  scope 3 emissions  targets  and value chain engagement.This comprehensive assessment and the resulting score are known across the investor and customer communities as a credible third-party view on companies' approaches to climate change. The score ranges from A (leadership level) to D- (disclosure level). SKF received an A- in 2022 which is in the leadership band. This is higher than the Europe regional average of B  and higher than the metal product manufacturing sector average of C. The score is set annually and the bar is raised every year  reflecting increasing stakeholder expectations. SKF's performance achievement and CDP score will therefore require continuous improvements.The overall performance achievement for the CDP Climate Change score is the weighted average of the annual performance achievement  based on the following criteria:SKF's CDP Climate Change score Performance achievement A 100 % A- 75 % B 50 % 0 %For example  if SKF's CDP score is B year 1  A- year 2 and A year 3  the overall performance achievement for the full programme period is 75% (50%+75%+100% / 3).Provided that the performance measures of the programme are fully met  the participants of the programme may be allotted up to the following maximum number of shares per person within the various key groups:CEO and President – shares corresponding to a value of 75% of the fixed base salaryOther members of Group Management – shares corresponding to 55% of the fixed base salary or 13 000 shares  whichever is higherManagers of large business units and similar – 4 500 sharesOther senior managers – 3 000 sharesOther key persons – 1 250 sharesIf the total outcome of the programme exceeds the threshold level for allotment of shares but the final allotment is below 5% of the target level  payment will be made in cash instead of shares  whereupon the amount of the cash payment shall correspond to the value of the shares calculated on the basis of the closing price for SKF's B share the day before settlement.Allotment of shares requires that the employment of a person covered by the programme is not terminated before the end of the programme period. If all the conditions included in SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023 are met  allotment of shares shall be made free of charge following the expiry of the three-year calculation period  i.e. during 2026.Before the number of shares to be allotted is finally determined  the Board shall examine whether the allotment is reasonable considering SKF's financial results and position  the conditions on the stock market as well as other circumstances  and if not  as determined by the Board  reduce the number of shares to be awarded to the lower number of shares deemed appropriate by the Board.The Board is furthermore entitled to introduce an alternative incentive solution for employees in countries where participation in SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023 is not appropriate. Such alternative incentive solution shall  as far as practicable  be formulated employing the same conditions as SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023.The company has 455 351 068 shares in issue when this notice is issued. In order to comply with the obligations of SKF's Performance Share Programme 2023  a maximum number of 1 000 000 B shares are required  corresponding to approximately 0.2% of the total number of outstanding shares.Assuming maximum allocation under the Performance Share Programme 2023 and a share price of SEK 199  the cost  including social security cost  is estimated at approximately MSEK 239. On the basis of a share price of SEK 275  the cost  including social security cost  is estimated at approximately MSEK 330. In addition  the administrative costs are estimated at approximately MSEK 2.The Board does not propose for the time being to take any action to hedge SKF's obligations under the programme. Delivery of shares under the programme shall not take place until 2026._______________Number of shares and votes  and documentationWhen this notice is issued  the total number of shares in the company are 455 351 068  represented by 29 403 933 series A shares and 425 947 135 series B shares  with a total number of votes of 71 998 646.5.

Aspo Group’s net sales increased to EUR 652.6 million  up by roughly 11% from the previous year. The comparable operating profit for 2022 increased to a record EUR 55.3 million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 8.5%. Both the increase in net sales and our comparable operating profit exceeded the financial targets set for the Group.Aspo’s net sales in October–December stood at EUR 164.6 million  and the comparable operating profit was EUR 11.3 million. ESL Shipping especially supported the positive development of net sales and operating profit  with its record-breaking fourth quarter crowning its overall excellent year. The strong growth of Leipurin’s net sales during the fourth quarter was supported not only by high inflation rates  but also by the acquisition of the Swedish company Kobia AB at the beginning of September. Telko’s comparable operating profit in October–December was below the normal level which was due to the direct and reflected effects of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Eastern trade. Apart from the eastern markets  Telko’s net sales developed positively.The year 2022 turned out to be highly different from what we still assumed at the beginning of the year. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dramatically changed the lives of many of our employees  and our entire operating environment changed drastically.Already in spring  we decided to withdraw from all our operations in Russia and from other selected eastern markets. The prerequisites for responsible business had vanished  and it became clear that we would set our sights even more firmly on western markets in accordance with our strategy updated at the end of 2021. We will continue to operate in Ukraine  and we want to support its development and do our part to help rebuild the country.In summer  we divested Leipurin’s machinery business Vulganus  and at the end of October  the divestment of Kauko was finalized. At the same time  we focused on developing our key businesses through acquisitions according to our compounder strategy  of which the acquisition of Kobia by Leipurin and Telko’s recent acquisitions were the most significant. During the year  we also made strategic investments  the most important of which was ESL Shipping’s decision to invest in new Green Coaster vessels using a pooling arrangement.We are heading to 2023 from a good position  and we will continue the determined implementation of our strategy. I believe that we can generate strong cash flow even in this challenging market environment and  in accordance with our financial guidance  we expect Aspo’s comparable operating profit to be higher than EUR 35 million in 2023. We continue to boost organic growth through strategic acquisitions.Thanks for Aspo’s excellent results in 2022 go to our entire personnel. I am particularly pleased and grateful for the dedication our personnel showed in supporting our colleagues in areas ravaged by the war and in ensuring their safety.ASPO GROUPFinancial results and targetsAspo’s financial targets announced on December 1  2021:Annual increase in net sales: 5–10% a yearOperating profit: 8%Return on equity: more than 20%Gearing: less than 130%With regard to Aspo’s businesses  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%.In 2022  the Group’s targets were reached well overall. Aspo Group’s operating profit increased by 11%. The comparable operating profit rate was 8.5% (7.2%)  clearly exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Return on equity remained at the level of 15.2% (20.8%) due to the items affecting comparability of EUR -24.1 million that mainly consisted of additional costs and impairment losses arising from Russia’s invasion in Ukraine  and whose negative impact on return on equity was roughly 15.6 percentage points. Aspo’s gearing decreased to 108.4% (131.0%)  well below the target level.Aspo Group’s comparable result for continuing and discontinued operationsAspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit is calculated by adjusting the reported operating profit with rare and material items affecting the operating profit. These include impairment losses  sales gains from vessels  and financial losses caused by Russia’s invasion in Ukraine.In December 2021  Aspo announced that Kauko operating segment was defined not being part of Aspo’s core operations  and Kauko was classified as a discontinued operation. On October 31  2022  Kauko was divested outside the Group  and its accumulated earnings until that date and the divestment loss are presented in the profit from discontinued operations  separate from the results of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. However  Kauko’s results are included in Aspo Group’s total figures and comparable operating profit.Telko’s companies in Russia and Belarus  and Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan are classified as held for sale in the 2022 financial statements (eastern businesses held for sale below). The results of the eastern businesses held for sale are reported as part of Telko and Leipurin  as well as Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The assets and liabilities of the eastern businesses held for sale are presented on the balance sheet separately as assets and liabilities held for sale. When the eastern businesses were classified as held for sale  they were measured at fair value less cost to sell  resulting in the recognition of impairment losses totaling EUR 14.5 million in the fourth quarter  reported as items affecting comparability. On divestment  the recognition of the translation differences of the eastern businesses as part of sales losses as well as a possible change the fair value of the eastern businesses compared with the estimates made in the financial statements will also have a negative impact on the operating profit. On the closing date  the amount of the translation differences of the eastern businesses held for sale was EUR -11.8 million. The amount fluctuates according to changes in exchange rates until the date of sale. The reclassification of the translation differences from the translation difference reserve to the result for the period has no impact on Aspo Group’s total equity.Net sales and operating profit margin  Group total 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales  Group total 164.6 163.2 652.6 586.4 Net sales  continuing operations 163.8 160.0 643.4 573.3 Net sales  discontinued operations 0.8 3.2 9.2 13.1 Operating profit  Group total -4.8 8.8 31.2 33.9 Operating profit  Group total  % -2.9 5.4 4.8 5.8 Items affecting comparability*) -16.1 -5.1 -24.1 -8.5 Comparable operating profit  Group total 11.3 13.9 55.3 42.4 Comparable operating profit  Group total  % 6.9 8.5 8.5 7.2Operating profit and comparable operating profit  Group total 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping  operating profit 10 2 9 8 38 1 26 8 Telko  operating profit -7 7 4 4 7 3 20 4 Leipurin  operating profit -4 3 -3 6 -4 8 -2 4 Other operations  operating profit -1 9 -1 9 -6 7 -7 9 Operating profit from continuing operations -3 7 8 7 33 9 36 9 Operating profit from discontinued operations -1 1 0 1 -2 7 -3 0 Operating profit  Group total -4 8 8 8 31 2 33 9 Items affecting comparability*) -16 1 -5 1 -24 1 -8 5 Comparable operating profit  Group total 11 3 13 9 55 3 42 4*) Items affecting comparability  MEUR ESL Telko Leipurin Other Kauko Total Shipping operations Sale of Espa 1 5 1 5 Inventory in Ukraine -2 6 -0 7 -3 3 Accounts receivable in Ukraine -0 5 -0 1 -0 6 Impairment losses -9 3 -5 0 -1 3 -15 6 Withdrawal from Russia -0 8 -1 1 -0 6 -2 5 Divestment losses -0 4 -1 2 -1 6 Other -1 3 -0 7 -2 0 Total 0 7 -13 5 -8 1 -0 7 -2 5 -24 1In 2022  items affecting comparability totaled EUR -24.1 million  of which EUR -20.7 million resulted from the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo Group’s business operations. Items affecting comparability relating to the Kauko segment totaled EUR -2.5 million  and they are reported in the profit from discontinued operations. Other items affecting comparability totaled EUR -0.9 million.Of the items affecting comparability during the fourth quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -16.1 million  EUR -14.3 million were related to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and its consequences. Of the items  EUR -0.4 million were recognized for the ESL Shipping segment  EUR -9.0 for Telko  and EUR -5.0 million for Leipurin. Items affecting comparability relating to reorganizations were EUR -0.4 million in the Leipurin segment and EUR -0.1 million in other operations. In addition  Kauko’s sales loss of EUR -1.2 million is included in the items affecting comparability and reported as part of the results of discontinued operations.Items affecting the comparability in 2021  totaling EUR -8.5 million  included the impairment loss of EUR -4.3 million recognized on Leipurin’s goodwill during the final quarter  and the impairment loss and restoration provision of EUR -0.8 million recognized on the fixed assets of Telko’s terminal in Rauma  as well as the impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter  which is reported as part of the results of discontinued operations.SustainabilitySustainability is a material factor which guides Aspo’s management system and especially the company’s investments. Aspo’s businesses aim to be pioneers in sustainability in their respective sectors. To support the sustainability commitments  Aspo published new environmental  social and corporate governance (ESG) goals for the Group and its businesses in December 2021. The key goal is to reduce emission intensity  CO2e (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) is 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. According to the green transition in the shipping industry  ESL Shipping is engaged in close and long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide fossil-free sea transportation for its key customers in the future. ESL Shipping invests in twelve new generation electric hybrid vessels  half of which will remain in its own ownership and half will be transferred to the other party of the pooling arrangement. The investment is significant in terms of monetary value  but above all  it helps the shipping company move towards its emissions target.During the past 12 months  emission intensity improved further to 0.33 (0.42)  driven by the increase in net sales and operational efficiency.Another key goal was a higher level of safety  with the Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) being 8.1 (8.8) during the past 12 months. Even though TRIF improved from the previous year  we did not reach the target of 7.0 set for 2022.Aspo regularly assesses the satisfaction of employees with their own tasks  the quality of management  and Aspo as an employer by conducting an annual atmosphere survey. In 2021  Aspo started to use the People Power index  a new method of measuring job satisfaction  and it was also included in the Group’s sustainability goals. The operating environment remained fairly challenging in all businesses  and job satisfaction decreased slightly  while still being high: the Group achieved the rating of AA in 2022 (2021: AA+). However  the targeted level of AA+ was not achieved unlike in 2021.Aspo’s internal Compliance and Code of Conduct training includes anti-corruption issues and provides guidance for identifying any suspicious situations and practices considered unethical. Aspo’s goal is that all of the Group’s personnel complete the training every year. In 2022  approximately 100% (89%) of the Group’s employees completed Code of Conduct training and roughly 100% (88%) completed Compliance training.Operating environment and the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo’s operationsAspo’s operating environment changed dramatically during 2022 due to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. The invasion has caused considerable general uncertainties in markets  higher interest rates  lower trust among consumers  price inflation  higher energy prices in particular  as well as significant volatility in prices and exchange rates.Significantly suspended business operations in Ukraine due to the war have caused financial losses. The considerable damage to the energy distribution infrastructure in Ukraine made the situation even worse during the second half of 2022. The war drastically reduces operating conditions in eastern markets as a result of operational challenges and regulations  and selected values in particular. Aspo’s decision to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets  combined with the sanctions related to the war  has also reshaped Aspo’s logistics flows and operating models.ESL Shipping’s all operations have been suspended in Russia  and the released vessel capacity has been transferred to other operating areas. Telko has signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. At the end of 2022  Telko also signed a binding preliminary agreement on the sale of its subsidiary in Belarus to a member of its current management. A binding preliminary agreement was also signed with Timur Akhiyarov  a Russian-born private investor  after the end of the financial year on the sale of Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan.Leipurin’s net sales in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan stood at EUR 24.7 million in 2022  comprising 19% of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2022 and less than 4% of Aspo Group’s net sales. Telko’s net sales in Russia and Belarus stood at EUR 58.0 million in 2022  comprising 22% of Telko’s total net sales in 2022 and less than 9% of Aspo Group’s net sales. The consolidated net sales of Telko and Leipurin in these countries accounted for roughly 13% of Aspo Group’s net sales in 2022 (16% of net sales in 2021).The international sanctions and Russia’s legislative measures prevent the transportation of goods and the transfer of payments which has reduced the net sales and profitability of the operations in Russia. In addition  decreases in the companies’ operations and personnel have reduced Russia’s role in Aspo’s business operations. The operating environment is expected to become even more challenging  and no rapid solution is in sight.The equity of the group companies in Russia is EUR 20.5 (16.6) million  comprising 14.3% (12.8%) of Aspo Group’s total equity. In Aspo Group  EUR 12.2 million in impairment losses associated with the equity of Russian companies have been recognized in the financial statements. Aspo’s assets in Russia mainly consist of cash and cash equivalents  inventories and accounts receivable. The number of employees in Aspo Group’s companies in Russia is decreasing  being 105 (193) at the end of the year.Rising interest and inflation rates  as well as weaker general economic estimates  have affected consumers’ purchasing behavior  for example  so that consumers have shifted from more expensive to more affordable products.While the coronavirus pandemic has been overshadowed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the news  it still has an impact on Aspo’s operating environment. For example  the global shortage of components  caused by the pandemic  has an impact on certain Aspo’s businesses  decelerating sales and the completion of orders. The markets are also characterized by disruptions in logistics flows and the low availability of certain products. The risk of infections must still be taken into account in daily operations especially among ESL Shipping’s crew members.Net sales by market area  continuing operations 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Share 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Share MEUR MEUR % MEUR MEUR % Finland 58.6 45.4 35.8 224.4 175.2 34.9 Scandinavia 38.6 32.2 23.6 137.6 109.4 21.4 Baltic countries 18.2 16 11.1 67.8 54.8 10.5 Russia  other CIS countries and Ukraine 21.6 43.9 13.2 118.2 155.2 18.4 Other countries 26.8 22.5 16.3 95.4 78.7 14.8 Total 163.8 160 100 643.4 573.3 100During 2022  Aspo has reported its net sales by market area with the following division: Finland  Scandinavia  the Baltic region  and eastern markets (Russia  other CIS countries  and Ukraine). The eastern markets’ share of total net sales continued to decrease during the fourth quarter of 2022  mainly due to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and decisions to downsize operations in Russia and withdraw from the market as planned. As a result of the withdrawal from Russia  the division of Aspo’s main market areas will change at the beginning of 2023. According to the previously announced strategy  the company will direct its growth investments at western markets  and the eastern markets’ share of Aspo’s total net sales already decreased to 13.2% in the fourth quarter.Cash flow and financingThe Group’s net cash flow from operating activities in January–December was EUR 67.7 (44.0) million. The cash flow of all businesses showed positive development during the year. The impact of the change in working capital on cash flow during the review period was EUR -6.7 (-22.0) million. The increase in working capital mainly comes from the advance payments for the vessels to be built in the ESL Shipping segment’s vessel pool and the customer receivables accumulated through high sales at the end of the year. This was partly compensated by the Telko segment’s working capital  which improved towards the year end. The free cash flow in January–December was EUR 34.4 (27.5) million. The amount of investments of EUR -17.8 (-15.9) million mainly included the ESL Shipping segment’s dockages and Green Coaster advance payments. In addition  the cash flow from investing activities includes EUR -17.9 million cash outflow on the acquisitions of Kobia  Mentum and Johan Steenks and a total of EUR 2.8 million in cash inflow from the sale of Espa and Vulganus as the most significant items.12/2022 12/2021 MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities  incl. lease liabilities 189.2 187.3 Cash and cash equivalents 33.5 17.7 Net interest-bearing debt 155.7 169.6Net interest-bearing debt decreased to EUR 155.7 (169.6) million and gearing fell to 108.4% (131.0%). The Group’s equity ratio at the end of the review period was 34.7% (32.0%). The balance sheet strengthened as a result of improved profitability and the new hybrid instrument issued in June.Net financial expenses in January–December totaled EUR -6.3 (-3.9) million. Exchange rate changes  especially the strengthened value of the Russian ruble  increased financial expenses by EUR 1.6 million from the previous year. The average interest rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  was 3.3% (1.4%).The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents stood at EUR 33.5 (17.7) at the end of the review period  of which cash and cash equivalents related to businesses held for sale were EUR 11.8 million. Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program also remained wholly unused (5).During 2022  Aspo extended its maturity structure for interest-bearing loans. In September  AtoBatC AB signed an EUR 32.2 million loan agreement with Svenska Skeppshypotek. The loan’s maturity is 15 years  and it has not yet been withdrawn. The loan  together with the ten-year loan agreement of EUR 20 million singed in June with the Nordic Investment Bank  of which EUR 19.6 million have been withdrawn  finances ESL Shipping’s investment in a series of six new highly energy-efficient electric hybrid vessels. The project was launched in September 2021. In addition  Aspo restructured a bilateral bank loan of EUR 20 million  about to mature in 2023  with a new bilateral revolving credit facility which will mature in 2025. The loan agreement also includes two options for a one-year extension.In June  Aspo issued a new EUR 30 million hybrid instrument  with a coupon rate of 8.75% per annum. The hybrid instrument has no maturity  but the company may exercise an early redemption option in June 2025 at the earliest. Aspo’s earlier hybrid instrument of EUR 20 million was redeemed on May 2  2022.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operationsAspo and its subsidiaries are exposed to various risks and uncertainties  which are mainly identified and managed in Aspo's businesses. The most important risks and preparedness for them are summarized and reported to Aspo's Board of Directors through Aspo's Audit Committee.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine causes significant geopolitical uncertainties. It affects the general economic environment  including inflation  energy and raw material prices  interest rates  and consumers’ trust.The ongoing process to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets will change the Group’s structure significantly and will affect the revenue model of Aspo’s businesses in the long term. There are risks that the withdrawal from the selected markets causes additional costs or losses  and that funds cannot be transferred from the markets or that the withdrawal is unsuccessful in full or in part. It is also possible that the official approvals required for the withdrawal from the markets are not obtained for example due to changes is legislation or that they are at risk or fail for some other reason.Financial activities and the prevailing geopolitical uncertainties have caused the prices of many raw materials  components and logistics services to rise rapidly. While Aspo may benefit from the price increases temporarily  the prices of raw materials or rental capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Disruptions in logistics flows  longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes are also increasing risks. The rapid increase in inflation has generally caused pressure for salary increases  which in Finland can lead to labor disputes  which can also negatively affect Aspo's businesses.International sanctions and countersanctions have been imposed  which may also affect Aspo’s businesses directly or indirectly. The geopolitical tensions may escalate and cause a direct adverse impact on business operations  put payments at risk and even suspend business operations. If escalated  cyber incidents and disruptions in information systems may cause damage to business operations.In line with its renewed strategy  Aspo aims to increase its steady profit-making ability through acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial resources and consequently may reduce solvency. With its strategy  Aspo aims to reduce the impact of the possibly weakening general economic development on Aspo’s profit-making ability.The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Aspo’s operations has been limited at the group level  even though it has been significant in the Leipurin segment. The current and any new coronavirus variants and their rapid spread may suspend business operations and cause financial losses through stoppages in global logistics chains  among other factors.Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation and knowledge  they involve significant risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO’S BUSINESS OPERATIONSESL ShippingESL Shipping is the leading dry bulk sea transport company operating in the Baltic Sea area. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 41 vessels with a total capacity of 425 000 deadweight tonnage (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (80% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 16 vessels (18%) were time chartered. ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service.10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 63.3 54.7 16 245.4 191.4 28 Operating profit  MEUR 10.2 9.8 4 38.1 26.8 42 Operating profit  % 16.1 17.9 15.5 14.0 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -0.4 0.7 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 10.6 9.8 8 37.4 26.8 40 Comparable operating profit  % 16.7 17.9 15.2 14.0The fourth quarter of 2022 marked the best quarter in ESL Shipping’s history measured by the operating profit. Net sales increased by 16% from the previous year to EUR 63.3 (54.7) million. The comparable operating profit for the quarter increased by 8% to record-breaking EUR 10.6 (9.8) million. The operating profit of EUR 10.2 (9.8) million includes EUR -0.4 million in expenses associated with suspended operations in Russia.High demand in the shipping company’s main market areas  the shipping company’s long-term partnership strategy and the successful operations of the onshore and offshore personnel enabled the excellent results. Weather conditions were also favorable for operations. The comparable operating profit rate of 16.7% (17.9%) achieved during the fourth quarter was once again excellent. During the quarter  the prices of diesel and liquefied natural gas (LNG) used as ship fuels decreased from the previous quarter  while remaining roughly twice as high as in the comparative period. The high level of fuel surcharges increased net sales and reduced the operating profit rate  which is used as an indicator of relative profitability.During the fourth quarter  cargo volumes transported by ESL Shipping decreased slightly from the comparative period to 3.8 (3.9) million tons. The volume development was based on the transfer of raw material deliveries away from Russia which has extended transportation distances especially for energy coal. The final quarter is also normally the busiest season for energy transportation  but as a result of the exceptional situation involving the security of supply  the low availability of biofuels and longer transportation distances  the percentage of energy coal from all transportation operations tripled during the fourth quarter from the comparative period.The profitability of all the shipping company’s vessel categories was excellent during the fourth quarter. In fourth quarter  production plants of several contractual customers underwent relatively large maintenance stoppages and restricted production due to lower demand and high energy costs. High demand experienced in the energy industry enabled the vessels to continue to operate at full capacity during the fourth quarter. The spot cargo market decreased in all customer segments and vessel categories during the quarter. After operations in Russia were suspended  demand for ESL Shipping’s loading and unloading operations for vessels at sea shifted to the southern Baltic Sea where it was maintained by the high demand for energy coal transportation during the fourth quarter and congestion at ports suitable for large ocean liners.Six time-chartered vessels of the smaller vessel category were redelivered to their owners as the charter agreements ended at the end of the fourth quarter and as the price of an extended charter period became too high.The newbuilding project of ESL Shipping’s Swedish subsidiary AtoBatC Shipping AB    at the Chowgule & Company Private Limited shipyard in India proceeded as planned during the fourth quarter. Every other vessel in the series of 12 next-generation electric hybrid vessels will be sold  as announced earlier  to the company established by the pooling investor group. The first four new vessels are already under construction  and the first vessel is to be delivered during fall 2023.One larger vessel was docked for seven days during the fourth quarter and one smaller vessel was out of service for 26 days. In 2022  dockage days totaled 141 (229).The net sales of ESL Shipping in January–December increased from the comparative period by 28% to EUR 245.4 (191.4) million. The comparable operating profit was the highest in the company’s history at EUR 37.4 (26.8) million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 15.2% (14.0%). The operating profit rate clearly exceeded the long-term target of 14%. Comparability was affected by the gain from the sale of the barge Espa and costs associated with the suspended operations in Russia. Their impact on net results was EUR 0.7 million and  as a result  ESL Shipping’s operating profit amounted to EUR 38.1 (26.8) million and its operating profit rate was 15.5% (14.0%) for 2022 as a whole.The shipping company’s long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The aim is to halve carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. During 2022  ESL Shipping transported 14.7 (14.8) million tons of cargo  and its vessels consumed 819 988 (898 158) MWh of energy. CO2 emissions per transported ton decreased by 7.5% to 0.015 (0.016) tons of carbon dioxide per ton of cargo. The new energy-efficient operating models applied to port visits supported the positive development.ESL Shipping outlook for 2023General macroeconomic uncertainties have increased in ESL Shipping’s main market areas. Higher inflation and slower economic growth increase demand and pricing pressure among the shipping company’s main customers. Finland’s labor market may experience unrest during the spring  and its impact through overtime bans and strikes may be significant on key customers and especially on the effectiveness of the transport chain.Global demand estimates in sea transportation markets and price levels of spot markets have decreased considerably from the previous year. On the other hand  the availability of vessel capacity suitable for round-the-year operations in the Baltic Sea is limited. Production volumes of ESL Shipping’s main customers is expected to be satisfactory  albeit slightly lower than in the previous year. Demand for energy deliveries outside Finland is expected to remain high during the first half of the year. In the forest industry  pulp delivery volumes are looking positive  but only satisfactory for sawn goods. Volumes are looking satisfactory in the steel industry. Now that deliveries of Russian raw materials have stopped  certain of the shipping company’s significant contractual customers are forced to seek new suppliers for part of their production input required in new geographic areas. Not all of these procurement routes have yet become stabilized which may cause an imbalance in ESL Shipping’s operations. The role of energy coal transportation is expected to decrease significantly when the preparation situation returns to normal and demand shifts towards other energy forms.The majority of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements with the exception of the Supramax vessels. Currently  the expectations of the lessors of the time-chartered vessels do not meet the realities in the shipping company’s main market areas which may cause further uncertainties in the availability of a suitable and sufficient tonnage. The impact of rising energy prices on ESL Shipping’s costs is compensated effectively through fuel clauses in long-term transportation agreements.Surveys show that ESL Shipping’s customer satisfaction is at an excellent level  similarly to the personnel’s commitment and job satisfaction. Activities to further improve customer and employee satisfaction  sustainability and occupational safety will continue.The shipping company’s investments in energy-efficient vessels will strengthen its competitiveness and market position in the future. ESL Shipping will continue the development of a fossil-free sea transportation ecosystem in line with the green transition and the vessels designed for it in cooperation with its key customers. The shipping company is participating in projects aimed to produce green hydrogen through renewable electricity and to further process it as fossil-free fuel for the shipping company’s vessels.During 2023  four larger and two smaller vessels will be docked for a total of approximately 100 days.TelkoTelko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together. Its competitive edge is based on strong technical support  efficient logistics and local expert service. Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Russia  Belarus  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China.In October 2022  Telko signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. In December  Telko finalized the preliminary agreement to divest its subsidiary in Belarus  to a member of its current management. Both business transactions still need to be approved by the local authorities. Assets and liabilities related to these companies have been classified as assets and liabilities held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 standard at the end of the review period.10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 59.2 73.6 -20 267.4 268.8 -1 Operating profit  MEUR -7.7 4.4 -275 7.3 20.4 -64 Operating profit  % -13.0 6.0 2.7 7.6 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -9.0 -0.8 -13.5 -0.8 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.3 5.2 -75 20.8 21.2 -2 Comparable operating profit  % 2.2 7.1 7.8 7.9During the fourth quarter  Telko’s net sales decreased steeply to EUR 59.2 (73.6) million. Telko’s net sales for the fourth quarter decreased after sales in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine dropped substantially from the previous year. Telko’s net sales outside Russia  Belarus and Ukraine increased. Demand remained stable in Telko’s all business operations.The comparable operating profit for the fourth quarter stood at EUR 1.3 (5.2) million  and the operating profit rate was 2.2% (7.1%). Net sales and operating profit decreased from the previous year  especially due to weak development and negative results in Russia. Telko’s result for the fourth quarter includes items affecting comparability  which reduced Telko’s operating profit by EUR 9.0 million in total. Impairment losses regarding companies in Russia and Belarus of EUR 9.3 million and other expenses of EUR 0.2 million were recognized relating to the withdrawal from Russia. In addition  the credit loss provision recognized from accounts receivable in Ukraine was reversed by EUR 0.5 million. The combined comparable operating profit of the above countries was slightly negative during the fourth quarter.Telko’s operating profit for the fourth quarter was EUR -7.7 (4.4) million. The operating profit rate was -13.0% (6.0%). Impairment losses associated with inventories  exchange rate losses  and costs related to corporate restructuring also had a negative impact on the operating profit.The net sales of the plastics business decreased by 25% during the fourth quarter to EUR 29.6 (39.7) million  mainly due to the decrease in Telko’s operations in Russia. In Telko’s European markets  demand for plastic polymers remained at a normal level in general. Sales outside Russia  Belarus and Ukraine increased slightly  regardless of the downward trend in prices. While the steep decline in the prices of volume plastics turned to an increase during the fourth quarter  the prices are still lower than during the corresponding period in the previous year. The prices of technical plastics decreased slightly during the fourth quarter but were clearly above the comparative period’s level. The acquisition of the operations of Johan Steenks  a Norwegian distributor of technical plastic raw materials and plastics  increased the net sales of the plastics business during the fourth quarter  while it had no significant impact on results.During the fourth quarter  the net sales of the chemicals business decreased by 32% to EUR 15.9 (23.4) million. Sales decreased steeply in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. The weak development especially in Ukraine resulted from the disruptions in the electricity distribution infrastructure due to the war which directly limited production. Total sales in other countries increased significantly  regardless of the decrease in prices. Prices started to increase during the fourth quarter. Telko’s chemicals business is divided between several customer groups which evens out any fluctuations in demand.During the fourth quarter  the net sales of the lubricants business increased by 31% to EUR 13.7 (10.5) million. Sales increased in all key product groups. The increase in sales resulted from high price levels  the acquisition of Mentum AS at the end of 2021  and very positively developed sales of industrial lubricants. Prices of lubricants increased slightly during the fourth quarter. Russia’s invasion in Ukraine did not have any direct impact on the lubricants business.Telko’s net sales in January–December decreased by 1% to EUR 267.4 (268.8) million. The full-year comparable operating profit of EUR 20.8 million was only slightly lower than the previous year’s record-high comparable operating profit (21.2). The comparable operating profit rate remained high at 7.8% (7.9%). Exchange rate losses of EUR 2.5 million reduced the operating profit.Telko’s full-year operating profit fell by 64% to EUR 7.3 (20.4) million. The operating profit rate was 2.7% (7.6%). Results decreased due to the warehouse destroyed in Ukraine  the impairment losses associated with companies in Russia and Belarus  and other costs arising from the withdrawal from Russia  which totaled EUR -13.5 million and have been reported as items affecting comparability.Telko outlook for 2023As announced previously  Telko has agreed to divest its operations in Russia and Belarus. Telko’s net sales in Russia and Belarus were EUR 58.0 million in 2022  comprising 22% of Telko’s total net sales in 2022. Both sales transactions require approval by the local authorities. Telko expects the Russian transaction to be completed during the first quarter of 2023 but there is uncertainty involved.In 2023  Telko’s net sales and profit will be significantly lower than in the previous year due to the changed situation in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. In other countries  demand is expected to remain moderate  even though there will be differences between businesses.The prices of plastics and chemicals decreased steeply during the latter half of 2022  while still being clearly above the long-term average. It is assumed that the most significant price corrections took place during 2022  but the prices are expected to decrease slightly during the first half if energy prices do not experience a considerable increase. In high added value products  on which Telko focuses in accordance with its strategy  price changes are typically more moderate. Significant changes in prices have a short-term impact on margins. Demand for lubricants is expected to remain stable  and prices are expected to increase at least during the first half of 2023.In western markets  demand will involve uncertainties during the next few months. Demand indices have decreased in the construction and automotive industries in Europe. High energy prices and inflation rates will affect demand during the next few months  in particular. At the end of the year  demand will  above all  be affected by the general development of purchasing power in Europe. The lifting of coronavirus restrictions in China is expected to increase local demand. In addition  higher demand in China may have an impact on global price development during the first part of the year. In Central Asia  demand is expected to remain relatively high. Sales in Ukraine will be lower during the first half than in the previous year  while they are expected to be at the 2022 level during the rest of the year  depending completely on the development of the war.Telko will continue its activities to improve its operational efficiency and scalability. Inflation causes general increases in costs. On the other hand  cargo expenses  especially in Asia  will be materially lower than in the previous year.The recent structural arrangements continued when Telko announced on January 31  2023  that it will acquire Eltrex  a Polish company specialized in the distribution of chemicals. According to its strategy  Telko continues to accelerate its growth through acquisitions in addition to organic growth.LeipurinLeipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies  and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. Leipurin operates in nine countries that have been grouped into four business units  each being responsible for their financial performance: Finland  Sweden  Baltics  and East. Leipurin serves bakery  food industry and foodservice customers by providing raw materials and by supporting research and development and recipes for new products. The Leipurin segment’s other product categories include various supplies and machines for the same customer segments. The Leipurin segment uses leading international manufacturers as its raw material and machinery supply partners.On April 22  2022  Aspo announced that Leipurin will withdraw from its operations in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. In January 2023  Leipurin signed a binding preliminary agreement to sell its subsidiaries in these countries to a private investor. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities. Assets and liabilities related to these companies have been classified as assets and liabilities held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 standard at the end of the review period.10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 41.3 31.7 30 130.6 113.1 15 Operating profit  MEUR -4.3 -3.6 19 -4.8 -2.4 100 Operating profit  % -10.4 -11.4 -3.7 -2.1 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -5.4 -4.3 -8.1 -4.3 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.1 0.7 57 3.3 1.9 74 Comparable operating profit  % 2.7 2.2 2.5 1.7 Comparable operating profit excl.

Figures for the comparative year included EUR 2.7 million in net sales of the discontinued machinery business in Russia and divested Vulganus Oy. The Finland business unit’s net sales increased by 8% to EUR 12.2 (11.3) million. In the Baltics  net sales increased by 18% to EUR 10.0 (8.5) million. Net sales of the East business unit decreased by 32% to EUR 6.2 (9.1) million due to the reduced product range  consisting only of local procurement. The decrease in the net sales of the East business unit was also significantly affected by the decrease in operations in Ukraine down to roughly 9% from the comparative year’s level. Sweden was established as a new business unit as a result of the acquisition of Kobia AB on September 1  and it accounted for EUR 12.9 million and approximately 31% of Leipurin’s net sales in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter  sales to bakeries increased by 41% to EUR 28.6 (20.3) million. Sales to the food industry increased by 35% to EUR 4.2 (3.1) million.The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets continued to have a significant impact on Leipurin’s sales during the fourth quarter. Measured in kilograms  the decrease in sales intensified in Finland  Sweden and the Baltics  whereas sales continued to be roughly half of the previous year’s level in the East business unit. The weak volume development is mainly driven by the decrease in consumers’ trust in the current market situation  in which energy costs and interest rates are especially rising steeply. The significant increase in living expenses continued in Finland  Sweden and the Baltics which reduced the inflation-adjusted sales volume of retail and strengthened the shift in consumers’ demand towards more affordable products. The positive development of profit margins continued  regardless of the negative trends in volumes.The comparable operating profit for the fourth quarter stood at EUR 1.1 (0.7) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.7% (2.2%). Leipurin’s comparable operating profit  excluding Vulganus  was EUR 1.1 (0.7) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.7% (2.3%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR -5.4 (-4.3) million  included costs and impairment losses arising from the withdrawal from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan  and costs associated with the reorganization of Leipurin’s group operations. The comparability of the comparative period was affected by animpairment loss recognized on goodwill. Leipurin’s operating loss for the fourth quarter was EUR -4.3 (-3.6) million. Reversal of a fair value allocation of inventories amounting to EUR -0.5 million which arised from the acquisition of Kobia  had a negative impact on the operating profit.In January–December  Leipurin’s net sales increased by 15% to EUR 130.6 (113.1) million. Figures for the comparative year included EUR 11.4 million in net sales of the discontinued machinery business in Russia and divested Vulganus Oy  which were EUR 7.1 million higher than in 2022  but the increase in raw material sales in western markets was particularly strong during the review period compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets had a significant impact on the euro-denominated increase in sales.Leipurin’s comparable operating profit in January–December 2022 was EUR 3.3 (1.9) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.5% (1.7%). Leipurin’s comparable operating profit  excluding Vulganus  was EUR 4.1 (2.4) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 3.2% (2.2%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR -8.1 (-4.3) million  were mainly related to the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine  the acquisition of Kobia  and the divestment of Vulganus. The reported operating profit was negative at EUR -4.8 (-2.4) million. Kobia’s impact on Leipurin’s operating profit was still negative due to the reversal of the EUR 0.5 million fair value allocation of inventories related to the acquisition.Vulganus was divested on June 30  2022. The loss arising from the divestment and the expenses related to it  totaling EUR -0.4 million  are reported under the Leipurin segment’s other operating expenses.Leipurin acquired all shares in Kobia AB  a Swedish distributor in the bakery industry  from the Swedish Abdon Group. Kobia AB comprises Leipurin’s new Sweden business unit  and it has been included in Aspo Group’s figures since September 1  2022. Kobia’s annual net sales are approximately EUR 50 million  and its operating profit rate is roughly 3%. The acquisition strengthens Leipurin’s position as the leading company in the Baltic Sea region.Leipurin outlook for 2023The war in Ukraine and the decision to withdraw operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan will have a significant impact on Leipurin’s net sales and results. Leipurin’s net sales in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan were EUR 24.7 million in 2022  comprising 19% of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2022. The divestment of the operations in the eastern markets still needs to be approved by the local authorities. Leipurin expects the transaction to be completed during the first half of 2023 but there is uncertainty involved.The expansion to Sweden through the acquisition of Kobia AB will increase Leipurin’s annual net sales by roughly EUR 50 million and produce considerable synergy benefits in the development of the product range  and in the supply chain and procurement. It also enables partners to be served in a larger geographic area. The integration of operations has progressed according to plans.Inflation and the rising energy prices  in particular  have a negative impact on demand for more expensive products  potentially presenting profitability challenges among the bakery segment’s customers. The decreased purchasing power may have a negative impact on demand for artisanal bakeries  as consumers prefer more affordable products.The upward trend is expected to continue in the prices of main raw material categories  even though the rapid inflation during the review period is expected to decelerate considerably. This is expected to take place during the first half of 2023.Despite these challenges  Leipurin sees that the market will offer a highly stable environment in the long term and also opportunities for organic growth in selected market segments. In addition  the profitability program that was launched earlier develops the organization's ability to lead with information and helps to improve financial performance in particular. The program focuses both on selected growth clusters and on improving the efficiency of operations. This program is expected to contribute to improving Leipurin’s financial development.The impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic on the global supply chains  the availability of certain raw materials and general delivery times will continue.The management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges will increase risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers.Other operationsOther operations include Aspo Group’s administration  finance and ICT service center. The comparable operating profit of other operations was EUR -1.8 (-1.9) million during the fourth quarter. The reported operating profit of EUR -1.9 (-1.9) million includes EUR -0.1 million in restructuring expenses affecting comparability.The comparable operating profit for 2022 was EUR -6.0 (-7.9) million. The reported operating profit was EUR -6.7 (-7.9) million  including EUR -0.7 million in items affecting comparability that are mainly related to the additional share-based remuneration granted to Aspo’s previous CEO and restructuring expenses.COMPANY INFORMATIONAspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

Kauko Oy was sold to Signal Partners Oy on October 31  2022.Profit from discontinued operations 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales 0.8 3.2 9.2 13.1 Materials and services -0.6 -2.3 -6.9 -9.6 Employee benefit expenses -0.2 -0.4 -1.5 -1.7 Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 0.0 0.0 -1.3 -3.5 Depreciation  leased assets 0.0 0.0 0.0 -0.1 Other operating expenses -1.1 -0.4 -2.2 -1.2 Operating profit -1.1 0.1 -2.7 -3.0 Profit before taxes -1.1 0.1 -2.7 -3.0 Income taxes -0.1 0.0 Profit for the period -1.1 0.1 -2.8 -3.0Profit from discontinued operations includes the income and expenses of the Kauko operating segment  to the extent that they are considered to transfer outside Aspo Group in conjunction with the divestment. Therefore  the profit from discontinued operations does not include all internal administrative charges of Aspo Group allocated to the Kauko operating segment. As a result  the profit from discontinued operations for the financial year is EUR 0.3 (0.4) million higher than the Kauko operating segment’s profit. An impairment loss of EUR -1.3 million was recognized on Kauko’s goodwill in June 2022. The profit from discontinued operations also includes the EUR -1.2 million loss on sale of Kauko Oy recognized during the fourth quarter. An impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million was recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter of 2021.Net cash flows of discontinued operations 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR Net cash inflow from operating activities -0.6 0.4 Net cash inflowithoutflow(-) from investing activities -1.0 0.0 Net cash inflowithoutflow(-) from financing activities -1.6 -1.6 Net change in cash generated by the discontinued operations -3.2 -1.2Net cash flows of discontinued operations consist of the Kauko operating segment’s share of Aspo Group’s cash flows. The cash flow from the divestment of Kauko Oy in 2022 was EUR -1.0 million  and it is included in the cash flow from investing activities. The costs to sell of EUR -0.4 million are included in the cash flow from operating activities. The cash flow from financing mainly consists of repayments of interest-bearing loans.Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale 12/2022 12/2021 MEUR MEUR Assets of discontinued operations 5.5 Other assets held for sale 12.4 2.9 Assets classified as held for sale  total 12.4 8.4 Liabilities of discontinued operations 4.9 Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale 3.9 1.9 Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale  total 3.9 6.8On the balance sheet  the assets and liabilities of the companies held for sale are reported under “Assets held for sale” and liabilities under “Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale”. The reporting of balance sheet items on separate rows starts at the time of classification  therefore the figures of the comparative period have not been restated.In 2022  assets and liabilities classified as held for sale included the assets and liabilities of the companies held for sale in eastern markets. The classification includes the share of the assets and liabilities of Aspo Group that belong to the companies held for sale  excluding internal assets and liabilities that have been eliminated. In 2021  assets and liabilities of discontinued operations included the figures of the Kauko operating segment. The other assets held for sale at the end of 2021 consisted of Vulganus Oy’s assets and liabilities. The recognition of depreciation and amortization expense ended on December 1  2021  for Kauko and Vulganus when they were classified as held for sale. The depreciation and amortization expense was recognized as part of sales losses in conjunction with the divestment of the companies. Telko Russia was classified as held for sale on October 31  2022  and the other companies held for sale in eastern markets on December 31  2022. The recognition of depreciation and amortization expense ended at the time of the classification as held for sale.At the time of classification as held for sale  the net assets of the companies in eastern markets were measured at fair value less cost to sell  which was lower than the carrying amount. As a result  an impairment loss of EUR 9.4 million was recognized in the Telko segment and EUR 5.2 million in the Leipurin segment during the fourth quarter  which are reported as part of the Telko and Leipurin segments’ figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations.Impairment losses in income statement 2022 Telko Leipurin Total MEUR MEUR MEUR Impairment losses  tangible and intangible assets 0.6 1.1 1.7 Impairment losses  leased assets 0.8 0.1 0.9 Materials and services 4.8 2.4 7.2 Other operating expenses 3.1 1.4 4.5 Income taxes 0.0 0.2 0.3 Total 9.4 5.2 14.6The impairment losses recognized on the assets of the companies in eastern markets were mainly allocated to inventories  accounts receivable  and cash and cash equivalents. In addition  an impairment loss was recognized on goodwill  determined in based on the ratio between the fair values of the divested companies and the segment.Restricted cash and cash equivalentsIn Russia  Aspo Group has EUR 13.5 million in cash and cash equivalents  the use of which is strictly restricted by the Russian Government and controlled by banks. The value of these cash and cash equivalents in the Group is EUR 11.5 million  as an impairment loss of EUR 2.0 million was recognized on the cash and cash equivalents in conjunction with the IFRS 5 classification of the companies in Russia. Cash and cash equivalents in Russia are presented under assets held for sale on the balance sheet. It was still possible to pay dividends and make commercial payments during the fourth quarter of 2022. According to our understanding  the purchase prices of the operations held for sale in eastern markets can be transferred in conjunction with their sale. However  there is a risk that the Group does not have access to the cash and cash equivalents in full in Russia  which is why they must be considered restricted cash and cash equivalents in accordance with IAS 7.Events after the review periodOn January 17  2023  Leipurin signed a binding preliminary agreement to sell all shares in its subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan to Timur Akhiyarov. Russian-born Akhiyarov will invest in Leipurin’s operations in eastern markets as a private investor. The sales price is approximately EUR 8.4 million. Rights to Leipurin’s name and trademarks are not included in the transaction. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities.The Belarusian subsidiaries of Telko and Leipurin have been added to the list of companies whose transfer of shares are prohibited by a decision issued by the Council of Ministers of Belarus at the end of January 2023. Because of this  it is deemed unlikely that the sale of Telko's Belarusian business would proceed. This does not change Aspo Group's previously published assessment of the financial effects of the divestment. Leipurin’s Belarusian subsidiary is part of an agreement according to which the share capitals of Leipurin’s subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan would be sold to the same buyer. The decision of the Council of Ministers of Belarus does not change the previously published assessment of the financial effects of the transaction  nor does it prevent the sale of Leipurin’s Russian and Kazakh subsidiaries.On January 31  Telko acquired a Polish distribution company Eltrex. Eltrex is a distributor of specialty chemicals and industrial packaging materials  and its annual net sales are approximately 8 million euros and operating profit slightly under one million euros.On February 9  2023  Leipurin completed a sale and lease back agreement for its warehouse property in Gothenburg  Sweden. The property came into Leipurin’s ownership via the Kobia acquisition that took place on 1 September 2022. The buyer of the property is Revelop  a Swedish real estate investor. As a result of the sale and lease back transaction  Aspo recognizes a sales gain of approximately EUR 0.4 million. According to the terms of the agreement  Leipurin leases the property for five years. The transaction is close to cost neutral  as the depreciation expense of the assets owned will be replaced by depreciation and interest expense for the leased assets of similar size.Helsinki  February 15  2023Aspo PlcBoard of DirectorsPress and analyst conferenceA press  analyst and investor conference will be held at FLIK’s Eliel studio in Sanomatalo  Töölönlahdenkatu 2  00100 Helsinki on February 15  2023 at 2 p.m. The event is also open to private investors  and participants are requested to register beforehand by emailing johanna.ahtiainen@aspo.com.The financial statement release will be presented by CEO Rolf Jansson.

The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of Aspo Plc to be held on April 4  2023  that EUR 0.23 per share be distributed in dividends for the 2022 financial year. In addition  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to decide on another dividend distribution in the maximum amount of EUR 0.23 per share on a later date. Therefore  a maximum of EUR 0.46 (0.45) would be distributed in dividends for the 2022 financial year.More information about the proposed dividend distribution is available under section “Dividend proposal”.Key figures 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Net sales  Group total  MEUR 164.6 163.2 652.6 586.4 Net sales from continuing operations  MEUR 163.8 160.0 643.4 573.3 ESL Shipping  operating profit  MEUR 10.2 9.8 38.1 26.8 Telko  operating profit  MEUR -7.7 4.4 7.3 20.4 Leipurin  operating profit  MEUR -4.3 -3.6 -4.8 -2.4 Other operations  operating profit  MEUR -1.9 -1.9 -6.7 -7.9 Operating profit from continuing operations  MEUR -3.7 8.7 33.9 36.9 Operating profit from continuing operations  % -2.3 5.4 5.3 6.4 Operating profit from discontinued operations  MEUR -1.1 0.1 -2.7 -3.0 Operating profit  Group total  MEUR -4.8 8.8 31.2 33.9 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -16.1 -5.1 -24.1 -8.5 Comparable operating profit  Group total  MEUR 11.3 13.9 55.3 42.4 Comparable operating profit  Group total  % 6.9 8.5 8.5 7.2 Profit before taxes from continuing operations  MEUR -3.0 7.7 27.6 33.0 Profit for the period  MEUR -5.4 5.7 20.7 25.3 Profit from continuing operations  MEUR -4.3 5.6 23.5 28.3 Profit from discontinued operations  MEUR -1.1 0.1 -2.8 -3.0 Earnings per share (EPS)  EUR -0.21 0.17 0.61 0.76 EPS from continuing operations  EUR -0.17 0.17 0.70 0.86 EPS from discontinued operations  EUR -0.04 0.00 -0.09 -0.10 Net cash from operating activities  MEUR 22.0 10.7 67.7 44.0 Free cash flow  MEUR 16.5 4.1 34.4 27.5 Return on equity (ROE)  % 15.2 20.8 Equity ratio  % 34.7 32.0 Gearing  % 108.4 131.0 Equity per share  EUR 4.58 4.14Rolf Jansson  CEO of Aspo Group  comments on the fourth quarter and the whole year 2022:In the light of financial figures  2022 was a success and in many ways record-breaking. Aspo Group’s net sales increased to EUR 652.6 million  up by roughly 11% from the previous year. The comparable operating profit for 2022 increased to a record EUR 55.3 million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 8.5%. Both the increase in net sales and our comparable operating profit exceeded the financial targets set for the Group.Aspo’s net sales in October–December stood at EUR 164.6 million  and the comparable operating profit was EUR 11.3 million. ESL Shipping especially supported the positive development of net sales and operating profit  with its record-breaking fourth quarter crowning its overall excellent year. The strong growth of Leipurin’s net sales during the fourth quarter was supported not only by high inflation rates  but also by the acquisition of the Swedish company Kobia AB at the beginning of September. Telko’s comparable operating profit in October–December was below the normal level which was due to the direct and reflected effects of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Eastern trade. Apart from the eastern markets  Telko’s net sales developed positively.The year 2022 turned out to be highly different from what we still assumed at the beginning of the year. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dramatically changed the lives of many of our employees  and our entire operating environment changed drastically.Already in spring  we decided to withdraw from all our operations in Russia and from other selected eastern markets. The prerequisites for responsible business had vanished  and it became clear that we would set our sights even more firmly on western markets in accordance with our strategy updated at the end of 2021. We will continue to operate in Ukraine  and we want to support its development and do our part to help rebuild the country.In summer  we divested Leipurin’s machinery business Vulganus  and at the end of October  the divestment of Kauko was finalized. At the same time  we focused on developing our key businesses through acquisitions according to our compounder strategy  of which the acquisition of Kobia by Leipurin and Telko’s recent acquisitions were the most significant. During the year  we also made strategic investments  the most important of which was ESL Shipping’s decision to invest in new Green Coaster vessels using a pooling arrangement.We are heading to 2023 from a good position  and we will continue the determined implementation of our strategy. I believe that we can generate strong cash flow even in this challenging market environment and  in accordance with our financial guidance  we expect Aspo’s comparable operating profit to be EUR 30–40 million in 2023. We continue to boost organic growth through strategic acquisitions.Thanks for Aspo’s excellent results in 2022 go to our entire personnel. I am particularly pleased and grateful for the dedication our personnel showed in supporting our colleagues in areas ravaged by the war and in ensuring their safety.ASPO GROUPFinancial results and targetsAspo’s financial targets announced on December 1  2021:Annual increase in net sales: 5–10% a yearOperating profit: 8%Return on equity: more than 20%Gearing: less than 130%With regard to Aspo’s businesses  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%.In 2022  the Group’s targets were reached well overall. Aspo Group’s operating profit increased by 11%. The comparable operating profit rate was 8.5% (7.2%)  clearly exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Return on equity remained at the level of 15.2% (20.8%) due to the items affecting comparability of EUR -24.1 million that mainly consisted of additional costs and impairment losses arising from Russia’s invasion in Ukraine  and whose negative impact on return on equity was roughly 15.6 percentage points. Aspo’s gearing decreased to 108.4% (131.0%)  well below the target level.Aspo Group’s comparable result for continuing and discontinued operationsAspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit is calculated by adjusting the reported operating profit with rare and material items affecting the operating profit. These include impairment losses  sales gains from vessels  and financial losses caused by Russia’s invasion in Ukraine.In December 2021  Aspo announced that Kauko operating segment was defined not being part of Aspo’s core operations  and Kauko was classified as a discontinued operation. On October 31  2022  Kauko was divested outside the Group  and its accumulated earnings until that date and the divestment loss are presented in the profit from discontinued operations  separate from the results of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. However  Kauko’s results are included in Aspo Group’s total figures and comparable operating profit.Telko’s companies in Russia and Belarus  and Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan are classified as held for sale in the 2022 financial statements (eastern businesses held for sale below). The results of the eastern businesses held for sale are reported as part of Telko and Leipurin  as well as Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The assets and liabilities of the eastern businesses held for sale are presented on the balance sheet separately as assets and liabilities held for sale. When the eastern businesses were classified as held for sale  they were measured at fair value less cost to sell  resulting in the recognition of impairment losses totaling EUR 14.5 million in the fourth quarter  reported as items affecting comparability. On divestment  the recognition of the translation differences of the eastern businesses as part of sales losses as well as a possible change the fair value of the eastern businesses compared with the estimates made in the financial statements will also have a negative impact on the operating profit. On the closing date  the amount of the translation differences of the eastern businesses held for sale was EUR -11.8 million. The amount fluctuates according to changes in exchange rates until the date of sale. The reclassification of the translation differences from the translation difference reserve to the result for the period has no impact on Aspo Group’s total equity.Net sales and operating profit margin  Group total 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales  Group total 164.6 163.2 652.6 586.4 Net sales  continuing operations 163.8 160.0 643.4 573.3 Net sales  discontinued operations 0.8 3.2 9.2 13.1 Operating profit  Group total -4.8 8.8 31.2 33.9 Operating profit  Group total  % -2.9 5.4 4.8 5.8 Items affecting comparability*) -16.1 -5.1 -24.1 -8.5 Comparable operating profit  Group total 11.3 13.9 55.3 42.4 Comparable operating profit  Group total  % 6.9 8.5 8.5 7.2Operating profit and comparable operating profit  Group total 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping  operating profit 10 2 9 8 38 1 26 8 Telko  operating profit -7 7 4 4 7 3 20 4 Leipurin  operating profit -4 3 -3 6 -4 8 -2 4 Other operations  operating profit -1 9 -1 9 -6 7 -7 9 Operating profit from continuing operations -3 7 8 7 33 9 36 9 Operating profit from discontinued operations -1 1 0 1 -2 7 -3 0 Operating profit  Group total -4 8 8 8 31 2 33 9 Items affecting comparability*) -16 1 -5 1 -24 1 -8 5 Comparable operating profit  Group total 11 3 13 9 55 3 42 4*) Items affecting comparability  MEUR ESL Telko Leipurin Other Kauko Total Shipping operations Sale of Espa 1 5 1 5 Inventory in Ukraine -2 6 -0 7 -3 3 Accounts receivable in Ukraine -0 5 -0 1 -0 6 Impairment losses -9 3 -5 0 -1 3 -15 6 Withdrawal from Russia -0 8 -1 1 -0 6 -2 5 Divestment losses -0 4 -1 2 -1 6 Other -1 3 -0 7 -2 0 Total 0 7 -13 5 -8 1 -0 7 -2 5 -24 1In 2022  items affecting comparability totaled EUR -24.1 million  of which EUR -20.7 million resulted from the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo Group’s business operations. Items affecting comparability relating to the Kauko segment totaled EUR -2.5 million  and they are reported in the profit from discontinued operations. Other items affecting comparability totaled EUR -0.9 million.Of the items affecting comparability during the fourth quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -16.1 million  EUR -14.3 million were related to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and its consequences. Of the items  EUR -0.4 million were recognized for the ESL Shipping segment  EUR -9.0 for Telko  and EUR -5.0 million for Leipurin. Items affecting comparability relating to reorganizations were EUR -0.4 million in the Leipurin segment and EUR -0.1 million in other operations. In addition  Kauko’s sales loss of EUR -1.2 million is included in the items affecting comparability and reported as part of the results of discontinued operations.Items affecting the comparability in 2021  totaling EUR -8.5 million  included the impairment loss of EUR -4.3 million recognized on Leipurin’s goodwill during the final quarter  and the impairment loss and restoration provision of EUR -0.8 million recognized on the fixed assets of Telko’s terminal in Rauma  as well as the impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter  which is reported as part of the results of discontinued operations.SustainabilitySustainability is a material factor which guides Aspo’s management system and especially the company’s investments. Aspo’s businesses aim to be pioneers in sustainability in their respective sectors. To support the sustainability commitments  Aspo published new environmental  social and corporate governance (ESG) goals for the Group and its businesses in December 2021. The key goal is to reduce emission intensity  CO2e (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) is 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. According to the green transition in the shipping industry  ESL Shipping is engaged in close and long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide fossil-free sea transportation for its key customers in the future. ESL Shipping invests in twelve new generation electric hybrid vessels  half of which will remain in its own ownership and half will be transferred to the other party of the pooling arrangement. The investment is significant in terms of monetary value  but above all  it helps the shipping company move towards its emissions target.During the past 12 months  emission intensity improved further to 0.33 (0.42)  driven by the increase in net sales and operational efficiency.Another key goal was a higher level of safety  with the Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) being 8.1 (8.8) during the past 12 months. Even though TRIF improved from the previous year  we did not reach the target of 7.0 set for 2022.Aspo regularly assesses the satisfaction of employees with their own tasks  the quality of management  and Aspo as an employer by conducting an annual atmosphere survey. In 2021  Aspo started to use the People Power index  a new method of measuring job satisfaction  and it was also included in the Group’s sustainability goals. The operating environment remained fairly challenging in all businesses  and job satisfaction decreased slightly  while still being high: the Group achieved the rating of AA in 2022 (2021: AA+). However  the targeted level of AA+ was not achieved unlike in 2021.Aspo’s internal Compliance and Code of Conduct training includes anti-corruption issues and provides guidance for identifying any suspicious situations and practices considered unethical. Aspo’s goal is that all of the Group’s personnel complete the training every year. In 2022  approximately 100% (89%) of the Group’s employees completed Code of Conduct training and roughly 100% (88%) completed Compliance training.Operating environment and the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo’s operationsAspo’s operating environment changed dramatically during 2022 due to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. The invasion has caused considerable general uncertainties in markets  higher interest rates  lower trust among consumers  price inflation  higher energy prices in particular  as well as significant volatility in prices and exchange rates.Significantly suspended business operations in Ukraine due to the war have caused financial losses. The considerable damage to the energy distribution infrastructure in Ukraine made the situation even worse during the second half of 2022. The war drastically reduces operating conditions in eastern markets as a result of operational challenges and regulations  and selected values in particular. Aspo’s decision to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets  combined with the sanctions related to the war  has also reshaped Aspo’s logistics flows and operating models.ESL Shipping’s all operations have been suspended in Russia  and the released vessel capacity has been transferred to other operating areas. Telko has signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. At the end of 2022  Telko also signed a binding preliminary agreement on the sale of its subsidiary in Belarus to a member of its current management. A binding preliminary agreement was also signed with Timur Akhiyarov  a Russian-born private investor  after the end of the financial year on the sale of Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan.Leipurin’s net sales in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan stood at EUR 24.7 million in 2022  comprising 19% of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2022 and less than 4% of Aspo Group’s net sales. Telko’s net sales in Russia and Belarus stood at EUR 58.0 million in 2022  comprising 22% of Telko’s total net sales in 2022 and less than 9% of Aspo Group’s net sales. The consolidated net sales of Telko and Leipurin in these countries accounted for roughly 13% of Aspo Group’s net sales in 2022 (16% of net sales in 2021).The international sanctions and Russia’s legislative measures prevent the transportation of goods and the transfer of payments which has reduced the net sales and profitability of the operations in Russia. In addition  decreases in the companies’ operations and personnel have reduced Russia’s role in Aspo’s business operations. The operating environment is expected to become even more challenging  and no rapid solution is in sight.The equity of the group companies in Russia is EUR 20.5 (16.6) million  comprising 14.3% (12.8%) of Aspo Group’s total equity. In Aspo Group  EUR 12.2 million in impairment losses associated with the equity of Russian companies have been recognized in the financial statements. Aspo’s assets in Russia mainly consist of cash and cash equivalents  inventories and accounts receivable. The number of employees in Aspo Group’s companies in Russia is decreasing  being 105 (193) at the end of the year.Rising interest and inflation rates  as well as weaker general economic estimates  have affected consumers’ purchasing behavior  for example  so that consumers have shifted from more expensive to more affordable products.While the coronavirus pandemic has been overshadowed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the news  it still has an impact on Aspo’s operating environment. For example  the global shortage of components  caused by the pandemic  has an impact on certain Aspo’s businesses  decelerating sales and the completion of orders. The markets are also characterized by disruptions in logistics flows and the low availability of certain products. The risk of infections must still be taken into account in daily operations especially among ESL Shipping’s crew members.Net sales by market area  continuing operations 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Share 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Share MEUR MEUR % MEUR MEUR % Finland 58.6 45.4 35.8 224.4 175.2 34.9 Scandinavia 38.6 32.2 23.6 137.6 109.4 21.4 Baltic countries 18.2 16 11.1 67.8 54.8 10.5 Russia  other CIS countries and Ukraine 21.6 43.9 13.2 118.2 155.2 18.4 Other countries 26.8 22.5 16.3 95.4 78.7 14.8 Total 163.8 160 100 643.4 573.3 100During 2022  Aspo has reported its net sales by market area with the following division: Finland  Scandinavia  the Baltic region  and eastern markets (Russia  other CIS countries  and Ukraine). The eastern markets’ share of total net sales continued to decrease during the fourth quarter of 2022  mainly due to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and decisions to downsize operations in Russia and withdraw from the market as planned. As a result of the withdrawal from Russia  the division of Aspo’s main market areas will change at the beginning of 2023. According to the previously announced strategy  the company will direct its growth investments at western markets  and the eastern markets’ share of Aspo’s total net sales already decreased to 13.2% in the fourth quarter.Cash flow and financingThe Group’s net cash flow from operating activities in January–December was EUR 67.7 (44.0) million. The cash flow of all businesses showed positive development during the year. The impact of the change in working capital on cash flow during the review period was EUR -6.7 (-22.0) million. The increase in working capital mainly comes from the advance payments for the vessels to be built in the ESL Shipping segment’s vessel pool and the customer receivables accumulated through high sales at the end of the year. This was partly compensated by the Telko segment’s working capital  which improved towards the year end. The free cash flow in January–December was EUR 34.4 (27.5) million. The amount of investments of EUR -17.8 (-15.9) million mainly included the ESL Shipping segment’s dockages and Green Coaster advance payments. In addition  the cash flow from investing activities includes EUR -17.9 million cash outflow on the acquisitions of Kobia  Mentum and Johan Steenks and a total of EUR 2.8 million in cash inflow from the sale of Espa and Vulganus as the most significant items.12/2022 12/2021 MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities  incl. lease liabilities 189.2 187.3 Cash and cash equivalents 33.5 17.7 Net interest-bearing debt 155.7 169.6Net interest-bearing debt decreased to EUR 155.7 (169.6) million and gearing fell to 108.4% (131.0%). The Group’s equity ratio at the end of the review period was 34.7% (32.0%). The balance sheet strengthened as a result of improved profitability and the new hybrid instrument issued in June.Net financial expenses in January–December totaled EUR -6.3 (-3.9) million. Exchange rate changes  especially the strengthened value of the Russian ruble  increased financial expenses by EUR 1.6 million from the previous year. The average interest rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  was 3.3% (1.4%).The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents stood at EUR 33.5 (17.7) at the end of the review period  of which cash and cash equivalents related to businesses held for sale were EUR 11.8 million. Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program also remained wholly unused (5).During 2022  Aspo extended its maturity structure for interest-bearing loans. In September  AtoBatC AB signed an EUR 32.2 million loan agreement with Svenska Skeppshypotek. The loan’s maturity is 15 years  and it has not yet been withdrawn. The loan  together with the ten-year loan agreement of EUR 20 million singed in June with the Nordic Investment Bank  of which EUR 19.6 million have been withdrawn  finances ESL Shipping’s investment in a series of six new highly energy-efficient electric hybrid vessels. The project was launched in September 2021. In addition  Aspo restructured a bilateral bank loan of EUR 20 million  about to mature in 2023  with a new bilateral revolving credit facility which will mature in 2025. The loan agreement also includes two options for a one-year extension.In June  Aspo issued a new EUR 30 million hybrid instrument  with a coupon rate of 8.75% per annum. The hybrid instrument has no maturity  but the company may exercise an early redemption option in June 2025 at the earliest. Aspo’s earlier hybrid instrument of EUR 20 million was redeemed on May 2  2022.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operationsAspo and its subsidiaries are exposed to various risks and uncertainties  which are mainly identified and managed in Aspo's businesses. The most important risks and preparedness for them are summarized and reported to Aspo's Board of Directors through Aspo's Audit Committee.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine causes significant geopolitical uncertainties. It affects the general economic environment  including inflation  energy and raw material prices  interest rates  and consumers’ trust.The ongoing process to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets will change the Group’s structure significantly and will affect the revenue model of Aspo’s businesses in the long term. There are risks that the withdrawal from the selected markets causes additional costs or losses  and that funds cannot be transferred from the markets or that the withdrawal is unsuccessful in full or in part. It is also possible that the official approvals required for the withdrawal from the markets are not obtained for example due to changes is legislation or that they are at risk or fail for some other reason.Financial activities and the prevailing geopolitical uncertainties have caused the prices of many raw materials  components and logistics services to rise rapidly. While Aspo may benefit from the price increases temporarily  the prices of raw materials or rental capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Disruptions in logistics flows  longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes are also increasing risks. The rapid increase in inflation has generally caused pressure for salary increases  which in Finland can lead to labor disputes  which can also negatively affect Aspo's businesses.International sanctions and countersanctions have been imposed  which may also affect Aspo’s businesses directly or indirectly. The geopolitical tensions may escalate and cause a direct adverse impact on business operations  put payments at risk and even suspend business operations. If escalated  cyber incidents and disruptions in information systems may cause damage to business operations.In line with its renewed strategy  Aspo aims to increase its steady profit-making ability through acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial resources and consequently may reduce solvency. With its strategy  Aspo aims to reduce the impact of the possibly weakening general economic development on Aspo’s profit-making ability.The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Aspo’s operations has been limited at the group level  even though it has been significant in the Leipurin segment. The current and any new coronavirus variants and their rapid spread may suspend business operations and cause financial losses through stoppages in global logistics chains  among other factors.Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation and knowledge  they involve significant risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO’S BUSINESS OPERATIONSESL ShippingESL Shipping is the leading dry bulk sea transport company operating in the Baltic Sea area. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 41 vessels with a total capacity of 425 000 deadweight tonnage (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (80% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 16 vessels (18%) were time chartered. ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service.10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 63.3 54.7 16 245.4 191.4 28 Operating profit  MEUR 10.2 9.8 4 38.1 26.8 42 Operating profit  % 16.1 17.9 15.5 14.0 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -0.4 0.7 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 10.6 9.8 8 37.4 26.8 40 Comparable operating profit  % 16.7 17.9 15.2 14.0The fourth quarter of 2022 marked the best quarter in ESL Shipping’s history measured by the operating profit. Net sales increased by 16% from the previous year to EUR 63.3 (54.7) million. The comparable operating profit for the quarter increased by 8% to record-breaking EUR 10.6 (9.8) million. The operating profit of EUR 10.2 (9.8) million includes EUR -0.4 million in expenses associated with suspended operations in Russia.High demand in the shipping company’s main market areas  the shipping company’s long-term partnership strategy and the successful operations of the onshore and offshore personnel enabled the excellent results. Weather conditions were also favorable for operations. The comparable operating profit rate of 16.7% (17.9%) achieved during the fourth quarter was once again excellent. During the quarter  the prices of diesel and liquefied natural gas (LNG) used as ship fuels decreased from the previous quarter  while remaining roughly twice as high as in the comparative period. The high level of fuel surcharges increased net sales and reduced the operating profit rate  which is used as an indicator of relative profitability.During the fourth quarter  cargo volumes transported by ESL Shipping decreased slightly from the comparative period to 3.8 (3.9) million tons. The volume development was based on the transfer of raw material deliveries away from Russia which has extended transportation distances especially for energy coal. The final quarter is also normally the busiest season for energy transportation  but as a result of the exceptional situation involving the security of supply  the low availability of biofuels and longer transportation distances  the percentage of energy coal from all transportation operations tripled during the fourth quarter from the comparative period.The profitability of all the shipping company’s vessel categories was excellent during the fourth quarter. In fourth quarter  production plants of several contractual customers underwent relatively large maintenance stoppages and restricted production due to lower demand and high energy costs. High demand experienced in the energy industry enabled the vessels to continue to operate at full capacity during the fourth quarter. The spot cargo market decreased in all customer segments and vessel categories during the quarter. After operations in Russia were suspended  demand for ESL Shipping’s loading and unloading operations for vessels at sea shifted to the southern Baltic Sea where it was maintained by the high demand for energy coal transportation during the fourth quarter and congestion at ports suitable for large ocean liners.Six time-chartered vessels of the smaller vessel category were redelivered to their owners as the charter agreements ended at the end of the fourth quarter and as the price of an extended charter period became too high.The newbuilding project of ESL Shipping’s Swedish subsidiary AtoBatC Shipping AB    at the Chowgule & Company Private Limited shipyard in India proceeded as planned during the fourth quarter. Every other vessel in the series of 12 next-generation electric hybrid vessels will be sold  as announced earlier  to the company established by the pooling investor group. The first four new vessels are already under construction  and the first vessel is to be delivered during fall 2023.One larger vessel was docked for seven days during the fourth quarter and one smaller vessel was out of service for 26 days. In 2022  dockage days totaled 141 (229).The net sales of ESL Shipping in January–December increased from the comparative period by 28% to EUR 245.4 (191.4) million. The comparable operating profit was the highest in the company’s history at EUR 37.4 (26.8) million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 15.2% (14.0%). The operating profit rate clearly exceeded the long-term target of 14%. Comparability was affected by the gain from the sale of the barge Espa and costs associated with the suspended operations in Russia. Their impact on net results was EUR 0.7 million and  as a result  ESL Shipping’s operating profit amounted to EUR 38.1 (26.8) million and its operating profit rate was 15.5% (14.0%) for 2022 as a whole.The shipping company’s long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The aim is to halve carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. During 2022  ESL Shipping transported 14.7 (14.8) million tons of cargo  and its vessels consumed 819 988 (898 158) MWh of energy. CO2 emissions per transported ton decreased by 7.5% to 0.015 (0.016) tons of carbon dioxide per ton of cargo. The new energy-efficient operating models applied to port visits supported the positive development.ESL Shipping outlook for 2023General macroeconomic uncertainties have increased in ESL Shipping’s main market areas. Higher inflation and slower economic growth increase demand and pricing pressure among the shipping company’s main customers. Finland’s labor market may experience unrest during the spring  and its impact through overtime bans and strikes may be significant on key customers and especially on the effectiveness of the transport chain.Global demand estimates in sea transportation markets and price levels of spot markets have decreased considerably from the previous year. On the other hand  the availability of vessel capacity suitable for round-the-year operations in the Baltic Sea is limited. Production volumes of ESL Shipping’s main customers is expected to be satisfactory  albeit slightly lower than in the previous year. Demand for energy deliveries outside Finland is expected to remain high during the first half of the year. In the forest industry  pulp delivery volumes are looking positive  but only satisfactory for sawn goods. Volumes are looking satisfactory in the steel industry. Now that deliveries of Russian raw materials have stopped  certain of the shipping company’s significant contractual customers are forced to seek new suppliers for part of their production input required in new geographic areas. Not all of these procurement routes have yet become stabilized which may cause an imbalance in ESL Shipping’s operations. The role of energy coal transportation is expected to decrease significantly when the preparation situation returns to normal and demand shifts towards other energy forms.The majority of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements with the exception of the Supramax vessels. Currently  the expectations of the lessors of the time-chartered vessels do not meet the realities in the shipping company’s main market areas which may cause further uncertainties in the availability of a suitable and sufficient tonnage. The impact of rising energy prices on ESL Shipping’s costs is compensated effectively through fuel clauses in long-term transportation agreements.Surveys show that ESL Shipping’s customer satisfaction is at an excellent level  similarly to the personnel’s commitment and job satisfaction. Activities to further improve customer and employee satisfaction  sustainability and occupational safety will continue.The shipping company’s investments in energy-efficient vessels will strengthen its competitiveness and market position in the future. ESL Shipping will continue the development of a fossil-free sea transportation ecosystem in line with the green transition and the vessels designed for it in cooperation with its key customers. The shipping company is participating in projects aimed to produce green hydrogen through renewable electricity and to further process it as fossil-free fuel for the shipping company’s vessels.During 2023  four larger and two smaller vessels will be docked for a total of approximately 100 days.TelkoTelko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together. Its competitive edge is based on strong technical support  efficient logistics and local expert service. Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Russia  Belarus  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China.In October 2022  Telko signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. In December  Telko finalized the preliminary agreement to divest its subsidiary in Belarus  to a member of its current management. Both business transactions still need to be approved by the local authorities. Assets and liabilities related to these companies have been classified as assets and liabilities held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 standard at the end of the review period.10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 59.2 73.6 -20 267.4 268.8 -1 Operating profit  MEUR -7.7 4.4 -275 7.3 20.4 -64 Operating profit  % -13.0 6.0 2.7 7.6 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -9.0 -0.8 -13.5 -0.8 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.3 5.2 -75 20.8 21.2 -2 Comparable operating profit  % 2.2 7.1 7.8 7.9During the fourth quarter  Telko’s net sales decreased steeply to EUR 59.2 (73.6) million. Telko’s net sales for the fourth quarter decreased after sales in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine dropped substantially from the previous year. Telko’s net sales outside Russia  Belarus and Ukraine increased. Demand remained stable in Telko’s all business operations.The comparable operating profit for the fourth quarter stood at EUR 1.3 (5.2) million  and the operating profit rate was 2.2% (7.1%). Net sales and operating profit decreased from the previous year  especially due to weak development and negative results in Russia. Telko’s result for the fourth quarter includes items affecting comparability  which reduced Telko’s operating profit by EUR 9.0 million in total. Impairment losses regarding companies in Russia and Belarus of EUR 9.3 million and other expenses of EUR 0.2 million were recognized relating to the withdrawal from Russia. In addition  the credit loss provision recognized from accounts receivable in Ukraine was reversed by EUR 0.5 million. The combined comparable operating profit of the above countries was slightly negative during the fourth quarter.Telko’s operating profit for the fourth quarter was EUR -7.7 (4.4) million. The operating profit rate was -13.0% (6.0%). Impairment losses associated with inventories  exchange rate losses  and costs related to corporate restructuring also had a negative impact on the operating profit.The net sales of the plastics business decreased by 25% during the fourth quarter to EUR 29.6 (39.7) million  mainly due to the decrease in Telko’s operations in Russia. In Telko’s European markets  demand for plastic polymers remained at a normal level in general. Sales outside Russia  Belarus and Ukraine increased slightly  regardless of the downward trend in prices. While the steep decline in the prices of volume plastics turned to an increase during the fourth quarter  the prices are still lower than during the corresponding period in the previous year. The prices of technical plastics decreased slightly during the fourth quarter but were clearly above the comparative period’s level. The acquisition of the operations of Johan Steenks  a Norwegian distributor of technical plastic raw materials and plastics  increased the net sales of the plastics business during the fourth quarter  while it had no significant impact on results.During the fourth quarter  the net sales of the chemicals business decreased by 32% to EUR 15.9 (23.4) million. Sales decreased steeply in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. The weak development especially in Ukraine resulted from the disruptions in the electricity distribution infrastructure due to the war which directly limited production. Total sales in other countries increased significantly  regardless of the decrease in prices. Prices started to increase during the fourth quarter. Telko’s chemicals business is divided between several customer groups which evens out any fluctuations in demand.During the fourth quarter  the net sales of the lubricants business increased by 31% to EUR 13.7 (10.5) million. Sales increased in all key product groups. The increase in sales resulted from high price levels  the acquisition of Mentum AS at the end of 2021  and very positively developed sales of industrial lubricants. Prices of lubricants increased slightly during the fourth quarter. Russia’s invasion in Ukraine did not have any direct impact on the lubricants business.Telko’s net sales in January–December decreased by 1% to EUR 267.4 (268.8) million. The full-year comparable operating profit of EUR 20.8 million was only slightly lower than the previous year’s record-high comparable operating profit (21.2). The comparable operating profit rate remained high at 7.8% (7.9%). Exchange rate losses of EUR 2.5 million reduced the operating profit.Telko’s full-year operating profit fell by 64% to EUR 7.3 (20.4) million. The operating profit rate was 2.7% (7.6%). Results decreased due to the warehouse destroyed in Ukraine  the impairment losses associated with companies in Russia and Belarus  and other costs arising from the withdrawal from Russia  which totaled EUR -13.5 million and have been reported as items affecting comparability.Telko outlook for 2023As announced previously  Telko has agreed to divest its operations in Russia and Belarus. Telko’s net sales in Russia and Belarus were EUR 58.0 million in 2022  comprising 22% of Telko’s total net sales in 2022. Both sales transactions require approval by the local authorities. Telko expects the Russian transaction to be completed during the first quarter of 2023 but there is uncertainty involved.In 2023  Telko’s net sales and profit will be significantly lower than in the previous year due to the changed situation in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. In other countries  demand is expected to remain moderate  even though there will be differences between businesses.The prices of plastics and chemicals decreased steeply during the latter half of 2022  while still being clearly above the long-term average. It is assumed that the most significant price corrections took place during 2022  but the prices are expected to decrease slightly during the first half if energy prices do not experience a considerable increase. In high added value products  on which Telko focuses in accordance with its strategy  price changes are typically more moderate. Significant changes in prices have a short-term impact on margins. Demand for lubricants is expected to remain stable  and prices are expected to increase at least during the first half of 2023.In western markets  demand will involve uncertainties during the next few months. Demand indices have decreased in the construction and automotive industries in Europe. High energy prices and inflation rates will affect demand during the next few months  in particular. At the end of the year  demand will  above all  be affected by the general development of purchasing power in Europe. The lifting of coronavirus restrictions in China is expected to increase local demand. In addition  higher demand in China may have an impact on global price development during the first part of the year. In Central Asia  demand is expected to remain relatively high. Sales in Ukraine will be lower during the first half than in the previous year  while they are expected to be at the 2022 level during the rest of the year  depending completely on the development of the war.Telko will continue its activities to improve its operational efficiency and scalability. Inflation causes general increases in costs. On the other hand  cargo expenses  especially in Asia  will be materially lower than in the previous year.The recent structural arrangements continued when Telko announced on January 31  2023  that it will acquire Eltrex  a Polish company specialized in the distribution of chemicals. According to its strategy  Telko continues to accelerate its growth through acquisitions in addition to organic growth.LeipurinLeipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies  and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. Leipurin operates in nine countries that have been grouped into four business units  each being responsible for their financial performance: Finland  Sweden  Baltics  and East. Leipurin serves bakery  food industry and foodservice customers by providing raw materials and by supporting research and development and recipes for new products. The Leipurin segment’s other product categories include various supplies and machines for the same customer segments. The Leipurin segment uses leading international manufacturers as its raw material and machinery supply partners.On April 22  2022  Aspo announced that Leipurin will withdraw from its operations in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. In January 2023  Leipurin signed a binding preliminary agreement to sell its subsidiaries in these countries to a private investor. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities. Assets and liabilities related to these companies have been classified as assets and liabilities held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 standard at the end of the review period.10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 41.3 31.7 30 130.6 113.1 15 Operating profit  MEUR -4.3 -3.6 19 -4.8 -2.4 100 Operating profit  % -10.4 -11.4 -3.7 -2.1 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -5.4 -4.3 -8.1 -4.3 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.1 0.7 57 3.3 1.9 74 Comparable operating profit  % 2.7 2.2 2.5 1.7 Comparable operating profit excl.

Figures for the comparative year included EUR 2.7 million in net sales of the discontinued machinery business in Russia and divested Vulganus Oy. The Finland business unit’s net sales increased by 8% to EUR 12.2 (11.3) million. In the Baltics  net sales increased by 18% to EUR 10.0 (8.5) million. Net sales of the East business unit decreased by 32% to EUR 6.2 (9.1) million due to the reduced product range  consisting only of local procurement. The decrease in the net sales of the East business unit was also significantly affected by the decrease in operations in Ukraine down to roughly 9% from the comparative year’s level. Sweden was established as a new business unit as a result of the acquisition of Kobia AB on September 1  and it accounted for EUR 12.9 million and approximately 31% of Leipurin’s net sales in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter  sales to bakeries increased by 41% to EUR 28.6 (20.3) million. Sales to the food industry increased by 35% to EUR 4.2 (3.1) million.The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets continued to have a significant impact on Leipurin’s sales during the fourth quarter. Measured in kilograms  the decrease in sales intensified in Finland  Sweden and the Baltics  whereas sales continued to be roughly half of the previous year’s level in the East business unit. The weak volume development is mainly driven by the decrease in consumers’ trust in the current market situation  in which energy costs and interest rates are especially rising steeply. The significant increase in living expenses continued in Finland  Sweden and the Baltics which reduced the inflation-adjusted sales volume of retail and strengthened the shift in consumers’ demand towards more affordable products. The positive development of profit margins continued  regardless of the negative trends in volumes.The comparable operating profit for the fourth quarter stood at EUR 1.1 (0.7) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.7% (2.2%). Leipurin’s comparable operating profit  excluding Vulganus  was EUR 1.1 (0.7) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.7% (2.3%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR -5.4 (-4.3) million  included costs and impairment losses arising from the withdrawal from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan  and costs associated with the reorganization of Leipurin’s group operations. The comparability of the comparative period was affected by animpairment loss recognized on goodwill. Leipurin’s operating loss for the fourth quarter was EUR -4.3 (-3.6) million. Reversal of a fair value allocation of inventories amounting to EUR -0.5 million which arised from the acquisition of Kobia  had a negative impact on the operating profit.In January–December  Leipurin’s net sales increased by 15% to EUR 130.6 (113.1) million. Figures for the comparative year included EUR 11.4 million in net sales of the discontinued machinery business in Russia and divested Vulganus Oy  which were EUR 7.1 million higher than in 2022  but the increase in raw material sales in western markets was particularly strong during the review period compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets had a significant impact on the euro-denominated increase in sales.Leipurin’s comparable operating profit in January–December 2022 was EUR 3.3 (1.9) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.5% (1.7%). Leipurin’s comparable operating profit  excluding Vulganus  was EUR 4.1 (2.4) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 3.2% (2.2%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR -8.1 (-4.3) million  were mainly related to the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine  the acquisition of Kobia  and the divestment of Vulganus. The reported operating profit was negative at EUR -4.8 (-2.4) million. Kobia’s impact on Leipurin’s operating profit was still negative due to the reversal of the EUR 0.5 million fair value allocation of inventories related to the acquisition.Vulganus was divested on June 30  2022. The loss arising from the divestment and the expenses related to it  totaling EUR -0.4 million  are reported under the Leipurin segment’s other operating expenses.Leipurin acquired all shares in Kobia AB  a Swedish distributor in the bakery industry  from the Swedish Abdon Group. Kobia AB comprises Leipurin’s new Sweden business unit  and it has been included in Aspo Group’s figures since September 1  2022. Kobia’s annual net sales are approximately EUR 50 million  and its operating profit rate is roughly 3%. The acquisition strengthens Leipurin’s position as the leading company in the Baltic Sea region.Leipurin outlook for 2023The war in Ukraine and the decision to withdraw operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan will have a significant impact on Leipurin’s net sales and results. Leipurin’s net sales in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan were EUR 24.7 million in 2022  comprising 19% of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2022. The divestment of the operations in the eastern markets still needs to be approved by the local authorities. Leipurin expects the transaction to be completed during the first half of 2023 but there is uncertainty involved.The expansion to Sweden through the acquisition of Kobia AB will increase Leipurin’s annual net sales by roughly EUR 50 million and produce considerable synergy benefits in the development of the product range  and in the supply chain and procurement. It also enables partners to be served in a larger geographic area. The integration of operations has progressed according to plans.Inflation and the rising energy prices  in particular  have a negative impact on demand for more expensive products  potentially presenting profitability challenges among the bakery segment’s customers. The decreased purchasing power may have a negative impact on demand for artisanal bakeries  as consumers prefer more affordable products.The upward trend is expected to continue in the prices of main raw material categories  even though the rapid inflation during the review period is expected to decelerate considerably. This is expected to take place during the first half of 2023.Despite these challenges  Leipurin sees that the market will offer a highly stable environment in the long term and also opportunities for organic growth in selected market segments. In addition  the profitability program that was launched earlier develops the organization's ability to lead with information and helps to improve financial performance in particular. The program focuses both on selected growth clusters and on improving the efficiency of operations. This program is expected to contribute to improving Leipurin’s financial development.The impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic on the global supply chains  the availability of certain raw materials and general delivery times will continue.The management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges will increase risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers.Other operationsOther operations include Aspo Group’s administration  finance and ICT service center. The comparable operating profit of other operations was EUR -1.8 (-1.9) million during the fourth quarter. The reported operating profit of EUR -1.9 (-1.9) million includes EUR -0.1 million in restructuring expenses affecting comparability.The comparable operating profit for 2022 was EUR -6.0 (-7.9) million. The reported operating profit was EUR -6.7 (-7.9) million  including EUR -0.7 million in items affecting comparability that are mainly related to the additional share-based remuneration granted to Aspo’s previous CEO and restructuring expenses.COMPANY INFORMATIONAspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

The acquisition expands Leipurin’s geographical presence in the Northern European market. In 2021  Kobia’s net sales amounted to approximately EUR 50 million and its operating profit rate was approximately 3%. The acquisition of Kobia AB included also the properties owned by Kobia. Aspo actively explores options to sell and lease back the properties. The potential transactions are significantly affected by market conditions.The purchase price of EUR 15.7 million was paid fully in cash. The assets and liabilities of the acquired company were measured at fair value on the acquisition date. A fair value allocation of EUR 9.7 million was made on the properties  a fair value allocation of EUR 0.4 million was made on the intangible assets based on customer relationships  and the fair value adjustment relating to inventories was EUR 0.5 million. The deferred tax liability arising from the fair value adjustments was EUR 2.2 million. The carrying amount of the other acquired assets and liabilities were deemed to correspond to their fair values. A goodwill balance of EUR 0.1 million resulted from the acquisition. The acquisition-related costs of approximately one million euro were recognized in the Leipurin segment’s other operating expenses.Acquisition calculation of Kobia AB 12/2022 MEUR Consideration Paid in cash 15.7 Total consideration 15.7 Assets acquired and liabilities assumed. fair value Intangible assets 0.8 Tangible assets 13.6 Leased assets 0.3 Inventories 4.8 Accounts receivable and other receivables 5.0 Total assets 24.5 Interest bearing liabilities 1.3 Accounts payable and other liabilities 5.3 Deferred tax liability 2.3 Total liabilities 8.9 Net assets acquired 15.6 Goodwill 0.1Acquisition of Johan SteenksTelko completed the acquisition of the operations of the Norwegian company Johan Steenks AS on October 3  2022. Johan Steenks is a distributor of technical plastic raw materials and additives for plastics  and it has an established customer base in the Norwegian markets and a number of well-known principals. The company’s annual net sales are roughly EUR 5 million. The business acquisition had no significant impact on Telko’s net sales or results during the final quarter of the year. The purchase price was approximately EUR 2.0 million  of which EUR 0.7 million were allocated to inventories and the remaining EUR 1.3 million were recognized as an increase in goodwill. The cash flow from the acquisition in 2022 was EUR -1.9 million.Discontinued operations and other non-current assets and disposal groups held for saleIn October 17  Telko signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. The sales price is approximately EUR 9.5 million. The transaction still needs to be approved by the Russian authorities. Telko’s company in Russia has been classified as held for sale since October 2022 when the preliminary agreement on the sale was signed. Telko’s company in Belarus has been classified as held for sale since December 2022 when the agreement on the sale was signed with the company’s acting management.Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan have been classified as held for sale since December 31  2022 when their divestment started to seem probable. A binding preliminary agreement on their sale was signed on January 17  2023 with Timur Akhiyarov  a Russian-born private investor. The sales price is approximately EUR 8.4 million. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities.The Kauko operating segment and Vulganus Oy  part of the Leipurin segment  were defined as non-core businesses for Aspo and classified as held for sale in December 2021. Vulganus was sold to KÖNIG Maschinen GmbH  the leading manufacturer of bakery machines in Austria  on June 30  2022. The results of Vulganus  including the divestment loss of EUR -0.4 million   are reported as part of the Leipurin segment’s figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations.The Kauko operating segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in accordance with the IFRS 5 standard  and its figures are reported separately from the figures of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. In the statement of comprehensive income  the figures of the comparative periods have been restated. Kauko Oy was sold to Signal Partners Oy on October 31  2022.Profit from discontinued operations 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales 0.8 3.2 9.2 13.1 Materials and services -0.6 -2.3 -6.9 -9.6 Employee benefit expenses -0.2 -0.4 -1.5 -1.7 Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 0.0 0.0 -1.3 -3.5 Depreciation  leased assets 0.0 0.0 0.0 -0.1 Other operating expenses -1.1 -0.4 -2.2 -1.2 Operating profit -1.1 0.1 -2.7 -3.0 Profit before taxes -1.1 0.1 -2.7 -3.0 Income taxes -0.1 0.0 Profit for the period -1.1 0.1 -2.8 -3.0Profit from discontinued operations includes the income and expenses of the Kauko operating segment  to the extent that they are considered to transfer outside Aspo Group in conjunction with the divestment. Therefore  the profit from discontinued operations does not include all internal administrative charges of Aspo Group allocated to the Kauko operating segment. As a result  the profit from discontinued operations for the financial year is EUR 0.3 (0.4) million higher than the Kauko operating segment’s profit. An impairment loss of EUR -1.3 million was recognized on Kauko’s goodwill in June 2022. The profit from discontinued operations also includes the EUR -1.2 million loss on sale of Kauko Oy recognized during the fourth quarter. An impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million was recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter of 2021.Net cash flows of discontinued operations 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR Net cash inflow from operating activities -0.6 0.4 Net cash inflowithoutflow(-) from investing activities -1.0 0.0 Net cash inflowithoutflow(-) from financing activities -1.6 -1.6 Net change in cash generated by the discontinued operations -3.2 -1.2Net cash flows of discontinued operations consist of the Kauko operating segment’s share of Aspo Group’s cash flows. The cash flow from the divestment of Kauko Oy in 2022 was EUR -1.0 million  and it is included in the cash flow from investing activities. The costs to sell of EUR -0.4 million are included in the cash flow from operating activities. The cash flow from financing mainly consists of repayments of interest-bearing loans.Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale 12/2022 12/2021 MEUR MEUR Assets of discontinued operations 5.5 Other assets held for sale 12.4 2.9 Assets classified as held for sale  total 12.4 8.4 Liabilities of discontinued operations 4.9 Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale 3.9 1.9 Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale  total 3.9 6.8On the balance sheet  the assets and liabilities of the companies held for sale are reported under “Assets held for sale” and liabilities under “Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale”. The reporting of balance sheet items on separate rows starts at the time of classification  therefore the figures of the comparative period have not been restated.In 2022  assets and liabilities classified as held for sale included the assets and liabilities of the companies held for sale in eastern markets. The classification includes the share of the assets and liabilities of Aspo Group that belong to the companies held for sale  excluding internal assets and liabilities that have been eliminated. In 2021  assets and liabilities of discontinued operations included the figures of the Kauko operating segment. The other assets held for sale at the end of 2021 consisted of Vulganus Oy’s assets and liabilities. The recognition of depreciation and amortization expense ended on December 1  2021  for Kauko and Vulganus when they were classified as held for sale. The depreciation and amortization expense was recognized as part of sales losses in conjunction with the divestment of the companies. Telko Russia was classified as held for sale on October 31  2022  and the other companies held for sale in eastern markets on December 31  2022. The recognition of depreciation and amortization expense ended at the time of the classification as held for sale.At the time of classification as held for sale  the net assets of the companies in eastern markets were measured at fair value less cost to sell  which was lower than the carrying amount. As a result  an impairment loss of EUR 9.4 million was recognized in the Telko segment and EUR 5.2 million in the Leipurin segment during the fourth quarter  which are reported as part of the Telko and Leipurin segments’ figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations.Impairment losses in income statement 2022 Telko Leipurin Total MEUR MEUR MEUR Impairment losses  tangible and intangible assets 0.6 1.1 1.7 Impairment losses  leased assets 0.8 0.1 0.9 Materials and services 4.8 2.4 7.2 Other operating expenses 3.1 1.4 4.5 Income taxes 0.0 0.2 0.3 Total 9.4 5.2 14.6The impairment losses recognized on the assets of the companies in eastern markets were mainly allocated to inventories  accounts receivable  and cash and cash equivalents. In addition  an impairment loss was recognized on goodwill  determined in based on the ratio between the fair values of the divested companies and the segment.Restricted cash and cash equivalentsIn Russia  Aspo Group has EUR 13.5 million in cash and cash equivalents  the use of which is strictly restricted by the Russian Government and controlled by banks. The value of these cash and cash equivalents in the Group is EUR 11.5 million  as an impairment loss of EUR 2.0 million was recognized on the cash and cash equivalents in conjunction with the IFRS 5 classification of the companies in Russia. Cash and cash equivalents in Russia are presented under assets held for sale on the balance sheet. It was still possible to pay dividends and make commercial payments during the fourth quarter of 2022. According to our understanding  the purchase prices of the operations held for sale in eastern markets can be transferred in conjunction with their sale. However  there is a risk that the Group does not have access to the cash and cash equivalents in full in Russia  which is why they must be considered restricted cash and cash equivalents in accordance with IAS 7.Events after the review periodOn January 17  2023  Leipurin signed a binding preliminary agreement to sell all shares in its subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan to Timur Akhiyarov. Russian-born Akhiyarov will invest in Leipurin’s operations in eastern markets as a private investor. The sales price is approximately EUR 8.4 million. Rights to Leipurin’s name and trademarks are not included in the transaction. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities.The Belarusian subsidiaries of Telko and Leipurin have been added to the list of companies whose transfer of shares are prohibited by a decision issued by the Council of Ministers of Belarus at the end of January 2023. Because of this  it is deemed unlikely that the sale of Telko's Belarusian business would proceed. This does not change Aspo Group's previously published assessment of the financial effects of the divestment. Leipurin’s Belarusian subsidiary is part of an agreement according to which the share capitals of Leipurin’s subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan would be sold to the same buyer. The decision of the Council of Ministers of Belarus does not change the previously published assessment of the financial effects of the transaction  nor does it prevent the sale of Leipurin’s Russian and Kazakh subsidiaries.On January 31  Telko acquired a Polish distribution company Eltrex. Eltrex is a distributor of specialty chemicals and industrial packaging materials  and its annual net sales are approximately 8 million euros and operating profit slightly under one million euros.On February 9  2023  Leipurin completed a sale and lease back agreement for its warehouse property in Gothenburg  Sweden. The property came into Leipurin’s ownership via the Kobia acquisition that took place on 1 September 2022. The buyer of the property is Revelop  a Swedish real estate investor. As a result of the sale and lease back transaction  Aspo recognizes a sales gain of approximately EUR 0.4 million. According to the terms of the agreement  Leipurin leases the property for five years. The transaction is close to cost neutral  as the depreciation expense of the assets owned will be replaced by depreciation and interest expense for the leased assets of similar size.Helsinki  February 15  2023Aspo PlcBoard of DirectorsPress and analyst conferenceA press  analyst and investor conference will be held at FLIK’s Eliel studio in Sanomatalo  Töölönlahdenkatu 2  00100 Helsinki on February 15  2023 at 2 p.m. The event is also open to private investors  and participants are requested to register beforehand by emailing johanna.ahtiainen@aspo.com.The financial statement release will be presented by CEO Rolf Jansson.

Amendment of the Articles of AssociationThe Board of Directors to the Annual General Meeting proposes that an addition is made to the Articles of Association to allow the Board of Directors  at their discretion  to arrange a General Meeting as a virtual meeting without a meeting venue. Among other things  the addition would allow General Meetings to be arranged in a way that can facilitate shareholder participation  for example  in the event of a pandemic or other unforeseen and exceptional circumstances. The Finnish Companies Act requires that shareholders can exercise their full rights in virtual meetings with equal rights to those in customary General Meetings. Pursuant to the proposal of the Board of Directors  section 8 § of the Articles of Association would read after the addition as follows (addition in italics):""8 § Annual General MeetingThe Annual General Meeting shall be held within six (6) months from the termination of the financial year  at a date specified by the Board of Directors. The Annual General Meeting shall be held in Helsinki  Espoo or Vantaa.The notice convening the General Meeting shall be delivered to the shareholders no earlier than three (3) months and no later than three (3) weeks prior to the Meeting  but no later than nine (9) days before the record date of the General Meeting. The notice shall be delivered to the shareholders by means of a notice published on the company's website or at least in one national daily newspaper designated by the Board of Directors.To be entitled to attend the General Meeting  a shareholder shall notify the company of its attendance by the date specified in the notice convening the Meeting  which date may not be earlier than ten (10) days prior to the Meeting.The Board of Directors may decide that an annual or an extraordinary general meeting is arranged without a meeting venue in a manner whereby shareholders exercise their full decision-making powers in real time during the general meeting using telecommunications and technical means (virtual meeting).""19.

Aspo Group’s net sales increased to EUR 652.6 million  up by roughly 11% from the previous year. The comparable operating profit for 2022 increased to a record EUR 55.3 million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 8.5%. Both the increase in net sales and our comparable operating profit exceeded the financial targets set for the Group.Aspo’s net sales in October–December stood at EUR 164.6 million  and the comparable operating profit was EUR 11.3 million. ESL Shipping especially supported the positive development of net sales and operating profit  with its record-breaking fourth quarter crowning its overall excellent year. The strong growth of Leipurin’s net sales during the fourth quarter was supported not only by high inflation rates  but also by the acquisition of the Swedish company Kobia AB at the beginning of September. Telko’s comparable operating profit in October–December was below the normal level which was due to the direct and reflected effects of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Eastern trade. Apart from the eastern markets  Telko’s net sales developed positively.The year 2022 turned out to be highly different from what we still assumed at the beginning of the year. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dramatically changed the lives of many of our employees  and our entire operating environment changed drastically.Already in spring  we decided to withdraw from all our operations in Russia and from other selected eastern markets. The prerequisites for responsible business had vanished  and it became clear that we would set our sights even more firmly on western markets in accordance with our strategy updated at the end of 2021. We will continue to operate in Ukraine  and we want to support its development and do our part to help rebuild the country.In summer  we divested Leipurin’s machinery business Vulganus  and at the end of October  the divestment of Kauko was finalized. At the same time  we focused on developing our key businesses through acquisitions according to our compounder strategy  of which the acquisition of Kobia by Leipurin and Telko’s recent acquisitions were the most significant. During the year  we also made strategic investments  the most important of which was ESL Shipping’s decision to invest in new Green Coaster vessels using a pooling arrangement.We are heading to 2023 from a good position  and we will continue the determined implementation of our strategy. I believe that we can generate strong cash flow even in this challenging market environment and  in accordance with our financial guidance  we expect Aspo’s comparable operating profit to be EUR 30–40 million in 2023. We continue to boost organic growth through strategic acquisitions.Thanks for Aspo’s excellent results in 2022 go to our entire personnel. I am particularly pleased and grateful for the dedication our personnel showed in supporting our colleagues in areas ravaged by the war and in ensuring their safety.ASPO GROUPFinancial results and targetsAspo’s financial targets announced on December 1  2021:Annual increase in net sales: 5–10% a yearOperating profit: 8%Return on equity: more than 20%Gearing: less than 130%With regard to Aspo’s businesses  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%.In 2022  the Group’s targets were reached well overall. Aspo Group’s operating profit increased by 11%. The comparable operating profit rate was 8.5% (7.2%)  clearly exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Return on equity remained at the level of 15.2% (20.8%) due to the items affecting comparability of EUR -24.1 million that mainly consisted of additional costs and impairment losses arising from Russia’s invasion in Ukraine  and whose negative impact on return on equity was roughly 15.6 percentage points. Aspo’s gearing decreased to 108.4% (131.0%)  well below the target level.Aspo Group’s comparable result for continuing and discontinued operationsAspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit is calculated by adjusting the reported operating profit with rare and material items affecting the operating profit. These include impairment losses  sales gains from vessels  and financial losses caused by Russia’s invasion in Ukraine.In December 2021  Aspo announced that Kauko operating segment was defined not being part of Aspo’s core operations  and Kauko was classified as a discontinued operation. On October 31  2022  Kauko was divested outside the Group  and its accumulated earnings until that date and the divestment loss are presented in the profit from discontinued operations  separate from the results of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. However  Kauko’s results are included in Aspo Group’s total figures and comparable operating profit.Telko’s companies in Russia and Belarus  and Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan are classified as held for sale in the 2022 financial statements (eastern businesses held for sale below). The results of the eastern businesses held for sale are reported as part of Telko and Leipurin  as well as Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The assets and liabilities of the eastern businesses held for sale are presented on the balance sheet separately as assets and liabilities held for sale. When the eastern businesses were classified as held for sale  they were measured at fair value less cost to sell  resulting in the recognition of impairment losses totaling EUR 14.5 million in the fourth quarter  reported as items affecting comparability. On divestment  the recognition of the translation differences of the eastern businesses as part of sales losses as well as a possible change the fair value of the eastern businesses compared with the estimates made in the financial statements will also have a negative impact on the operating profit. On the closing date  the amount of the translation differences of the eastern businesses held for sale was EUR -11.8 million. The amount fluctuates according to changes in exchange rates until the date of sale. The reclassification of the translation differences from the translation difference reserve to the result for the period has no impact on Aspo Group’s total equity.Net sales and operating profit margin  Group total 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales  Group total 164.6 163.2 652.6 586.4 Net sales  continuing operations 163.8 160.0 643.4 573.3 Net sales  discontinued operations 0.8 3.2 9.2 13.1 Operating profit  Group total -4.8 8.8 31.2 33.9 Operating profit  Group total  % -2.9 5.4 4.8 5.8 Items affecting comparability*) -16.1 -5.1 -24.1 -8.5 Comparable operating profit  Group total 11.3 13.9 55.3 42.4 Comparable operating profit  Group total  % 6.9 8.5 8.5 7.2Operating profit and comparable operating profit  Group total 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping  operating profit 10 2 9 8 38 1 26 8 Telko  operating profit -7 7 4 4 7 3 20 4 Leipurin  operating profit -4 3 -3 6 -4 8 -2 4 Other operations  operating profit -1 9 -1 9 -6 7 -7 9 Operating profit from continuing operations -3 7 8 7 33 9 36 9 Operating profit from discontinued operations -1 1 0 1 -2 7 -3 0 Operating profit  Group total -4 8 8 8 31 2 33 9 Items affecting comparability*) -16 1 -5 1 -24 1 -8 5 Comparable operating profit  Group total 11 3 13 9 55 3 42 4*) Items affecting comparability  MEUR ESL Telko Leipurin Other Kauko Total Shipping operations Sale of Espa 1 5 1 5 Inventory in Ukraine -2 6 -0 7 -3 3 Accounts receivable in Ukraine -0 5 -0 1 -0 6 Impairment losses -9 3 -5 0 -1 3 -15 6 Withdrawal from Russia -0 8 -1 1 -0 6 -2 5 Divestment losses -0 4 -1 2 -1 6 Other -1 3 -0 7 -2 0 Total 0 7 -13 5 -8 1 -0 7 -2 5 -24 1In 2022  items affecting comparability totaled EUR -24.1 million  of which EUR -20.7 million resulted from the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo Group’s business operations.

Items affecting comparability relating to reorganizations were EUR -0.4 million in the Leipurin segment and EUR -0.1 million in other operations. In addition  Kauko’s sales loss of EUR -1.2 million is included in the items affecting comparability and reported as part of the results of discontinued operations.Items affecting the comparability in 2021  totaling EUR -8.5 million  included the impairment loss of EUR -4.3 million recognized on Leipurin’s goodwill during the final quarter  and the impairment loss and restoration provision of EUR -0.8 million recognized on the fixed assets of Telko’s terminal in Rauma  as well as the impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter  which is reported as part of the results of discontinued operations.SustainabilitySustainability is a material factor which guides Aspo’s management system and especially the company’s investments. Aspo’s businesses aim to be pioneers in sustainability in their respective sectors. To support the sustainability commitments  Aspo published new environmental  social and corporate governance (ESG) goals for the Group and its businesses in December 2021. The key goal is to reduce emission intensity  CO2e (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) is 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. According to the green transition in the shipping industry  ESL Shipping is engaged in close and long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide fossil-free sea transportation for its key customers in the future. ESL Shipping invests in twelve new generation electric hybrid vessels  half of which will remain in its own ownership and half will be transferred to the other party of the pooling arrangement. The investment is significant in terms of monetary value  but above all  it helps the shipping company move towards its emissions target.During the past 12 months  emission intensity improved further to 0.33 (0.42)  driven by the increase in net sales and operational efficiency.Another key goal was a higher level of safety  with the Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) being 8.1 (8.8) during the past 12 months. Even though TRIF improved from the previous year  we did not reach the target of 7.0 set for 2022.Aspo regularly assesses the satisfaction of employees with their own tasks  the quality of management  and Aspo as an employer by conducting an annual atmosphere survey. In 2021  Aspo started to use the People Power index  a new method of measuring job satisfaction  and it was also included in the Group’s sustainability goals. The operating environment remained fairly challenging in all businesses  and job satisfaction decreased slightly  while still being high: the Group achieved the rating of AA in 2022 (2021: AA+). However  the targeted level of AA+ was not achieved unlike in 2021.Aspo’s internal Compliance and Code of Conduct training includes anti-corruption issues and provides guidance for identifying any suspicious situations and practices considered unethical. Aspo’s goal is that all of the Group’s personnel complete the training every year. In 2022  approximately 100% (89%) of the Group’s employees completed Code of Conduct training and roughly 100% (88%) completed Compliance training.Operating environment and the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo’s operationsAspo’s operating environment changed dramatically during 2022 due to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. The invasion has caused considerable general uncertainties in markets  higher interest rates  lower trust among consumers  price inflation  higher energy prices in particular  as well as significant volatility in prices and exchange rates.Significantly suspended business operations in Ukraine due to the war have caused financial losses. The considerable damage to the energy distribution infrastructure in Ukraine made the situation even worse during the second half of 2022. The war drastically reduces operating conditions in eastern markets as a result of operational challenges and regulations  and selected values in particular. Aspo’s decision to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets  combined with the sanctions related to the war  has also reshaped Aspo’s logistics flows and operating models.ESL Shipping’s all operations have been suspended in Russia  and the released vessel capacity has been transferred to other operating areas. Telko has signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. At the end of 2022  Telko also signed a binding preliminary agreement on the sale of its subsidiary in Belarus to a member of its current management. A binding preliminary agreement was also signed with Timur Akhiyarov  a Russian-born private investor  after the end of the financial year on the sale of Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan.Leipurin’s net sales in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan stood at EUR 24.7 million in 2022  comprising 19% of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2022 and less than 4% of Aspo Group’s net sales. Telko’s net sales in Russia and Belarus stood at EUR 58.0 million in 2022  comprising 22% of Telko’s total net sales in 2022 and less than 9% of Aspo Group’s net sales. The consolidated net sales of Telko and Leipurin in these countries accounted for roughly 13% of Aspo Group’s net sales in 2022 (16% of net sales in 2021).The international sanctions and Russia’s legislative measures prevent the transportation of goods and the transfer of payments which has reduced the net sales and profitability of the operations in Russia. In addition  decreases in the companies’ operations and personnel have reduced Russia’s role in Aspo’s business operations. The operating environment is expected to become even more challenging  and no rapid solution is in sight.The equity of the group companies in Russia is EUR 20.5 (16.6) million  comprising 14.3% (12.8%) of Aspo Group’s total equity. In Aspo Group  EUR 12.2 million in impairment losses associated with the equity of Russian companies have been recognized in the financial statements. Aspo’s assets in Russia mainly consist of cash and cash equivalents  inventories and accounts receivable. The number of employees in Aspo Group’s companies in Russia is decreasing  being 105 (193) at the end of the year.Rising interest and inflation rates  as well as weaker general economic estimates  have affected consumers’ purchasing behavior  for example  so that consumers have shifted from more expensive to more affordable products.While the coronavirus pandemic has been overshadowed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the news  it still has an impact on Aspo’s operating environment. For example  the global shortage of components  caused by the pandemic  has an impact on certain Aspo’s businesses  decelerating sales and the completion of orders. The markets are also characterized by disruptions in logistics flows and the low availability of certain products. The risk of infections must still be taken into account in daily operations especially among ESL Shipping’s crew members.Net sales by market area  continuing operations 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Share 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Share MEUR MEUR % MEUR MEUR % Finland 58.6 45.4 35.8 224.4 175.2 34.9 Scandinavia 38.6 32.2 23.6 137.6 109.4 21.4 Baltic countries 18.2 16 11.1 67.8 54.8 10.5 Russia  other CIS countries and Ukraine 21.6 43.9 13.2 118.2 155.2 18.4 Other countries 26.8 22.5 16.3 95.4 78.7 14.8 Total 163.8 160 100 643.4 573.3 100During 2022  Aspo has reported its net sales by market area with the following division: Finland  Scandinavia  the Baltic region  and eastern markets (Russia  other CIS countries  and Ukraine). The eastern markets’ share of total net sales continued to decrease during the fourth quarter of 2022  mainly due to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and decisions to downsize operations in Russia and withdraw from the market as planned. As a result of the withdrawal from Russia  the division of Aspo’s main market areas will change at the beginning of 2023. According to the previously announced strategy  the company will direct its growth investments at western markets  and the eastern markets’ share of Aspo’s total net sales already decreased to 13.2% in the fourth quarter.Cash flow and financingThe Group’s net cash flow from operating activities in January–December was EUR 67.7 (44.0) million. The cash flow of all businesses showed positive development during the year. The impact of the change in working capital on cash flow during the review period was EUR -6.7 (-22.0) million. The increase in working capital mainly comes from the advance payments for the vessels to be built in the ESL Shipping segment’s vessel pool and the customer receivables accumulated through high sales at the end of the year. This was partly compensated by the Telko segment’s working capital  which improved towards the year end. The free cash flow in January–December was EUR 34.4 (27.5) million. The amount of investments of EUR -17.8 (-15.9) million mainly included the ESL Shipping segment’s dockages and Green Coaster advance payments. In addition  the cash flow from investing activities includes EUR -17.9 million cash outflow on the acquisitions of Kobia  Mentum and Johan Steenks and a total of EUR 2.8 million in cash inflow from the sale of Espa and Vulganus as the most significant items.12/2022 12/2021 MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities  incl. lease liabilities 189.2 187.3 Cash and cash equivalents 33.5 17.7 Net interest-bearing debt 155.7 169.6Net interest-bearing debt decreased to EUR 155.7 (169.6) million and gearing fell to 108.4% (131.0%). The Group’s equity ratio at the end of the review period was 34.7% (32.0%). The balance sheet strengthened as a result of improved profitability and the new hybrid instrument issued in June.Net financial expenses in January–December totaled EUR -6.3 (-3.9) million. Exchange rate changes  especially the strengthened value of the Russian ruble  increased financial expenses by EUR 1.6 million from the previous year. The average interest rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  was 3.3% (1.4%).The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents stood at EUR 33.5 (17.7) at the end of the review period  of which cash and cash equivalents related to businesses held for sale were EUR 11.8 million. Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program also remained wholly unused (5).During 2022  Aspo extended its maturity structure for interest-bearing loans. In September  AtoBatC AB signed an EUR 32.2 million loan agreement with Svenska Skeppshypotek. The loan’s maturity is 15 years  and it has not yet been withdrawn. The loan  together with the ten-year loan agreement of EUR 20 million singed in June with the Nordic Investment Bank  of which EUR 19.6 million have been withdrawn  finances ESL Shipping’s investment in a series of six new highly energy-efficient electric hybrid vessels. The project was launched in September 2021. In addition  Aspo restructured a bilateral bank loan of EUR 20 million  about to mature in 2023  with a new bilateral revolving credit facility which will mature in 2025. The loan agreement also includes two options for a one-year extension.In June  Aspo issued a new EUR 30 million hybrid instrument  with a coupon rate of 8.75% per annum. The hybrid instrument has no maturity  but the company may exercise an early redemption option in June 2025 at the earliest. Aspo’s earlier hybrid instrument of EUR 20 million was redeemed on May 2  2022.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operationsAspo and its subsidiaries are exposed to various risks and uncertainties  which are mainly identified and managed in Aspo's businesses. The most important risks and preparedness for them are summarized and reported to Aspo's Board of Directors through Aspo's Audit Committee.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine causes significant geopolitical uncertainties. It affects the general economic environment  including inflation  energy and raw material prices  interest rates  and consumers’ trust.The ongoing process to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets will change the Group’s structure significantly and will affect the revenue model of Aspo’s businesses in the long term. There are risks that the withdrawal from the selected markets causes additional costs or losses  and that funds cannot be transferred from the markets or that the withdrawal is unsuccessful in full or in part. It is also possible that the official approvals required for the withdrawal from the markets are not obtained for example due to changes is legislation or that they are at risk or fail for some other reason.Financial activities and the prevailing geopolitical uncertainties have caused the prices of many raw materials  components and logistics services to rise rapidly. While Aspo may benefit from the price increases temporarily  the prices of raw materials or rental capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Disruptions in logistics flows  longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes are also increasing risks. The rapid increase in inflation has generally caused pressure for salary increases  which in Finland can lead to labor disputes  which can also negatively affect Aspo's businesses.International sanctions and countersanctions have been imposed  which may also affect Aspo’s businesses directly or indirectly. The geopolitical tensions may escalate and cause a direct adverse impact on business operations  put payments at risk and even suspend business operations. If escalated  cyber incidents and disruptions in information systems may cause damage to business operations.In line with its renewed strategy  Aspo aims to increase its steady profit-making ability through acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial resources and consequently may reduce solvency. With its strategy  Aspo aims to reduce the impact of the possibly weakening general economic development on Aspo’s profit-making ability.The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Aspo’s operations has been limited at the group level  even though it has been significant in the Leipurin segment. The current and any new coronavirus variants and their rapid spread may suspend business operations and cause financial losses through stoppages in global logistics chains  among other factors.Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation and knowledge  they involve significant risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO’S BUSINESS OPERATIONSESL ShippingESL Shipping is the leading dry bulk sea transport company operating in the Baltic Sea area. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 41 vessels with a total capacity of 425 000 deadweight tonnage (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (80% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 16 vessels (18%) were time chartered. ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service.10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 63.3 54.7 16 245.4 191.4 28 Operating profit  MEUR 10.2 9.8 4 38.1 26.8 42 Operating profit  % 16.1 17.9 15.5 14.0 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -0.4 0.7 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 10.6 9.8 8 37.4 26.8 40 Comparable operating profit  % 16.7 17.9 15.2 14.0The fourth quarter of 2022 marked the best quarter in ESL Shipping’s history measured by the operating profit. Net sales increased by 16% from the previous year to EUR 63.3 (54.7) million. The comparable operating profit for the quarter increased by 8% to record-breaking EUR 10.6 (9.8) million. The operating profit of EUR 10.2 (9.8) million includes EUR -0.4 million in expenses associated with suspended operations in Russia.High demand in the shipping company’s main market areas  the shipping company’s long-term partnership strategy and the successful operations of the onshore and offshore personnel enabled the excellent results. Weather conditions were also favorable for operations. The comparable operating profit rate of 16.7% (17.9%) achieved during the fourth quarter was once again excellent. During the quarter  the prices of diesel and liquefied natural gas (LNG) used as ship fuels decreased from the previous quarter  while remaining roughly twice as high as in the comparative period. The high level of fuel surcharges increased net sales and reduced the operating profit rate  which is used as an indicator of relative profitability.During the fourth quarter  cargo volumes transported by ESL Shipping decreased slightly from the comparative period to 3.8 (3.9) million tons. The volume development was based on the transfer of raw material deliveries away from Russia which has extended transportation distances especially for energy coal. The final quarter is also normally the busiest season for energy transportation  but as a result of the exceptional situation involving the security of supply  the low availability of biofuels and longer transportation distances  the percentage of energy coal from all transportation operations tripled during the fourth quarter from the comparative period.The profitability of all the shipping company’s vessel categories was excellent during the fourth quarter. In fourth quarter  production plants of several contractual customers underwent relatively large maintenance stoppages and restricted production due to lower demand and high energy costs. High demand experienced in the energy industry enabled the vessels to continue to operate at full capacity during the fourth quarter. The spot cargo market decreased in all customer segments and vessel categories during the quarter. After operations in Russia were suspended  demand for ESL Shipping’s loading and unloading operations for vessels at sea shifted to the southern Baltic Sea where it was maintained by the high demand for energy coal transportation during the fourth quarter and congestion at ports suitable for large ocean liners.Six time-chartered vessels of the smaller vessel category were redelivered to their owners as the charter agreements ended at the end of the fourth quarter and as the price of an extended charter period became too high.The newbuilding project of ESL Shipping’s Swedish subsidiary AtoBatC Shipping AB    at the Chowgule & Company Private Limited shipyard in India proceeded as planned during the fourth quarter. Every other vessel in the series of 12 next-generation electric hybrid vessels will be sold  as announced earlier  to the company established by the pooling investor group. The first four new vessels are already under construction  and the first vessel is to be delivered during fall 2023.One larger vessel was docked for seven days during the fourth quarter and one smaller vessel was out of service for 26 days. In 2022  dockage days totaled 141 (229).The net sales of ESL Shipping in January–December increased from the comparative period by 28% to EUR 245.4 (191.4) million. The comparable operating profit was the highest in the company’s history at EUR 37.4 (26.8) million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 15.2% (14.0%). The operating profit rate clearly exceeded the long-term target of 14%. Comparability was affected by the gain from the sale of the barge Espa and costs associated with the suspended operations in Russia. Their impact on net results was EUR 0.7 million and  as a result  ESL Shipping’s operating profit amounted to EUR 38.1 (26.8) million and its operating profit rate was 15.5% (14.0%) for 2022 as a whole.The shipping company’s long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The aim is to halve carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. During 2022  ESL Shipping transported 14.7 (14.8) million tons of cargo  and its vessels consumed 819 988 (898 158) MWh of energy. CO2 emissions per transported ton decreased by 7.5% to 0.015 (0.016) tons of carbon dioxide per ton of cargo. The new energy-efficient operating models applied to port visits supported the positive development.ESL Shipping outlook for 2023General macroeconomic uncertainties have increased in ESL Shipping’s main market areas. Higher inflation and slower economic growth increase demand and pricing pressure among the shipping company’s main customers. Finland’s labor market may experience unrest during the spring  and its impact through overtime bans and strikes may be significant on key customers and especially on the effectiveness of the transport chain.Global demand estimates in sea transportation markets and price levels of spot markets have decreased considerably from the previous year. On the other hand  the availability of vessel capacity suitable for round-the-year operations in the Baltic Sea is limited. Production volumes of ESL Shipping’s main customers is expected to be satisfactory  albeit slightly lower than in the previous year. Demand for energy deliveries outside Finland is expected to remain high during the first half of the year. In the forest industry  pulp delivery volumes are looking positive  but only satisfactory for sawn goods. Volumes are looking satisfactory in the steel industry. Now that deliveries of Russian raw materials have stopped  certain of the shipping company’s significant contractual customers are forced to seek new suppliers for part of their production input required in new geographic areas. Not all of these procurement routes have yet become stabilized which may cause an imbalance in ESL Shipping’s operations. The role of energy coal transportation is expected to decrease significantly when the preparation situation returns to normal and demand shifts towards other energy forms.The majority of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements with the exception of the Supramax vessels. Currently  the expectations of the lessors of the time-chartered vessels do not meet the realities in the shipping company’s main market areas which may cause further uncertainties in the availability of a suitable and sufficient tonnage. The impact of rising energy prices on ESL Shipping’s costs is compensated effectively through fuel clauses in long-term transportation agreements.Surveys show that ESL Shipping’s customer satisfaction is at an excellent level  similarly to the personnel’s commitment and job satisfaction. Activities to further improve customer and employee satisfaction  sustainability and occupational safety will continue.The shipping company’s investments in energy-efficient vessels will strengthen its competitiveness and market position in the future. ESL Shipping will continue the development of a fossil-free sea transportation ecosystem in line with the green transition and the vessels designed for it in cooperation with its key customers. The shipping company is participating in projects aimed to produce green hydrogen through renewable electricity and to further process it as fossil-free fuel for the shipping company’s vessels.During 2023  four larger and two smaller vessels will be docked for a total of approximately 100 days.TelkoTelko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together. Its competitive edge is based on strong technical support  efficient logistics and local expert service. Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Russia  Belarus  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China.In October 2022  Telko signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. In December  Telko finalized the preliminary agreement to divest its subsidiary in Belarus  to a member of its current management. Both business transactions still need to be approved by the local authorities. Assets and liabilities related to these companies have been classified as assets and liabilities held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 standard at the end of the review period.10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 59.2 73.6 -20 267.4 268.8 -1 Operating profit  MEUR -7.7 4.4 -275 7.3 20.4 -64 Operating profit  % -13.0 6.0 2.7 7.6 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -9.0 -0.8 -13.5 -0.8 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.3 5.2 -75 20.8 21.2 -2 Comparable operating profit  % 2.2 7.1 7.8 7.9During the fourth quarter  Telko’s net sales decreased steeply to EUR 59.2 (73.6) million. Telko’s net sales for the fourth quarter decreased after sales in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine dropped substantially from the previous year. Telko’s net sales outside Russia  Belarus and Ukraine increased. Demand remained stable in Telko’s all business operations.The comparable operating profit for the fourth quarter stood at EUR 1.3 (5.2) million  and the operating profit rate was 2.2% (7.1%). Net sales and operating profit decreased from the previous year  especially due to weak development and negative results in Russia. Telko’s result for the fourth quarter includes items affecting comparability  which reduced Telko’s operating profit by EUR 9.0 million in total. Impairment losses regarding companies in Russia and Belarus of EUR 9.3 million and other expenses of EUR 0.2 million were recognized relating to the withdrawal from Russia. In addition  the credit loss provision recognized from accounts receivable in Ukraine was reversed by EUR 0.5 million. The combined comparable operating profit of the above countries was slightly negative during the fourth quarter.Telko’s operating profit for the fourth quarter was EUR -7.7 (4.4) million. The operating profit rate was -13.0% (6.0%). Impairment losses associated with inventories  exchange rate losses  and costs related to corporate restructuring also had a negative impact on the operating profit.The net sales of the plastics business decreased by 25% during the fourth quarter to EUR 29.6 (39.7) million  mainly due to the decrease in Telko’s operations in Russia. In Telko’s European markets  demand for plastic polymers remained at a normal level in general. Sales outside Russia  Belarus and Ukraine increased slightly  regardless of the downward trend in prices. While the steep decline in the prices of volume plastics turned to an increase during the fourth quarter  the prices are still lower than during the corresponding period in the previous year. The prices of technical plastics decreased slightly during the fourth quarter but were clearly above the comparative period’s level. The acquisition of the operations of Johan Steenks  a Norwegian distributor of technical plastic raw materials and plastics  increased the net sales of the plastics business during the fourth quarter  while it had no significant impact on results.During the fourth quarter  the net sales of the chemicals business decreased by 32% to EUR 15.9 (23.4) million. Sales decreased steeply in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. The weak development especially in Ukraine resulted from the disruptions in the electricity distribution infrastructure due to the war which directly limited production. Total sales in other countries increased significantly  regardless of the decrease in prices. Prices started to increase during the fourth quarter. Telko’s chemicals business is divided between several customer groups which evens out any fluctuations in demand.During the fourth quarter  the net sales of the lubricants business increased by 31% to EUR 13.7 (10.5) million. Sales increased in all key product groups. The increase in sales resulted from high price levels  the acquisition of Mentum AS at the end of 2021  and very positively developed sales of industrial lubricants. Prices of lubricants increased slightly during the fourth quarter. Russia’s invasion in Ukraine did not have any direct impact on the lubricants business.Telko’s net sales in January–December decreased by 1% to EUR 267.4 (268.8) million. The full-year comparable operating profit of EUR 20.8 million was only slightly lower than the previous year’s record-high comparable operating profit (21.2). The comparable operating profit rate remained high at 7.8% (7.9%). Exchange rate losses of EUR 2.5 million reduced the operating profit.Telko’s full-year operating profit fell by 64% to EUR 7.3 (20.4) million. The operating profit rate was 2.7% (7.6%). Results decreased due to the warehouse destroyed in Ukraine  the impairment losses associated with companies in Russia and Belarus  and other costs arising from the withdrawal from Russia  which totaled EUR -13.5 million and have been reported as items affecting comparability.Telko outlook for 2023As announced previously  Telko has agreed to divest its operations in Russia and Belarus. Telko’s net sales in Russia and Belarus were EUR 58.0 million in 2022  comprising 22% of Telko’s total net sales in 2022. Both sales transactions require approval by the local authorities. Telko expects the Russian transaction to be completed during the first quarter of 2023 but there is uncertainty involved.In 2023  Telko’s net sales and profit will be significantly lower than in the previous year due to the changed situation in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. In other countries  demand is expected to remain moderate  even though there will be differences between businesses.The prices of plastics and chemicals decreased steeply during the latter half of 2022  while still being clearly above the long-term average. It is assumed that the most significant price corrections took place during 2022  but the prices are expected to decrease slightly during the first half if energy prices do not experience a considerable increase. In high added value products  on which Telko focuses in accordance with its strategy  price changes are typically more moderate. Significant changes in prices have a short-term impact on margins. Demand for lubricants is expected to remain stable  and prices are expected to increase at least during the first half of 2023.In western markets  demand will involve uncertainties during the next few months. Demand indices have decreased in the construction and automotive industries in Europe. High energy prices and inflation rates will affect demand during the next few months  in particular. At the end of the year  demand will  above all  be affected by the general development of purchasing power in Europe. The lifting of coronavirus restrictions in China is expected to increase local demand. In addition  higher demand in China may have an impact on global price development during the first part of the year. In Central Asia  demand is expected to remain relatively high. Sales in Ukraine will be lower during the first half than in the previous year  while they are expected to be at the 2022 level during the rest of the year  depending completely on the development of the war.Telko will continue its activities to improve its operational efficiency and scalability. Inflation causes general increases in costs. On the other hand  cargo expenses  especially in Asia  will be materially lower than in the previous year.The recent structural arrangements continued when Telko announced on January 31  2023  that it will acquire Eltrex  a Polish company specialized in the distribution of chemicals. According to its strategy  Telko continues to accelerate its growth through acquisitions in addition to organic growth.LeipurinLeipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies  and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. Leipurin operates in nine countries that have been grouped into four business units  each being responsible for their financial performance: Finland  Sweden  Baltics  and East. Leipurin serves bakery  food industry and foodservice customers by providing raw materials and by supporting research and development and recipes for new products. The Leipurin segment’s other product categories include various supplies and machines for the same customer segments. The Leipurin segment uses leading international manufacturers as its raw material and machinery supply partners.On April 22  2022  Aspo announced that Leipurin will withdraw from its operations in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. In January 2023  Leipurin signed a binding preliminary agreement to sell its subsidiaries in these countries to a private investor. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities. Assets and liabilities related to these companies have been classified as assets and liabilities held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 standard at the end of the review period.10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 41.3 31.7 30 130.6 113.1 15 Operating profit  MEUR -4.3 -3.6 19 -4.8 -2.4 100 Operating profit  % -10.4 -11.4 -3.7 -2.1 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -5.4 -4.3 -8.1 -4.3 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.1 0.7 57 3.3 1.9 74 Comparable operating profit  % 2.7 2.2 2.5 1.7 Comparable operating profit excl.

Figures for the comparative year included EUR 2.7 million in net sales of the discontinued machinery business in Russia and divested Vulganus Oy. The Finland business unit’s net sales increased by 8% to EUR 12.2 (11.3) million. In the Baltics  net sales increased by 18% to EUR 10.0 (8.5) million. Net sales of the East business unit decreased by 32% to EUR 6.2 (9.1) million due to the reduced product range  consisting only of local procurement. The decrease in the net sales of the East business unit was also significantly affected by the decrease in operations in Ukraine down to roughly 9% from the comparative year’s level. Sweden was established as a new business unit as a result of the acquisition of Kobia AB on September 1  and it accounted for EUR 12.9 million and approximately 31% of Leipurin’s net sales in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter  sales to bakeries increased by 41% to EUR 28.6 (20.3) million. Sales to the food industry increased by 35% to EUR 4.2 (3.1) million.The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets continued to have a significant impact on Leipurin’s sales during the fourth quarter. Measured in kilograms  the decrease in sales intensified in Finland  Sweden and the Baltics  whereas sales continued to be roughly half of the previous year’s level in the East business unit. The weak volume development is mainly driven by the decrease in consumers’ trust in the current market situation  in which energy costs and interest rates are especially rising steeply. The significant increase in living expenses continued in Finland  Sweden and the Baltics which reduced the inflation-adjusted sales volume of retail and strengthened the shift in consumers’ demand towards more affordable products. The positive development of profit margins continued  regardless of the negative trends in volumes.The comparable operating profit for the fourth quarter stood at EUR 1.1 (0.7) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.7% (2.2%). Leipurin’s comparable operating profit  excluding Vulganus  was EUR 1.1 (0.7) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.7% (2.3%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR -5.4 (-4.3) million  included costs and impairment losses arising from the withdrawal from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan  and costs associated with the reorganization of Leipurin’s group operations. The comparability of the comparative period was affected by animpairment loss recognized on goodwill. Leipurin’s operating loss for the fourth quarter was EUR -4.3 (-3.6) million. Reversal of a fair value allocation of inventories amounting to EUR -0.5 million which arised from the acquisition of Kobia  had a negative impact on the operating profit.In January–December  Leipurin’s net sales increased by 15% to EUR 130.6 (113.1) million. Figures for the comparative year included EUR 11.4 million in net sales of the discontinued machinery business in Russia and divested Vulganus Oy  which were EUR 7.1 million higher than in 2022  but the increase in raw material sales in western markets was particularly strong during the review period compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets had a significant impact on the euro-denominated increase in sales.Leipurin’s comparable operating profit in January–December 2022 was EUR 3.3 (1.9) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.5% (1.7%). Leipurin’s comparable operating profit  excluding Vulganus  was EUR 4.1 (2.4) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 3.2% (2.2%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR -8.1 (-4.3) million  were mainly related to the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine  the acquisition of Kobia  and the divestment of Vulganus. The reported operating profit was negative at EUR -4.8 (-2.4) million. Kobia’s impact on Leipurin’s operating profit was still negative due to the reversal of the EUR 0.5 million fair value allocation of inventories related to the acquisition.Vulganus was divested on June 30  2022. The loss arising from the divestment and the expenses related to it  totaling EUR -0.4 million  are reported under the Leipurin segment’s other operating expenses.Leipurin acquired all shares in Kobia AB  a Swedish distributor in the bakery industry  from the Swedish Abdon Group. Kobia AB comprises Leipurin’s new Sweden business unit  and it has been included in Aspo Group’s figures since September 1  2022. Kobia’s annual net sales are approximately EUR 50 million  and its operating profit rate is roughly 3%. The acquisition strengthens Leipurin’s position as the leading company in the Baltic Sea region.Leipurin outlook for 2023The war in Ukraine and the decision to withdraw operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan will have a significant impact on Leipurin’s net sales and results. Leipurin’s net sales in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan were EUR 24.7 million in 2022  comprising 19% of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2022. The divestment of the operations in the eastern markets still needs to be approved by the local authorities. Leipurin expects the transaction to be completed during the first half of 2023 but there is uncertainty involved.The expansion to Sweden through the acquisition of Kobia AB will increase Leipurin’s annual net sales by roughly EUR 50 million and produce considerable synergy benefits in the development of the product range  and in the supply chain and procurement. It also enables partners to be served in a larger geographic area. The integration of operations has progressed according to plans.Inflation and the rising energy prices  in particular  have a negative impact on demand for more expensive products  potentially presenting profitability challenges among the bakery segment’s customers. The decreased purchasing power may have a negative impact on demand for artisanal bakeries  as consumers prefer more affordable products.The upward trend is expected to continue in the prices of main raw material categories  even though the rapid inflation during the review period is expected to decelerate considerably. This is expected to take place during the first half of 2023.Despite these challenges  Leipurin sees that the market will offer a highly stable environment in the long term and also opportunities for organic growth in selected market segments. In addition  the profitability program that was launched earlier develops the organization's ability to lead with information and helps to improve financial performance in particular. The program focuses both on selected growth clusters and on improving the efficiency of operations. This program is expected to contribute to improving Leipurin’s financial development.The impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic on the global supply chains  the availability of certain raw materials and general delivery times will continue.The management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges will increase risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers.Other operationsOther operations include Aspo Group’s administration  finance and ICT service center. The comparable operating profit of other operations was EUR -1.8 (-1.9) million during the fourth quarter. The reported operating profit of EUR -1.9 (-1.9) million includes EUR -0.1 million in restructuring expenses affecting comparability.The comparable operating profit for 2022 was EUR -6.0 (-7.9) million. The reported operating profit was EUR -6.7 (-7.9) million  including EUR -0.7 million in items affecting comparability that are mainly related to the additional share-based remuneration granted to Aspo’s previous CEO and restructuring expenses.COMPANY INFORMATIONAspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

At the end of the financial year  inventories included EUR 10.2 million in advance payments for the Green Coaster vessels.ESL Shipping’s total investment comprises six vessels and roughly EUR 70 million.Segment assets and liabilities ESL ShippingTelko Leipurin Held for Unallocated Group MEUR sale items total Assets Dec 31  2021 215.8 106.6 54.7 8.4 20.8 406.3 Assets Dec 31  2022 224.8 85.7 68.5 12.4 24.5 415.9 Liabilities Dec 31  2021 31.5 47.9 15.4 6.8 175.3 276.9 Liabilities Dec 31  2022 32.3 34.4 16.4 3.9 185.2 272.2Aspo Group disaggregation of net sales. from continuing operationsTelko net sales 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR Business area: Plastics business 29.6 39.7 -25.4 136.9 146.7 -6.7 Chemicals business 15.9 23.4 -32.1 80.3 83.6 -3.9 Lubricants business 13.7 10.5 30.5 50.2 38.5 30.4 Telko total 59.2 73.6 -19.6 267.4 268.8 -0.5Leipurin net sales 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR Regions: Finland 12.2 11.3 8.0 46.6 40.4 15.3 Sweden 12.9 17.3 Baltics 10.0 8.5 18.0 36.8 30.6 20.4 East 6.2 9.1 -32.1 25.6 30.7 -16.7 Total 41.3 29.0 42.4 126.3 101.7 24.2 of which: Bakeries 28.6 20.3 40.8 87.9 73.2 20.1 Food Industry 4.2 3.1 34.5 14.2 11.0 28.8 Retail  foodservice  other 8.5 5.5 53.7 24.2 17.4 38.8 Machinery trading Russia 2.0 -100.0 0.0 7.3 -100.0 Vulganus 0.7 -100.0 4.3 4.1 4.9 Leipurin total 41.3 31.7 30.4 130.6 113.1 15.5Net sales by timing of revenue recognition 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping At a point in time 0.6 0.9 3.5 3.6 Over time 62.7 53.8 241.9 187.8 63.3 54.7 245.4 191.4 Telko At a point in time 59.1 73.5 267.0 268.5 Over time 0.1 0.1 0.4 0.3 59.2 73.6 267.4 268.8 Leipurin At a point in time 41.3 29.7 127.3 107.5 Over time 0.0 2.0 3.3 5.6 41.3 31.7 130.6 113.1 Total At a point in time 101.0 104.1 397.8 379.6 Over time 62.8 55.9 245.6 193.7 163.8 160.0 643.4 573.3 Net sales by market area 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping Finland 32.6 20.2 121.5 84.3 Scandinavia 11.9 17.4 58.5 54.1 Baltic countries 0.6 2.3 2.9 3.5 Russia  other CIS countries and Ukraine 0.0 0.6 1.3 2.5 Other countries 18.2 14.2 61.2 47.0 63.3 54.7 245.4 191.4 Telko Finland 13.7 12.4 53.5 47.6 Scandinavia 14.1 14.1 61.7 52.4 Baltic countries 7.6 5.0 28.2 20.4 Russia  other CIS countries and Ukraine 15.4 34.0 91.3 117.3 Other countries 8.4 8.1 32.7 31.1 59.2 73.6 267.4 268.8 Leipurin Finland 12.3 12.8 49.4 43.3 Scandinavia 12.6 0.7 17.4 2.9 Baltic countries 10.0 8.7 36.7 30.9 Russia  other CIS countries and Ukraine 6.2 9.3 25.6 35.4 Other countries 0.2 0.2 1.5 0.6 41.3 31.7 130.6 113.1 Total Finland 58.6 45.4 224.4 175.2 Scandinavia 38.6 32.2 137.6 109.4 Baltic countries 18.2 16.0 67.8 54.8 Russia  other CIS countries and Ukraine 21.6 43.9 118.2 155.2 Other countries 26.8 22.5 95.4 78.7 163.8 160.0 643.4 573.3Acquisition of Kobia ABLeipurin acquired the entire share capital of the Swedish bakery industry distributor Kobia Ab from the Swedish Abdon Group on September 1  2022. The acquisition expands Leipurin’s geographical presence in the Northern European market. In 2021  Kobia’s net sales amounted to approximately EUR 50 million and its operating profit rate was approximately 3%. The acquisition of Kobia AB included also the properties owned by Kobia. Aspo actively explores options to sell and lease back the properties. The potential transactions are significantly affected by market conditions.The purchase price of EUR 15.7 million was paid fully in cash. The assets and liabilities of the acquired company were measured at fair value on the acquisition date. A fair value allocation of EUR 9.7 million was made on the properties  a fair value allocation of EUR 0.4 million was made on the intangible assets based on customer relationships  and the fair value adjustment relating to inventories was EUR 0.5 million. The deferred tax liability arising from the fair value adjustments was EUR 2.2 million. The carrying amount of the other acquired assets and liabilities were deemed to correspond to their fair values. A goodwill balance of EUR 0.1 million resulted from the acquisition. The acquisition-related costs of approximately one million euro were recognized in the Leipurin segment’s other operating expenses.Acquisition calculation of Kobia AB 12/2022 MEUR Consideration Paid in cash 15.7 Total consideration 15.7 Assets acquired and liabilities assumed. fair value Intangible assets 0.8 Tangible assets 13.6 Leased assets 0.3 Inventories 4.8 Accounts receivable and other receivables 5.0 Total assets 24.5 Interest bearing liabilities 1.3 Accounts payable and other liabilities 5.3 Deferred tax liability 2.3 Total liabilities 8.9 Net assets acquired 15.6 Goodwill 0.1Acquisition of Johan SteenksTelko completed the acquisition of the operations of the Norwegian company Johan Steenks AS on October 3  2022. Johan Steenks is a distributor of technical plastic raw materials and additives for plastics  and it has an established customer base in the Norwegian markets and a number of well-known principals. The company’s annual net sales are roughly EUR 5 million. The business acquisition had no significant impact on Telko’s net sales or results during the final quarter of the year. The purchase price was approximately EUR 2.0 million  of which EUR 0.7 million were allocated to inventories and the remaining EUR 1.3 million were recognized as an increase in goodwill. The cash flow from the acquisition in 2022 was EUR -1.9 million.Discontinued operations and other non-current assets and disposal groups held for saleIn October 17  Telko signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. The sales price is approximately EUR 9.5 million. The transaction still needs to be approved by the Russian authorities. Telko’s company in Russia has been classified as held for sale since October 2022 when the preliminary agreement on the sale was signed. Telko’s company in Belarus has been classified as held for sale since December 2022 when the agreement on the sale was signed with the company’s acting management.Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan have been classified as held for sale since December 31  2022 when their divestment started to seem probable. A binding preliminary agreement on their sale was signed on January 17  2023 with Timur Akhiyarov  a Russian-born private investor. The sales price is approximately EUR 8.4 million. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities.The Kauko operating segment and Vulganus Oy  part of the Leipurin segment  were defined as non-core businesses for Aspo and classified as held for sale in December 2021. Vulganus was sold to KÖNIG Maschinen GmbH  the leading manufacturer of bakery machines in Austria  on June 30  2022. The results of Vulganus  including the divestment loss of EUR -0.4 million   are reported as part of the Leipurin segment’s figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations.The Kauko operating segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in accordance with the IFRS 5 standard  and its figures are reported separately from the figures of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. In the statement of comprehensive income  the figures of the comparative periods have been restated. Kauko Oy was sold to Signal Partners Oy on October 31  2022.Profit from discontinued operations 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales 0.8 3.2 9.2 13.1 Materials and services -0.6 -2.3 -6.9 -9.6 Employee benefit expenses -0.2 -0.4 -1.5 -1.7 Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 0.0 0.0 -1.3 -3.5 Depreciation  leased assets 0.0 0.0 0.0 -0.1 Other operating expenses -1.1 -0.4 -2.2 -1.2 Operating profit -1.1 0.1 -2.7 -3.0 Profit before taxes -1.1 0.1 -2.7 -3.0 Income taxes -0.1 0.0 Profit for the period -1.1 0.1 -2.8 -3.0Profit from discontinued operations includes the income and expenses of the Kauko operating segment  to the extent that they are considered to transfer outside Aspo Group in conjunction with the divestment. Therefore  the profit from discontinued operations does not include all internal administrative charges of Aspo Group allocated to the Kauko operating segment. As a result  the profit from discontinued operations for the financial year is EUR 0.3 (0.4) million higher than the Kauko operating segment’s profit. An impairment loss of EUR -1.3 million was recognized on Kauko’s goodwill in June 2022. The profit from discontinued operations also includes the EUR -1.2 million loss on sale of Kauko Oy recognized during the fourth quarter. An impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million was recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter of 2021.Net cash flows of discontinued operations 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR Net cash inflow from operating activities -0.6 0.4 Net cash inflowithoutflow(-) from investing activities -1.0 0.0 Net cash inflowithoutflow(-) from financing activities -1.6 -1.6 Net change in cash generated by the discontinued operations -3.2 -1.2Net cash flows of discontinued operations consist of the Kauko operating segment’s share of Aspo Group’s cash flows.

The costs to sell of EUR -0.4 million are included in the cash flow from operating activities. The cash flow from financing mainly consists of repayments of interest-bearing loans.Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale 12/2022 12/2021 MEUR MEUR Assets of discontinued operations 5.5 Other assets held for sale 12.4 2.9 Assets classified as held for sale  total 12.4 8.4 Liabilities of discontinued operations 4.9 Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale 3.9 1.9 Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale  total 3.9 6.8On the balance sheet  the assets and liabilities of the companies held for sale are reported under “Assets held for sale” and liabilities under “Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale”. The reporting of balance sheet items on separate rows starts at the time of classification  therefore the figures of the comparative period have not been restated.In 2022  assets and liabilities classified as held for sale included the assets and liabilities of the companies held for sale in eastern markets. The classification includes the share of the assets and liabilities of Aspo Group that belong to the companies held for sale  excluding internal assets and liabilities that have been eliminated. In 2021  assets and liabilities of discontinued operations included the figures of the Kauko operating segment. The other assets held for sale at the end of 2021 consisted of Vulganus Oy’s assets and liabilities. The recognition of depreciation and amortization expense ended on December 1  2021  for Kauko and Vulganus when they were classified as held for sale. The depreciation and amortization expense was recognized as part of sales losses in conjunction with the divestment of the companies. Telko Russia was classified as held for sale on October 31  2022  and the other companies held for sale in eastern markets on December 31  2022. The recognition of depreciation and amortization expense ended at the time of the classification as held for sale.At the time of classification as held for sale  the net assets of the companies in eastern markets were measured at fair value less cost to sell  which was lower than the carrying amount. As a result  an impairment loss of EUR 9.4 million was recognized in the Telko segment and EUR 5.2 million in the Leipurin segment during the fourth quarter  which are reported as part of the Telko and Leipurin segments’ figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations.Impairment losses in income statement 2022 Telko Leipurin Total MEUR MEUR MEUR Impairment losses  tangible and intangible assets 0.6 1.1 1.7 Impairment losses  leased assets 0.8 0.1 0.9 Materials and services 4.8 2.4 7.2 Other operating expenses 3.1 1.4 4.5 Income taxes 0.0 0.2 0.3 Total 9.4 5.2 14.6The impairment losses recognized on the assets of the companies in eastern markets were mainly allocated to inventories  accounts receivable  and cash and cash equivalents. In addition  an impairment loss was recognized on goodwill  determined in based on the ratio between the fair values of the divested companies and the segment.Restricted cash and cash equivalentsIn Russia  Aspo Group has EUR 13.5 million in cash and cash equivalents  the use of which is strictly restricted by the Russian Government and controlled by banks. The value of these cash and cash equivalents in the Group is EUR 11.5 million  as an impairment loss of EUR 2.0 million was recognized on the cash and cash equivalents in conjunction with the IFRS 5 classification of the companies in Russia. Cash and cash equivalents in Russia are presented under assets held for sale on the balance sheet. It was still possible to pay dividends and make commercial payments during the fourth quarter of 2022. According to our understanding  the purchase prices of the operations held for sale in eastern markets can be transferred in conjunction with their sale. However  there is a risk that the Group does not have access to the cash and cash equivalents in full in Russia  which is why they must be considered restricted cash and cash equivalents in accordance with IAS 7.Events after the review periodOn January 17  2023  Leipurin signed a binding preliminary agreement to sell all shares in its subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan to Timur Akhiyarov. Russian-born Akhiyarov will invest in Leipurin’s operations in eastern markets as a private investor. The sales price is approximately EUR 8.4 million. Rights to Leipurin’s name and trademarks are not included in the transaction. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities.The Belarusian subsidiaries of Telko and Leipurin have been added to the list of companies whose transfer of shares are prohibited by a decision issued by the Council of Ministers of Belarus at the end of January 2023. Because of this  it is deemed unlikely that the sale of Telko's Belarusian business would proceed. This does not change Aspo Group's previously published assessment of the financial effects of the divestment. Leipurin’s Belarusian subsidiary is part of an agreement according to which the share capitals of Leipurin’s subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan would be sold to the same buyer. The decision of the Council of Ministers of Belarus does not change the previously published assessment of the financial effects of the transaction  nor does it prevent the sale of Leipurin’s Russian and Kazakh subsidiaries.On January 31  Telko acquired a Polish distribution company Eltrex. Eltrex is a distributor of specialty chemicals and industrial packaging materials  and its annual net sales are approximately 8 million euros and operating profit slightly under one million euros.On February 9  2023  Leipurin completed a sale and lease back agreement for its warehouse property in Gothenburg  Sweden. The property came into Leipurin’s ownership via the Kobia acquisition that took place on 1 September 2022. The buyer of the property is Revelop  a Swedish real estate investor. As a result of the sale and lease back transaction  Aspo recognizes a sales gain of approximately EUR 0.4 million. According to the terms of the agreement  Leipurin leases the property for five years. The transaction is close to cost neutral  as the depreciation expense of the assets owned will be replaced by depreciation and interest expense for the leased assets of similar size.Helsinki  February 15  2023Aspo PlcBoard of DirectorsPress and analyst conferenceA press  analyst and investor conference will be held at FLIK’s Eliel studio in Sanomatalo  Töölönlahdenkatu 2  00100 Helsinki on February 15  2023 at 2 p.m. The event is also open to private investors  and participants are requested to register beforehand by emailing johanna.ahtiainen@aspo.com.The financial statement release will be presented by CEO Rolf Jansson.

Therefore  a maximum of EUR 0.46 (0.45) would be distributed in dividends for the 2022 financial year.More information about the proposed dividend distribution is available under section “Dividend proposal”.Key figures 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Net sales  Group total  MEUR 164.6 163.2 652.6 586.4 Net sales from continuing operations  MEUR 163.8 160.0 643.4 573.3 ESL Shipping  operating profit  MEUR 10.2 9.8 38.1 26.8 Telko  operating profit  MEUR -7.7 4.4 7.3 20.4 Leipurin  operating profit  MEUR -4.3 -3.6 -4.8 -2.4 Other operations  operating profit  MEUR -1.9 -1.9 -6.7 -7.9 Operating profit from continuing operations  MEUR -3.7 8.7 33.9 36.9 Operating profit from continuing operations  % -2.3 5.4 5.3 6.4 Operating profit from discontinued operations  MEUR -1.1 0.1 -2.7 -3.0 Operating profit  Group total  MEUR -4.8 8.8 31.2 33.9 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -16.1 -5.1 -24.1 -8.5 Comparable operating profit  Group total  MEUR 11.3 13.9 55.3 42.4 Comparable operating profit  Group total  % 6.9 8.5 8.5 7.2 Profit before taxes from continuing operations  MEUR -3.0 7.7 27.6 33.0 Profit for the period  MEUR -5.4 5.7 20.7 25.3 Profit from continuing operations  MEUR -4.3 5.6 23.5 28.3 Profit from discontinued operations  MEUR -1.1 0.1 -2.8 -3.0 Earnings per share (EPS)  EUR -0.21 0.17 0.61 0.76 EPS from continuing operations  EUR -0.17 0.17 0.70 0.86 EPS from discontinued operations  EUR -0.04 0.00 -0.09 -0.10 Net cash from operating activities  MEUR 22.0 10.7 67.7 44.0 Free cash flow  MEUR 16.5 4.1 34.4 27.5 Return on equity (ROE)  % 15.2 20.8 Equity ratio  % 34.7 32.0 Gearing  % 108.4 131.0 Equity per share  EUR 4.58 4.14Rolf Jansson  CEO of Aspo Group  comments on the fourth quarter and the whole year 2022:In the light of financial figures  2022 was a success and in many ways record-breaking. Aspo Group’s net sales increased to EUR 652.6 million  up by roughly 11% from the previous year. The comparable operating profit for 2022 increased to a record EUR 55.3 million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 8.5%. Both the increase in net sales and our comparable operating profit exceeded the financial targets set for the Group. Aspo’s net sales in October–December stood at EUR 164.6 million  and the comparable operating profit was EUR 11.3 million. ESL Shipping especially supported the positive development of net sales and operating profit  with its record-breaking fourth quarter crowning its overall excellent year. The strong growth of Leipurin’s net sales during the fourth quarter was supported not only by high inflation rates  but also by the acquisition of the Swedish company Kobia AB at the beginning of September. Telko’s comparable operating profit in October–December was below the normal level which was due to the direct and reflected effects of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Eastern trade. Apart from the eastern markets  Telko’s net sales developed positively. The year 2022 turned out to be highly different from what we still assumed at the beginning of the year. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dramatically changed the lives of many of our employees  and our entire operating environment changed drastically. Already in spring  we decided to withdraw from all our operations in Russia and from other selected eastern markets. The prerequisites for responsible business had vanished  and it became clear that we would set our sights even more firmly on western markets in accordance with our strategy updated at the end of 2021. We will continue to operate in Ukraine  and we want to support its development and do our part to help rebuild the country. In summer  we divested Leipurin’s machinery business Vulganus  and at the end of October  the divestment of Kauko was finalized. At the same time  we focused on developing our key businesses through acquisitions according to our compounder strategy  of which the acquisition of Kobia by Leipurin and Telko’s recent acquisitions were the most significant. During the year  we also made strategic investments  the most important of which was ESL Shipping’s decision to invest in new Green Coaster vessels using a pooling arrangement. We are heading to 2023 from a good position  and we will continue the determined implementation of our strategy. I believe that we can generate strong cash flow even in this challenging market environment and  in accordance with our financial guidance  we expect Aspo’s comparable operating profit to be EUR 30–40 million in 2023. We continue to boost organic growth through strategic acquisitions. Thanks for Aspo’s excellent results in 2022 go to our entire personnel. I am particularly pleased and grateful for the dedication our personnel showed in supporting our colleagues in areas ravaged by the war and in ensuring their safety.ASPO GROUP Financial results and targets Aspo’s financial targets announced on December 1  2021: Annual increase in net sales: 5–10% a yearOperating profit: 8%Return on equity: more than 20%Gearing: less than 130% With regard to Aspo’s businesses  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%. In 2022  the Group’s targets were reached well overall. Aspo Group’s operating profit increased by 11%. The comparable operating profit rate was 8.5% (7.2%)  clearly exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Return on equity remained at the level of 15.2% (20.8%) due to the items affecting comparability of EUR -24.1 million that mainly consisted of additional costs and impairment losses arising from Russia’s invasion in Ukraine  and whose negative impact on return on equity was roughly 15.6 percentage points. Aspo’s gearing decreased to 108.4% (131.0%)  well below the target level. Aspo Group’s comparable result for continuing and discontinued operations Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit is calculated by adjusting the reported operating profit with rare and material items affecting the operating profit. These include impairment losses  sales gains from vessels  and financial losses caused by Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. In December 2021  Aspo announced that Kauko operating segment was defined not being part of Aspo’s core operations  and Kauko was classified as a discontinued operation. On October 31  2022  Kauko was divested outside the Group  and its accumulated earnings until that date and the divestment loss are presented in the profit from discontinued operations  separate from the results of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. However  Kauko’s results are included in Aspo Group’s total figures and comparable operating profit. Telko’s companies in Russia and Belarus  and Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan are classified as held for sale in the 2022 financial statements (eastern businesses held for sale below). The results of the eastern businesses held for sale are reported as part of Telko and Leipurin  as well as Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The assets and liabilities of the eastern businesses held for sale are presented on the balance sheet separately as assets and liabilities held for sale. When the eastern businesses were classified as held for sale  they were measured at fair value less cost to sell  resulting in the recognition of impairment losses totaling EUR 14.5 million in the fourth quarter  reported as items affecting comparability. On divestment  the recognition of the translation differences of the eastern businesses as part of sales losses as well as a possible change the fair value of the eastern businesses compared with the estimates made in the financial statements will also have a negative impact on the operating profit. On the closing date  the amount of the translation differences of the eastern businesses held for sale was EUR -11.8 million. The amount fluctuates according to changes in exchange rates until the date of sale. The reclassification of the translation differences from the translation difference reserve to the result for the period has no impact on Aspo Group’s total equity.

Items affecting comparability relating to the Kauko segment totaled EUR -2.5 million  and they are reported in the profit from discontinued operations. Other items affecting comparability totaled EUR -0.9 million. Of the items affecting comparability during the fourth quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -16.1 million  EUR -14.3 million were related to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and its consequences. Of the items  EUR -0.4 million were recognized for the ESL Shipping segment  EUR -9.0 for Telko  and EUR -5.0 million for Leipurin. Items affecting comparability relating to reorganizations were EUR -0.4 million in the Leipurin segment and EUR -0.1 million in other operations. In addition  Kauko’s sales loss of EUR -1.2 million is included in the items affecting comparability and reported as part of the results of discontinued operations. Items affecting the comparability in 2021  totaling EUR -8.5 million  included the impairment loss of EUR -4.3 million recognized on Leipurin’s goodwill during the final quarter  and the impairment loss and restoration provision of EUR -0.8 million recognized on the fixed assets of Telko’s terminal in Rauma  as well as the impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter  which is reported as part of the results of discontinued operations.Sustainability Sustainability is a material factor which guides Aspo’s management system and especially the company’s investments. Aspo’s businesses aim to be pioneers in sustainability in their respective sectors. To support the sustainability commitments  Aspo published new environmental  social and corporate governance (ESG) goals for the Group and its businesses in December 2021. The key goal is to reduce emission intensity  CO2e (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) is 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. According to the green transition in the shipping industry  ESL Shipping is engaged in close and long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide fossil-free sea transportation for its key customers in the future. ESL Shipping invests in twelve new generation electric hybrid vessels  half of which will remain in its own ownership and half will be transferred to the other party of the pooling arrangement. The investment is significant in terms of monetary value  but above all  it helps the shipping company move towards its emissions target. During the past 12 months  emission intensity improved further to 0.33 (0.42)  driven by the increase in net sales and operational efficiency. Another key goal was a higher level of safety  with the Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) being 8.1 (8.8) during the past 12 months. Even though TRIF improved from the previous year  we did not reach the target of 7.0 set for 2022. Aspo regularly assesses the satisfaction of employees with their own tasks  the quality of management  and Aspo as an employer by conducting an annual atmosphere survey. In 2021  Aspo started to use the People Power index  a new method of measuring job satisfaction  and it was also included in the Group’s sustainability goals. The operating environment remained fairly challenging in all businesses  and job satisfaction decreased slightly  while still being high: the Group achieved the rating of AA in 2022 (2021: AA+). However  the targeted level of AA+ was not achieved unlike in 2021. Aspo’s internal Compliance and Code of Conduct training includes anti-corruption issues and provides guidance for identifying any suspicious situations and practices considered unethical. Aspo’s goal is that all of the Group’s personnel complete the training every year. In 2022  approximately 100% (89%) of the Group’s employees completed Code of Conduct training and roughly 100% (88%) completed Compliance training.Operating environment and the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo’s operations Aspo’s operating environment changed dramatically during 2022 due to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. The invasion has caused considerable general uncertainties in markets  higher interest rates  lower trust among consumers  price inflation  higher energy prices in particular  as well as significant volatility in prices and exchange rates. Significantly suspended business operations in Ukraine due to the war have caused financial losses. The considerable damage to the energy distribution infrastructure in Ukraine made the situation even worse during the second half of 2022. The war drastically reduces operating conditions in eastern markets as a result of operational challenges and regulations  and selected values in particular. Aspo’s decision to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets  combined with the sanctions related to the war  has also reshaped Aspo’s logistics flows and operating models. ESL Shipping’s all operations have been suspended in Russia  and the released vessel capacity has been transferred to other operating areas. Telko has signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. At the end of 2022  Telko also signed a binding preliminary agreement on the sale of its subsidiary in Belarus to a member of its current management. A binding preliminary agreement was also signed with Timur Akhiyarov  a Russian-born private investor  after the end of the financial year on the sale of Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. Leipurin’s net sales in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan stood at EUR 24.7 million in 2022  comprising 19% of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2022 and less than 4% of Aspo Group’s net sales. Telko’s net sales in Russia and Belarus stood at EUR 58.0 million in 2022  comprising 22% of Telko’s total net sales in 2022 and less than 9% of Aspo Group’s net sales. The consolidated net sales of Telko and Leipurin in these countries accounted for roughly 13% of Aspo Group’s net sales in 2022 (16% of net sales in 2021). The international sanctions and Russia’s legislative measures prevent the transportation of goods and the transfer of payments which has reduced the net sales and profitability of the operations in Russia. In addition  decreases in the companies’ operations and personnel have reduced Russia’s role in Aspo’s business operations. The operating environment is expected to become even more challenging  and no rapid solution is in sight. The equity of the group companies in Russia is EUR 20.5 (16.6) million  comprising 14.3% (12.8%) of Aspo Group’s total equity. In Aspo Group  EUR 12.2 million in impairment losses associated with the equity of Russian companies have been recognized in the financial statements. Aspo’s assets in Russia mainly consist of cash and cash equivalents  inventories and accounts receivable. The number of employees in Aspo Group’s companies in Russia is decreasing  being 105 (193) at the end of the year. Rising interest and inflation rates  as well as weaker general economic estimates  have affected consumers’ purchasing behavior  for example  so that consumers have shifted from more expensive to more affordable products. While the coronavirus pandemic has been overshadowed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the news  it still has an impact on Aspo’s operating environment. For example  the global shortage of components  caused by the pandemic  has an impact on certain Aspo’s businesses  decelerating sales and the completion of orders. The markets are also characterized by disruptions in logistics flows and the low availability of certain products. The risk of infections must still be taken into account in daily operations especially among ESL Shipping’s crew members.

The eastern markets’ share of total net sales continued to decrease during the fourth quarter of 2022  mainly due to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and decisions to downsize operations in Russia and withdraw from the market as planned. As a result of the withdrawal from Russia  the division of Aspo’s main market areas will change at the beginning of 2023. According to the previously announced strategy  the company will direct its growth investments at western markets  and the eastern markets’ share of Aspo’s total net sales already decreased to 13.2% in the fourth quarter.Cash flow and financing The Group’s net cash flow from operating activities in January–December was EUR 67.7 (44.0) million. The cash flow of all businesses showed positive development during the year. The impact of the change in working capital on cash flow during the review period was EUR -6.7 (-22.0) million. The increase in working capital mainly comes from the advance payments for the vessels to be built in the ESL Shipping segment’s vessel pool and the customer receivables accumulated through high sales at the end of the year. This was partly compensated by the Telko segment’s working capital  which improved towards the year end. The free cash flow in January–December was EUR 34.4 (27.5) million. The amount of investments of EUR -17.8 (-15.9) million mainly included the ESL Shipping segment’s dockages and Green Coaster advance payments. In addition  the cash flow from investing activities includes EUR -17.9 million cash outflow on the acquisitions of Kobia  Mentum and Johan Steenks and a total of EUR 2.8 million in cash inflow from the sale of Espa and Vulganus as the most significant items.12/2022 12/2021 MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities  incl. lease liabilities 189.2 187.3 Cash and cash equivalents 33.5 17.7 Net interest-bearing debt 155.7 169.6 Net interest-bearing debt decreased to EUR 155.7 (169.6) million and gearing fell to 108.4% (131.0%). The Group’s equity ratio at the end of the review period was 34.7% (32.0%). The balance sheet strengthened as a result of improved profitability and the new hybrid instrument issued in June. Net financial expenses in January–December totaled EUR -6.3 (-3.9) million. Exchange rate changes  especially the strengthened value of the Russian ruble  increased financial expenses by EUR 1.6 million from the previous year. The average interest rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  was 3.3% (1.4%). The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents stood at EUR 33.5 (17.7) at the end of the review period  of which cash and cash equivalents related to businesses held for sale were EUR 11.8 million. Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program also remained wholly unused (5). During 2022  Aspo extended its maturity structure for interest-bearing loans. In September  AtoBatC AB signed an EUR 32.2 million loan agreement with Svenska Skeppshypotek. The loan’s maturity is 15 years  and it has not yet been withdrawn. The loan  together with the ten-year loan agreement of EUR 20 million singed in June with the Nordic Investment Bank  of which EUR 19.6 million have been withdrawn  finances ESL Shipping’s investment in a series of six new highly energy-efficient electric hybrid vessels. The project was launched in September 2021. In addition  Aspo restructured a bilateral bank loan of EUR 20 million  about to mature in 2023  with a new bilateral revolving credit facility which will mature in 2025. The loan agreement also includes two options for a one-year extension. In June  Aspo issued a new EUR 30 million hybrid instrument  with a coupon rate of 8.75% per annum. The hybrid instrument has no maturity  but the company may exercise an early redemption option in June 2025 at the earliest. Aspo’s earlier hybrid instrument of EUR 20 million was redeemed on May 2  2022.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operations Aspo and its subsidiaries are exposed to various risks and uncertainties  which are mainly identified and managed in Aspo's businesses. The most important risks and preparedness for them are summarized and reported to Aspo's Board of Directors through Aspo's Audit Committee. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine causes significant geopolitical uncertainties. It affects the general economic environment  including inflation  energy and raw material prices  interest rates  and consumers’ trust. The ongoing process to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets will change the Group’s structure significantly and will affect the revenue model of Aspo’s businesses in the long term. There are risks that the withdrawal from the selected markets causes additional costs or losses  and that funds cannot be transferred from the markets or that the withdrawal is unsuccessful in full or in part. It is also possible that the official approvals required for the withdrawal from the markets are not obtained for example due to changes is legislation or that they are at risk or fail for some other reason. Financial activities and the prevailing geopolitical uncertainties have caused the prices of many raw materials  components and logistics services to rise rapidly. While Aspo may benefit from the price increases temporarily  the prices of raw materials or rental capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Disruptions in logistics flows  longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes are also increasing risks. The rapid increase in inflation has generally caused pressure for salary increases  which in Finland can lead to labor disputes  which can also negatively affect Aspo's businesses. International sanctions and countersanctions have been imposed  which may also affect Aspo’s businesses directly or indirectly. The geopolitical tensions may escalate and cause a direct adverse impact on business operations  put payments at risk and even suspend business operations. If escalated  cyber incidents and disruptions in information systems may cause damage to business operations. In line with its renewed strategy  Aspo aims to increase its steady profit-making ability through acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial resources and consequently may reduce solvency. With its strategy  Aspo aims to reduce the impact of the possibly weakening general economic development on Aspo’s profit-making ability. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Aspo’s operations has been limited at the group level  even though it has been significant in the Leipurin segment. The current and any new coronavirus variants and their rapid spread may suspend business operations and cause financial losses through stoppages in global logistics chains  among other factors. Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation and knowledge  they involve significant risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO’S BUSINESS OPERATIONS ESL Shipping ESL Shipping is the leading dry bulk sea transport company operating in the Baltic Sea area. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 41 vessels with a total capacity of 425 000 deadweight tonnage (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (80% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 16 vessels (18%) were time chartered. ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service. 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 63.3 54.7 16 245.4 191.4 28 Operating profit  MEUR 10.2 9.8 4 38.1 26.8 42 Operating profit  % 16.1 17.9 15.5 14.0 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -0.4 0.7 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 10.6 9.8 8 37.4 26.8 40 Comparable operating profit  % 16.7 17.9 15.2 14.0 The fourth quarter of 2022 marked the best quarter in ESL Shipping’s history measured by the operating profit. Net sales increased by 16% from the previous year to EUR 63.3 (54.7) million. The comparable operating profit for the quarter increased by 8% to record-breaking EUR 10.6 (9.8) million. The operating profit of EUR 10.2 (9.8) million includes EUR -0.4 million in expenses associated with suspended operations in Russia. High demand in the shipping company’s main market areas  the shipping company’s long-term partnership strategy and the successful operations of the onshore and offshore personnel enabled the excellent results. Weather conditions were also favorable for operations. The comparable operating profit rate of 16.7% (17.9%) achieved during the fourth quarter was once again excellent. During the quarter  the prices of diesel and liquefied natural gas (LNG) used as ship fuels decreased from the previous quarter  while remaining roughly twice as high as in the comparative period. The high level of fuel surcharges increased net sales and reduced the operating profit rate  which is used as an indicator of relative profitability. During the fourth quarter  cargo volumes transported by ESL Shipping decreased slightly from the comparative period to 3.8 (3.9) million tons. The volume development was based on the transfer of raw material deliveries away from Russia which has extended transportation distances especially for energy coal. The final quarter is also normally the busiest season for energy transportation  but as a result of the exceptional situation involving the security of supply  the low availability of biofuels and longer transportation distances  the percentage of energy coal from all transportation operations tripled during the fourth quarter from the comparative period. The profitability of all the shipping company’s vessel categories was excellent during the fourth quarter. In fourth quarter  production plants of several contractual customers underwent relatively large maintenance stoppages and restricted production due to lower demand and high energy costs. High demand experienced in the energy industry enabled the vessels to continue to operate at full capacity during the fourth quarter. The spot cargo market decreased in all customer segments and vessel categories during the quarter. After operations in Russia were suspended  demand for ESL Shipping’s loading and unloading operations for vessels at sea shifted to the southern Baltic Sea where it was maintained by the high demand for energy coal transportation during the fourth quarter and congestion at ports suitable for large ocean liners. Six time-chartered vessels of the smaller vessel category were redelivered to their owners as the charter agreements ended at the end of the fourth quarter and as the price of an extended charter period became too high. The newbuilding project of ESL Shipping’s Swedish subsidiary AtoBatC Shipping AB    at the Chowgule & Company Private Limited shipyard in India proceeded as planned during the fourth quarter. Every other vessel in the series of 12 next-generation electric hybrid vessels will be sold  as announced earlier  to the company established by the pooling investor group. The first four new vessels are already under construction  and the first vessel is to be delivered during fall 2023. One larger vessel was docked for seven days during the fourth quarter and one smaller vessel was out of service for 26 days. In 2022  dockage days totaled 141 (229). The net sales of ESL Shipping in January–December increased from the comparative period by 28% to EUR 245.4 (191.4) million. The comparable operating profit was the highest in the company’s history at EUR 37.4 (26.8) million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 15.2% (14.0%). The operating profit rate clearly exceeded the long-term target of 14%. Comparability was affected by the gain from the sale of the barge Espa and costs associated with the suspended operations in Russia. Their impact on net results was EUR 0.7 million and  as a result  ESL Shipping’s operating profit amounted to EUR 38.1 (26.8) million and its operating profit rate was 15.5% (14.0%) for 2022 as a whole. The shipping company’s long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The aim is to halve carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. During 2022  ESL Shipping transported 14.7 (14.8) million tons of cargo  and its vessels consumed 819 988 (898 158) MWh of energy. CO2 emissions per transported ton decreased by 7.5% to 0.015 (0.016) tons of carbon dioxide per ton of cargo. The new energy-efficient operating models applied to port visits supported the positive development.ESL Shipping outlook for 2023 General macroeconomic uncertainties have increased in ESL Shipping’s main market areas. Higher inflation and slower economic growth increase demand and pricing pressure among the shipping company’s main customers. Finland’s labor market may experience unrest during the spring  and its impact through overtime bans and strikes may be significant on key customers and especially on the effectiveness of the transport chain. Global demand estimates in sea transportation markets and price levels of spot markets have decreased considerably from the previous year. On the other hand  the availability of vessel capacity suitable for round-the-year operations in the Baltic Sea is limited. Production volumes of ESL Shipping’s main customers is expected to be satisfactory  albeit slightly lower than in the previous year. Demand for energy deliveries outside Finland is expected to remain high during the first half of the year. In the forest industry  pulp delivery volumes are looking positive  but only satisfactory for sawn goods. Volumes are looking satisfactory in the steel industry. Now that deliveries of Russian raw materials have stopped  certain of the shipping company’s significant contractual customers are forced to seek new suppliers for part of their production input required in new geographic areas. Not all of these procurement routes have yet become stabilized which may cause an imbalance in ESL Shipping’s operations. The role of energy coal transportation is expected to decrease significantly when the preparation situation returns to normal and demand shifts towards other energy forms. The majority of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements with the exception of the Supramax vessels. Currently  the expectations of the lessors of the time-chartered vessels do not meet the realities in the shipping company’s main market areas which may cause further uncertainties in the availability of a suitable and sufficient tonnage. The impact of rising energy prices on ESL Shipping’s costs is compensated effectively through fuel clauses in long-term transportation agreements. Surveys show that ESL Shipping’s customer satisfaction is at an excellent level  similarly to the personnel’s commitment and job satisfaction. Activities to further improve customer and employee satisfaction  sustainability and occupational safety will continue. The shipping company’s investments in energy-efficient vessels will strengthen its competitiveness and market position in the future. ESL Shipping will continue the development of a fossil-free sea transportation ecosystem in line with the green transition and the vessels designed for it in cooperation with its key customers. The shipping company is participating in projects aimed to produce green hydrogen through renewable electricity and to further process it as fossil-free fuel for the shipping company’s vessels. During 2023  four larger and two smaller vessels will be docked for a total of approximately 100 days.Telko Telko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together. Its competitive edge is based on strong technical support  efficient logistics and local expert service. Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Russia  Belarus  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China. In October 2022  Telko signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. In December  Telko finalized the preliminary agreement to divest its subsidiary in Belarus  to a member of its current management. Both business transactions still need to be approved by the local authorities.

Telko’s net sales for the fourth quarter decreased after sales in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine dropped substantially from the previous year. Telko’s net sales outside Russia  Belarus and Ukraine increased. Demand remained stable in Telko’s all business operations. The comparable operating profit for the fourth quarter stood at EUR 1.3 (5.2) million  and the operating profit rate was 2.2% (7.1%). Net sales and operating profit decreased from the previous year  especially due to weak development and negative results in Russia. Telko’s result for the fourth quarter includes items affecting comparability  which reduced Telko’s operating profit by EUR 9.0 million in total. Impairment losses regarding companies in Russia and Belarus of EUR 9.3 million and other expenses of EUR 0.2 million were recognized relating to the withdrawal from Russia. In addition  the credit loss provision recognized from accounts receivable in Ukraine was reversed by EUR 0.5 million. The combined comparable operating profit of the above countries was slightly negative during the fourth quarter. Telko’s operating profit for the fourth quarter was EUR -7.7 (4.4) million. The operating profit rate was -13.0% (6.0%). Impairment losses associated with inventories  exchange rate losses  and costs related to corporate restructuring also had a negative impact on the operating profit. The net sales of the plastics business decreased by 25% during the fourth quarter to EUR 29.6 (39.7) million  mainly due to the decrease in Telko’s operations in Russia. In Telko’s European markets  demand for plastic polymers remained at a normal level in general. Sales outside Russia  Belarus and Ukraine increased slightly  regardless of the downward trend in prices. While the steep decline in the prices of volume plastics turned to an increase during the fourth quarter  the prices are still lower than during the corresponding period in the previous year. The prices of technical plastics decreased slightly during the fourth quarter but were clearly above the comparative period’s level. The acquisition of the operations of Johan Steenks  a Norwegian distributor of technical plastic raw materials and plastics  increased the net sales of the plastics business during the fourth quarter  while it had no significant impact on results. During the fourth quarter  the net sales of the chemicals business decreased by 32% to EUR 15.9 (23.4) million. Sales decreased steeply in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. The weak development especially in Ukraine resulted from the disruptions in the electricity distribution infrastructure due to the war which directly limited production. Total sales in other countries increased significantly  regardless of the decrease in prices. Prices started to increase during the fourth quarter. Telko’s chemicals business is divided between several customer groups which evens out any fluctuations in demand. During the fourth quarter  the net sales of the lubricants business increased by 31% to EUR 13.7 (10.5) million. Sales increased in all key product groups. The increase in sales resulted from high price levels  the acquisition of Mentum AS at the end of 2021  and very positively developed sales of industrial lubricants. Prices of lubricants increased slightly during the fourth quarter. Russia’s invasion in Ukraine did not have any direct impact on the lubricants business. Telko’s net sales in January–December decreased by 1% to EUR 267.4 (268.8) million. The full-year comparable operating profit of EUR 20.8 million was only slightly lower than the previous year’s record-high comparable operating profit (21.2). The comparable operating profit rate remained high at 7.8% (7.9%). Exchange rate losses of EUR 2.5 million reduced the operating profit. Telko’s full-year operating profit fell by 64% to EUR 7.3 (20.4) million. The operating profit rate was 2.7% (7.6%). Results decreased due to the warehouse destroyed in Ukraine  the impairment losses associated with companies in Russia and Belarus  and other costs arising from the withdrawal from Russia  which totaled EUR -13.5 million and have been reported as items affecting comparability.Telko outlook for 2023 As announced previously  Telko has agreed to divest its operations in Russia and Belarus. Telko’s net sales in Russia and Belarus were EUR 58.0 million in 2022  comprising 22% of Telko’s total net sales in 2022. Both sales transactions require approval by the local authorities. Telko expects the Russian transaction to be completed during the first quarter of 2023 but there is uncertainty involved. In 2023  Telko’s net sales and profit will be significantly lower than in the previous year due to the changed situation in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. In other countries  demand is expected to remain moderate  even though there will be differences between businesses. The prices of plastics and chemicals decreased steeply during the latter half of 2022  while still being clearly above the long-term average. It is assumed that the most significant price corrections took place during 2022  but the prices are expected to decrease slightly during the first half if energy prices do not experience a considerable increase. In high added value products  on which Telko focuses in accordance with its strategy  price changes are typically more moderate. Significant changes in prices have a short-term impact on margins. Demand for lubricants is expected to remain stable  and prices are expected to increase at least during the first half of 2023. In western markets  demand will involve uncertainties during the next few months. Demand indices have decreased in the construction and automotive industries in Europe. High energy prices and inflation rates will affect demand during the next few months  in particular. At the end of the year  demand will  above all  be affected by the general development of purchasing power in Europe. The lifting of coronavirus restrictions in China is expected to increase local demand. In addition  higher demand in China may have an impact on global price development during the first part of the year. In Central Asia  demand is expected to remain relatively high. Sales in Ukraine will be lower during the first half than in the previous year  while they are expected to be at the 2022 level during the rest of the year  depending completely on the development of the war. Telko will continue its activities to improve its operational efficiency and scalability. Inflation causes general increases in costs. On the other hand  cargo expenses  especially in Asia  will be materially lower than in the previous year. The recent structural arrangements continued when Telko announced on January 31  2023  that it will acquire Eltrex  a Polish company specialized in the distribution of chemicals. According to its strategy  Telko continues to accelerate its growth through acquisitions in addition to organic growth.Leipurin Leipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies  and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. Leipurin operates in nine countries that have been grouped into four business units  each being responsible for their financial performance: Finland  Sweden  Baltics  and East. Leipurin serves bakery  food industry and foodservice customers by providing raw materials and by supporting research and development and recipes for new products. The Leipurin segment’s other product categories include various supplies and machines for the same customer segments. The Leipurin segment uses leading international manufacturers as its raw material and machinery supply partners. On April 22  2022  Aspo announced that Leipurin will withdraw from its operations in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. In January 2023  Leipurin signed a binding preliminary agreement to sell its subsidiaries in these countries to a private investor. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities. Assets and liabilities related to these companies have been classified as assets and liabilities held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 standard at the end of the review period. 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 41.3 31.7 30 130.6 113.1 15 Operating profit  MEUR -4.3 -3.6 19 -4.8 -2.4 100 Operating profit  % -10.4 -11.4 -3.7 -2.1 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -5.4 -4.3 -8.1 -4.3 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.1 0.7 57 3.3 1.9 74 Comparable operating profit  % 2.7 2.2 2.5 1.7 Comparable operating profit excl.

Vulganus  % 2.7 2.3 3.2 2.2Leipurin’s operations were still affected by the restrictions in eastern markets due to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine  the high price inflation in global raw material markets  and challenges related to the availability of raw materials. Leipurin’s total net sales increased by 30% during the fourth quarter to EUR 41.3 (31.7) million. Figures for the comparative year included EUR 2.7 million in net sales of the discontinued machinery business in Russia and divested Vulganus Oy. The Finland business unit’s net sales increased by 8% to EUR 12.2 (11.3) million. In the Baltics  net sales increased by 18% to EUR 10.0 (8.5) million. Net sales of the East business unit decreased by 32% to EUR 6.2 (9.1) million due to the reduced product range  consisting only of local procurement. The decrease in the net sales of the East business unit was also significantly affected by the decrease in operations in Ukraine down to roughly 9% from the comparative year’s level. Sweden was established as a new business unit as a result of the acquisition of Kobia AB on September 1  and it accounted for EUR 12.9 million and approximately 31% of Leipurin’s net sales in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter  sales to bakeries increased by 41% to EUR 28.6 (20.3) million. Sales to the food industry increased by 35% to EUR 4.2 (3.1) million. The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets continued to have a significant impact on Leipurin’s sales during the fourth quarter. Measured in kilograms  the decrease in sales intensified in Finland  Sweden and the Baltics  whereas sales continued to be roughly half of the previous year’s level in the East business unit. The weak volume development is mainly driven by the decrease in consumers’ trust in the current market situation  in which energy costs and interest rates are especially rising steeply. The significant increase in living expenses continued in Finland  Sweden and the Baltics which reduced the inflation-adjusted sales volume of retail and strengthened the shift in consumers’ demand towards more affordable products. The positive development of profit margins continued  regardless of the negative trends in volumes. The comparable operating profit for the fourth quarter stood at EUR 1.1 (0.7) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.7% (2.2%). Leipurin’s comparable operating profit  excluding Vulganus  was EUR 1.1 (0.7) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.7% (2.3%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR -5.4 (-4.3) million  included costs and impairment losses arising from the withdrawal from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan  and costs associated with the reorganization of Leipurin’s group operations. The comparability of the comparative period was affected by animpairment loss recognized on goodwill. Leipurin’s operating loss for the fourth quarter was EUR -4.3 (-3.6) million. Reversal of a fair value allocation of inventories amounting to EUR -0.5 million which arised from the acquisition of Kobia  had a negative impact on the operating profit. In January–December  Leipurin’s net sales increased by 15% to EUR 130.6 (113.1) million. Figures for the comparative year included EUR 11.4 million in net sales of the discontinued machinery business in Russia and divested Vulganus Oy  which were EUR 7.1 million higher than in 2022  but the increase in raw material sales in western markets was particularly strong during the review period compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets had a significant impact on the euro-denominated increase in sales. Leipurin’s comparable operating profit in January–December 2022 was EUR 3.3 (1.9) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.5% (1.7%). Leipurin’s comparable operating profit  excluding Vulganus  was EUR 4.1 (2.4) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 3.2% (2.2%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR -8.1 (-4.3) million  were mainly related to the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine  the acquisition of Kobia  and the divestment of Vulganus. The reported operating profit was negative at EUR -4.8 (-2.4) million. Kobia’s impact on Leipurin’s operating profit was still negative due to the reversal of the EUR 0.5 million fair value allocation of inventories related to the acquisition. Vulganus was divested on June 30  2022. The loss arising from the divestment and the expenses related to it  totaling EUR -0.4 million  are reported under the Leipurin segment’s other operating expenses. Leipurin acquired all shares in Kobia AB  a Swedish distributor in the bakery industry  from the Swedish Abdon Group. Kobia AB comprises Leipurin’s new Sweden business unit  and it has been included in Aspo Group’s figures since September 1  2022. Kobia’s annual net sales are approximately EUR 50 million  and its operating profit rate is roughly 3%. The acquisition strengthens Leipurin’s position as the leading company in the Baltic Sea region.Leipurin outlook for 2023 The war in Ukraine and the decision to withdraw operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan will have a significant impact on Leipurin’s net sales and results. Leipurin’s net sales in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan were EUR 24.7 million in 2022  comprising 19% of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2022. The divestment of the operations in the eastern markets still needs to be approved by the local authorities. Leipurin expects the transaction to be completed during the first half of 2023 but there is uncertainty involved. The expansion to Sweden through the acquisition of Kobia AB will increase Leipurin’s annual net sales by roughly EUR 50 million and produce considerable synergy benefits in the development of the product range  and in the supply chain and procurement. It also enables partners to be served in a larger geographic area. The integration of operations has progressed according to plans. Inflation and the rising energy prices  in particular  have a negative impact on demand for more expensive products  potentially presenting profitability challenges among the bakery segment’s customers. The decreased purchasing power may have a negative impact on demand for artisanal bakeries  as consumers prefer more affordable products. The upward trend is expected to continue in the prices of main raw material categories  even though the rapid inflation during the review period is expected to decelerate considerably. This is expected to take place during the first half of 2023. Despite these challenges  Leipurin sees that the market will offer a highly stable environment in the long term and also opportunities for organic growth in selected market segments. In addition  the profitability program that was launched earlier develops the organization's ability to lead with information and helps to improve financial performance in particular. The program focuses both on selected growth clusters and on improving the efficiency of operations. This program is expected to contribute to improving Leipurin’s financial development. The impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic on the global supply chains  the availability of certain raw materials and general delivery times will continue. The management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges will increase risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers.Other operations Other operations include Aspo Group’s administration  finance and ICT service center. The comparable operating profit of other operations was EUR -1.8 (-1.9) million during the fourth quarter. The reported operating profit of EUR -1.9 (-1.9) million includes EUR -0.1 million in restructuring expenses affecting comparability. The comparable operating profit for 2022 was EUR -6.0 (-7.9) million. The reported operating profit was EUR -6.7 (-7.9) million  including EUR -0.7 million in items affecting comparability that are mainly related to the additional share-based remuneration granted to Aspo’s previous CEO and restructuring expenses.COMPANY INFORMATION Aspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

The new vessels of ice class 1A will be top of the line in terms of their cargo capacity  technology and innovation. The total value of the six-vessel investment is approximately EUR 70 million  and its cash flows will be divided mainly for the years 2023 and 2024. The new vessels will be built at the Chowgule and Company Private Limited shipyard in India  and first of them will start operating in the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2022  it was confirmed that ESL Shipping will establish a Green Coaster pool. As a result  AtoBatC Shipping AB declared its option and ordered five additional vessels from the Chowgule & Company Private Limited  from which AtoBatC has previously ordered seven identical electric hybrid vessels. Every other vessel in the series of 12 next-generation electric hybrid vessels will be sold to a company formed by a group of investors. Advance payments for the vessels to be sold further have been recognized in inventories. At the end of the financial year  inventories included EUR 10.2 million in advance payments for the Green Coaster vessels. ESL Shipping’s total investment comprises six vessels and roughly EUR 70 million.

The acquisition expands Leipurin’s geographical presence in the Northern European market. In 2021  Kobia’s net sales amounted to approximately EUR 50 million and its operating profit rate was approximately 3%. The acquisition of Kobia AB included also the properties owned by Kobia. Aspo actively explores options to sell and lease back the properties. The potential transactions are significantly affected by market conditions. The purchase price of EUR 15.7 million was paid fully in cash. The assets and liabilities of the acquired company were measured at fair value on the acquisition date. A fair value allocation of EUR 9.7 million was made on the properties  a fair value allocation of EUR 0.4 million was made on the intangible assets based on customer relationships  and the fair value adjustment relating to inventories was EUR 0.5 million. The deferred tax liability arising from the fair value adjustments was EUR 2.2 million. The carrying amount of the other acquired assets and liabilities were deemed to correspond to their fair values. A goodwill balance of EUR 0.1 million resulted from the acquisition. The acquisition-related costs of approximately one million euro were recognized in the Leipurin segment’s other operating expenses.

Johan Steenks is a distributor of technical plastic raw materials and additives for plastics  and it has an established customer base in the Norwegian markets and a number of well-known principals. The company’s annual net sales are roughly EUR 5 million. The business acquisition had no significant impact on Telko’s net sales or results during the final quarter of the year. The purchase price was approximately EUR 2.0 million  of which EUR 0.7 million were allocated to inventories and the remaining EUR 1.3 million were recognized as an increase in goodwill. The cash flow from the acquisition in 2022 was EUR -1.9 million.Discontinued operations and other non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale In October 17  Telko signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. The sales price is approximately EUR 9.5 million. The transaction still needs to be approved by the Russian authorities. Telko’s company in Russia has been classified as held for sale since October 2022 when the preliminary agreement on the sale was signed. Telko’s company in Belarus has been classified as held for sale since December 2022 when the agreement on the sale was signed with the company’s acting management. Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan have been classified as held for sale since December 31  2022 when their divestment started to seem probable. A binding preliminary agreement on their sale was signed on January 17  2023 with Timur Akhiyarov  a Russian-born private investor. The sales price is approximately EUR 8.4 million. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities. The Kauko operating segment and Vulganus Oy  part of the Leipurin segment  were defined as non-core businesses for Aspo and classified as held for sale in December 2021. Vulganus was sold to KÖNIG Maschinen GmbH  the leading manufacturer of bakery machines in Austria  on June 30  2022. The results of Vulganus  including the divestment loss of EUR -0.4 million   are reported as part of the Leipurin segment’s figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The Kauko operating segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in accordance with the IFRS 5 standard  and its figures are reported separately from the figures of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. In the statement of comprehensive income  the figures of the comparative periods have been restated. Kauko Oy was sold to Signal Partners Oy on October 31  2022.

Therefore  the profit from discontinued operations does not include all internal administrative charges of Aspo Group allocated to the Kauko operating segment. As a result  the profit from discontinued operations for the financial year is EUR 0.3 (0.4) million higher than the Kauko operating segment’s profit. An impairment loss of EUR -1.3 million was recognized on Kauko’s goodwill in June 2022. The profit from discontinued operations also includes the EUR -1.2 million loss on sale of Kauko Oy recognized during the fourth quarter. An impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million was recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter of 2021.

The cash flow from the divestment of Kauko Oy in 2022 was EUR -1.0 million  and it is included in the cash flow from investing activities. The costs to sell of EUR -0.4 million are included in the cash flow from operating activities. The cash flow from financing mainly consists of repayments of interest-bearing loans.

The reporting of balance sheet items on separate rows starts at the time of classification  therefore the figures of the comparative period have not been restated. In 2022  assets and liabilities classified as held for sale included the assets and liabilities of the companies held for sale in eastern markets. The classification includes the share of the assets and liabilities of Aspo Group that belong to the companies held for sale  excluding internal assets and liabilities that have been eliminated. In 2021  assets and liabilities of discontinued operations included the figures of the Kauko operating segment. The other assets held for sale at the end of 2021 consisted of Vulganus Oy’s assets and liabilities. The recognition of depreciation and amortization expense ended on December 1  2021  for Kauko and Vulganus when they were classified as held for sale. The depreciation and amortization expense was recognized as part of sales losses in conjunction with the divestment of the companies. Telko Russia was classified as held for sale on October 31  2022  and the other companies held for sale in eastern markets on December 31  2022. The recognition of depreciation and amortization expense ended at the time of the classification as held for sale. At the time of classification as held for sale  the net assets of the companies in eastern markets were measured at fair value less cost to sell  which was lower than the carrying amount. As a result  an impairment loss of EUR 9.4 million was recognized in the Telko segment and EUR 5.2 million in the Leipurin segment during the fourth quarter  which are reported as part of the Telko and Leipurin segments’ figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations.

In addition  an impairment loss was recognized on goodwill  determined in based on the ratio between the fair values of the divested companies and the segment.Restricted cash and cash equivalents In Russia  Aspo Group has EUR 13.5 million in cash and cash equivalents  the use of which is strictly restricted by the Russian Government and controlled by banks. The value of these cash and cash equivalents in the Group is EUR 11.5 million  as an impairment loss of EUR 2.0 million was recognized on the cash and cash equivalents in conjunction with the IFRS 5 classification of the companies in Russia. Cash and cash equivalents in Russia are presented under assets held for sale on the balance sheet. It was still possible to pay dividends and make commercial payments during the fourth quarter of 2022. According to our understanding  the purchase prices of the operations held for sale in eastern markets can be transferred in conjunction with their sale. However  there is a risk that the Group does not have access to the cash and cash equivalents in full in Russia  which is why they must be considered restricted cash and cash equivalents in accordance with IAS 7. Events after the review period On January 17  2023  Leipurin signed a binding preliminary agreement to sell all shares in its subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan to Timur Akhiyarov. Russian-born Akhiyarov will invest in Leipurin’s operations in eastern markets as a private investor. The sales price is approximately EUR 8.4 million. Rights to Leipurin’s name and trademarks are not included in the transaction. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities. The Belarusian subsidiaries of Telko and Leipurin have been added to the list of companies whose transfer of shares are prohibited by a decision issued by the Council of Ministers of Belarus at the end of January 2023. Because of this  it is deemed unlikely that the sale of Telko's Belarusian business would proceed. This does not change Aspo Group's previously published assessment of the financial effects of the divestment. Leipurin’s Belarusian subsidiary is part of an agreement according to which the share capitals of Leipurin’s subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan would be sold to the same buyer. The decision of the Council of Ministers of Belarus does not change the previously published assessment of the financial effects of the transaction  nor does it prevent the sale of Leipurin’s Russian and Kazakh subsidiaries. On January 31  Telko acquired a Polish distribution company Eltrex. Eltrex is a distributor of specialty chemicals and industrial packaging materials  and its annual net sales are approximately 8 million euros and operating profit slightly under one million euros. On February 9  2023  Leipurin completed a sale and lease back agreement for its warehouse property in Gothenburg  Sweden. The property came into Leipurin’s ownership via the Kobia acquisition that took place on 1 September 2022. The buyer of the property is Revelop  a Swedish real estate investor. As a result of the sale and lease back transaction  Aspo recognizes a sales gain of approximately EUR 0.4 million. According to the terms of the agreement  Leipurin leases the property for five years. The transaction is close to cost neutral  as the depreciation expense of the assets owned will be replaced by depreciation and interest expense for the leased assets of similar size.

Aspo Group’s net sales increased to EUR 652.6 million  up by roughly 11% from the previous year. The comparable operating profit for 2022 increased to a record EUR 55.3 million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 8.5%. Both the increase in net sales and our comparable operating profit exceeded the financial targets set for the Group. Aspo’s net sales in October–December stood at EUR 164.6 million  and the comparable operating profit was EUR 11.3 million. ESL Shipping especially supported the positive development of net sales and operating profit  with its record-breaking fourth quarter crowning its overall excellent year. The strong growth of Leipurin’s net sales during the fourth quarter was supported not only by high inflation rates  but also by the acquisition of the Swedish company Kobia AB at the beginning of September. Telko’s comparable operating profit in October–December was below the normal level which was due to the direct and reflected effects of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Eastern trade. Apart from the eastern markets  Telko’s net sales developed positively. The year 2022 turned out to be highly different from what we still assumed at the beginning of the year. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dramatically changed the lives of many of our employees  and our entire operating environment changed drastically. Already in spring  we decided to withdraw from all our operations in Russia and from other selected eastern markets. The prerequisites for responsible business had vanished  and it became clear that we would set our sights even more firmly on western markets in accordance with our strategy updated at the end of 2021. We will continue to operate in Ukraine  and we want to support its development and do our part to help rebuild the country. In summer  we divested Leipurin’s machinery business Vulganus  and at the end of October  the divestment of Kauko was finalized. At the same time  we focused on developing our key businesses through acquisitions according to our compounder strategy  of which the acquisition of Kobia by Leipurin and Telko’s recent acquisitions were the most significant. During the year  we also made strategic investments  the most important of which was ESL Shipping’s decision to invest in new Green Coaster vessels using a pooling arrangement. We are heading to 2023 from a good position  and we will continue the determined implementation of our strategy. I believe that we can generate strong cash flow even in this challenging market environment and  in accordance with our financial guidance  we expect Aspo’s comparable operating profit to be higher than EUR 35 million in 2023. We continue to boost organic growth through strategic acquisitions. Thanks for Aspo’s excellent results in 2022 go to our entire personnel. I am particularly pleased and grateful for the dedication our personnel showed in supporting our colleagues in areas ravaged by the war and in ensuring their safety.ASPO GROUP Financial results and targets Aspo’s financial targets announced on December 1  2021: Annual increase in net sales: 5–10% a yearOperating profit: 8%Return on equity: more than 20%Gearing: less than 130% With regard to Aspo’s businesses  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%. In 2022  the Group’s targets were reached well overall. Aspo Group’s operating profit increased by 11%. The comparable operating profit rate was 8.5% (7.2%)  clearly exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Return on equity remained at the level of 15.2% (20.8%) due to the items affecting comparability of EUR -24.1 million that mainly consisted of additional costs and impairment losses arising from Russia’s invasion in Ukraine  and whose negative impact on return on equity was roughly 15.6 percentage points. Aspo’s gearing decreased to 108.4% (131.0%)  well below the target level.Aspo Group’s comparable result for continuing and discontinued operations Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit is calculated by adjusting the reported operating profit with rare and material items affecting the operating profit. These include impairment losses  sales gains from vessels  and financial losses caused by Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. In December 2021  Aspo announced that Kauko operating segment was defined not being part of Aspo’s core operations  and Kauko was classified as a discontinued operation. On October 31  2022  Kauko was divested outside the Group  and its accumulated earnings until that date and the divestment loss are presented in the profit from discontinued operations  separate from the results of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. However  Kauko’s results are included in Aspo Group’s total figures and comparable operating profit. Telko’s companies in Russia and Belarus  and Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan are classified as held for sale in the 2022 financial statements (eastern businesses held for sale below). The results of the eastern businesses held for sale are reported as part of Telko and Leipurin  as well as Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The assets and liabilities of the eastern businesses held for sale are presented on the balance sheet separately as assets and liabilities held for sale. When the eastern businesses were classified as held for sale  they were measured at fair value less cost to sell  resulting in the recognition of impairment losses totaling EUR 14.5 million in the fourth quarter  reported as items affecting comparability. On divestment  the recognition of the translation differences of the eastern businesses as part of sales losses as well as a possible change the fair value of the eastern businesses compared with the estimates made in the financial statements will also have a negative impact on the operating profit. On the closing date  the amount of the translation differences of the eastern businesses held for sale was EUR -11.8 million. The amount fluctuates according to changes in exchange rates until the date of sale. The reclassification of the translation differences from the translation difference reserve to the result for the period has no impact on Aspo Group’s total equity.

Items affecting comparability relating to the Kauko segment totaled EUR -2.5 million  and they are reported in the profit from discontinued operations. Other items affecting comparability totaled EUR -0.9 million. Of the items affecting comparability during the fourth quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -16.1 million  EUR -14.3 million were related to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and its consequences. Of the items  EUR -0.4 million were recognized for the ESL Shipping segment  EUR -9.0 for Telko  and EUR -5.0 million for Leipurin. Items affecting comparability relating to reorganizations were EUR -0.4 million in the Leipurin segment and EUR -0.1 million in other operations. In addition  Kauko’s sales loss of EUR -1.2 million is included in the items affecting comparability and reported as part of the results of discontinued operations. Items affecting the comparability in 2021  totaling EUR -8.5 million  included the impairment loss of EUR -4.3 million recognized on Leipurin’s goodwill during the final quarter  and the impairment loss and restoration provision of EUR -0.8 million recognized on the fixed assets of Telko’s terminal in Rauma  as well as the impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter  which is reported as part of the results of discontinued operations.Sustainability Sustainability is a material factor which guides Aspo’s management system and especially the company’s investments. Aspo’s businesses aim to be pioneers in sustainability in their respective sectors. To support the sustainability commitments  Aspo published new environmental  social and corporate governance (ESG) goals for the Group and its businesses in December 2021. The key goal is to reduce emission intensity  CO2e (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) is 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. According to the green transition in the shipping industry  ESL Shipping is engaged in close and long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide fossil-free sea transportation for its key customers in the future. ESL Shipping invests in twelve new generation electric hybrid vessels  half of which will remain in its own ownership and half will be transferred to the other party of the pooling arrangement. The investment is significant in terms of monetary value  but above all  it helps the shipping company move towards its emissions target. During the past 12 months  emission intensity improved further to 0.33 (0.42)  driven by the increase in net sales and operational efficiency. Another key goal was a higher level of safety  with the Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) being 8.1 (8.8) during the past 12 months. Even though TRIF improved from the previous year  we did not reach the target of 7.0 set for 2022. Aspo regularly assesses the satisfaction of employees with their own tasks  the quality of management  and Aspo as an employer by conducting an annual atmosphere survey. In 2021  Aspo started to use the People Power index  a new method of measuring job satisfaction  and it was also included in the Group’s sustainability goals. The operating environment remained fairly challenging in all businesses  and job satisfaction decreased slightly  while still being high: the Group achieved the rating of AA in 2022 (2021: AA+). However  the targeted level of AA+ was not achieved unlike in 2021. Aspo’s internal Compliance and Code of Conduct training includes anti-corruption issues and provides guidance for identifying any suspicious situations and practices considered unethical. Aspo’s goal is that all of the Group’s personnel complete the training every year. In 2022  approximately 100% (89%) of the Group’s employees completed Code of Conduct training and roughly 100% (88%) completed Compliance training.Operating environment and the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo’s operations Aspo’s operating environment changed dramatically during 2022 due to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. The invasion has caused considerable general uncertainties in markets  higher interest rates  lower trust among consumers  price inflation  higher energy prices in particular  as well as significant volatility in prices and exchange rates. Significantly suspended business operations in Ukraine due to the war have caused financial losses. The considerable damage to the energy distribution infrastructure in Ukraine made the situation even worse during the second half of 2022. The war drastically reduces operating conditions in eastern markets as a result of operational challenges and regulations  and selected values in particular. Aspo’s decision to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets  combined with the sanctions related to the war  has also reshaped Aspo’s logistics flows and operating models. ESL Shipping’s all operations have been suspended in Russia  and the released vessel capacity has been transferred to other operating areas. Telko has signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. At the end of 2022  Telko also signed a binding preliminary agreement on the sale of its subsidiary in Belarus to a member of its current management. A binding preliminary agreement was also signed with Timur Akhiyarov  a Russian-born private investor  after the end of the financial year on the sale of Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. Leipurin’s net sales in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan stood at EUR 24.7 million in 2022  comprising 19% of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2022 and less than 4% of Aspo Group’s net sales. Telko’s net sales in Russia and Belarus stood at EUR 58.0 million in 2022  comprising 22% of Telko’s total net sales in 2022 and less than 9% of Aspo Group’s net sales. The consolidated net sales of Telko and Leipurin in these countries accounted for roughly 13% of Aspo Group’s net sales in 2022 (16% of net sales in 2021). The international sanctions and Russia’s legislative measures prevent the transportation of goods and the transfer of payments which has reduced the net sales and profitability of the operations in Russia. In addition  decreases in the companies’ operations and personnel have reduced Russia’s role in Aspo’s business operations. The operating environment is expected to become even more challenging  and no rapid solution is in sight. The equity of the group companies in Russia is EUR 20.5 (16.6) million  comprising 14.3% (12.8%) of Aspo Group’s total equity. In Aspo Group  EUR 12.2 million in impairment losses associated with the equity of Russian companies have been recognized in the financial statements. Aspo’s assets in Russia mainly consist of cash and cash equivalents  inventories and accounts receivable. The number of employees in Aspo Group’s companies in Russia is decreasing  being 105 (193) at the end of the year. Rising interest and inflation rates  as well as weaker general economic estimates  have affected consumers’ purchasing behavior  for example  so that consumers have shifted from more expensive to more affordable products. While the coronavirus pandemic has been overshadowed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the news  it still has an impact on Aspo’s operating environment. For example  the global shortage of components  caused by the pandemic  has an impact on certain Aspo’s businesses  decelerating sales and the completion of orders. The markets are also characterized by disruptions in logistics flows and the low availability of certain products. The risk of infections must still be taken into account in daily operations especially among ESL Shipping’s crew members.

The eastern markets’ share of total net sales continued to decrease during the fourth quarter of 2022  mainly due to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and decisions to downsize operations in Russia and withdraw from the market as planned. As a result of the withdrawal from Russia  the division of Aspo’s main market areas will change at the beginning of 2023. According to the previously announced strategy  the company will direct its growth investments at western markets  and the eastern markets’ share of Aspo’s total net sales already decreased to 13.2% in the fourth quarter.Cash flow and financing The Group’s net cash flow from operating activities in January–December was EUR 67.7 (44.0) million. The cash flow of all businesses showed positive development during the year. The impact of the change in working capital on cash flow during the review period was EUR -6.7 (-22.0) million. The increase in working capital mainly comes from the advance payments for the vessels to be built in the ESL Shipping segment’s vessel pool and the customer receivables accumulated through high sales at the end of the year. This was partly compensated by the Telko segment’s working capital  which improved towards the year end. The free cash flow in January–December was EUR 34.4 (27.5) million. The amount of investments of EUR -17.8 (-15.9) million mainly included the ESL Shipping segment’s dockages and Green Coaster advance payments. In addition  the cash flow from investing activities includes EUR -17.9 million cash outflow on the acquisitions of Kobia  Mentum and Johan Steenks and a total of EUR 2.8 million in cash inflow from the sale of Espa and Vulganus as the most significant items.12/2022 12/2021 MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities  incl. lease liabilities 189.2 187.3 Cash and cash equivalents 33.5 17.7 Net interest-bearing debt 155.7 169.6 Net interest-bearing debt decreased to EUR 155.7 (169.6) million and gearing fell to 108.4% (131.0%). The Group’s equity ratio at the end of the review period was 34.7% (32.0%). The balance sheet strengthened as a result of improved profitability and the new hybrid instrument issued in June. Net financial expenses in January–December totaled EUR -6.3 (-3.9) million. Exchange rate changes  especially the strengthened value of the Russian ruble  increased financial expenses by EUR 1.6 million from the previous year. The average interest rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  was 3.3% (1.4%). The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents stood at EUR 33.5 (17.7) at the end of the review period  of which cash and cash equivalents related to businesses held for sale were EUR 11.8 million. Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program also remained wholly unused (5). During 2022  Aspo extended its maturity structure for interest-bearing loans. In September  AtoBatC AB signed an EUR 32.2 million loan agreement with Svenska Skeppshypotek. The loan’s maturity is 15 years  and it has not yet been withdrawn. The loan  together with the ten-year loan agreement of EUR 20 million singed in June with the Nordic Investment Bank  of which EUR 19.6 million have been withdrawn  finances ESL Shipping’s investment in a series of six new highly energy-efficient electric hybrid vessels. The project was launched in September 2021. In addition  Aspo restructured a bilateral bank loan of EUR 20 million  about to mature in 2023  with a new bilateral revolving credit facility which will mature in 2025. The loan agreement also includes two options for a one-year extension. In June  Aspo issued a new EUR 30 million hybrid instrument  with a coupon rate of 8.75% per annum. The hybrid instrument has no maturity  but the company may exercise an early redemption option in June 2025 at the earliest. Aspo’s earlier hybrid instrument of EUR 20 million was redeemed on May 2  2022.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operations Aspo and its subsidiaries are exposed to various risks and uncertainties  which are mainly identified and managed in Aspo's businesses. The most important risks and preparedness for them are summarized and reported to Aspo's Board of Directors through Aspo's Audit Committee. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine causes significant geopolitical uncertainties. It affects the general economic environment  including inflation  energy and raw material prices  interest rates  and consumers’ trust. The ongoing process to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets will change the Group’s structure significantly and will affect the revenue model of Aspo’s businesses in the long term. There are risks that the withdrawal from the selected markets causes additional costs or losses  and that funds cannot be transferred from the markets or that the withdrawal is unsuccessful in full or in part. It is also possible that the official approvals required for the withdrawal from the markets are not obtained for example due to changes is legislation or that they are at risk or fail for some other reason. Financial activities and the prevailing geopolitical uncertainties have caused the prices of many raw materials  components and logistics services to rise rapidly. While Aspo may benefit from the price increases temporarily  the prices of raw materials or rental capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Disruptions in logistics flows  longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes are also increasing risks. The rapid increase in inflation has generally caused pressure for salary increases  which in Finland can lead to labor disputes  which can also negatively affect Aspo's businesses. International sanctions and countersanctions have been imposed  which may also affect Aspo’s businesses directly or indirectly. The geopolitical tensions may escalate and cause a direct adverse impact on business operations  put payments at risk and even suspend business operations. If escalated  cyber incidents and disruptions in information systems may cause damage to business operations. In line with its renewed strategy  Aspo aims to increase its steady profit-making ability through acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial resources and consequently may reduce solvency. With its strategy  Aspo aims to reduce the impact of the possibly weakening general economic development on Aspo’s profit-making ability. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Aspo’s operations has been limited at the group level  even though it has been significant in the Leipurin segment. The current and any new coronavirus variants and their rapid spread may suspend business operations and cause financial losses through stoppages in global logistics chains  among other factors. Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation and knowledge  they involve significant risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO’S BUSINESS OPERATIONS ESL Shipping ESL Shipping is the leading dry bulk sea transport company operating in the Baltic Sea area. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 41 vessels with a total capacity of 425 000 deadweight tonnage (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (80% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 16 vessels (18%) were time chartered. ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service. 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 63.3 54.7 16 245.4 191.4 28 Operating profit  MEUR 10.2 9.8 4 38.1 26.8 42 Operating profit  % 16.1 17.9 15.5 14.0 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -0.4 0.7 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 10.6 9.8 8 37.4 26.8 40 Comparable operating profit  % 16.7 17.9 15.2 14.0 The fourth quarter of 2022 marked the best quarter in ESL Shipping’s history measured by the operating profit. Net sales increased by 16% from the previous year to EUR 63.3 (54.7) million. The comparable operating profit for the quarter increased by 8% to record-breaking EUR 10.6 (9.8) million. The operating profit of EUR 10.2 (9.8) million includes EUR -0.4 million in expenses associated with suspended operations in Russia. High demand in the shipping company’s main market areas  the shipping company’s long-term partnership strategy and the successful operations of the onshore and offshore personnel enabled the excellent results. Weather conditions were also favorable for operations. The comparable operating profit rate of 16.7% (17.9%) achieved during the fourth quarter was once again excellent. During the quarter  the prices of diesel and liquefied natural gas (LNG) used as ship fuels decreased from the previous quarter  while remaining roughly twice as high as in the comparative period. The high level of fuel surcharges increased net sales and reduced the operating profit rate  which is used as an indicator of relative profitability. During the fourth quarter  cargo volumes transported by ESL Shipping decreased slightly from the comparative period to 3.8 (3.9) million tons. The volume development was based on the transfer of raw material deliveries away from Russia which has extended transportation distances especially for energy coal. The final quarter is also normally the busiest season for energy transportation  but as a result of the exceptional situation involving the security of supply  the low availability of biofuels and longer transportation distances  the percentage of energy coal from all transportation operations tripled during the fourth quarter from the comparative period. The profitability of all the shipping company’s vessel categories was excellent during the fourth quarter. In fourth quarter  production plants of several contractual customers underwent relatively large maintenance stoppages and restricted production due to lower demand and high energy costs. High demand experienced in the energy industry enabled the vessels to continue to operate at full capacity during the fourth quarter. The spot cargo market decreased in all customer segments and vessel categories during the quarter. After operations in Russia were suspended  demand for ESL Shipping’s loading and unloading operations for vessels at sea shifted to the southern Baltic Sea where it was maintained by the high demand for energy coal transportation during the fourth quarter and congestion at ports suitable for large ocean liners. Six time-chartered vessels of the smaller vessel category were redelivered to their owners as the charter agreements ended at the end of the fourth quarter and as the price of an extended charter period became too high. The newbuilding project of ESL Shipping’s Swedish subsidiary AtoBatC Shipping AB    at the Chowgule & Company Private Limited shipyard in India proceeded as planned during the fourth quarter. Every other vessel in the series of 12 next-generation electric hybrid vessels will be sold  as announced earlier  to the company established by the pooling investor group. The first four new vessels are already under construction  and the first vessel is to be delivered during fall 2023. One larger vessel was docked for seven days during the fourth quarter and one smaller vessel was out of service for 26 days. In 2022  dockage days totaled 141 (229). The net sales of ESL Shipping in January–December increased from the comparative period by 28% to EUR 245.4 (191.4) million. The comparable operating profit was the highest in the company’s history at EUR 37.4 (26.8) million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 15.2% (14.0%). The operating profit rate clearly exceeded the long-term target of 14%. Comparability was affected by the gain from the sale of the barge Espa and costs associated with the suspended operations in Russia. Their impact on net results was EUR 0.7 million and  as a result  ESL Shipping’s operating profit amounted to EUR 38.1 (26.8) million and its operating profit rate was 15.5% (14.0%) for 2022 as a whole. The shipping company’s long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The aim is to halve carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. During 2022  ESL Shipping transported 14.7 (14.8) million tons of cargo  and its vessels consumed 819 988 (898 158) MWh of energy. CO2 emissions per transported ton decreased by 7.5% to 0.015 (0.016) tons of carbon dioxide per ton of cargo. The new energy-efficient operating models applied to port visits supported the positive development.ESL Shipping outlook for 2023 General macroeconomic uncertainties have increased in ESL Shipping’s main market areas. Higher inflation and slower economic growth increase demand and pricing pressure among the shipping company’s main customers. Finland’s labor market may experience unrest during the spring  and its impact through overtime bans and strikes may be significant on key customers and especially on the effectiveness of the transport chain. Global demand estimates in sea transportation markets and price levels of spot markets have decreased considerably from the previous year. On the other hand  the availability of vessel capacity suitable for round-the-year operations in the Baltic Sea is limited. Production volumes of ESL Shipping’s main customers is expected to be satisfactory  albeit slightly lower than in the previous year. Demand for energy deliveries outside Finland is expected to remain high during the first half of the year. In the forest industry  pulp delivery volumes are looking positive  but only satisfactory for sawn goods. Volumes are looking satisfactory in the steel industry. Now that deliveries of Russian raw materials have stopped  certain of the shipping company’s significant contractual customers are forced to seek new suppliers for part of their production input required in new geographic areas. Not all of these procurement routes have yet become stabilized which may cause an imbalance in ESL Shipping’s operations. The role of energy coal transportation is expected to decrease significantly when the preparation situation returns to normal and demand shifts towards other energy forms. The majority of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements with the exception of the Supramax vessels. Currently  the expectations of the lessors of the time-chartered vessels do not meet the realities in the shipping company’s main market areas which may cause further uncertainties in the availability of a suitable and sufficient tonnage. The impact of rising energy prices on ESL Shipping’s costs is compensated effectively through fuel clauses in long-term transportation agreements. Surveys show that ESL Shipping’s customer satisfaction is at an excellent level  similarly to the personnel’s commitment and job satisfaction. Activities to further improve customer and employee satisfaction  sustainability and occupational safety will continue. The shipping company’s investments in energy-efficient vessels will strengthen its competitiveness and market position in the future. ESL Shipping will continue the development of a fossil-free sea transportation ecosystem in line with the green transition and the vessels designed for it in cooperation with its key customers. The shipping company is participating in projects aimed to produce green hydrogen through renewable electricity and to further process it as fossil-free fuel for the shipping company’s vessels. During 2023  four larger and two smaller vessels will be docked for a total of approximately 100 days. Telko Telko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together. Its competitive edge is based on strong technical support  efficient logistics and local expert service. Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Russia  Belarus  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China. In October 2022  Telko signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. In December  Telko finalized the preliminary agreement to divest its subsidiary in Belarus  to a member of its current management. Both business transactions still need to be approved by the local authorities. Assets and liabilities related to these companies have been classified as assets and liabilities held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 standard at the end of the review period. 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 59.2 73.6 -20 267.4 268.8 -1 Operating profit  MEUR -7.7 4.4 -275 7.3 20.4 -64 Operating profit  % -13.0 6.0 2.7 7.6 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -9.0 -0.8 -13.5 -0.8 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.3 5.2 -75 20.8 21.2 -2 Comparable operating profit  % 2.2 7.1 7.8 7.9 During the fourth quarter  Telko’s net sales decreased steeply to EUR 59.2 (73.6) million. Telko’s net sales for the fourth quarter decreased after sales in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine dropped substantially from the previous year. Telko’s net sales outside Russia  Belarus and Ukraine increased. Demand remained stable in Telko’s all business operations. The comparable operating profit for the fourth quarter stood at EUR 1.3 (5.2) million  and the operating profit rate was 2.2% (7.1%). Net sales and operating profit decreased from the previous year  especially due to weak development and negative results in Russia. Telko’s result for the fourth quarter includes items affecting comparability  which reduced Telko’s operating profit by EUR 9.0 million in total. Impairment losses regarding companies in Russia and Belarus of EUR 9.3 million and other expenses of EUR 0.2 million were recognized relating to the withdrawal from Russia. In addition  the credit loss provision recognized from accounts receivable in Ukraine was reversed by EUR 0.5 million. The combined comparable operating profit of the above countries was slightly negative during the fourth quarter. Telko’s operating profit for the fourth quarter was EUR -7.7 (4.4) million. The operating profit rate was -13.0% (6.0%). Impairment losses associated with inventories  exchange rate losses  and costs related to corporate restructuring also had a negative impact on the operating profit. The net sales of the plastics business decreased by 25% during the fourth quarter to EUR 29.6 (39.7) million  mainly due to the decrease in Telko’s operations in Russia. In Telko’s European markets  demand for plastic polymers remained at a normal level in general. Sales outside Russia  Belarus and Ukraine increased slightly  regardless of the downward trend in prices. While the steep decline in the prices of volume plastics turned to an increase during the fourth quarter  the prices are still lower than during the corresponding period in the previous year. The prices of technical plastics decreased slightly during the fourth quarter but were clearly above the comparative period’s level. The acquisition of the operations of Johan Steenks  a Norwegian distributor of technical plastic raw materials and plastics  increased the net sales of the plastics business during the fourth quarter  while it had no significant impact on results. During the fourth quarter  the net sales of the chemicals business decreased by 32% to EUR 15.9 (23.4) million. Sales decreased steeply in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. The weak development especially in Ukraine resulted from the disruptions in the electricity distribution infrastructure due to the war which directly limited production. Total sales in other countries increased significantly  regardless of the decrease in prices. Prices started to increase during the fourth quarter. Telko’s chemicals business is divided between several customer groups which evens out any fluctuations in demand. During the fourth quarter  the net sales of the lubricants business increased by 31% to EUR 13.7 (10.5) million. Sales increased in all key product groups. The increase in sales resulted from high price levels  the acquisition of Mentum AS at the end of 2021  and very positively developed sales of industrial lubricants. Prices of lubricants increased slightly during the fourth quarter. Russia’s invasion in Ukraine did not have any direct impact on the lubricants business. Telko’s net sales in January–December decreased by 1% to EUR 267.4 (268.8) million. The full-year comparable operating profit of EUR 20.8 million was only slightly lower than the previous year’s record-high comparable operating profit (21.2). The comparable operating profit rate remained high at 7.8% (7.9%). Exchange rate losses of EUR 2.5 million reduced the operating profit. Telko’s full-year operating profit fell by 64% to EUR 7.3 (20.4) million. The operating profit rate was 2.7% (7.6%). Results decreased due to the warehouse destroyed in Ukraine  the impairment losses associated with companies in Russia and Belarus  and other costs arising from the withdrawal from Russia  which totaled EUR -13.5 million and have been reported as items affecting comparability.Telko outlook for 2023 As announced previously  Telko has agreed to divest its operations in Russia and Belarus. Telko’s net sales in Russia and Belarus were EUR 58.0 million in 2022  comprising 22% of Telko’s total net sales in 2022. Both sales transactions require approval by the local authorities. Telko expects the Russian transaction to be completed during the first quarter of 2023 but there is uncertainty involved. In 2023  Telko’s net sales and profit will be significantly lower than in the previous year due to the changed situation in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. In other countries  demand is expected to remain moderate  even though there will be differences between businesses. The prices of plastics and chemicals decreased steeply during the latter half of 2022  while still being clearly above the long-term average. It is assumed that the most significant price corrections took place during 2022  but the prices are expected to decrease slightly during the first half if energy prices do not experience a considerable increase. In high added value products  on which Telko focuses in accordance with its strategy  price changes are typically more moderate. Significant changes in prices have a short-term impact on margins. Demand for lubricants is expected to remain stable  and prices are expected to increase at least during the first half of 2023. In western markets  demand will involve uncertainties during the next few months. Demand indices have decreased in the construction and automotive industries in Europe. High energy prices and inflation rates will affect demand during the next few months  in particular. At the end of the year  demand will  above all  be affected by the general development of purchasing power in Europe. The lifting of coronavirus restrictions in China is expected to increase local demand. In addition  higher demand in China may have an impact on global price development during the first part of the year. In Central Asia  demand is expected to remain relatively high. Sales in Ukraine will be lower during the first half than in the previous year  while they are expected to be at the 2022 level during the rest of the year  depending completely on the development of the war. Telko will continue its activities to improve its operational efficiency and scalability. Inflation causes general increases in costs. On the other hand  cargo expenses  especially in Asia  will be materially lower than in the previous year. The recent structural arrangements continued when Telko announced on January 31  2023  that it will acquire Eltrex  a Polish company specialized in the distribution of chemicals. According to its strategy  Telko continues to accelerate its growth through acquisitions in addition to organic growth. Leipurin Leipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies  and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. Leipurin operates in nine countries that have been grouped into four business units  each being responsible for their financial performance: Finland  Sweden  Baltics  and East. Leipurin serves bakery  food industry and foodservice customers by providing raw materials and by supporting research and development and recipes for new products. The Leipurin segment’s other product categories include various supplies and machines for the same customer segments. The Leipurin segment uses leading international manufacturers as its raw material and machinery supply partners. On April 22  2022  Aspo announced that Leipurin will withdraw from its operations in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. In January 2023  Leipurin signed a binding preliminary agreement to sell its subsidiaries in these countries to a private investor. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities. Assets and liabilities related to these companies have been classified as assets and liabilities held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 standard at the end of the review period. 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 41.3 31.7 30 130.6 113.1 15 Operating profit  MEUR -4.3 -3.6 19 -4.8 -2.4 100 Operating profit  % -10.4 -11.4 -3.7 -2.1 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -5.4 -4.3 -8.1 -4.3 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.1 0.7 57 3.3 1.9 74 Comparable operating profit  % 2.7 2.2 2.5 1.7 Comparable operating profit excl.

Leipurin’s total net sales increased by 30% during the fourth quarter to EUR 41.3 (31.7) million. Figures for the comparative year included EUR 2.7 million in net sales of the discontinued machinery business in Russia and divested Vulganus Oy. The Finland business unit’s net sales increased by 8% to EUR 12.2 (11.3) million. In the Baltics  net sales increased by 18% to EUR 10.0 (8.5) million. Net sales of the East business unit decreased by 32% to EUR 6.2 (9.1) million due to the reduced product range  consisting only of local procurement. The decrease in the net sales of the East business unit was also significantly affected by the decrease in operations in Ukraine down to roughly 9% from the comparative year’s level. Sweden was established as a new business unit as a result of the acquisition of Kobia AB on September 1  and it accounted for EUR 12.9 million and approximately 31% of Leipurin’s net sales in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter  sales to bakeries increased by 41% to EUR 28.6 (20.3) million. Sales to the food industry increased by 35% to EUR 4.2 (3.1) million. The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets continued to have a significant impact on Leipurin’s sales during the fourth quarter. Measured in kilograms  the decrease in sales intensified in Finland  Sweden and the Baltics  whereas sales continued to be roughly half of the previous year’s level in the East business unit. The weak volume development is mainly driven by the decrease in consumers’ trust in the current market situation  in which energy costs and interest rates are especially rising steeply. The significant increase in living expenses continued in Finland  Sweden and the Baltics which reduced the inflation-adjusted sales volume of retail and strengthened the shift in consumers’ demand towards more affordable products. The positive development of profit margins continued  regardless of the negative trends in volumes. The comparable operating profit for the fourth quarter stood at EUR 1.1 (0.7) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.7% (2.2%). Leipurin’s comparable operating profit  excluding Vulganus  was EUR 1.1 (0.7) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.7% (2.3%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR -5.4 (-4.3) million  included costs and impairment losses arising from the withdrawal from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan  and costs associated with the reorganization of Leipurin’s group operations. The comparability of the comparative period was affected by animpairment loss recognized on goodwill. Leipurin’s operating loss for the fourth quarter was EUR -4.3 (-3.6) million. Reversal of a fair value allocation of inventories amounting to EUR -0.5 million which arised from the acquisition of Kobia  had a negative impact on the operating profit. In January–December  Leipurin’s net sales increased by 15% to EUR 130.6 (113.1) million. Figures for the comparative year included EUR 11.4 million in net sales of the discontinued machinery business in Russia and divested Vulganus Oy  which were EUR 7.1 million higher than in 2022  but the increase in raw material sales in western markets was particularly strong during the review period compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets had a significant impact on the euro-denominated increase in sales. Leipurin’s comparable operating profit in January–December 2022 was EUR 3.3 (1.9) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.5% (1.7%). Leipurin’s comparable operating profit  excluding Vulganus  was EUR 4.1 (2.4) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 3.2% (2.2%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR -8.1 (-4.3) million  were mainly related to the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine  the acquisition of Kobia  and the divestment of Vulganus. The reported operating profit was negative at EUR -4.8 (-2.4) million. Kobia’s impact on Leipurin’s operating profit was still negative due to the reversal of the EUR 0.5 million fair value allocation of inventories related to the acquisition. Vulganus was divested on June 30  2022. The loss arising from the divestment and the expenses related to it  totaling EUR -0.4 million  are reported under the Leipurin segment’s other operating expenses. Leipurin acquired all shares in Kobia AB  a Swedish distributor in the bakery industry  from the Swedish Abdon Group. Kobia AB comprises Leipurin’s new Sweden business unit  and it has been included in Aspo Group’s figures since September 1  2022. Kobia’s annual net sales are approximately EUR 50 million  and its operating profit rate is roughly 3%. The acquisition strengthens Leipurin’s position as the leading company in the Baltic Sea region. Leipurin outlook for 2023 The war in Ukraine and the decision to withdraw operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan will have a significant impact on Leipurin’s net sales and results. Leipurin’s net sales in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan were EUR 24.7 million in 2022  comprising 19% of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2022. The divestment of the operations in the eastern markets still needs to be approved by the local authorities. Leipurin expects the transaction to be completed during the first half of 2023 but there is uncertainty involved. The expansion to Sweden through the acquisition of Kobia AB will increase Leipurin’s annual net sales by roughly EUR 50 million and produce considerable synergy benefits in the development of the product range  and in the supply chain and procurement. It also enables partners to be served in a larger geographic area. The integration of operations has progressed according to plans. Inflation and the rising energy prices  in particular  have a negative impact on demand for more expensive products  potentially presenting profitability challenges among the bakery segment’s customers. The decreased purchasing power may have a negative impact on demand for artisanal bakeries  as consumers prefer more affordable products. The upward trend is expected to continue in the prices of main raw material categories  even though the rapid inflation during the review period is expected to decelerate considerably. This is expected to take place during the first half of 2023. Despite these challenges  Leipurin sees that the market will offer a highly stable environment in the long term and also opportunities for organic growth in selected market segments. In addition  the profitability program that was launched earlier develops the organization's ability to lead with information and helps to improve financial performance in particular. The program focuses both on selected growth clusters and on improving the efficiency of operations. This program is expected to contribute to improving Leipurin’s financial development. The impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic on the global supply chains  the availability of certain raw materials and general delivery times will continue. The management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges will increase risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers. Other operations Other operations include Aspo Group’s administration  finance and ICT service center. The comparable operating profit of other operations was EUR -1.8 (-1.9) million during the fourth quarter. The reported operating profit of EUR -1.9 (-1.9) million includes EUR -0.1 million in restructuring expenses affecting comparability. The comparable operating profit for 2022 was EUR -6.0 (-7.9) million. The reported operating profit was EUR -6.7 (-7.9) million  including EUR -0.7 million in items affecting comparability that are mainly related to the additional share-based remuneration granted to Aspo’s previous CEO and restructuring expenses.COMPANY INFORMATION Aspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

Remuneration Share-based incentive plan 2022–2024 On February 16  2022  Aspo Plc’s Board of Directors decided to establish a new share-based incentive plan for 2022–2024. The aim of the plan is to combine the objectives of the shareholders and key employees in order to increase the value of the company in the long term  to retain key employees in the company  and to offer them a competitive reward plan based on earning and accumulating the company’s shares. The share-based incentive plan consists of three earnings periods  with the earned reward being based on the Group’s earnings per share (EPS) and two sustainability indicators. Participation in the scheme and obtaining rewards require that participants allocate the freely transferable company shares they hold to the plan or acquire the company’s shares up to the quantity determined by the Board of Directors. The share-based incentive plan is directed at a maximum of 30 people  including the members of the Group Executive Committee. The potential reward will be paid partly in the company’s shares and partly in cash in 2023  2024 and 2025. The rewards payable based on the plan correspond to a maximum total value of 400 000 Aspo Plc shares  also including the proportion to be paid in cash. For the 2022 earnings period  the targets were met at 90% overall. Share-based incentive plan 2021–2023 On February 11  2021  Aspo’s Board of Directors decided to continue the share-based incentive plan for the Group’s key personnel by establishing a share-based incentive plan for 2021–2023. The aim of the plan is to combine the objectives of the shareholders and key employees in order to increase the value of the company in the long term  to retain key employees in the company  and to offer them a competitive reward plan based on earning and accumulating the company’s shares. The share-based incentive plan is directed at around 20 people  including the members of the Group Executive Committee. The EPS target  acting as an earnings criterion for the share-based incentive plan  was fully met during the 2021 financial year. In March 2022  based on the share-based incentive plan  a total of 89 400 treasury shares were transferred  and an amount equaling the value of the shares was paid in cash to cover taxes.

The Kauko operating segment and Vulganus Oy  part of the Leipurin segment  were defined as non-core businesses for Aspo and classified as held for sale in December 2021. Vulganus was sold to KÖNIG Maschinen GmbH  the leading manufacturer of bakery machines in Austria  on June 30  2022. The results of Vulganus  including the divestment loss of EUR -0.4 million   are reported as part of the Leipurin segment’s figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The Kauko operating segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in accordance with the IFRS 5 standard  and its figures are reported separately from the figures of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. In the statement of comprehensive income  the figures of the comparative periods have been restated. Kauko Oy was sold to Signal Partners Oy on October 31  2022.

Therefore  the profit from discontinued operations does not include all internal administrative charges of Aspo Group allocated to the Kauko operating segment. As a result  the profit from discontinued operations for the financial year is EUR 0.3 (0.4) million higher than the Kauko operating segment’s profit. An impairment loss of EUR -1.3 million was recognized on Kauko’s goodwill in June 2022. The profit from discontinued operations also includes the EUR -1.2 million loss on sale of Kauko Oy recognized during the fourth quarter. An impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million was recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter of 2021.

The cash flow from the divestment of Kauko Oy in 2022 was EUR -1.0 million  and it is included in the cash flow from investing activities. The costs to sell of EUR -0.4 million are included in the cash flow from operating activities. The cash flow from financing mainly consists of repayments of interest-bearing loans.

The reporting of balance sheet items on separate rows starts at the time of classification  therefore the figures of the comparative period have not been restated. In 2022  assets and liabilities classified as held for sale included the assets and liabilities of the companies held for sale in eastern markets. The classification includes the share of the assets and liabilities of Aspo Group that belong to the companies held for sale  excluding internal assets and liabilities that have been eliminated. In 2021  assets and liabilities of discontinued operations included the figures of the Kauko operating segment. The other assets held for sale at the end of 2021 consisted of Vulganus Oy’s assets and liabilities. The recognition of depreciation and amortization expense ended on December 1  2021  for Kauko and Vulganus when they were classified as held for sale. The depreciation and amortization expense was recognized as part of sales losses in conjunction with the divestment of the companies. Telko Russia was classified as held for sale on October 31  2022  and the other companies held for sale in eastern markets on December 31  2022. The recognition of depreciation and amortization expense ended at the time of the classification as held for sale. At the time of classification as held for sale  the net assets of the companies in eastern markets were measured at fair value less cost to sell  which was lower than the carrying amount. As a result  an impairment loss of EUR 9.4 million was recognized in the Telko segment and EUR 5.2 million in the Leipurin segment during the fourth quarter  which are reported as part of the Telko and Leipurin segments’ figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations.

In addition  an impairment loss was recognized on goodwill  determined in based on the ratio between the fair values of the divested companies and the segment. Restricted cash and cash equivalents In Russia  Aspo Group has EUR 13.5 million in cash and cash equivalents  the use of which is strictly restricted by the Russian Government and controlled by banks. The value of these cash and cash equivalents in the Group is EUR 11.5 million  as an impairment loss of EUR 2.0 million was recognized on the cash and cash equivalents in conjunction with the IFRS 5 classification of the companies in Russia. Cash and cash equivalents in Russia are presented under assets held for sale on the balance sheet. It was still possible to pay dividends and make commercial payments during the fourth quarter of 2022. According to our understanding  the purchase prices of the operations held for sale in eastern markets can be transferred in conjunction with their sale. However  there is a risk that the Group does not have access to the cash and cash equivalents in full in Russia  which is why they must be considered restricted cash and cash equivalents in accordance with IAS 7. Events after the review period On January 17  2023  Leipurin signed a binding preliminary agreement to sell all shares in its subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan to Timur Akhiyarov. Russian-born Akhiyarov will invest in Leipurin’s operations in eastern markets as a private investor. The sales price is approximately EUR 8.4 million. Rights to Leipurin’s name and trademarks are not included in the transaction. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities. The Belarusian subsidiaries of Telko and Leipurin have been added to the list of companies whose transfer of shares are prohibited by a decision issued by the Council of Ministers of Belarus at the end of January 2023. Because of this  it is deemed unlikely that the sale of Telko's Belarusian business would proceed. This does not change Aspo Group's previously published assessment of the financial effects of the divestment. Leipurin’s Belarusian subsidiary is part of an agreement according to which the share capitals of Leipurin’s subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan would be sold to the same buyer. The decision of the Council of Ministers of Belarus does not change the previously published assessment of the financial effects of the transaction  nor does it prevent the sale of Leipurin’s Russian and Kazakh subsidiaries. On January 31  Telko acquired a Polish distribution company Eltrex. Eltrex is a distributor of specialty chemicals and industrial packaging materials  and its annual net sales are approximately 8 million euros and operating profit slightly under one million euros. On February 9  2023  Leipurin completed a sale and lease back agreement for its warehouse property in Gothenburg  Sweden. The property came into Leipurin’s ownership via the Kobia acquisition that took place on 1 September 2022. The buyer of the property is Revelop  a Swedish real estate investor. As a result of the sale and lease back transaction  Aspo recognizes a sales gain of approximately EUR 0.4 million. According to the terms of the agreement  Leipurin leases the property for five years. The transaction is close to cost neutral  as the depreciation expense of the assets owned will be replaced by depreciation and interest expense for the leased assets of similar size.

Aspo Group’s net sales increased to EUR 652.6 million  up by roughly 11% from the previous year. The comparable operating profit for 2022 increased to a record EUR 55.3 million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 8.5%. Both the increase in net sales and our comparable operating profit exceeded the financial targets set for the Group. Aspo’s net sales in October–December stood at EUR 164.6 million  and the comparable operating profit was EUR 11.3 million. ESL Shipping especially supported the positive development of net sales and operating profit  with its record-breaking fourth quarter crowning its overall excellent year. The strong growth of Leipurin’s net sales during the fourth quarter was supported not only by high inflation rates  but also by the acquisition of the Swedish company Kobia AB at the beginning of September. Telko’s comparable operating profit in October–December was below the normal level which was due to the direct and reflected effects of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Eastern trade. Apart from the eastern markets  Telko’s net sales developed positively. The year 2022 turned out to be highly different from what we still assumed at the beginning of the year. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dramatically changed the lives of many of our employees  and our entire operating environment changed drastically. Already in spring  we decided to withdraw from all our operations in Russia and from other selected eastern markets. The prerequisites for responsible business had vanished  and it became clear that we would set our sights even more firmly on western markets in accordance with our strategy updated at the end of 2021. We will continue to operate in Ukraine  and we want to support its development and do our part to help rebuild the country. In summer  we divested Leipurin’s machinery business Vulganus  and at the end of October  the divestment of Kauko was finalized. At the same time  we focused on developing our key businesses through acquisitions according to our compounder strategy  of which the acquisition of Kobia by Leipurin and Telko’s recent acquisitions were the most significant. During the year  we also made strategic investments  the most important of which was ESL Shipping’s decision to invest in new Green Coaster vessels using a pooling arrangement. We are heading to 2023 from a good position  and we will continue the determined implementation of our strategy. I believe that we can generate strong cash flow even in this challenging market environment and  in accordance with our financial guidance  we expect Aspo’s comparable operating profit to be higher than EUR 35 million in 2023. We continue to boost organic growth through strategic acquisitions. Thanks for Aspo’s excellent results in 2022 go to our entire personnel. I am particularly pleased and grateful for the dedication our personnel showed in supporting our colleagues in areas ravaged by the war and in ensuring their safety.ASPO GROUP Financial results and targets Aspo’s financial targets announced on December 1  2021: Annual increase in net sales: 5–10% a yearOperating profit: 8%Return on equity: more than 20%Gearing: less than 130% With regard to Aspo’s businesses  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%. In 2022  the Group’s targets were reached well overall. Aspo Group’s operating profit increased by 11%. The comparable operating profit rate was 8.5% (7.2%)  clearly exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Return on equity remained at the level of 15.2% (20.8%) due to the items affecting comparability of EUR -24.1 million that mainly consisted of additional costs and impairment losses arising from Russia’s invasion in Ukraine  and whose negative impact on return on equity was roughly 15.6 percentage points. Aspo’s gearing decreased to 108.4% (131.0%)  well below the target level.Aspo Group’s comparable result for continuing and discontinued operations Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit is calculated by adjusting the reported operating profit with rare and material items affecting the operating profit. These include impairment losses  sales gains from vessels  and financial losses caused by Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. In December 2021  Aspo announced that Kauko operating segment was defined not being part of Aspo’s core operations  and Kauko was classified as a discontinued operation. On October 31  2022  Kauko was divested outside the Group  and its accumulated earnings until that date and the divestment loss are presented in the profit from discontinued operations  separate from the results of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. However  Kauko’s results are included in Aspo Group’s total figures and comparable operating profit. Telko’s companies in Russia and Belarus  and Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan are classified as held for sale in the 2022 financial statements (eastern businesses held for sale below). The results of the eastern businesses held for sale are reported as part of Telko and Leipurin  as well as Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The assets and liabilities of the eastern businesses held for sale are presented on the balance sheet separately as assets and liabilities held for sale. When the eastern businesses were classified as held for sale  they were measured at fair value less cost to sell  resulting in the recognition of impairment losses totaling EUR 14.5 million in the fourth quarter  reported as items affecting comparability. On divestment  the recognition of the translation differences of the eastern businesses as part of sales losses as well as a possible change the fair value of the eastern businesses compared with the estimates made in the financial statements will also have a negative impact on the operating profit. On the closing date  the amount of the translation differences of the eastern businesses held for sale was EUR -11.8 million. The amount fluctuates according to changes in exchange rates until the date of sale. The reclassification of the translation differences from the translation difference reserve to the result for the period has no impact on Aspo Group’s total equity.

Other items affecting comparability totaled EUR -0.9 million. Of the items affecting comparability during the fourth quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -16.1 million  EUR -14.3 million were related to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and its consequences. Of the items  EUR -0.4 million were recognized for the ESL Shipping segment  EUR -9.0 for Telko  and EUR -5.0 million for Leipurin. Items affecting comparability relating to reorganizations were EUR -0.4 million in the Leipurin segment and EUR -0.1 million in other operations. In addition  Kauko’s sales loss of EUR -1.2 million is included in the items affecting comparability and reported as part of the results of discontinued operations. Items affecting the comparability in 2021  totaling EUR -8.5 million  included the impairment loss of EUR -4.3 million recognized on Leipurin’s goodwill during the final quarter  and the impairment loss and restoration provision of EUR -0.8 million recognized on the fixed assets of Telko’s terminal in Rauma  as well as the impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter  which is reported as part of the results of discontinued operations.Sustainability Sustainability is a material factor which guides Aspo’s management system and especially the company’s investments. Aspo’s businesses aim to be pioneers in sustainability in their respective sectors. To support the sustainability commitments  Aspo published new environmental  social and corporate governance (ESG) goals for the Group and its businesses in December 2021. The key goal is to reduce emission intensity  CO2e (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) is 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. According to the green transition in the shipping industry  ESL Shipping is engaged in close and long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide fossil-free sea transportation for its key customers in the future. ESL Shipping invests in twelve new generation electric hybrid vessels  half of which will remain in its own ownership and half will be transferred to the other party of the pooling arrangement. The investment is significant in terms of monetary value  but above all  it helps the shipping company move towards its emissions target. During the past 12 months  emission intensity improved further to 0.33 (0.42)  driven by the increase in net sales and operational efficiency. Another key goal was a higher level of safety  with the Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) being 8.1 (8.8) during the past 12 months. Even though TRIF improved from the previous year  we did not reach the target of 7.0 set for 2022. Aspo regularly assesses the satisfaction of employees with their own tasks  the quality of management  and Aspo as an employer by conducting an annual atmosphere survey. In 2021  Aspo started to use the People Power index  a new method of measuring job satisfaction  and it was also included in the Group’s sustainability goals. The operating environment remained fairly challenging in all businesses  and job satisfaction decreased slightly  while still being high: the Group achieved the rating of AA in 2022 (2021: AA+). However  the targeted level of AA+ was not achieved unlike in 2021. Aspo’s internal Compliance and Code of Conduct training includes anti-corruption issues and provides guidance for identifying any suspicious situations and practices considered unethical. Aspo’s goal is that all of the Group’s personnel complete the training every year. In 2022  approximately 100% (89%) of the Group’s employees completed Code of Conduct training and roughly 100% (88%) completed Compliance training.Operating environment and the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo’s operations Aspo’s operating environment changed dramatically during 2022 due to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. The invasion has caused considerable general uncertainties in markets  higher interest rates  lower trust among consumers  price inflation  higher energy prices in particular  as well as significant volatility in prices and exchange rates. Significantly suspended business operations in Ukraine due to the war have caused financial losses. The considerable damage to the energy distribution infrastructure in Ukraine made the situation even worse during the second half of 2022. The war drastically reduces operating conditions in eastern markets as a result of operational challenges and regulations  and selected values in particular. Aspo’s decision to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets  combined with the sanctions related to the war  has also reshaped Aspo’s logistics flows and operating models. ESL Shipping’s all operations have been suspended in Russia  and the released vessel capacity has been transferred to other operating areas. Telko has signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. At the end of 2022  Telko also signed a binding preliminary agreement on the sale of its subsidiary in Belarus to a member of its current management. A binding preliminary agreement was also signed with Timur Akhiyarov  a Russian-born private investor  after the end of the financial year on the sale of Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. Leipurin’s net sales in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan stood at EUR 24.7 million in 2022  comprising 19% of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2022 and less than 4% of Aspo Group’s net sales. Telko’s net sales in Russia and Belarus stood at EUR 58.0 million in 2022  comprising 22% of Telko’s total net sales in 2022 and less than 9% of Aspo Group’s net sales. The consolidated net sales of Telko and Leipurin in these countries accounted for roughly 13% of Aspo Group’s net sales in 2022 (16% of net sales in 2021). The international sanctions and Russia’s legislative measures prevent the transportation of goods and the transfer of payments which has reduced the net sales and profitability of the operations in Russia. In addition  decreases in the companies’ operations and personnel have reduced Russia’s role in Aspo’s business operations. The operating environment is expected to become even more challenging  and no rapid solution is in sight. The equity of the group companies in Russia is EUR 20.5 (16.6) million  comprising 14.3% (12.8%) of Aspo Group’s total equity. In Aspo Group  EUR 12.2 million in impairment losses associated with the equity of Russian companies have been recognized in the financial statements. Aspo’s assets in Russia mainly consist of cash and cash equivalents  inventories and accounts receivable. The number of employees in Aspo Group’s companies in Russia is decreasing  being 105 (193) at the end of the year. Rising interest and inflation rates  as well as weaker general economic estimates  have affected consumers’ purchasing behavior  for example  so that consumers have shifted from more expensive to more affordable products. While the coronavirus pandemic has been overshadowed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the news  it still has an impact on Aspo’s operating environment. For example  the global shortage of components  caused by the pandemic  has an impact on certain Aspo’s businesses  decelerating sales and the completion of orders. The markets are also characterized by disruptions in logistics flows and the low availability of certain products. The risk of infections must still be taken into account in daily operations especially among ESL Shipping’s crew members.

The eastern markets’ share of total net sales continued to decrease during the fourth quarter of 2022  mainly due to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and decisions to downsize operations in Russia and withdraw from the market as planned. As a result of the withdrawal from Russia  the division of Aspo’s main market areas will change at the beginning of 2023. According to the previously announced strategy  the company will direct its growth investments at western markets  and the eastern markets’ share of Aspo’s total net sales already decreased to 13.2% in the fourth quarter.Cash flow and financing The Group’s net cash flow from operating activities in January–December was EUR 67.7 (44.0) million. The cash flow of all businesses showed positive development during the year. The impact of the change in working capital on cash flow during the review period was EUR -6.7 (-22.0) million. The increase in working capital mainly comes from the advance payments for the vessels to be built in the ESL Shipping segment’s vessel pool and the customer receivables accumulated through high sales at the end of the year. This was partly compensated by the Telko segment’s working capital  which improved towards the year end. The free cash flow in January–December was EUR 34.4 (27.5) million. The amount of investments of EUR -17.8 (-15.9) million mainly included the ESL Shipping segment’s dockages and Green Coaster advance payments. In addition  the cash flow from investing activities includes EUR -17.9 million cash outflow on the acquisitions of Kobia  Mentum and Johan Steenks and a total of EUR 2.8 million in cash inflow from the sale of Espa and Vulganus as the most significant items.12/2022 12/2021 MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities  incl. lease liabilities 189.2 187.3 Cash and cash equivalents 33.5 17.7 Net interest-bearing debt 155.7 169.6 Net interest-bearing debt decreased to EUR 155.7 (169.6) million and gearing fell to 108.4% (131.0%). The Group’s equity ratio at the end of the review period was 34.7% (32.0%). The balance sheet strengthened as a result of improved profitability and the new hybrid instrument issued in June. Net financial expenses in January–December totaled EUR -6.3 (-3.9) million. Exchange rate changes  especially the strengthened value of the Russian ruble  increased financial expenses by EUR 1.6 million from the previous year. The average interest rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  was 3.3% (1.4%). The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents stood at EUR 33.5 (17.7) at the end of the review period  of which cash and cash equivalents related to businesses held for sale were EUR 11.8 million. Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program also remained wholly unused (5). During 2022  Aspo extended its maturity structure for interest-bearing loans. In September  AtoBatC AB signed an EUR 32.2 million loan agreement with Svenska Skeppshypotek. The loan’s maturity is 15 years  and it has not yet been withdrawn. The loan  together with the ten-year loan agreement of EUR 20 million singed in June with the Nordic Investment Bank  of which EUR 19.6 million have been withdrawn  finances ESL Shipping’s investment in a series of six new highly energy-efficient electric hybrid vessels. The project was launched in September 2021. In addition  Aspo restructured a bilateral bank loan of EUR 20 million  about to mature in 2023  with a new bilateral revolving credit facility which will mature in 2025. The loan agreement also includes two options for a one-year extension. In June  Aspo issued a new EUR 30 million hybrid instrument  with a coupon rate of 8.75% per annum. The hybrid instrument has no maturity  but the company may exercise an early redemption option in June 2025 at the earliest. Aspo’s earlier hybrid instrument of EUR 20 million was redeemed on May 2  2022.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operations Aspo and its subsidiaries are exposed to various risks and uncertainties  which are mainly identified and managed in Aspo's businesses. The most important risks and preparedness for them are summarized and reported to Aspo's Board of Directors through Aspo's Audit Committee. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine causes significant geopolitical uncertainties. It affects the general economic environment  including inflation  energy and raw material prices  interest rates  and consumers’ trust. The ongoing process to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets will change the Group’s structure significantly and will affect the revenue model of Aspo’s businesses in the long term. There are risks that the withdrawal from the selected markets causes additional costs or losses  and that funds cannot be transferred from the markets or that the withdrawal is unsuccessful in full or in part. It is also possible that the official approvals required for the withdrawal from the markets are not obtained for example due to changes is legislation or that they are at risk or fail for some other reason. Financial activities and the prevailing geopolitical uncertainties have caused the prices of many raw materials  components and logistics services to rise rapidly. While Aspo may benefit from the price increases temporarily  the prices of raw materials or rental capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Disruptions in logistics flows  longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes are also increasing risks. The rapid increase in inflation has generally caused pressure for salary increases  which in Finland can lead to labor disputes  which can also negatively affect Aspo's businesses. International sanctions and countersanctions have been imposed  which may also affect Aspo’s businesses directly or indirectly. The geopolitical tensions may escalate and cause a direct adverse impact on business operations  put payments at risk and even suspend business operations. If escalated  cyber incidents and disruptions in information systems may cause damage to business operations. In line with its renewed strategy  Aspo aims to increase its steady profit-making ability through acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial resources and consequently may reduce solvency. With its strategy  Aspo aims to reduce the impact of the possibly weakening general economic development on Aspo’s profit-making ability. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Aspo’s operations has been limited at the group level  even though it has been significant in the Leipurin segment. The current and any new coronavirus variants and their rapid spread may suspend business operations and cause financial losses through stoppages in global logistics chains  among other factors. Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation and knowledge  they involve significant risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO’S BUSINESS OPERATIONS ESL Shipping ESL Shipping is the leading dry bulk sea transport company operating in the Baltic Sea area. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 41 vessels with a total capacity of 425 000 deadweight tonnage (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (80% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 16 vessels (18%) were time chartered. ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service. 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 63.3 54.7 16 245.4 191.4 28 Operating profit  MEUR 10.2 9.8 4 38.1 26.8 42 Operating profit  % 16.1 17.9 15.5 14.0 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -0.4 0.7 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 10.6 9.8 8 37.4 26.8 40 Comparable operating profit  % 16.7 17.9 15.2 14.0 The fourth quarter of 2022 marked the best quarter in ESL Shipping’s history measured by the operating profit. Net sales increased by 16% from the previous year to EUR 63.3 (54.7) million. The comparable operating profit for the quarter increased by 8% to record-breaking EUR 10.6 (9.8) million. The operating profit of EUR 10.2 (9.8) million includes EUR -0.4 million in expenses associated with suspended operations in Russia. High demand in the shipping company’s main market areas  the shipping company’s long-term partnership strategy and the successful operations of the onshore and offshore personnel enabled the excellent results. Weather conditions were also favorable for operations. The comparable operating profit rate of 16.7% (17.9%) achieved during the fourth quarter was once again excellent. During the quarter  the prices of diesel and liquefied natural gas (LNG) used as ship fuels decreased from the previous quarter  while remaining roughly twice as high as in the comparative period. The high level of fuel surcharges increased net sales and reduced the operating profit rate  which is used as an indicator of relative profitability. During the fourth quarter  cargo volumes transported by ESL Shipping decreased slightly from the comparative period to 3.8 (3.9) million tons. The volume development was based on the transfer of raw material deliveries away from Russia which has extended transportation distances especially for energy coal. The final quarter is also normally the busiest season for energy transportation  but as a result of the exceptional situation involving the security of supply  the low availability of biofuels and longer transportation distances  the percentage of energy coal from all transportation operations tripled during the fourth quarter from the comparative period. The profitability of all the shipping company’s vessel categories was excellent during the fourth quarter. In fourth quarter  production plants of several contractual customers underwent relatively large maintenance stoppages and restricted production due to lower demand and high energy costs. High demand experienced in the energy industry enabled the vessels to continue to operate at full capacity during the fourth quarter. The spot cargo market decreased in all customer segments and vessel categories during the quarter. After operations in Russia were suspended  demand for ESL Shipping’s loading and unloading operations for vessels at sea shifted to the southern Baltic Sea where it was maintained by the high demand for energy coal transportation during the fourth quarter and congestion at ports suitable for large ocean liners. Six time-chartered vessels of the smaller vessel category were redelivered to their owners as the charter agreements ended at the end of the fourth quarter and as the price of an extended charter period became too high. The newbuilding project of ESL Shipping’s Swedish subsidiary AtoBatC Shipping AB    at the Chowgule & Company Private Limited shipyard in India proceeded as planned during the fourth quarter. Every other vessel in the series of 12 next-generation electric hybrid vessels will be sold  as announced earlier  to the company established by the pooling investor group. The first four new vessels are already under construction  and the first vessel is to be delivered during fall 2023. One larger vessel was docked for seven days during the fourth quarter and one smaller vessel was out of service for 26 days. In 2022  dockage days totaled 141 (229). The net sales of ESL Shipping in January–December increased from the comparative period by 28% to EUR 245.4 (191.4) million. The comparable operating profit was the highest in the company’s history at EUR 37.4 (26.8) million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 15.2% (14.0%). The operating profit rate clearly exceeded the long-term target of 14%. Comparability was affected by the gain from the sale of the barge Espa and costs associated with the suspended operations in Russia. Their impact on net results was EUR 0.7 million and  as a result  ESL Shipping’s operating profit amounted to EUR 38.1 (26.8) million and its operating profit rate was 15.5% (14.0%) for 2022 as a whole. The shipping company’s long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The aim is to halve carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. During 2022  ESL Shipping transported 14.7 (14.8) million tons of cargo  and its vessels consumed 819 988 (898 158) MWh of energy. CO2 emissions per transported ton decreased by 7.5% to 0.015 (0.016) tons of carbon dioxide per ton of cargo. The new energy-efficient operating models applied to port visits supported the positive development.ESL Shipping outlook for 2023 General macroeconomic uncertainties have increased in ESL Shipping’s main market areas. Higher inflation and slower economic growth increase demand and pricing pressure among the shipping company’s main customers. Finland’s labor market may experience unrest during the spring  and its impact through overtime bans and strikes may be significant on key customers and especially on the effectiveness of the transport chain. Global demand estimates in sea transportation markets and price levels of spot markets have decreased considerably from the previous year. On the other hand  the availability of vessel capacity suitable for round-the-year operations in the Baltic Sea is limited. Production volumes of ESL Shipping’s main customers is expected to be satisfactory  albeit slightly lower than in the previous year. Demand for energy deliveries outside Finland is expected to remain high during the first half of the year. In the forest industry  pulp delivery volumes are looking positive  but only satisfactory for sawn goods. Volumes are looking satisfactory in the steel industry. Now that deliveries of Russian raw materials have stopped  certain of the shipping company’s significant contractual customers are forced to seek new suppliers for part of their production input required in new geographic areas. Not all of these procurement routes have yet become stabilized which may cause an imbalance in ESL Shipping’s operations. The role of energy coal transportation is expected to decrease significantly when the preparation situation returns to normal and demand shifts towards other energy forms. The majority of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements with the exception of the Supramax vessels. Currently  the expectations of the lessors of the time-chartered vessels do not meet the realities in the shipping company’s main market areas which may cause further uncertainties in the availability of a suitable and sufficient tonnage. The impact of rising energy prices on ESL Shipping’s costs is compensated effectively through fuel clauses in long-term transportation agreements. Surveys show that ESL Shipping’s customer satisfaction is at an excellent level  similarly to the personnel’s commitment and job satisfaction. Activities to further improve customer and employee satisfaction  sustainability and occupational safety will continue. The shipping company’s investments in energy-efficient vessels will strengthen its competitiveness and market position in the future. ESL Shipping will continue the development of a fossil-free sea transportation ecosystem in line with the green transition and the vessels designed for it in cooperation with its key customers. The shipping company is participating in projects aimed to produce green hydrogen through renewable electricity and to further process it as fossil-free fuel for the shipping company’s vessels. During 2023  four larger and two smaller vessels will be docked for a total of approximately 100 days. Telko Telko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together. Its competitive edge is based on strong technical support  efficient logistics and local expert service. Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Russia  Belarus  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China. In October 2022  Telko signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. In December  Telko finalized the preliminary agreement to divest its subsidiary in Belarus  to a member of its current management. Both business transactions still need to be approved by the local authorities. Assets and liabilities related to these companies have been classified as assets and liabilities held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 standard at the end of the review period. 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 59.2 73.6 -20 267.4 268.8 -1 Operating profit  MEUR -7.7 4.4 -275 7.3 20.4 -64 Operating profit  % -13.0 6.0 2.7 7.6 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -9.0 -0.8 -13.5 -0.8 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.3 5.2 -75 20.8 21.2 -2 Comparable operating profit  % 2.2 7.1 7.8 7.9 During the fourth quarter  Telko’s net sales decreased steeply to EUR 59.2 (73.6) million. Telko’s net sales for the fourth quarter decreased after sales in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine dropped substantially from the previous year. Telko’s net sales outside Russia  Belarus and Ukraine increased. Demand remained stable in Telko’s all business operations. The comparable operating profit for the fourth quarter stood at EUR 1.3 (5.2) million  and the operating profit rate was 2.2% (7.1%). Net sales and operating profit decreased from the previous year  especially due to weak development and negative results in Russia. Telko’s result for the fourth quarter includes items affecting comparability  which reduced Telko’s operating profit by EUR 9.0 million in total. Impairment losses regarding companies in Russia and Belarus of EUR 9.3 million and other expenses of EUR 0.2 million were recognized relating to the withdrawal from Russia. In addition  the credit loss provision recognized from accounts receivable in Ukraine was reversed by EUR 0.5 million. The combined comparable operating profit of the above countries was slightly negative during the fourth quarter. Telko’s operating profit for the fourth quarter was EUR -7.7 (4.4) million. The operating profit rate was -13.0% (6.0%). Impairment losses associated with inventories  exchange rate losses  and costs related to corporate restructuring also had a negative impact on the operating profit. The net sales of the plastics business decreased by 25% during the fourth quarter to EUR 29.6 (39.7) million  mainly due to the decrease in Telko’s operations in Russia. In Telko’s European markets  demand for plastic polymers remained at a normal level in general. Sales outside Russia  Belarus and Ukraine increased slightly  regardless of the downward trend in prices. While the steep decline in the prices of volume plastics turned to an increase during the fourth quarter  the prices are still lower than during the corresponding period in the previous year. The prices of technical plastics decreased slightly during the fourth quarter but were clearly above the comparative period’s level. The acquisition of the operations of Johan Steenks  a Norwegian distributor of technical plastic raw materials and plastics  increased the net sales of the plastics business during the fourth quarter  while it had no significant impact on results. During the fourth quarter  the net sales of the chemicals business decreased by 32% to EUR 15.9 (23.4) million. Sales decreased steeply in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. The weak development especially in Ukraine resulted from the disruptions in the electricity distribution infrastructure due to the war which directly limited production. Total sales in other countries increased significantly  regardless of the decrease in prices. Prices started to increase during the fourth quarter. Telko’s chemicals business is divided between several customer groups which evens out any fluctuations in demand. During the fourth quarter  the net sales of the lubricants business increased by 31% to EUR 13.7 (10.5) million. Sales increased in all key product groups. The increase in sales resulted from high price levels  the acquisition of Mentum AS at the end of 2021  and very positively developed sales of industrial lubricants. Prices of lubricants increased slightly during the fourth quarter. Russia’s invasion in Ukraine did not have any direct impact on the lubricants business. Telko’s net sales in January–December decreased by 1% to EUR 267.4 (268.8) million. The full-year comparable operating profit of EUR 20.8 million was only slightly lower than the previous year’s record-high comparable operating profit (21.2). The comparable operating profit rate remained high at 7.8% (7.9%). Exchange rate losses of EUR 2.5 million reduced the operating profit. Telko’s full-year operating profit fell by 64% to EUR 7.3 (20.4) million. The operating profit rate was 2.7% (7.6%). Results decreased due to the warehouse destroyed in Ukraine  the impairment losses associated with companies in Russia and Belarus  and other costs arising from the withdrawal from Russia  which totaled EUR -13.5 million and have been reported as items affecting comparability.Telko outlook for 2023 As announced previously  Telko has agreed to divest its operations in Russia and Belarus. Telko’s net sales in Russia and Belarus were EUR 58.0 million in 2022  comprising 22% of Telko’s total net sales in 2022. Both sales transactions require approval by the local authorities. Telko expects the Russian transaction to be completed during the first quarter of 2023 but there is uncertainty involved. In 2023  Telko’s net sales and profit will be significantly lower than in the previous year due to the changed situation in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. In other countries  demand is expected to remain moderate  even though there will be differences between businesses. The prices of plastics and chemicals decreased steeply during the latter half of 2022  while still being clearly above the long-term average. It is assumed that the most significant price corrections took place during 2022  but the prices are expected to decrease slightly during the first half if energy prices do not experience a considerable increase. In high added value products  on which Telko focuses in accordance with its strategy  price changes are typically more moderate. Significant changes in prices have a short-term impact on margins. Demand for lubricants is expected to remain stable  and prices are expected to increase at least during the first half of 2023. In western markets  demand will involve uncertainties during the next few months. Demand indices have decreased in the construction and automotive industries in Europe. High energy prices and inflation rates will affect demand during the next few months  in particular. At the end of the year  demand will  above all  be affected by the general development of purchasing power in Europe. The lifting of coronavirus restrictions in China is expected to increase local demand. In addition  higher demand in China may have an impact on global price development during the first part of the year. In Central Asia  demand is expected to remain relatively high. Sales in Ukraine will be lower during the first half than in the previous year  while they are expected to be at the 2022 level during the rest of the year  depending completely on the development of the war. Telko will continue its activities to improve its operational efficiency and scalability. Inflation causes general increases in costs. On the other hand  cargo expenses  especially in Asia  will be materially lower than in the previous year. The recent structural arrangements continued when Telko announced on January 31  2023  that it will acquire Eltrex  a Polish company specialized in the distribution of chemicals. According to its strategy  Telko continues to accelerate its growth through acquisitions in addition to organic growth. Leipurin Leipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies  and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. Leipurin operates in nine countries that have been grouped into four business units  each being responsible for their financial performance: Finland  Sweden  Baltics  and East. Leipurin serves bakery  food industry and foodservice customers by providing raw materials and by supporting research and development and recipes for new products. The Leipurin segment’s other product categories include various supplies and machines for the same customer segments. The Leipurin segment uses leading international manufacturers as its raw material and machinery supply partners. On April 22  2022  Aspo announced that Leipurin will withdraw from its operations in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. In January 2023  Leipurin signed a binding preliminary agreement to sell its subsidiaries in these countries to a private investor. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities. Assets and liabilities related to these companies have been classified as assets and liabilities held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 standard at the end of the review period. 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 41.3 31.7 30 130.6 113.1 15 Operating profit  MEUR -4.3 -3.6 19 -4.8 -2.4 100 Operating profit  % -10.4 -11.4 -3.7 -2.1 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -5.4 -4.3 -8.1 -4.3 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.1 0.7 57 3.3 1.9 74 Comparable operating profit  % 2.7 2.2 2.5 1.7 Comparable operating profit excl.

Vulganus  % 2.7 2.3 3.2 2.2Leipurin’s operations were still affected by the restrictions in eastern markets due to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine  the high price inflation in global raw material markets  and challenges related to the availability of raw materials. Leipurin’s total net sales increased by 30% during the fourth quarter to EUR 41.3 (31.7) million. Figures for the comparative year included EUR 2.7 million in net sales of the discontinued machinery business in Russia and divested Vulganus Oy. The Finland business unit’s net sales increased by 8% to EUR 12.2 (11.3) million. In the Baltics  net sales increased by 18% to EUR 10.0 (8.5) million. Net sales of the East business unit decreased by 32% to EUR 6.2 (9.1) million due to the reduced product range  consisting only of local procurement. The decrease in the net sales of the East business unit was also significantly affected by the decrease in operations in Ukraine down to roughly 9% from the comparative year’s level. Sweden was established as a new business unit as a result of the acquisition of Kobia AB on September 1  and it accounted for EUR 12.9 million and approximately 31% of Leipurin’s net sales in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter  sales to bakeries increased by 41% to EUR 28.6 (20.3) million. Sales to the food industry increased by 35% to EUR 4.2 (3.1) million. The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets continued to have a significant impact on Leipurin’s sales during the fourth quarter. Measured in kilograms  the decrease in sales intensified in Finland  Sweden and the Baltics  whereas sales continued to be roughly half of the previous year’s level in the East business unit. The weak volume development is mainly driven by the decrease in consumers’ trust in the current market situation  in which energy costs and interest rates are especially rising steeply. The significant increase in living expenses continued in Finland  Sweden and the Baltics which reduced the inflation-adjusted sales volume of retail and strengthened the shift in consumers’ demand towards more affordable products. The positive development of profit margins continued  regardless of the negative trends in volumes. The comparable operating profit for the fourth quarter stood at EUR 1.1 (0.7) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.7% (2.2%). Leipurin’s comparable operating profit  excluding Vulganus  was EUR 1.1 (0.7) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.7% (2.3%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR -5.4 (-4.3) million  included costs and impairment losses arising from the withdrawal from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan  and costs associated with the reorganization of Leipurin’s group operations. The comparability of the comparative period was affected by animpairment loss recognized on goodwill. Leipurin’s operating loss for the fourth quarter was EUR -4.3 (-3.6) million. Reversal of a fair value allocation of inventories amounting to EUR -0.5 million which arised from the acquisition of Kobia  had a negative impact on the operating profit. In January–December  Leipurin’s net sales increased by 15% to EUR 130.6 (113.1) million. Figures for the comparative year included EUR 11.4 million in net sales of the discontinued machinery business in Russia and divested Vulganus Oy  which were EUR 7.1 million higher than in 2022  but the increase in raw material sales in western markets was particularly strong during the review period compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets had a significant impact on the euro-denominated increase in sales. Leipurin’s comparable operating profit in January–December 2022 was EUR 3.3 (1.9) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.5% (1.7%). Leipurin’s comparable operating profit  excluding Vulganus  was EUR 4.1 (2.4) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 3.2% (2.2%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR -8.1 (-4.3) million  were mainly related to the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine  the acquisition of Kobia  and the divestment of Vulganus. The reported operating profit was negative at EUR -4.8 (-2.4) million. Kobia’s impact on Leipurin’s operating profit was still negative due to the reversal of the EUR 0.5 million fair value allocation of inventories related to the acquisition. Vulganus was divested on June 30  2022. The loss arising from the divestment and the expenses related to it  totaling EUR -0.4 million  are reported under the Leipurin segment’s other operating expenses. Leipurin acquired all shares in Kobia AB  a Swedish distributor in the bakery industry  from the Swedish Abdon Group. Kobia AB comprises Leipurin’s new Sweden business unit  and it has been included in Aspo Group’s figures since September 1  2022. Kobia’s annual net sales are approximately EUR 50 million  and its operating profit rate is roughly 3%. The acquisition strengthens Leipurin’s position as the leading company in the Baltic Sea region. Leipurin outlook for 2023 The war in Ukraine and the decision to withdraw operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan will have a significant impact on Leipurin’s net sales and results. Leipurin’s net sales in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan were EUR 24.7 million in 2022  comprising 19% of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2022. The divestment of the operations in the eastern markets still needs to be approved by the local authorities. Leipurin expects the transaction to be completed during the first half of 2023 but there is uncertainty involved. The expansion to Sweden through the acquisition of Kobia AB will increase Leipurin’s annual net sales by roughly EUR 50 million and produce considerable synergy benefits in the development of the product range  and in the supply chain and procurement. It also enables partners to be served in a larger geographic area. The integration of operations has progressed according to plans. Inflation and the rising energy prices  in particular  have a negative impact on demand for more expensive products  potentially presenting profitability challenges among the bakery segment’s customers. The decreased purchasing power may have a negative impact on demand for artisanal bakeries  as consumers prefer more affordable products. The upward trend is expected to continue in the prices of main raw material categories  even though the rapid inflation during the review period is expected to decelerate considerably. This is expected to take place during the first half of 2023. Despite these challenges  Leipurin sees that the market will offer a highly stable environment in the long term and also opportunities for organic growth in selected market segments. In addition  the profitability program that was launched earlier develops the organization's ability to lead with information and helps to improve financial performance in particular. The program focuses both on selected growth clusters and on improving the efficiency of operations. This program is expected to contribute to improving Leipurin’s financial development. The impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic on the global supply chains  the availability of certain raw materials and general delivery times will continue. The management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges will increase risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers. Other operations Other operations include Aspo Group’s administration  finance and ICT service center. The comparable operating profit of other operations was EUR -1.8 (-1.9) million during the fourth quarter. The reported operating profit of EUR -1.9 (-1.9) million includes EUR -0.1 million in restructuring expenses affecting comparability. The comparable operating profit for 2022 was EUR -6.0 (-7.9) million. The reported operating profit was EUR -6.7 (-7.9) million  including EUR -0.7 million in items affecting comparability that are mainly related to the additional share-based remuneration granted to Aspo’s previous CEO and restructuring expenses.COMPANY INFORMATION Aspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

The acquisition expands Leipurin’s geographical presence in the Northern European market. In 2021  Kobia’s net sales amounted to approximately EUR 50 million and its operating profit rate was approximately 3%. The acquisition of Kobia AB included also the properties owned by Kobia. Aspo actively explores options to sell and lease back the properties. The potential transactions are significantly affected by market conditions. The purchase price of EUR 15.7 million was paid fully in cash. The assets and liabilities of the acquired company were measured at fair value on the acquisition date. A fair value allocation of EUR 9.7 million was made on the properties  a fair value allocation of EUR 0.4 million was made on the intangible assets based on customer relationships  and the fair value adjustment relating to inventories was EUR 0.5 million. The deferred tax liability arising from the fair value adjustments was EUR 2.2 million. The carrying amount of the other acquired assets and liabilities were deemed to correspond to their fair values. A goodwill balance of EUR 0.1 million resulted from the acquisition. The acquisition-related costs of approximately one million euro were recognized in the Leipurin segment’s other operating expenses.

Johan Steenks is a distributor of technical plastic raw materials and additives for plastics  and it has an established customer base in the Norwegian markets and a number of well-known principals. The company’s annual net sales are roughly EUR 5 million. The business acquisition had no significant impact on Telko’s net sales or results during the final quarter of the year. The purchase price was approximately EUR 2.0 million  of which EUR 0.7 million were allocated to inventories and the remaining EUR 1.3 million were recognized as an increase in goodwill. The cash flow from the acquisition in 2022 was EUR -1.9 million.Discontinued operations and other non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale In October 17  Telko signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. The sales price is approximately EUR 9.5 million. The transaction still needs to be approved by the Russian authorities. Telko’s company in Russia has been classified as held for sale since October 2022 when the preliminary agreement on the sale was signed. Telko’s company in Belarus has been classified as held for sale since December 2022 when the agreement on the sale was signed with the company’s acting management. Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan have been classified as held for sale since December 31  2022 when their divestment started to seem probable. A binding preliminary agreement on their sale was signed on January 17  2023 with Timur Akhiyarov  a Russian-born private investor. The sales price is approximately EUR 8.4 million. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities. The Kauko operating segment and Vulganus Oy  part of the Leipurin segment  were defined as non-core businesses for Aspo and classified as held for sale in December 2021. Vulganus was sold to KÖNIG Maschinen GmbH  the leading manufacturer of bakery machines in Austria  on June 30  2022. The results of Vulganus  including the divestment loss of EUR -0.4 million   are reported as part of the Leipurin segment’s figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The Kauko operating segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in accordance with the IFRS 5 standard  and its figures are reported separately from the figures of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. In the statement of comprehensive income  the figures of the comparative periods have been restated. Kauko Oy was sold to Signal Partners Oy on October 31  2022.

Therefore  the profit from discontinued operations does not include all internal administrative charges of Aspo Group allocated to the Kauko operating segment. As a result  the profit from discontinued operations for the financial year is EUR 0.3 (0.4) million higher than the Kauko operating segment’s profit. An impairment loss of EUR -1.3 million was recognized on Kauko’s goodwill in June 2022. The profit from discontinued operations also includes the EUR -1.2 million loss on sale of Kauko Oy recognized during the fourth quarter. An impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million was recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter of 2021.

The cash flow from the divestment of Kauko Oy in 2022 was EUR -1.0 million  and it is included in the cash flow from investing activities. The costs to sell of EUR -0.4 million are included in the cash flow from operating activities. The cash flow from financing mainly consists of repayments of interest-bearing loans.

The reporting of balance sheet items on separate rows starts at the time of classification  therefore the figures of the comparative period have not been restated. In 2022  assets and liabilities classified as held for sale included the assets and liabilities of the companies held for sale in eastern markets. The classification includes the share of the assets and liabilities of Aspo Group that belong to the companies held for sale  excluding internal assets and liabilities that have been eliminated. In 2021  assets and liabilities of discontinued operations included the figures of the Kauko operating segment. The other assets held for sale at the end of 2021 consisted of Vulganus Oy’s assets and liabilities. The recognition of depreciation and amortization expense ended on December 1  2021  for Kauko and Vulganus when they were classified as held for sale. The depreciation and amortization expense was recognized as part of sales losses in conjunction with the divestment of the companies. Telko Russia was classified as held for sale on October 31  2022  and the other companies held for sale in eastern markets on December 31  2022. The recognition of depreciation and amortization expense ended at the time of the classification as held for sale. At the time of classification as held for sale  the net assets of the companies in eastern markets were measured at fair value less cost to sell  which was lower than the carrying amount. As a result  an impairment loss of EUR 9.4 million was recognized in the Telko segment and EUR 5.2 million in the Leipurin segment during the fourth quarter  which are reported as part of the Telko and Leipurin segments’ figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations.

In addition  an impairment loss was recognized on goodwill  determined in based on the ratio between the fair values of the divested companies and the segment. Restricted cash and cash equivalents In Russia  Aspo Group has EUR 13.5 million in cash and cash equivalents  the use of which is strictly restricted by the Russian Government and controlled by banks. The value of these cash and cash equivalents in the Group is EUR 11.5 million  as an impairment loss of EUR 2.0 million was recognized on the cash and cash equivalents in conjunction with the IFRS 5 classification of the companies in Russia. Cash and cash equivalents in Russia are presented under assets held for sale on the balance sheet. It was still possible to pay dividends and make commercial payments during the fourth quarter of 2022. According to our understanding  the purchase prices of the operations held for sale in eastern markets can be transferred in conjunction with their sale. However  there is a risk that the Group does not have access to the cash and cash equivalents in full in Russia  which is why they must be considered restricted cash and cash equivalents in accordance with IAS 7. Events after the review period On January 17  2023  Leipurin signed a binding preliminary agreement to sell all shares in its subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan to Timur Akhiyarov. Russian-born Akhiyarov will invest in Leipurin’s operations in eastern markets as a private investor. The sales price is approximately EUR 8.4 million. Rights to Leipurin’s name and trademarks are not included in the transaction. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities. The Belarusian subsidiaries of Telko and Leipurin have been added to the list of companies whose transfer of shares are prohibited by a decision issued by the Council of Ministers of Belarus at the end of January 2023. Because of this  it is deemed unlikely that the sale of Telko's Belarusian business would proceed. This does not change Aspo Group's previously published assessment of the financial effects of the divestment. Leipurin’s Belarusian subsidiary is part of an agreement according to which the share capitals of Leipurin’s subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan would be sold to the same buyer. The decision of the Council of Ministers of Belarus does not change the previously published assessment of the financial effects of the transaction  nor does it prevent the sale of Leipurin’s Russian and Kazakh subsidiaries. On January 31  Telko acquired a Polish distribution company Eltrex. Eltrex is a distributor of specialty chemicals and industrial packaging materials  and its annual net sales are approximately 8 million euros and operating profit slightly under one million euros. On February 9  2023  Leipurin completed a sale and lease back agreement for its warehouse property in Gothenburg  Sweden. The property came into Leipurin’s ownership via the Kobia acquisition that took place on 1 September 2022. The buyer of the property is Revelop  a Swedish real estate investor. As a result of the sale and lease back transaction  Aspo recognizes a sales gain of approximately EUR 0.4 million. According to the terms of the agreement  Leipurin leases the property for five years. The transaction is close to cost neutral  as the depreciation expense of the assets owned will be replaced by depreciation and interest expense for the leased assets of similar size.

In addition  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to decide on another dividend distribution in the maximum amount of EUR 0.23 per share on a later date. Therefore  a maximum of EUR 0.46 (0.45) would be distributed in dividends for the 2022 financial year.More information about the proposed dividend distribution is available under section “Dividend proposal”.Key figures 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Net sales  Group total  MEUR 164.6 163.2 652.6 586.4 Net sales from continuing operations  MEUR 163.8 160.0 643.4 573.3 ESL Shipping  operating profit  MEUR 10.2 9.8 38.1 26.8 Telko  operating profit  MEUR -7.7 4.4 7.3 20.4 Leipurin  operating profit  MEUR -4.3 -3.6 -4.8 -2.4 Other operations  operating profit  MEUR -1.9 -1.9 -6.7 -7.9 Operating profit from continuing operations  MEUR -3.7 8.7 33.9 36.9 Operating profit from continuing operations  % -2.3 5.4 5.3 6.4 Operating profit from discontinued operations  MEUR -1.1 0.1 -2.7 -3.0 Operating profit  Group total  MEUR -4.8 8.8 31.2 33.9 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -16.1 -5.1 -24.1 -8.5 Comparable operating profit  Group total  MEUR 11.3 13.9 55.3 42.4 Comparable operating profit  Group total  % 6.9 8.5 8.5 7.2 Profit before taxes from continuing operations  MEUR -3.0 7.7 27.6 33.0 Profit for the period  MEUR -5.4 5.7 20.7 25.3 Profit from continuing operations  MEUR -4.3 5.6 23.5 28.3 Profit from discontinued operations  MEUR -1.1 0.1 -2.8 -3.0 Earnings per share (EPS)  EUR -0.21 0.17 0.61 0.76 EPS from continuing operations  EUR -0.17 0.17 0.70 0.86 EPS from discontinued operations  EUR -0.04 0.00 -0.09 -0.10 Net cash from operating activities  MEUR 22.0 10.7 67.7 44.0 Free cash flow  MEUR 16.5 4.1 34.4 27.5 Return on equity (ROE)  % 15.2 20.8 Equity ratio  % 34.7 32.0 Gearing  % 108.4 131.0 Equity per share  EUR 4.58 4.14Rolf Jansson  CEO of Aspo Group  comments on the fourth quarter and the whole year 2022:In the light of financial figures  2022 was a success and in many ways record-breaking. Aspo Group’s net sales increased to EUR 652.6 million  up by roughly 11% from the previous year. The comparable operating profit for 2022 increased to a record EUR 55.3 million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 8.5%. Both the increase in net sales and our comparable operating profit exceeded the financial targets set for the Group.Aspo’s net sales in October–December stood at EUR 164.6 million  and the comparable operating profit was EUR 11.3 million. ESL Shipping especially supported the positive development of net sales and operating profit  with its record-breaking fourth quarter crowning its overall excellent year. The strong growth of Leipurin’s net sales during the fourth quarter was supported not only by high inflation rates  but also by the acquisition of the Swedish company Kobia AB at the beginning of September. Telko’s comparable operating profit in October–December was below the normal level which was due to the direct and reflected effects of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Eastern trade. Apart from the eastern markets  Telko’s net sales developed positively.The year 2022 turned out to be highly different from what we still assumed at the beginning of the year. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dramatically changed the lives of many of our employees  and our entire operating environment changed drastically.Already in spring  we decided to withdraw from all our operations in Russia and from other selected eastern markets. The prerequisites for responsible business had vanished  and it became clear that we would set our sights even more firmly on western markets in accordance with our strategy updated at the end of 2021. We will continue to operate in Ukraine  and we want to support its development and do our part to help rebuild the country.In summer  we divested Leipurin’s machinery business Vulganus  and at the end of October  the divestment of Kauko was finalized. At the same time  we focused on developing our key businesses through acquisitions according to our compounder strategy  of which the acquisition of Kobia by Leipurin and Telko’s recent acquisitions were the most significant. During the year  we also made strategic investments  the most important of which was ESL Shipping’s decision to invest in new Green Coaster vessels using a pooling arrangement.We are heading to 2023 from a good position  and we will continue the determined implementation of our strategy. I believe that we can generate strong cash flow even in this challenging market environment and  in accordance with our financial guidance  we expect Aspo’s comparable operating profit to be higher than EUR 35 million in 2023. We continue to boost organic growth through strategic acquisitions.Thanks for Aspo’s excellent results in 2022 go to our entire personnel. I am particularly pleased and grateful for the dedication our personnel showed in supporting our colleagues in areas ravaged by the war and in ensuring their safety.ASPO GROUPFinancial results and targetsAspo’s financial targets announced on December 1  2021:Annual increase in net sales: 5–10% a yearOperating profit: 8%Return on equity: more than 20%Gearing: less than 130%With regard to Aspo’s businesses  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%.In 2022  the Group’s targets were reached well overall. Aspo Group’s operating profit increased by 11%. The comparable operating profit rate was 8.5% (7.2%)  clearly exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Return on equity remained at the level of 15.2% (20.8%) due to the items affecting comparability of EUR -24.1 million that mainly consisted of additional costs and impairment losses arising from Russia’s invasion in Ukraine  and whose negative impact on return on equity was roughly 15.6 percentage points. Aspo’s gearing decreased to 108.4% (131.0%)  well below the target level.Aspo Group’s comparable result for continuing and discontinued operationsAspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit is calculated by adjusting the reported operating profit with rare and material items affecting the operating profit. These include impairment losses  sales gains from vessels  and financial losses caused by Russia’s invasion in Ukraine.In December 2021  Aspo announced that Kauko operating segment was defined not being part of Aspo’s core operations  and Kauko was classified as a discontinued operation. On October 31  2022  Kauko was divested outside the Group  and its accumulated earnings until that date and the divestment loss are presented in the profit from discontinued operations  separate from the results of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. However  Kauko’s results are included in Aspo Group’s total figures and comparable operating profit.Telko’s companies in Russia and Belarus  and Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan are classified as held for sale in the 2022 financial statements (eastern businesses held for sale below). The results of the eastern businesses held for sale are reported as part of Telko and Leipurin  as well as Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The assets and liabilities of the eastern businesses held for sale are presented on the balance sheet separately as assets and liabilities held for sale. When the eastern businesses were classified as held for sale  they were measured at fair value less cost to sell  resulting in the recognition of impairment losses totaling EUR 14.5 million in the fourth quarter  reported as items affecting comparability. On divestment  the recognition of the translation differences of the eastern businesses as part of sales losses as well as a possible change the fair value of the eastern businesses compared with the estimates made in the financial statements will also have a negative impact on the operating profit. On the closing date  the amount of the translation differences of the eastern businesses held for sale was EUR -11.8 million. The amount fluctuates according to changes in exchange rates until the date of sale. The reclassification of the translation differences from the translation difference reserve to the result for the period has no impact on Aspo Group’s total equity.Net sales and operating profit margin  Group total 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales  Group total 164.6 163.2 652.6 586.4 Net sales  continuing operations 163.8 160.0 643.4 573.3 Net sales  discontinued operations 0.8 3.2 9.2 13.1 Operating profit  Group total -4.8 8.8 31.2 33.9 Operating profit  Group total  % -2.9 5.4 4.8 5.8 Items affecting comparability*) -16.1 -5.1 -24.1 -8.5 Comparable operating profit  Group total 11.3 13.9 55.3 42.4 Comparable operating profit  Group total  % 6.9 8.5 8.5 7.2Operating profit and comparable operating profit  Group total 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping  operating profit 10 2 9 8 38 1 26 8 Telko  operating profit -7 7 4 4 7 3 20 4 Leipurin  operating profit -4 3 -3 6 -4 8 -2 4 Other operations  operating profit -1 9 -1 9 -6 7 -7 9 Operating profit from continuing operations -3 7 8 7 33 9 36 9 Operating profit from discontinued operations -1 1 0 1 -2 7 -3 0 Operating profit  Group total -4 8 8 8 31 2 33 9 Items affecting comparability*) -16 1 -5 1 -24 1 -8 5 Comparable operating profit  Group total 11 3 13 9 55 3 42 4*) Items affecting comparability  MEUR ESL Telko Leipurin Other Kauko Total Shipping operations Sale of Espa 1 5 1 5 Inventory in Ukraine -2 6 -0 7 -3 3 Accounts receivable in Ukraine -0 5 -0 1 -0 6 Impairment losses -9 3 -5 0 -1 3 -15 6 Withdrawal from Russia -0 8 -1 1 -0 6 -2 5 Divestment losses -0 4 -1 2 -1 6 Other -1 3 -0 7 -2 0 Total 0 7 -13 5 -8 1 -0 7 -2 5 -24 1In 2022  items affecting comparability totaled EUR -24.1 million  of which EUR -20.7 million resulted from the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo Group’s business operations. Items affecting comparability relating to the Kauko segment totaled EUR -2.5 million  and they are reported in the profit from discontinued operations. Other items affecting comparability totaled EUR -0.9 million.Of the items affecting comparability during the fourth quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -16.1 million  EUR -14.3 million were related to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and its consequences. Of the items  EUR -0.4 million were recognized for the ESL Shipping segment  EUR -9.0 for Telko  and EUR -5.0 million for Leipurin. Items affecting comparability relating to reorganizations were EUR -0.4 million in the Leipurin segment and EUR -0.1 million in other operations. In addition  Kauko’s sales loss of EUR -1.2 million is included in the items affecting comparability and reported as part of the results of discontinued operations.Items affecting the comparability in 2021  totaling EUR -8.5 million  included the impairment loss of EUR -4.3 million recognized on Leipurin’s goodwill during the final quarter  and the impairment loss and restoration provision of EUR -0.8 million recognized on the fixed assets of Telko’s terminal in Rauma  as well as the impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter  which is reported as part of the results of discontinued operations.SustainabilitySustainability is a material factor which guides Aspo’s management system and especially the company’s investments. Aspo’s businesses aim to be pioneers in sustainability in their respective sectors. To support the sustainability commitments  Aspo published new environmental  social and corporate governance (ESG) goals for the Group and its businesses in December 2021. The key goal is to reduce emission intensity  CO2e (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) is 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. According to the green transition in the shipping industry  ESL Shipping is engaged in close and long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide fossil-free sea transportation for its key customers in the future. ESL Shipping invests in twelve new generation electric hybrid vessels  half of which will remain in its own ownership and half will be transferred to the other party of the pooling arrangement. The investment is significant in terms of monetary value  but above all  it helps the shipping company move towards its emissions target.During the past 12 months  emission intensity improved further to 0.33 (0.42)  driven by the increase in net sales and operational efficiency.Another key goal was a higher level of safety  with the Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) being 8.1 (8.8) during the past 12 months. Even though TRIF improved from the previous year  we did not reach the target of 7.0 set for 2022.Aspo regularly assesses the satisfaction of employees with their own tasks  the quality of management  and Aspo as an employer by conducting an annual atmosphere survey. In 2021  Aspo started to use the People Power index  a new method of measuring job satisfaction  and it was also included in the Group’s sustainability goals. The operating environment remained fairly challenging in all businesses  and job satisfaction decreased slightly  while still being high: the Group achieved the rating of AA in 2022 (2021: AA+). However  the targeted level of AA+ was not achieved unlike in 2021.Aspo’s internal Compliance and Code of Conduct training includes anti-corruption issues and provides guidance for identifying any suspicious situations and practices considered unethical. Aspo’s goal is that all of the Group’s personnel complete the training every year. In 2022  approximately 100% (89%) of the Group’s employees completed Code of Conduct training and roughly 100% (88%) completed Compliance training.Operating environment and the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo’s operationsAspo’s operating environment changed dramatically during 2022 due to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. The invasion has caused considerable general uncertainties in markets  higher interest rates  lower trust among consumers  price inflation  higher energy prices in particular  as well as significant volatility in prices and exchange rates.Significantly suspended business operations in Ukraine due to the war have caused financial losses. The considerable damage to the energy distribution infrastructure in Ukraine made the situation even worse during the second half of 2022. The war drastically reduces operating conditions in eastern markets as a result of operational challenges and regulations  and selected values in particular. Aspo’s decision to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets  combined with the sanctions related to the war  has also reshaped Aspo’s logistics flows and operating models.ESL Shipping’s all operations have been suspended in Russia  and the released vessel capacity has been transferred to other operating areas. Telko has signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. At the end of 2022  Telko also signed a binding preliminary agreement on the sale of its subsidiary in Belarus to a member of its current management. A binding preliminary agreement was also signed with Timur Akhiyarov  a Russian-born private investor  after the end of the financial year on the sale of Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan.Leipurin’s net sales in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan stood at EUR 24.7 million in 2022  comprising 19% of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2022 and less than 4% of Aspo Group’s net sales. Telko’s net sales in Russia and Belarus stood at EUR 58.0 million in 2022  comprising 22% of Telko’s total net sales in 2022 and less than 9% of Aspo Group’s net sales. The consolidated net sales of Telko and Leipurin in these countries accounted for roughly 13% of Aspo Group’s net sales in 2022 (16% of net sales in 2021).The international sanctions and Russia’s legislative measures prevent the transportation of goods and the transfer of payments which has reduced the net sales and profitability of the operations in Russia. In addition  decreases in the companies’ operations and personnel have reduced Russia’s role in Aspo’s business operations. The operating environment is expected to become even more challenging  and no rapid solution is in sight.The equity of the group companies in Russia is EUR 20.5 (16.6) million  comprising 14.3% (12.8%) of Aspo Group’s total equity. In Aspo Group  EUR 12.2 million in impairment losses associated with the equity of Russian companies have been recognized in the financial statements. Aspo’s assets in Russia mainly consist of cash and cash equivalents  inventories and accounts receivable. The number of employees in Aspo Group’s companies in Russia is decreasing  being 105 (193) at the end of the year.Rising interest and inflation rates  as well as weaker general economic estimates  have affected consumers’ purchasing behavior  for example  so that consumers have shifted from more expensive to more affordable products.While the coronavirus pandemic has been overshadowed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the news  it still has an impact on Aspo’s operating environment. For example  the global shortage of components  caused by the pandemic  has an impact on certain Aspo’s businesses  decelerating sales and the completion of orders. The markets are also characterized by disruptions in logistics flows and the low availability of certain products. The risk of infections must still be taken into account in daily operations especially among ESL Shipping’s crew members.Net sales by market area  continuing operations 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Share 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Share MEUR MEUR % MEUR MEUR % Finland 58.6 45.4 35.8 224.4 175.2 34.9 Scandinavia 38.6 32.2 23.6 137.6 109.4 21.4 Baltic countries 18.2 16 11.1 67.8 54.8 10.5 Russia  other CIS countries and Ukraine 21.6 43.9 13.2 118.2 155.2 18.4 Other countries 26.8 22.5 16.3 95.4 78.7 14.8 Total 163.8 160 100 643.4 573.3 100During 2022  Aspo has reported its net sales by market area with the following division: Finland  Scandinavia  the Baltic region  and eastern markets (Russia  other CIS countries  and Ukraine). The eastern markets’ share of total net sales continued to decrease during the fourth quarter of 2022  mainly due to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and decisions to downsize operations in Russia and withdraw from the market as planned. As a result of the withdrawal from Russia  the division of Aspo’s main market areas will change at the beginning of 2023. According to the previously announced strategy  the company will direct its growth investments at western markets  and the eastern markets’ share of Aspo’s total net sales already decreased to 13.2% in the fourth quarter.Cash flow and financingThe Group’s net cash flow from operating activities in January–December was EUR 67.7 (44.0) million. The cash flow of all businesses showed positive development during the year. The impact of the change in working capital on cash flow during the review period was EUR -6.7 (-22.0) million. The increase in working capital mainly comes from the advance payments for the vessels to be built in the ESL Shipping segment’s vessel pool and the customer receivables accumulated through high sales at the end of the year. This was partly compensated by the Telko segment’s working capital  which improved towards the year end. The free cash flow in January–December was EUR 34.4 (27.5) million. The amount of investments of EUR -17.8 (-15.9) million mainly included the ESL Shipping segment’s dockages and Green Coaster advance payments. In addition  the cash flow from investing activities includes EUR -17.9 million cash outflow on the acquisitions of Kobia  Mentum and Johan Steenks and a total of EUR 2.8 million in cash inflow from the sale of Espa and Vulganus as the most significant items.12/2022 12/2021 MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities  incl. lease liabilities 189.2 187.3 Cash and cash equivalents 33.5 17.7 Net interest-bearing debt 155.7 169.6Net interest-bearing debt decreased to EUR 155.7 (169.6) million and gearing fell to 108.4% (131.0%). The Group’s equity ratio at the end of the review period was 34.7% (32.0%). The balance sheet strengthened as a result of improved profitability and the new hybrid instrument issued in June.Net financial expenses in January–December totaled EUR -6.3 (-3.9) million. Exchange rate changes  especially the strengthened value of the Russian ruble  increased financial expenses by EUR 1.6 million from the previous year. The average interest rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  was 3.3% (1.4%).The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents stood at EUR 33.5 (17.7) at the end of the review period  of which cash and cash equivalents related to businesses held for sale were EUR 11.8 million. Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program also remained wholly unused (5).During 2022  Aspo extended its maturity structure for interest-bearing loans. In September  AtoBatC AB signed an EUR 32.2 million loan agreement with Svenska Skeppshypotek. The loan’s maturity is 15 years  and it has not yet been withdrawn. The loan  together with the ten-year loan agreement of EUR 20 million singed in June with the Nordic Investment Bank  of which EUR 19.6 million have been withdrawn  finances ESL Shipping’s investment in a series of six new highly energy-efficient electric hybrid vessels. The project was launched in September 2021. In addition  Aspo restructured a bilateral bank loan of EUR 20 million  about to mature in 2023  with a new bilateral revolving credit facility which will mature in 2025. The loan agreement also includes two options for a one-year extension.In June  Aspo issued a new EUR 30 million hybrid instrument  with a coupon rate of 8.75% per annum. The hybrid instrument has no maturity  but the company may exercise an early redemption option in June 2025 at the earliest. Aspo’s earlier hybrid instrument of EUR 20 million was redeemed on May 2  2022.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operationsAspo and its subsidiaries are exposed to various risks and uncertainties  which are mainly identified and managed in Aspo's businesses. The most important risks and preparedness for them are summarized and reported to Aspo's Board of Directors through Aspo's Audit Committee.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine causes significant geopolitical uncertainties. It affects the general economic environment  including inflation  energy and raw material prices  interest rates  and consumers’ trust.The ongoing process to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets will change the Group’s structure significantly and will affect the revenue model of Aspo’s businesses in the long term. There are risks that the withdrawal from the selected markets causes additional costs or losses  and that funds cannot be transferred from the markets or that the withdrawal is unsuccessful in full or in part. It is also possible that the official approvals required for the withdrawal from the markets are not obtained for example due to changes is legislation or that they are at risk or fail for some other reason.Financial activities and the prevailing geopolitical uncertainties have caused the prices of many raw materials  components and logistics services to rise rapidly. While Aspo may benefit from the price increases temporarily  the prices of raw materials or rental capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Disruptions in logistics flows  longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes are also increasing risks. The rapid increase in inflation has generally caused pressure for salary increases  which in Finland can lead to labor disputes  which can also negatively affect Aspo's businesses.International sanctions and countersanctions have been imposed  which may also affect Aspo’s businesses directly or indirectly. The geopolitical tensions may escalate and cause a direct adverse impact on business operations  put payments at risk and even suspend business operations. If escalated  cyber incidents and disruptions in information systems may cause damage to business operations.In line with its renewed strategy  Aspo aims to increase its steady profit-making ability through acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial resources and consequently may reduce solvency. With its strategy  Aspo aims to reduce the impact of the possibly weakening general economic development on Aspo’s profit-making ability.The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Aspo’s operations has been limited at the group level  even though it has been significant in the Leipurin segment. The current and any new coronavirus variants and their rapid spread may suspend business operations and cause financial losses through stoppages in global logistics chains  among other factors.Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation and knowledge  they involve significant risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO’S BUSINESS OPERATIONSESL ShippingESL Shipping is the leading dry bulk sea transport company operating in the Baltic Sea area. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 41 vessels with a total capacity of 425 000 deadweight tonnage (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (80% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 16 vessels (18%) were time chartered. ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service.10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 63.3 54.7 16 245.4 191.4 28 Operating profit  MEUR 10.2 9.8 4 38.1 26.8 42 Operating profit  % 16.1 17.9 15.5 14.0 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -0.4 0.7 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 10.6 9.8 8 37.4 26.8 40 Comparable operating profit  % 16.7 17.9 15.2 14.0The fourth quarter of 2022 marked the best quarter in ESL Shipping’s history measured by the operating profit. Net sales increased by 16% from the previous year to EUR 63.3 (54.7) million. The comparable operating profit for the quarter increased by 8% to record-breaking EUR 10.6 (9.8) million. The operating profit of EUR 10.2 (9.8) million includes EUR -0.4 million in expenses associated with suspended operations in Russia.High demand in the shipping company’s main market areas  the shipping company’s long-term partnership strategy and the successful operations of the onshore and offshore personnel enabled the excellent results. Weather conditions were also favorable for operations. The comparable operating profit rate of 16.7% (17.9%) achieved during the fourth quarter was once again excellent. During the quarter  the prices of diesel and liquefied natural gas (LNG) used as ship fuels decreased from the previous quarter  while remaining roughly twice as high as in the comparative period. The high level of fuel surcharges increased net sales and reduced the operating profit rate  which is used as an indicator of relative profitability.During the fourth quarter  cargo volumes transported by ESL Shipping decreased slightly from the comparative period to 3.8 (3.9) million tons. The volume development was based on the transfer of raw material deliveries away from Russia which has extended transportation distances especially for energy coal. The final quarter is also normally the busiest season for energy transportation  but as a result of the exceptional situation involving the security of supply  the low availability of biofuels and longer transportation distances  the percentage of energy coal from all transportation operations tripled during the fourth quarter from the comparative period.The profitability of all the shipping company’s vessel categories was excellent during the fourth quarter. In fourth quarter  production plants of several contractual customers underwent relatively large maintenance stoppages and restricted production due to lower demand and high energy costs. High demand experienced in the energy industry enabled the vessels to continue to operate at full capacity during the fourth quarter. The spot cargo market decreased in all customer segments and vessel categories during the quarter. After operations in Russia were suspended  demand for ESL Shipping’s loading and unloading operations for vessels at sea shifted to the southern Baltic Sea where it was maintained by the high demand for energy coal transportation during the fourth quarter and congestion at ports suitable for large ocean liners.Six time-chartered vessels of the smaller vessel category were redelivered to their owners as the charter agreements ended at the end of the fourth quarter and as the price of an extended charter period became too high.The newbuilding project of ESL Shipping’s Swedish subsidiary AtoBatC Shipping AB    at the Chowgule & Company Private Limited shipyard in India proceeded as planned during the fourth quarter. Every other vessel in the series of 12 next-generation electric hybrid vessels will be sold  as announced earlier  to the company established by the pooling investor group. The first four new vessels are already under construction  and the first vessel is to be delivered during fall 2023.One larger vessel was docked for seven days during the fourth quarter and one smaller vessel was out of service for 26 days. In 2022  dockage days totaled 141 (229).The net sales of ESL Shipping in January–December increased from the comparative period by 28% to EUR 245.4 (191.4) million. The comparable operating profit was the highest in the company’s history at EUR 37.4 (26.8) million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 15.2% (14.0%). The operating profit rate clearly exceeded the long-term target of 14%. Comparability was affected by the gain from the sale of the barge Espa and costs associated with the suspended operations in Russia. Their impact on net results was EUR 0.7 million and  as a result  ESL Shipping’s operating profit amounted to EUR 38.1 (26.8) million and its operating profit rate was 15.5% (14.0%) for 2022 as a whole.The shipping company’s long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The aim is to halve carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. During 2022  ESL Shipping transported 14.7 (14.8) million tons of cargo  and its vessels consumed 819 988 (898 158) MWh of energy. CO2 emissions per transported ton decreased by 7.5% to 0.015 (0.016) tons of carbon dioxide per ton of cargo. The new energy-efficient operating models applied to port visits supported the positive development.ESL Shipping outlook for 2023General macroeconomic uncertainties have increased in ESL Shipping’s main market areas. Higher inflation and slower economic growth increase demand and pricing pressure among the shipping company’s main customers. Finland’s labor market may experience unrest during the spring  and its impact through overtime bans and strikes may be significant on key customers and especially on the effectiveness of the transport chain.Global demand estimates in sea transportation markets and price levels of spot markets have decreased considerably from the previous year. On the other hand  the availability of vessel capacity suitable for round-the-year operations in the Baltic Sea is limited. Production volumes of ESL Shipping’s main customers is expected to be satisfactory  albeit slightly lower than in the previous year. Demand for energy deliveries outside Finland is expected to remain high during the first half of the year. In the forest industry  pulp delivery volumes are looking positive  but only satisfactory for sawn goods. Volumes are looking satisfactory in the steel industry. Now that deliveries of Russian raw materials have stopped  certain of the shipping company’s significant contractual customers are forced to seek new suppliers for part of their production input required in new geographic areas. Not all of these procurement routes have yet become stabilized which may cause an imbalance in ESL Shipping’s operations. The role of energy coal transportation is expected to decrease significantly when the preparation situation returns to normal and demand shifts towards other energy forms.The majority of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements with the exception of the Supramax vessels. Currently  the expectations of the lessors of the time-chartered vessels do not meet the realities in the shipping company’s main market areas which may cause further uncertainties in the availability of a suitable and sufficient tonnage. The impact of rising energy prices on ESL Shipping’s costs is compensated effectively through fuel clauses in long-term transportation agreements.Surveys show that ESL Shipping’s customer satisfaction is at an excellent level  similarly to the personnel’s commitment and job satisfaction. Activities to further improve customer and employee satisfaction  sustainability and occupational safety will continue.The shipping company’s investments in energy-efficient vessels will strengthen its competitiveness and market position in the future. ESL Shipping will continue the development of a fossil-free sea transportation ecosystem in line with the green transition and the vessels designed for it in cooperation with its key customers. The shipping company is participating in projects aimed to produce green hydrogen through renewable electricity and to further process it as fossil-free fuel for the shipping company’s vessels.During 2023  four larger and two smaller vessels will be docked for a total of approximately 100 days.TelkoTelko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together. Its competitive edge is based on strong technical support  efficient logistics and local expert service. Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Russia  Belarus  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China.In October 2022  Telko signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. In December  Telko finalized the preliminary agreement to divest its subsidiary in Belarus  to a member of its current management. Both business transactions still need to be approved by the local authorities. Assets and liabilities related to these companies have been classified as assets and liabilities held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 standard at the end of the review period.10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 59.2 73.6 -20 267.4 268.8 -1 Operating profit  MEUR -7.7 4.4 -275 7.3 20.4 -64 Operating profit  % -13.0 6.0 2.7 7.6 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -9.0 -0.8 -13.5 -0.8 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.3 5.2 -75 20.8 21.2 -2 Comparable operating profit  % 2.2 7.1 7.8 7.9During the fourth quarter  Telko’s net sales decreased steeply to EUR 59.2 (73.6) million. Telko’s net sales for the fourth quarter decreased after sales in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine dropped substantially from the previous year. Telko’s net sales outside Russia  Belarus and Ukraine increased. Demand remained stable in Telko’s all business operations.The comparable operating profit for the fourth quarter stood at EUR 1.3 (5.2) million  and the operating profit rate was 2.2% (7.1%). Net sales and operating profit decreased from the previous year  especially due to weak development and negative results in Russia. Telko’s result for the fourth quarter includes items affecting comparability  which reduced Telko’s operating profit by EUR 9.0 million in total. Impairment losses regarding companies in Russia and Belarus of EUR 9.3 million and other expenses of EUR 0.2 million were recognized relating to the withdrawal from Russia. In addition  the credit loss provision recognized from accounts receivable in Ukraine was reversed by EUR 0.5 million. The combined comparable operating profit of the above countries was slightly negative during the fourth quarter.Telko’s operating profit for the fourth quarter was EUR -7.7 (4.4) million. The operating profit rate was -13.0% (6.0%). Impairment losses associated with inventories  exchange rate losses  and costs related to corporate restructuring also had a negative impact on the operating profit.The net sales of the plastics business decreased by 25% during the fourth quarter to EUR 29.6 (39.7) million  mainly due to the decrease in Telko’s operations in Russia. In Telko’s European markets  demand for plastic polymers remained at a normal level in general. Sales outside Russia  Belarus and Ukraine increased slightly  regardless of the downward trend in prices. While the steep decline in the prices of volume plastics turned to an increase during the fourth quarter  the prices are still lower than during the corresponding period in the previous year. The prices of technical plastics decreased slightly during the fourth quarter but were clearly above the comparative period’s level. The acquisition of the operations of Johan Steenks  a Norwegian distributor of technical plastic raw materials and plastics  increased the net sales of the plastics business during the fourth quarter  while it had no significant impact on results.During the fourth quarter  the net sales of the chemicals business decreased by 32% to EUR 15.9 (23.4) million. Sales decreased steeply in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. The weak development especially in Ukraine resulted from the disruptions in the electricity distribution infrastructure due to the war which directly limited production. Total sales in other countries increased significantly  regardless of the decrease in prices. Prices started to increase during the fourth quarter. Telko’s chemicals business is divided between several customer groups which evens out any fluctuations in demand.During the fourth quarter  the net sales of the lubricants business increased by 31% to EUR 13.7 (10.5) million. Sales increased in all key product groups. The increase in sales resulted from high price levels  the acquisition of Mentum AS at the end of 2021  and very positively developed sales of industrial lubricants. Prices of lubricants increased slightly during the fourth quarter. Russia’s invasion in Ukraine did not have any direct impact on the lubricants business.Telko’s net sales in January–December decreased by 1% to EUR 267.4 (268.8) million. The full-year comparable operating profit of EUR 20.8 million was only slightly lower than the previous year’s record-high comparable operating profit (21.2). The comparable operating profit rate remained high at 7.8% (7.9%). Exchange rate losses of EUR 2.5 million reduced the operating profit.Telko’s full-year operating profit fell by 64% to EUR 7.3 (20.4) million. The operating profit rate was 2.7% (7.6%). Results decreased due to the warehouse destroyed in Ukraine  the impairment losses associated with companies in Russia and Belarus  and other costs arising from the withdrawal from Russia  which totaled EUR -13.5 million and have been reported as items affecting comparability.Telko outlook for 2023As announced previously  Telko has agreed to divest its operations in Russia and Belarus. Telko’s net sales in Russia and Belarus were EUR 58.0 million in 2022  comprising 22% of Telko’s total net sales in 2022. Both sales transactions require approval by the local authorities. Telko expects the Russian transaction to be completed during the first quarter of 2023 but there is uncertainty involved.In 2023  Telko’s net sales and profit will be significantly lower than in the previous year due to the changed situation in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. In other countries  demand is expected to remain moderate  even though there will be differences between businesses.The prices of plastics and chemicals decreased steeply during the latter half of 2022  while still being clearly above the long-term average. It is assumed that the most significant price corrections took place during 2022  but the prices are expected to decrease slightly during the first half if energy prices do not experience a considerable increase. In high added value products  on which Telko focuses in accordance with its strategy  price changes are typically more moderate. Significant changes in prices have a short-term impact on margins. Demand for lubricants is expected to remain stable  and prices are expected to increase at least during the first half of 2023.In western markets  demand will involve uncertainties during the next few months. Demand indices have decreased in the construction and automotive industries in Europe. High energy prices and inflation rates will affect demand during the next few months  in particular. At the end of the year  demand will  above all  be affected by the general development of purchasing power in Europe. The lifting of coronavirus restrictions in China is expected to increase local demand. In addition  higher demand in China may have an impact on global price development during the first part of the year. In Central Asia  demand is expected to remain relatively high. Sales in Ukraine will be lower during the first half than in the previous year  while they are expected to be at the 2022 level during the rest of the year  depending completely on the development of the war.Telko will continue its activities to improve its operational efficiency and scalability. Inflation causes general increases in costs. On the other hand  cargo expenses  especially in Asia  will be materially lower than in the previous year.The recent structural arrangements continued when Telko announced on January 31  2023  that it will acquire Eltrex  a Polish company specialized in the distribution of chemicals. According to its strategy  Telko continues to accelerate its growth through acquisitions in addition to organic growth.LeipurinLeipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies  and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. Leipurin operates in nine countries that have been grouped into four business units  each being responsible for their financial performance: Finland  Sweden  Baltics  and East. Leipurin serves bakery  food industry and foodservice customers by providing raw materials and by supporting research and development and recipes for new products. The Leipurin segment’s other product categories include various supplies and machines for the same customer segments. The Leipurin segment uses leading international manufacturers as its raw material and machinery supply partners.On April 22  2022  Aspo announced that Leipurin will withdraw from its operations in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. In January 2023  Leipurin signed a binding preliminary agreement to sell its subsidiaries in these countries to a private investor. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities. Assets and liabilities related to these companies have been classified as assets and liabilities held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 standard at the end of the review period.10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 41.3 31.7 30 130.6 113.1 15 Operating profit  MEUR -4.3 -3.6 19 -4.8 -2.4 100 Operating profit  % -10.4 -11.4 -3.7 -2.1 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -5.4 -4.3 -8.1 -4.3 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.1 0.7 57 3.3 1.9 74 Comparable operating profit  % 2.7 2.2 2.5 1.7 Comparable operating profit excl.

Figures for the comparative year included EUR 2.7 million in net sales of the discontinued machinery business in Russia and divested Vulganus Oy. The Finland business unit’s net sales increased by 8% to EUR 12.2 (11.3) million. In the Baltics  net sales increased by 18% to EUR 10.0 (8.5) million. Net sales of the East business unit decreased by 32% to EUR 6.2 (9.1) million due to the reduced product range  consisting only of local procurement. The decrease in the net sales of the East business unit was also significantly affected by the decrease in operations in Ukraine down to roughly 9% from the comparative year’s level. Sweden was established as a new business unit as a result of the acquisition of Kobia AB on September 1  and it accounted for EUR 12.9 million and approximately 31% of Leipurin’s net sales in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter  sales to bakeries increased by 41% to EUR 28.6 (20.3) million. Sales to the food industry increased by 35% to EUR 4.2 (3.1) million.The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets continued to have a significant impact on Leipurin’s sales during the fourth quarter. Measured in kilograms  the decrease in sales intensified in Finland  Sweden and the Baltics  whereas sales continued to be roughly half of the previous year’s level in the East business unit. The weak volume development is mainly driven by the decrease in consumers’ trust in the current market situation  in which energy costs and interest rates are especially rising steeply. The significant increase in living expenses continued in Finland  Sweden and the Baltics which reduced the inflation-adjusted sales volume of retail and strengthened the shift in consumers’ demand towards more affordable products. The positive development of profit margins continued  regardless of the negative trends in volumes.The comparable operating profit for the fourth quarter stood at EUR 1.1 (0.7) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.7% (2.2%). Leipurin’s comparable operating profit  excluding Vulganus  was EUR 1.1 (0.7) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.7% (2.3%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR -5.4 (-4.3) million  included costs and impairment losses arising from the withdrawal from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan  and costs associated with the reorganization of Leipurin’s group operations. The comparability of the comparative period was affected by animpairment loss recognized on goodwill. Leipurin’s operating loss for the fourth quarter was EUR -4.3 (-3.6) million. Reversal of a fair value allocation of inventories amounting to EUR -0.5 million which arised from the acquisition of Kobia  had a negative impact on the operating profit.In January–December  Leipurin’s net sales increased by 15% to EUR 130.6 (113.1) million. Figures for the comparative year included EUR 11.4 million in net sales of the discontinued machinery business in Russia and divested Vulganus Oy  which were EUR 7.1 million higher than in 2022  but the increase in raw material sales in western markets was particularly strong during the review period compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets had a significant impact on the euro-denominated increase in sales.Leipurin’s comparable operating profit in January–December 2022 was EUR 3.3 (1.9) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.5% (1.7%). Leipurin’s comparable operating profit  excluding Vulganus  was EUR 4.1 (2.4) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 3.2% (2.2%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR -8.1 (-4.3) million  were mainly related to the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine  the acquisition of Kobia  and the divestment of Vulganus. The reported operating profit was negative at EUR -4.8 (-2.4) million. Kobia’s impact on Leipurin’s operating profit was still negative due to the reversal of the EUR 0.5 million fair value allocation of inventories related to the acquisition.Vulganus was divested on June 30  2022. The loss arising from the divestment and the expenses related to it  totaling EUR -0.4 million  are reported under the Leipurin segment’s other operating expenses.Leipurin acquired all shares in Kobia AB  a Swedish distributor in the bakery industry  from the Swedish Abdon Group. Kobia AB comprises Leipurin’s new Sweden business unit  and it has been included in Aspo Group’s figures since September 1  2022. Kobia’s annual net sales are approximately EUR 50 million  and its operating profit rate is roughly 3%. The acquisition strengthens Leipurin’s position as the leading company in the Baltic Sea region.Leipurin outlook for 2023The war in Ukraine and the decision to withdraw operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan will have a significant impact on Leipurin’s net sales and results. Leipurin’s net sales in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan were EUR 24.7 million in 2022  comprising 19% of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2022. The divestment of the operations in the eastern markets still needs to be approved by the local authorities. Leipurin expects the transaction to be completed during the first half of 2023 but there is uncertainty involved.The expansion to Sweden through the acquisition of Kobia AB will increase Leipurin’s annual net sales by roughly EUR 50 million and produce considerable synergy benefits in the development of the product range  and in the supply chain and procurement. It also enables partners to be served in a larger geographic area. The integration of operations has progressed according to plans.Inflation and the rising energy prices  in particular  have a negative impact on demand for more expensive products  potentially presenting profitability challenges among the bakery segment’s customers. The decreased purchasing power may have a negative impact on demand for artisanal bakeries  as consumers prefer more affordable products.The upward trend is expected to continue in the prices of main raw material categories  even though the rapid inflation during the review period is expected to decelerate considerably. This is expected to take place during the first half of 2023.Despite these challenges  Leipurin sees that the market will offer a highly stable environment in the long term and also opportunities for organic growth in selected market segments. In addition  the profitability program that was launched earlier develops the organization's ability to lead with information and helps to improve financial performance in particular. The program focuses both on selected growth clusters and on improving the efficiency of operations. This program is expected to contribute to improving Leipurin’s financial development.The impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic on the global supply chains  the availability of certain raw materials and general delivery times will continue.The management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges will increase risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers.Other operationsOther operations include Aspo Group’s administration  finance and ICT service center. The comparable operating profit of other operations was EUR -1.8 (-1.9) million during the fourth quarter. The reported operating profit of EUR -1.9 (-1.9) million includes EUR -0.1 million in restructuring expenses affecting comparability.The comparable operating profit for 2022 was EUR -6.0 (-7.9) million. The reported operating profit was EUR -6.7 (-7.9) million  including EUR -0.7 million in items affecting comparability that are mainly related to the additional share-based remuneration granted to Aspo’s previous CEO and restructuring expenses.COMPANY INFORMATIONAspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

Therefore  the profit from discontinued operations does not include all internal administrative charges of Aspo Group allocated to the Kauko operating segment. As a result  the profit from discontinued operations for the financial year is EUR 0.3 (0.4) million higher than the Kauko operating segment’s profit. An impairment loss of EUR -1.3 million was recognized on Kauko’s goodwill in June 2022. The profit from discontinued operations also includes the EUR -1.2 million loss on sale of Kauko Oy recognized during the fourth quarter.

The reporting of balance sheet items on separate rows starts at the time of classification  therefore the figures of the comparative period have not been restated.In 2022  assets and liabilities classified as held for sale included the assets and liabilities of the companies held for sale in eastern markets. The classification includes the share of the assets and liabilities of Aspo Group that belong to the companies held for sale  excluding internal assets and liabilities that have been eliminated. In 2021  assets and liabilities of discontinued operations included the figures of the Kauko operating segment. The other assets held for sale at the end of 2021 consisted of Vulganus Oy’s assets and liabilities. The recognition of depreciation and amortization expense ended on December 1  2021  for Kauko and Vulganus when they were classified as held for sale. The depreciation and amortization expense was recognized as part of sales losses in conjunction with the divestment of the companies. Telko Russia was classified as held for sale on October 31  2022  and the other companies held for sale in eastern markets on December 31  2022. The recognition of depreciation and amortization expense ended at the time of the classification as held for sale.At the time of classification as held for sale  the net assets of the companies in eastern markets were measured at fair value less cost to sell  which was lower than the carrying amount. As a result  an impairment loss of EUR 9.4 million was recognized in the Telko segment and EUR 5.2 million in the Leipurin segment during the fourth quarter  which are reported as part of the Telko and Leipurin segments’ figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations.Impairment losses in income statement 2022 Telko Leipurin Total MEUR MEUR MEUR Impairment losses  tangible and intangible assets 0.6 1.1 1.7 Impairment losses  leased assets 0.8 0.1 0.9 Materials and services 4.8 2.4 7.2 Other operating expenses 3.1 1.4 4.5 Income taxes 0.0 0.2 0.3 Total 9.4 5.2 14.6The impairment losses recognized on the assets of the companies in eastern markets were mainly allocated to inventories  accounts receivable  and cash and cash equivalents.

The value of these cash and cash equivalents in the Group is EUR 11.5 million  as an impairment loss of EUR 2.0 million was recognized on the cash and cash equivalents in conjunction with the IFRS 5 classification of the companies in Russia. Cash and cash equivalents in Russia are presented under assets held for sale on the balance sheet. It was still possible to pay dividends and make commercial payments during the fourth quarter of 2022. According to our understanding  the purchase prices of the operations held for sale in eastern markets can be transferred in conjunction with their sale. However  there is a risk that the Group does not have access to the cash and cash equivalents in full in Russia  which is why they must be considered restricted cash and cash equivalents in accordance with IAS 7.Events after the review periodOn January 17  2023  Leipurin signed a binding preliminary agreement to sell all shares in its subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan to Timur Akhiyarov. Russian-born Akhiyarov will invest in Leipurin’s operations in eastern markets as a private investor. The sales price is approximately EUR 8.4 million. Rights to Leipurin’s name and trademarks are not included in the transaction. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities.The Belarusian subsidiaries of Telko and Leipurin have been added to the list of companies whose transfer of shares are prohibited by a decision issued by the Council of Ministers of Belarus at the end of January 2023. Because of this  it is deemed unlikely that the sale of Telko's Belarusian business would proceed. This does not change Aspo Group's previously published assessment of the financial effects of the divestment. Leipurin’s Belarusian subsidiary is part of an agreement according to which the share capitals of Leipurin’s subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan would be sold to the same buyer. The decision of the Council of Ministers of Belarus does not change the previously published assessment of the financial effects of the transaction  nor does it prevent the sale of Leipurin’s Russian and Kazakh subsidiaries.On January 31  Telko acquired a Polish distribution company Eltrex. Eltrex is a distributor of specialty chemicals and industrial packaging materials  and its annual net sales are approximately 8 million euros and operating profit slightly under one million euros.On February 9  2023  Leipurin completed a sale and lease back agreement for its warehouse property in Gothenburg  Sweden. The property came into Leipurin’s ownership via the Kobia acquisition that took place on 1 September 2022. The buyer of the property is Revelop  a Swedish real estate investor. As a result of the sale and lease back transaction  Aspo recognizes a sales gain of approximately EUR 0.4 million. According to the terms of the agreement  Leipurin leases the property for five years. The transaction is close to cost neutral  as the depreciation expense of the assets owned will be replaced by depreciation and interest expense for the leased assets of similar size.Helsinki  February 15  2023Aspo PlcBoard of DirectorsPress and analyst conferenceA press  analyst and investor conference will be held at FLIK’s Eliel studio in Sanomatalo  Töölönlahdenkatu 2  00100 Helsinki on February 15  2023 at 2 p.m. The event is also open to private investors  and participants are requested to register beforehand by emailing johanna.ahtiainen@aspo.com.The financial statement release will be presented by CEO Rolf Jansson.

The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of Aspo Plc to be held on April 4  2023  that EUR 0.23 per share be distributed in dividends for the 2022 financial year. In addition  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to decide on another dividend distribution in the maximum amount of EUR 0.23 per share on a later date. Therefore  a maximum of EUR 0.46 (0.45) would be distributed in dividends for the 2022 financial year.More information about the proposed dividend distribution is available under section “Dividend proposal”.Key figures 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Net sales  Group total  MEUR 164.6 163.2 652.6 586.4 Net sales from continuing operations  MEUR 163.8 160.0 643.4 573.3 ESL Shipping  operating profit  MEUR 10.2 9.8 38.1 26.8 Telko  operating profit  MEUR -7.7 4.4 7.3 20.4 Leipurin  operating profit  MEUR -4.3 -3.6 -4.8 -2.4 Other operations  operating profit  MEUR -1.9 -1.9 -6.7 -7.9 Operating profit from continuing operations  MEUR -3.7 8.7 33.9 36.9 Operating profit from continuing operations  % -2.3 5.4 5.3 6.4 Operating profit from discontinued operations  MEUR -1.1 0.1 -2.7 -3.0 Operating profit  Group total  MEUR -4.8 8.8 31.2 33.9 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -16.1 -5.1 -24.1 -8.5 Comparable operating profit  Group total  MEUR 11.3 13.9 55.3 42.4 Comparable operating profit  Group total  % 6.9 8.5 8.5 7.2 Profit before taxes from continuing operations  MEUR -3.0 7.7 27.6 33.0 Profit for the period  MEUR -5.4 5.7 20.7 25.3 Profit from continuing operations  MEUR -4.3 5.6 23.5 28.3 Profit from discontinued operations  MEUR -1.1 0.1 -2.8 -3.0 Earnings per share (EPS)  EUR -0.21 0.17 0.61 0.76 EPS from continuing operations  EUR -0.17 0.17 0.70 0.86 EPS from discontinued operations  EUR -0.04 0.00 -0.09 -0.10 Net cash from operating activities  MEUR 22.0 10.7 67.7 44.0 Free cash flow  MEUR 16.5 4.1 34.4 27.5 Return on equity (ROE)  % 15.2 20.8 Equity ratio  % 34.7 32.0 Gearing  % 108.4 131.0 Equity per share  EUR 4.58 4.14Rolf Jansson  CEO of Aspo Group  comments on the fourth quarter and the whole year 2022:In the light of financial figures  2022 was a success and in many ways record-breaking. Aspo Group’s net sales increased to EUR 652.6 million  up by roughly 11% from the previous year. The comparable operating profit for 2022 increased to a record EUR 55.3 million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 8.5%. Both the increase in net sales and our comparable operating profit exceeded the financial targets set for the Group. Aspo’s net sales in October–December stood at EUR 164.6 million  and the comparable operating profit was EUR 11.3 million. ESL Shipping especially supported the positive development of net sales and operating profit  with its record-breaking fourth quarter crowning its overall excellent year. The strong growth of Leipurin’s net sales during the fourth quarter was supported not only by high inflation rates  but also by the acquisition of the Swedish company Kobia AB at the beginning of September. Telko’s comparable operating profit in October–December was below the normal level which was due to the direct and reflected effects of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Eastern trade. Apart from the eastern markets  Telko’s net sales developed positively. The year 2022 turned out to be highly different from what we still assumed at the beginning of the year. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dramatically changed the lives of many of our employees  and our entire operating environment changed drastically. Already in spring  we decided to withdraw from all our operations in Russia and from other selected eastern markets. The prerequisites for responsible business had vanished  and it became clear that we would set our sights even more firmly on western markets in accordance with our strategy updated at the end of 2021. We will continue to operate in Ukraine  and we want to support its development and do our part to help rebuild the country. In summer  we divested Leipurin’s machinery business Vulganus  and at the end of October  the divestment of Kauko was finalized. At the same time  we focused on developing our key businesses through acquisitions according to our compounder strategy  of which the acquisition of Kobia by Leipurin and Telko’s recent acquisitions were the most significant. During the year  we also made strategic investments  the most important of which was ESL Shipping’s decision to invest in new Green Coaster vessels using a pooling arrangement. We are heading to 2023 from a good position  and we will continue the determined implementation of our strategy. I believe that we can generate strong cash flow even in this challenging market environment and  in accordance with our financial guidance  we expect Aspo’s comparable operating profit to be EUR 30–40 million in 2023. We continue to boost organic growth through strategic acquisitions. Thanks for Aspo’s excellent results in 2022 go to our entire personnel. I am particularly pleased and grateful for the dedication our personnel showed in supporting our colleagues in areas ravaged by the war and in ensuring their safety.ASPO GROUP Financial results and targets Aspo’s financial targets announced on December 1  2021: Annual increase in net sales: 5–10% a yearOperating profit: 8%Return on equity: more than 20%Gearing: less than 130% With regard to Aspo’s businesses  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%. In 2022  the Group’s targets were reached well overall. Aspo Group’s operating profit increased by 11%. The comparable operating profit rate was 8.5% (7.2%)  clearly exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Return on equity remained at the level of 15.2% (20.8%) due to the items affecting comparability of EUR -24.1 million that mainly consisted of additional costs and impairment losses arising from Russia’s invasion in Ukraine  and whose negative impact on return on equity was roughly 15.6 percentage points. Aspo’s gearing decreased to 108.4% (131.0%)  well below the target level. Aspo Group’s comparable result for continuing and discontinued operations Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit is calculated by adjusting the reported operating profit with rare and material items affecting the operating profit. These include impairment losses  sales gains from vessels  and financial losses caused by Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. In December 2021  Aspo announced that Kauko operating segment was defined not being part of Aspo’s core operations  and Kauko was classified as a discontinued operation. On October 31  2022  Kauko was divested outside the Group  and its accumulated earnings until that date and the divestment loss are presented in the profit from discontinued operations  separate from the results of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. However  Kauko’s results are included in Aspo Group’s total figures and comparable operating profit. Telko’s companies in Russia and Belarus  and Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan are classified as held for sale in the 2022 financial statements (eastern businesses held for sale below). The results of the eastern businesses held for sale are reported as part of Telko and Leipurin  as well as Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The assets and liabilities of the eastern businesses held for sale are presented on the balance sheet separately as assets and liabilities held for sale. When the eastern businesses were classified as held for sale  they were measured at fair value less cost to sell  resulting in the recognition of impairment losses totaling EUR 14.5 million in the fourth quarter  reported as items affecting comparability. On divestment  the recognition of the translation differences of the eastern businesses as part of sales losses as well as a possible change the fair value of the eastern businesses compared with the estimates made in the financial statements will also have a negative impact on the operating profit. On the closing date  the amount of the translation differences of the eastern businesses held for sale was EUR -11.8 million. The amount fluctuates according to changes in exchange rates until the date of sale. The reclassification of the translation differences from the translation difference reserve to the result for the period has no impact on Aspo Group’s total equity.

Items affecting comparability relating to the Kauko segment totaled EUR -2.5 million  and they are reported in the profit from discontinued operations. Other items affecting comparability totaled EUR -0.9 million. Of the items affecting comparability during the fourth quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -16.1 million  EUR -14.3 million were related to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and its consequences. Of the items  EUR -0.4 million were recognized for the ESL Shipping segment  EUR -9.0 for Telko  and EUR -5.0 million for Leipurin. Items affecting comparability relating to reorganizations were EUR -0.4 million in the Leipurin segment and EUR -0.1 million in other operations. In addition  Kauko’s sales loss of EUR -1.2 million is included in the items affecting comparability and reported as part of the results of discontinued operations. Items affecting the comparability in 2021  totaling EUR -8.5 million  included the impairment loss of EUR -4.3 million recognized on Leipurin’s goodwill during the final quarter  and the impairment loss and restoration provision of EUR -0.8 million recognized on the fixed assets of Telko’s terminal in Rauma  as well as the impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter  which is reported as part of the results of discontinued operations.Sustainability Sustainability is a material factor which guides Aspo’s management system and especially the company’s investments. Aspo’s businesses aim to be pioneers in sustainability in their respective sectors. To support the sustainability commitments  Aspo published new environmental  social and corporate governance (ESG) goals for the Group and its businesses in December 2021. The key goal is to reduce emission intensity  CO2e (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) is 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. According to the green transition in the shipping industry  ESL Shipping is engaged in close and long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide fossil-free sea transportation for its key customers in the future. ESL Shipping invests in twelve new generation electric hybrid vessels  half of which will remain in its own ownership and half will be transferred to the other party of the pooling arrangement. The investment is significant in terms of monetary value  but above all  it helps the shipping company move towards its emissions target. During the past 12 months  emission intensity improved further to 0.33 (0.42)  driven by the increase in net sales and operational efficiency. Another key goal was a higher level of safety  with the Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) being 8.1 (8.8) during the past 12 months. Even though TRIF improved from the previous year  we did not reach the target of 7.0 set for 2022. Aspo regularly assesses the satisfaction of employees with their own tasks  the quality of management  and Aspo as an employer by conducting an annual atmosphere survey. In 2021  Aspo started to use the People Power index  a new method of measuring job satisfaction  and it was also included in the Group’s sustainability goals. The operating environment remained fairly challenging in all businesses  and job satisfaction decreased slightly  while still being high: the Group achieved the rating of AA in 2022 (2021: AA+). However  the targeted level of AA+ was not achieved unlike in 2021. Aspo’s internal Compliance and Code of Conduct training includes anti-corruption issues and provides guidance for identifying any suspicious situations and practices considered unethical. Aspo’s goal is that all of the Group’s personnel complete the training every year. In 2022  approximately 100% (89%) of the Group’s employees completed Code of Conduct training and roughly 100% (88%) completed Compliance training.Operating environment and the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo’s operations Aspo’s operating environment changed dramatically during 2022 due to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. The invasion has caused considerable general uncertainties in markets  higher interest rates  lower trust among consumers  price inflation  higher energy prices in particular  as well as significant volatility in prices and exchange rates. Significantly suspended business operations in Ukraine due to the war have caused financial losses. The considerable damage to the energy distribution infrastructure in Ukraine made the situation even worse during the second half of 2022. The war drastically reduces operating conditions in eastern markets as a result of operational challenges and regulations  and selected values in particular. Aspo’s decision to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets  combined with the sanctions related to the war  has also reshaped Aspo’s logistics flows and operating models. ESL Shipping’s all operations have been suspended in Russia  and the released vessel capacity has been transferred to other operating areas. Telko has signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. At the end of 2022  Telko also signed a binding preliminary agreement on the sale of its subsidiary in Belarus to a member of its current management. A binding preliminary agreement was also signed with Timur Akhiyarov  a Russian-born private investor  after the end of the financial year on the sale of Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. Leipurin’s net sales in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan stood at EUR 24.7 million in 2022  comprising 19% of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2022 and less than 4% of Aspo Group’s net sales. Telko’s net sales in Russia and Belarus stood at EUR 58.0 million in 2022  comprising 22% of Telko’s total net sales in 2022 and less than 9% of Aspo Group’s net sales. The consolidated net sales of Telko and Leipurin in these countries accounted for roughly 13% of Aspo Group’s net sales in 2022 (16% of net sales in 2021). The international sanctions and Russia’s legislative measures prevent the transportation of goods and the transfer of payments which has reduced the net sales and profitability of the operations in Russia. In addition  decreases in the companies’ operations and personnel have reduced Russia’s role in Aspo’s business operations. The operating environment is expected to become even more challenging  and no rapid solution is in sight. The equity of the group companies in Russia is EUR 20.5 (16.6) million  comprising 14.3% (12.8%) of Aspo Group’s total equity. In Aspo Group  EUR 12.2 million in impairment losses associated with the equity of Russian companies have been recognized in the financial statements. Aspo’s assets in Russia mainly consist of cash and cash equivalents  inventories and accounts receivable. The number of employees in Aspo Group’s companies in Russia is decreasing  being 105 (193) at the end of the year. Rising interest and inflation rates  as well as weaker general economic estimates  have affected consumers’ purchasing behavior  for example  so that consumers have shifted from more expensive to more affordable products. While the coronavirus pandemic has been overshadowed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the news  it still has an impact on Aspo’s operating environment. For example  the global shortage of components  caused by the pandemic  has an impact on certain Aspo’s businesses  decelerating sales and the completion of orders. The markets are also characterized by disruptions in logistics flows and the low availability of certain products. The risk of infections must still be taken into account in daily operations especially among ESL Shipping’s crew members.

The eastern markets’ share of total net sales continued to decrease during the fourth quarter of 2022  mainly due to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and decisions to downsize operations in Russia and withdraw from the market as planned. As a result of the withdrawal from Russia  the division of Aspo’s main market areas will change at the beginning of 2023. According to the previously announced strategy  the company will direct its growth investments at western markets  and the eastern markets’ share of Aspo’s total net sales already decreased to 13.2% in the fourth quarter.Cash flow and financing The Group’s net cash flow from operating activities in January–December was EUR 67.7 (44.0) million. The cash flow of all businesses showed positive development during the year. The impact of the change in working capital on cash flow during the review period was EUR -6.7 (-22.0) million. The increase in working capital mainly comes from the advance payments for the vessels to be built in the ESL Shipping segment’s vessel pool and the customer receivables accumulated through high sales at the end of the year. This was partly compensated by the Telko segment’s working capital  which improved towards the year end. The free cash flow in January–December was EUR 34.4 (27.5) million. The amount of investments of EUR -17.8 (-15.9) million mainly included the ESL Shipping segment’s dockages and Green Coaster advance payments. In addition  the cash flow from investing activities includes EUR -17.9 million cash outflow on the acquisitions of Kobia  Mentum and Johan Steenks and a total of EUR 2.8 million in cash inflow from the sale of Espa and Vulganus as the most significant items.12/2022 12/2021 MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities  incl. lease liabilities 189.2 187.3 Cash and cash equivalents 33.5 17.7 Net interest-bearing debt 155.7 169.6 Net interest-bearing debt decreased to EUR 155.7 (169.6) million and gearing fell to 108.4% (131.0%). The Group’s equity ratio at the end of the review period was 34.7% (32.0%). The balance sheet strengthened as a result of improved profitability and the new hybrid instrument issued in June. Net financial expenses in January–December totaled EUR -6.3 (-3.9) million. Exchange rate changes  especially the strengthened value of the Russian ruble  increased financial expenses by EUR 1.6 million from the previous year. The average interest rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  was 3.3% (1.4%). The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents stood at EUR 33.5 (17.7) at the end of the review period  of which cash and cash equivalents related to businesses held for sale were EUR 11.8 million. Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program also remained wholly unused (5). During 2022  Aspo extended its maturity structure for interest-bearing loans. In September  AtoBatC AB signed an EUR 32.2 million loan agreement with Svenska Skeppshypotek. The loan’s maturity is 15 years  and it has not yet been withdrawn. The loan  together with the ten-year loan agreement of EUR 20 million singed in June with the Nordic Investment Bank  of which EUR 19.6 million have been withdrawn  finances ESL Shipping’s investment in a series of six new highly energy-efficient electric hybrid vessels. The project was launched in September 2021. In addition  Aspo restructured a bilateral bank loan of EUR 20 million  about to mature in 2023  with a new bilateral revolving credit facility which will mature in 2025. The loan agreement also includes two options for a one-year extension. In June  Aspo issued a new EUR 30 million hybrid instrument  with a coupon rate of 8.75% per annum. The hybrid instrument has no maturity  but the company may exercise an early redemption option in June 2025 at the earliest. Aspo’s earlier hybrid instrument of EUR 20 million was redeemed on May 2  2022.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operations Aspo and its subsidiaries are exposed to various risks and uncertainties  which are mainly identified and managed in Aspo's businesses. The most important risks and preparedness for them are summarized and reported to Aspo's Board of Directors through Aspo's Audit Committee. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine causes significant geopolitical uncertainties. It affects the general economic environment  including inflation  energy and raw material prices  interest rates  and consumers’ trust. The ongoing process to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets will change the Group’s structure significantly and will affect the revenue model of Aspo’s businesses in the long term. There are risks that the withdrawal from the selected markets causes additional costs or losses  and that funds cannot be transferred from the markets or that the withdrawal is unsuccessful in full or in part. It is also possible that the official approvals required for the withdrawal from the markets are not obtained for example due to changes is legislation or that they are at risk or fail for some other reason. Financial activities and the prevailing geopolitical uncertainties have caused the prices of many raw materials  components and logistics services to rise rapidly. While Aspo may benefit from the price increases temporarily  the prices of raw materials or rental capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Disruptions in logistics flows  longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes are also increasing risks. The rapid increase in inflation has generally caused pressure for salary increases  which in Finland can lead to labor disputes  which can also negatively affect Aspo's businesses. International sanctions and countersanctions have been imposed  which may also affect Aspo’s businesses directly or indirectly. The geopolitical tensions may escalate and cause a direct adverse impact on business operations  put payments at risk and even suspend business operations. If escalated  cyber incidents and disruptions in information systems may cause damage to business operations. In line with its renewed strategy  Aspo aims to increase its steady profit-making ability through acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial resources and consequently may reduce solvency. With its strategy  Aspo aims to reduce the impact of the possibly weakening general economic development on Aspo’s profit-making ability. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Aspo’s operations has been limited at the group level  even though it has been significant in the Leipurin segment. The current and any new coronavirus variants and their rapid spread may suspend business operations and cause financial losses through stoppages in global logistics chains  among other factors. Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation and knowledge  they involve significant risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO’S BUSINESS OPERATIONS ESL Shipping ESL Shipping is the leading dry bulk sea transport company operating in the Baltic Sea area. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 41 vessels with a total capacity of 425 000 deadweight tonnage (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (80% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 16 vessels (18%) were time chartered. ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service. 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 63.3 54.7 16 245.4 191.4 28 Operating profit  MEUR 10.2 9.8 4 38.1 26.8 42 Operating profit  % 16.1 17.9 15.5 14.0 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -0.4 0.7 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 10.6 9.8 8 37.4 26.8 40 Comparable operating profit  % 16.7 17.9 15.2 14.0 The fourth quarter of 2022 marked the best quarter in ESL Shipping’s history measured by the operating profit. Net sales increased by 16% from the previous year to EUR 63.3 (54.7) million. The comparable operating profit for the quarter increased by 8% to record-breaking EUR 10.6 (9.8) million. The operating profit of EUR 10.2 (9.8) million includes EUR -0.4 million in expenses associated with suspended operations in Russia. High demand in the shipping company’s main market areas  the shipping company’s long-term partnership strategy and the successful operations of the onshore and offshore personnel enabled the excellent results. Weather conditions were also favorable for operations. The comparable operating profit rate of 16.7% (17.9%) achieved during the fourth quarter was once again excellent. During the quarter  the prices of diesel and liquefied natural gas (LNG) used as ship fuels decreased from the previous quarter  while remaining roughly twice as high as in the comparative period. The high level of fuel surcharges increased net sales and reduced the operating profit rate  which is used as an indicator of relative profitability. During the fourth quarter  cargo volumes transported by ESL Shipping decreased slightly from the comparative period to 3.8 (3.9) million tons. The volume development was based on the transfer of raw material deliveries away from Russia which has extended transportation distances especially for energy coal. The final quarter is also normally the busiest season for energy transportation  but as a result of the exceptional situation involving the security of supply  the low availability of biofuels and longer transportation distances  the percentage of energy coal from all transportation operations tripled during the fourth quarter from the comparative period. The profitability of all the shipping company’s vessel categories was excellent during the fourth quarter. In fourth quarter  production plants of several contractual customers underwent relatively large maintenance stoppages and restricted production due to lower demand and high energy costs. High demand experienced in the energy industry enabled the vessels to continue to operate at full capacity during the fourth quarter. The spot cargo market decreased in all customer segments and vessel categories during the quarter. After operations in Russia were suspended  demand for ESL Shipping’s loading and unloading operations for vessels at sea shifted to the southern Baltic Sea where it was maintained by the high demand for energy coal transportation during the fourth quarter and congestion at ports suitable for large ocean liners. Six time-chartered vessels of the smaller vessel category were redelivered to their owners as the charter agreements ended at the end of the fourth quarter and as the price of an extended charter period became too high. The newbuilding project of ESL Shipping’s Swedish subsidiary AtoBatC Shipping AB    at the Chowgule & Company Private Limited shipyard in India proceeded as planned during the fourth quarter. Every other vessel in the series of 12 next-generation electric hybrid vessels will be sold  as announced earlier  to the company established by the pooling investor group. The first four new vessels are already under construction  and the first vessel is to be delivered during fall 2023. One larger vessel was docked for seven days during the fourth quarter and one smaller vessel was out of service for 26 days. In 2022  dockage days totaled 141 (229). The net sales of ESL Shipping in January–December increased from the comparative period by 28% to EUR 245.4 (191.4) million. The comparable operating profit was the highest in the company’s history at EUR 37.4 (26.8) million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 15.2% (14.0%). The operating profit rate clearly exceeded the long-term target of 14%. Comparability was affected by the gain from the sale of the barge Espa and costs associated with the suspended operations in Russia. Their impact on net results was EUR 0.7 million and  as a result  ESL Shipping’s operating profit amounted to EUR 38.1 (26.8) million and its operating profit rate was 15.5% (14.0%) for 2022 as a whole. The shipping company’s long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The aim is to halve carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. During 2022  ESL Shipping transported 14.7 (14.8) million tons of cargo  and its vessels consumed 819 988 (898 158) MWh of energy. CO2 emissions per transported ton decreased by 7.5% to 0.015 (0.016) tons of carbon dioxide per ton of cargo. The new energy-efficient operating models applied to port visits supported the positive development.ESL Shipping outlook for 2023 General macroeconomic uncertainties have increased in ESL Shipping’s main market areas. Higher inflation and slower economic growth increase demand and pricing pressure among the shipping company’s main customers. Finland’s labor market may experience unrest during the spring  and its impact through overtime bans and strikes may be significant on key customers and especially on the effectiveness of the transport chain. Global demand estimates in sea transportation markets and price levels of spot markets have decreased considerably from the previous year. On the other hand  the availability of vessel capacity suitable for round-the-year operations in the Baltic Sea is limited. Production volumes of ESL Shipping’s main customers is expected to be satisfactory  albeit slightly lower than in the previous year. Demand for energy deliveries outside Finland is expected to remain high during the first half of the year. In the forest industry  pulp delivery volumes are looking positive  but only satisfactory for sawn goods. Volumes are looking satisfactory in the steel industry. Now that deliveries of Russian raw materials have stopped  certain of the shipping company’s significant contractual customers are forced to seek new suppliers for part of their production input required in new geographic areas. Not all of these procurement routes have yet become stabilized which may cause an imbalance in ESL Shipping’s operations. The role of energy coal transportation is expected to decrease significantly when the preparation situation returns to normal and demand shifts towards other energy forms. The majority of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements with the exception of the Supramax vessels. Currently  the expectations of the lessors of the time-chartered vessels do not meet the realities in the shipping company’s main market areas which may cause further uncertainties in the availability of a suitable and sufficient tonnage. The impact of rising energy prices on ESL Shipping’s costs is compensated effectively through fuel clauses in long-term transportation agreements. Surveys show that ESL Shipping’s customer satisfaction is at an excellent level  similarly to the personnel’s commitment and job satisfaction. Activities to further improve customer and employee satisfaction  sustainability and occupational safety will continue. The shipping company’s investments in energy-efficient vessels will strengthen its competitiveness and market position in the future. ESL Shipping will continue the development of a fossil-free sea transportation ecosystem in line with the green transition and the vessels designed for it in cooperation with its key customers. The shipping company is participating in projects aimed to produce green hydrogen through renewable electricity and to further process it as fossil-free fuel for the shipping company’s vessels. During 2023  four larger and two smaller vessels will be docked for a total of approximately 100 days.Telko Telko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together. Its competitive edge is based on strong technical support  efficient logistics and local expert service. Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Russia  Belarus  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China. In October 2022  Telko signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. In December  Telko finalized the preliminary agreement to divest its subsidiary in Belarus  to a member of its current management. Both business transactions still need to be approved by the local authorities. Assets and liabilities related to these companies have been classified as assets and liabilities held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 standard at the end of the review period. 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 59.2 73.6 -20 267.4 268.8 -1 Operating profit  MEUR -7.7 4.4 -275 7.3 20.4 -64 Operating profit  % -13.0 6.0 2.7 7.6 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -9.0 -0.8 -13.5 -0.8 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.3 5.2 -75 20.8 21.2 -2 Comparable operating profit  % 2.2 7.1 7.8 7.9 During the fourth quarter  Telko’s net sales decreased steeply to EUR 59.2 (73.6) million. Telko’s net sales for the fourth quarter decreased after sales in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine dropped substantially from the previous year. Telko’s net sales outside Russia  Belarus and Ukraine increased. Demand remained stable in Telko’s all business operations. The comparable operating profit for the fourth quarter stood at EUR 1.3 (5.2) million  and the operating profit rate was 2.2% (7.1%). Net sales and operating profit decreased from the previous year  especially due to weak development and negative results in Russia. Telko’s result for the fourth quarter includes items affecting comparability  which reduced Telko’s operating profit by EUR 9.0 million in total. Impairment losses regarding companies in Russia and Belarus of EUR 9.3 million and other expenses of EUR 0.2 million were recognized relating to the withdrawal from Russia. In addition  the credit loss provision recognized from accounts receivable in Ukraine was reversed by EUR 0.5 million. The combined comparable operating profit of the above countries was slightly negative during the fourth quarter. Telko’s operating profit for the fourth quarter was EUR -7.7 (4.4) million. The operating profit rate was -13.0% (6.0%). Impairment losses associated with inventories  exchange rate losses  and costs related to corporate restructuring also had a negative impact on the operating profit. The net sales of the plastics business decreased by 25% during the fourth quarter to EUR 29.6 (39.7) million  mainly due to the decrease in Telko’s operations in Russia. In Telko’s European markets  demand for plastic polymers remained at a normal level in general. Sales outside Russia  Belarus and Ukraine increased slightly  regardless of the downward trend in prices. While the steep decline in the prices of volume plastics turned to an increase during the fourth quarter  the prices are still lower than during the corresponding period in the previous year. The prices of technical plastics decreased slightly during the fourth quarter but were clearly above the comparative period’s level. The acquisition of the operations of Johan Steenks  a Norwegian distributor of technical plastic raw materials and plastics  increased the net sales of the plastics business during the fourth quarter  while it had no significant impact on results. During the fourth quarter  the net sales of the chemicals business decreased by 32% to EUR 15.9 (23.4) million. Sales decreased steeply in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. The weak development especially in Ukraine resulted from the disruptions in the electricity distribution infrastructure due to the war which directly limited production. Total sales in other countries increased significantly  regardless of the decrease in prices. Prices started to increase during the fourth quarter. Telko’s chemicals business is divided between several customer groups which evens out any fluctuations in demand. During the fourth quarter  the net sales of the lubricants business increased by 31% to EUR 13.7 (10.5) million. Sales increased in all key product groups. The increase in sales resulted from high price levels  the acquisition of Mentum AS at the end of 2021  and very positively developed sales of industrial lubricants. Prices of lubricants increased slightly during the fourth quarter. Russia’s invasion in Ukraine did not have any direct impact on the lubricants business. Telko’s net sales in January–December decreased by 1% to EUR 267.4 (268.8) million. The full-year comparable operating profit of EUR 20.8 million was only slightly lower than the previous year’s record-high comparable operating profit (21.2). The comparable operating profit rate remained high at 7.8% (7.9%). Exchange rate losses of EUR 2.5 million reduced the operating profit. Telko’s full-year operating profit fell by 64% to EUR 7.3 (20.4) million. The operating profit rate was 2.7% (7.6%). Results decreased due to the warehouse destroyed in Ukraine  the impairment losses associated with companies in Russia and Belarus  and other costs arising from the withdrawal from Russia  which totaled EUR -13.5 million and have been reported as items affecting comparability.Telko outlook for 2023 As announced previously  Telko has agreed to divest its operations in Russia and Belarus. Telko’s net sales in Russia and Belarus were EUR 58.0 million in 2022  comprising 22% of Telko’s total net sales in 2022. Both sales transactions require approval by the local authorities. Telko expects the Russian transaction to be completed during the first quarter of 2023 but there is uncertainty involved. In 2023  Telko’s net sales and profit will be significantly lower than in the previous year due to the changed situation in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. In other countries  demand is expected to remain moderate  even though there will be differences between businesses. The prices of plastics and chemicals decreased steeply during the latter half of 2022  while still being clearly above the long-term average. It is assumed that the most significant price corrections took place during 2022  but the prices are expected to decrease slightly during the first half if energy prices do not experience a considerable increase. In high added value products  on which Telko focuses in accordance with its strategy  price changes are typically more moderate. Significant changes in prices have a short-term impact on margins. Demand for lubricants is expected to remain stable  and prices are expected to increase at least during the first half of 2023. In western markets  demand will involve uncertainties during the next few months. Demand indices have decreased in the construction and automotive industries in Europe. High energy prices and inflation rates will affect demand during the next few months  in particular. At the end of the year  demand will  above all  be affected by the general development of purchasing power in Europe. The lifting of coronavirus restrictions in China is expected to increase local demand. In addition  higher demand in China may have an impact on global price development during the first part of the year. In Central Asia  demand is expected to remain relatively high. Sales in Ukraine will be lower during the first half than in the previous year  while they are expected to be at the 2022 level during the rest of the year  depending completely on the development of the war. Telko will continue its activities to improve its operational efficiency and scalability. Inflation causes general increases in costs. On the other hand  cargo expenses  especially in Asia  will be materially lower than in the previous year. The recent structural arrangements continued when Telko announced on January 31  2023  that it will acquire Eltrex  a Polish company specialized in the distribution of chemicals. According to its strategy  Telko continues to accelerate its growth through acquisitions in addition to organic growth.Leipurin Leipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies  and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. Leipurin operates in nine countries that have been grouped into four business units  each being responsible for their financial performance: Finland  Sweden  Baltics  and East. Leipurin serves bakery  food industry and foodservice customers by providing raw materials and by supporting research and development and recipes for new products. The Leipurin segment’s other product categories include various supplies and machines for the same customer segments. The Leipurin segment uses leading international manufacturers as its raw material and machinery supply partners. On April 22  2022  Aspo announced that Leipurin will withdraw from its operations in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. In January 2023  Leipurin signed a binding preliminary agreement to sell its subsidiaries in these countries to a private investor. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities. Assets and liabilities related to these companies have been classified as assets and liabilities held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 standard at the end of the review period. 10-12/2022 10-12/2021 Change % 1-12/2022 1-12/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 41.3 31.7 30 130.6 113.1 15 Operating profit  MEUR -4.3 -3.6 19 -4.8 -2.4 100 Operating profit  % -10.4 -11.4 -3.7 -2.1 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -5.4 -4.3 -8.1 -4.3 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.1 0.7 57 3.3 1.9 74 Comparable operating profit  % 2.7 2.2 2.5 1.7 Comparable operating profit excl.

Leipurin’s total net sales increased by 30% during the fourth quarter to EUR 41.3 (31.7) million. Figures for the comparative year included EUR 2.7 million in net sales of the discontinued machinery business in Russia and divested Vulganus Oy. The Finland business unit’s net sales increased by 8% to EUR 12.2 (11.3) million. In the Baltics  net sales increased by 18% to EUR 10.0 (8.5) million. Net sales of the East business unit decreased by 32% to EUR 6.2 (9.1) million due to the reduced product range  consisting only of local procurement. The decrease in the net sales of the East business unit was also significantly affected by the decrease in operations in Ukraine down to roughly 9% from the comparative year’s level. Sweden was established as a new business unit as a result of the acquisition of Kobia AB on September 1  and it accounted for EUR 12.9 million and approximately 31% of Leipurin’s net sales in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter  sales to bakeries increased by 41% to EUR 28.6 (20.3) million. Sales to the food industry increased by 35% to EUR 4.2 (3.1) million. The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets continued to have a significant impact on Leipurin’s sales during the fourth quarter. Measured in kilograms  the decrease in sales intensified in Finland  Sweden and the Baltics  whereas sales continued to be roughly half of the previous year’s level in the East business unit. The weak volume development is mainly driven by the decrease in consumers’ trust in the current market situation  in which energy costs and interest rates are especially rising steeply. The significant increase in living expenses continued in Finland  Sweden and the Baltics which reduced the inflation-adjusted sales volume of retail and strengthened the shift in consumers’ demand towards more affordable products. The positive development of profit margins continued  regardless of the negative trends in volumes. The comparable operating profit for the fourth quarter stood at EUR 1.1 (0.7) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.7% (2.2%). Leipurin’s comparable operating profit  excluding Vulganus  was EUR 1.1 (0.7) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.7% (2.3%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR -5.4 (-4.3) million  included costs and impairment losses arising from the withdrawal from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan  and costs associated with the reorganization of Leipurin’s group operations. The comparability of the comparative period was affected by animpairment loss recognized on goodwill. Leipurin’s operating loss for the fourth quarter was EUR -4.3 (-3.6) million. Reversal of a fair value allocation of inventories amounting to EUR -0.5 million which arised from the acquisition of Kobia  had a negative impact on the operating profit. In January–December  Leipurin’s net sales increased by 15% to EUR 130.6 (113.1) million. Figures for the comparative year included EUR 11.4 million in net sales of the discontinued machinery business in Russia and divested Vulganus Oy  which were EUR 7.1 million higher than in 2022  but the increase in raw material sales in western markets was particularly strong during the review period compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets had a significant impact on the euro-denominated increase in sales. Leipurin’s comparable operating profit in January–December 2022 was EUR 3.3 (1.9) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.5% (1.7%). Leipurin’s comparable operating profit  excluding Vulganus  was EUR 4.1 (2.4) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 3.2% (2.2%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR -8.1 (-4.3) million  were mainly related to the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine  the acquisition of Kobia  and the divestment of Vulganus. The reported operating profit was negative at EUR -4.8 (-2.4) million. Kobia’s impact on Leipurin’s operating profit was still negative due to the reversal of the EUR 0.5 million fair value allocation of inventories related to the acquisition. Vulganus was divested on June 30  2022. The loss arising from the divestment and the expenses related to it  totaling EUR -0.4 million  are reported under the Leipurin segment’s other operating expenses. Leipurin acquired all shares in Kobia AB  a Swedish distributor in the bakery industry  from the Swedish Abdon Group. Kobia AB comprises Leipurin’s new Sweden business unit  and it has been included in Aspo Group’s figures since September 1  2022. Kobia’s annual net sales are approximately EUR 50 million  and its operating profit rate is roughly 3%. The acquisition strengthens Leipurin’s position as the leading company in the Baltic Sea region.Leipurin outlook for 2023 The war in Ukraine and the decision to withdraw operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan will have a significant impact on Leipurin’s net sales and results. Leipurin’s net sales in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan were EUR 24.7 million in 2022  comprising 19% of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2022. The divestment of the operations in the eastern markets still needs to be approved by the local authorities. Leipurin expects the transaction to be completed during the first half of 2023 but there is uncertainty involved. The expansion to Sweden through the acquisition of Kobia AB will increase Leipurin’s annual net sales by roughly EUR 50 million and produce considerable synergy benefits in the development of the product range  and in the supply chain and procurement. It also enables partners to be served in a larger geographic area. The integration of operations has progressed according to plans. Inflation and the rising energy prices  in particular  have a negative impact on demand for more expensive products  potentially presenting profitability challenges among the bakery segment’s customers. The decreased purchasing power may have a negative impact on demand for artisanal bakeries  as consumers prefer more affordable products. The upward trend is expected to continue in the prices of main raw material categories  even though the rapid inflation during the review period is expected to decelerate considerably. This is expected to take place during the first half of 2023. Despite these challenges  Leipurin sees that the market will offer a highly stable environment in the long term and also opportunities for organic growth in selected market segments. In addition  the profitability program that was launched earlier develops the organization's ability to lead with information and helps to improve financial performance in particular. The program focuses both on selected growth clusters and on improving the efficiency of operations. This program is expected to contribute to improving Leipurin’s financial development. The impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic on the global supply chains  the availability of certain raw materials and general delivery times will continue. The management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges will increase risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers.Other operations Other operations include Aspo Group’s administration  finance and ICT service center. The comparable operating profit of other operations was EUR -1.8 (-1.9) million during the fourth quarter. The reported operating profit of EUR -1.9 (-1.9) million includes EUR -0.1 million in restructuring expenses affecting comparability. The comparable operating profit for 2022 was EUR -6.0 (-7.9) million. The reported operating profit was EUR -6.7 (-7.9) million  including EUR -0.7 million in items affecting comparability that are mainly related to the additional share-based remuneration granted to Aspo’s previous CEO and restructuring expenses.COMPANY INFORMATION Aspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

Aspo started to pay dividends twice a year in 2017. The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of Aspo Plc to be held on April 4  2023  that EUR 0.23 per share be distributed in dividends for the 2022 financial year  and that no dividend will be paid for shares held by Aspo Plc.

The aim of the plan is to combine the objectives of the shareholders and key employees in order to increase the value of the company in the long term  to retain key employees in the company  and to offer them a competitive reward plan based on earning and accumulating the company’s shares. The share-based incentive plan consists of three earnings periods  with the earned reward being based on the Group’s earnings per share (EPS) and two sustainability indicators. Participation in the scheme and obtaining rewards require that participants allocate the freely transferable company shares they hold to the plan or acquire the company’s shares up to the quantity determined by the Board of Directors. The share-based incentive plan is directed at a maximum of 30 people  including the members of the Group Executive Committee. The potential reward will be paid partly in the company’s shares and partly in cash in 2023  2024 and 2025. The rewards payable based on the plan correspond to a maximum total value of 400 000 Aspo Plc shares  also including the proportion to be paid in cash. For the 2022 earnings period  the targets were met at 90% overall. Share-based incentive plan 2021–2023 On February 11  2021  Aspo’s Board of Directors decided to continue the share-based incentive plan for the Group’s key personnel by establishing a share-based incentive plan for 2021–2023. The aim of the plan is to combine the objectives of the shareholders and key employees in order to increase the value of the company in the long term  to retain key employees in the company  and to offer them a competitive reward plan based on earning and accumulating the company’s shares. The share-based incentive plan is directed at around 20 people  including the members of the Group Executive Committee. The EPS target  acting as an earnings criterion for the share-based incentive plan  was fully met during the 2021 financial year. In March 2022  based on the share-based incentive plan  a total of 89 400 treasury shares were transferred  and an amount equaling the value of the shares was paid in cash to cover taxes.

Johan Steenks is a distributor of technical plastic raw materials and additives for plastics  and it has an established customer base in the Norwegian markets and a number of well-known principals. The company’s annual net sales are roughly EUR 5 million. The business acquisition had no significant impact on Telko’s net sales or results during the final quarter of the year. The purchase price was approximately EUR 2.0 million  of which EUR 0.7 million were allocated to inventories and the remaining EUR 1.3 million were recognized as an increase in goodwill. The cash flow from the acquisition in 2022 was EUR -1.9 million.Discontinued operations and other non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale In October 17  Telko signed a binding preliminary agreement on selling all shares in its subsidiary in Russia  to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. The sales price is approximately EUR 9.5 million. The transaction still needs to be approved by the Russian authorities. Telko’s company in Russia has been classified as held for sale since October 2022 when the preliminary agreement on the sale was signed. Telko’s company in Belarus has been classified as held for sale since December 2022 when the agreement on the sale was signed with the company’s acting management. Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan have been classified as held for sale since December 31  2022 when their divestment started to seem probable. A binding preliminary agreement on their sale was signed on January 17  2023 with Timur Akhiyarov  a Russian-born private investor. The sales price is approximately EUR 8.4 million. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities. The Kauko operating segment and Vulganus Oy  part of the Leipurin segment  were defined as non-core businesses for Aspo and classified as held for sale in December 2021. Vulganus was sold to KÖNIG Maschinen GmbH  the leading manufacturer of bakery machines in Austria  on June 30  2022. The results of Vulganus  including the divestment loss of EUR -0.4 million   are reported as part of the Leipurin segment’s figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The Kauko operating segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in accordance with the IFRS 5 standard  and its figures are reported separately from the figures of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. In the statement of comprehensive income  the figures of the comparative periods have been restated. Kauko Oy was sold to Signal Partners Oy on October 31  2022.

Therefore  the profit from discontinued operations does not include all internal administrative charges of Aspo Group allocated to the Kauko operating segment. As a result  the profit from discontinued operations for the financial year is EUR 0.3 (0.4) million higher than the Kauko operating segment’s profit. An impairment loss of EUR -1.3 million was recognized on Kauko’s goodwill in June 2022. The profit from discontinued operations also includes the EUR -1.2 million loss on sale of Kauko Oy recognized during the fourth quarter. An impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million was recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter of 2021.

The cash flow from the divestment of Kauko Oy in 2022 was EUR -1.0 million  and it is included in the cash flow from investing activities. The costs to sell of EUR -0.4 million are included in the cash flow from operating activities. The cash flow from financing mainly consists of repayments of interest-bearing loans.

The reporting of balance sheet items on separate rows starts at the time of classification  therefore the figures of the comparative period have not been restated. In 2022  assets and liabilities classified as held for sale included the assets and liabilities of the companies held for sale in eastern markets. The classification includes the share of the assets and liabilities of Aspo Group that belong to the companies held for sale  excluding internal assets and liabilities that have been eliminated. In 2021  assets and liabilities of discontinued operations included the figures of the Kauko operating segment. The other assets held for sale at the end of 2021 consisted of Vulganus Oy’s assets and liabilities. The recognition of depreciation and amortization expense ended on December 1  2021  for Kauko and Vulganus when they were classified as held for sale. The depreciation and amortization expense was recognized as part of sales losses in conjunction with the divestment of the companies. Telko Russia was classified as held for sale on October 31  2022  and the other companies held for sale in eastern markets on December 31  2022. The recognition of depreciation and amortization expense ended at the time of the classification as held for sale. At the time of classification as held for sale  the net assets of the companies in eastern markets were measured at fair value less cost to sell  which was lower than the carrying amount. As a result  an impairment loss of EUR 9.4 million was recognized in the Telko segment and EUR 5.2 million in the Leipurin segment during the fourth quarter  which are reported as part of the Telko and Leipurin segments’ figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations.

In addition  an impairment loss was recognized on goodwill  determined in based on the ratio between the fair values of the divested companies and the segment.Restricted cash and cash equivalents In Russia  Aspo Group has EUR 13.5 million in cash and cash equivalents  the use of which is strictly restricted by the Russian Government and controlled by banks. The value of these cash and cash equivalents in the Group is EUR 11.5 million  as an impairment loss of EUR 2.0 million was recognized on the cash and cash equivalents in conjunction with the IFRS 5 classification of the companies in Russia. Cash and cash equivalents in Russia are presented under assets held for sale on the balance sheet. It was still possible to pay dividends and make commercial payments during the fourth quarter of 2022. According to our understanding  the purchase prices of the operations held for sale in eastern markets can be transferred in conjunction with their sale. However  there is a risk that the Group does not have access to the cash and cash equivalents in full in Russia  which is why they must be considered restricted cash and cash equivalents in accordance with IAS 7. Events after the review period On January 17  2023  Leipurin signed a binding preliminary agreement to sell all shares in its subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan to Timur Akhiyarov. Russian-born Akhiyarov will invest in Leipurin’s operations in eastern markets as a private investor. The sales price is approximately EUR 8.4 million. Rights to Leipurin’s name and trademarks are not included in the transaction. The transaction still needs to be approved by the local authorities. The Belarusian subsidiaries of Telko and Leipurin have been added to the list of companies whose transfer of shares are prohibited by a decision issued by the Council of Ministers of Belarus at the end of January 2023. Because of this  it is deemed unlikely that the sale of Telko's Belarusian business would proceed. This does not change Aspo Group's previously published assessment of the financial effects of the divestment. Leipurin’s Belarusian subsidiary is part of an agreement according to which the share capitals of Leipurin’s subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan would be sold to the same buyer. The decision of the Council of Ministers of Belarus does not change the previously published assessment of the financial effects of the transaction  nor does it prevent the sale of Leipurin’s Russian and Kazakh subsidiaries. On January 31  Telko acquired a Polish distribution company Eltrex. Eltrex is a distributor of specialty chemicals and industrial packaging materials  and its annual net sales are approximately 8 million euros and operating profit slightly under one million euros. On February 9  2023  Leipurin completed a sale and lease back agreement for its warehouse property in Gothenburg  Sweden. The property came into Leipurin’s ownership via the Kobia acquisition that took place on 1 September 2022. The buyer of the property is Revelop  a Swedish real estate investor. As a result of the sale and lease back transaction  Aspo recognizes a sales gain of approximately EUR 0.4 million. According to the terms of the agreement  Leipurin leases the property for five years. The transaction is close to cost neutral  as the depreciation expense of the assets owned will be replaced by depreciation and interest expense for the leased assets of similar size.

HEINEKEN's dream is to shape the future of beer and beyond to win the hearts of consumers. HEINEKEN is also shaping the future with its ambition to become the best digitally connected brewer  raising the bar on sustainability and responsibility and evolving its culture  operating model and capabilities. At the same time  we are stepping up on productivity to fund the investments required and improve profitability and capital efficiency.HEINEKEN's superior and balanced growth ambition is grounded in its advantaged geographic footprint  its ability to scale strong premium beer brands  including non-alcoholic variants  and in developing winning beverage propositions in fast-growing segments.Revenue for the full year 2022 was €34 676 million (2021: 26 583 million). Net revenue (beia) increased by 21.2% organically  with total consolidated volume growing by 6.4% and net revenue (beia) per hectolitre up 13.9%. The underlying price-mix on a constant geographic basis was up 14.3%  driven by pricing for inflation and by premiumisation. All regions contributed with double-digit organic growth. Currency translation positively impacted net revenue (beia) by €1 582 million or 7.2%  mainly driven by the Mexican Peso  Brazilian Real  Vietnamese Dong and the US Dollar. Consolidation changes positively impacted net revenue (beia) by €570 million or 2.6%  mainly from the consolidation of United Breweries Limited (UBL) in India.Beer volume grew 6.9% organically for the full year and was ahead of 2019 by 2.7% on an organic basis. The growth was led by the sharp recovery of Asia Pacific in the second half of the year  the reopening of the on-trade in Europe in the first half following the COVID-related restrictions of last year and continued growth in the Americas and Africa  Middle East & Eastern Europe regions.Beer volume 4Q22 Organicgrowth FY22 Organicgrowth (in mhl) 4Q21 FY21 Heineken N.V. 63.3 61.1 3.5 % 256.9 231.2 6.9 %In the fourth quarter  net revenue (beia) grew organically by 17.4%  with double-digit growth across all regions. Total consolidated volume grew 3.0% and net revenue (beia) per hectolitre was up 14.0%. Price-mix on a constant geographic basis was up 14.5%  again driven by pricing and premiumisation. Beer volume grew 3.5%  driven by Asia Pacific and continued growth in Europe  more than offsetting lower volume in other regions.Premium beer volume grew 11.4% versus last year and came 15.6% ahead of 2019  organically. HEINEKEN's premium brands outperformed the total portfolio in the majority of its markets and accounted for more than half of our total organic growth in beer volume in 2022.This growth is led by Heineken®  up 12.5% versus last year (14.5% excluding Russia) and 31.5% relative to 2019  significantly outperforming the total beer market. The growth was broad-based with more than 50 markets growing double-digits in 2022. The strong growth was led by Heineken® Original  bolstered by the remarkable performance of its line extensions. Heineken® Silver more than doubled its volume  driven by excellent performances in Vietnam and China and its global rollout  reaching 28 markets in total by the end of 2022.Heineken® volume 4Q22 Organicgrowth FY22 Organicgrowth (in mhl) Total 14.8 11.2 % 54.9 12.5 %Outlook 2023For 2023  HEINEKEN expects operating profit (beia) to grow organically mid- to high-single-digit  subject to any significant unforeseen macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. This outlook is based on continued progress on HEINEKEN's EverGreen strategy  a challenging global economic environment and lower consumer confidence in certain markets.HEINEKEN expects further progress towards building great brands  its digital route to consumer  strategic capabilities and HEINEKEN's Brew a Better World activities with commensurate investments. HEINEKEN also expects stable to modestly growing volume  increasing in developing markets and declining in Europe. HEINEKEN will continue the discipline to price responsibly as per local market conditions  aiming to cover most of the absolute impact of inflation in its cost base. HEINEKEN anticipates an increase in its input costs in the high teens per hectolitre and significantly higher energy costs  particularly in Europe. HEINEKEN will deliver on its gross savings ahead of the €2 billion target relative to the cost base of 2019  including an increased ambition of savings in Europe. Overall as a result  net revenue (beia) will grow organically ahead of operating profit (beia). Due to the phasing of marketing and selling expenses and input cost pressures  the operating profit (beia) organic growth will be skewed towards the second half.HEINEKEN also expects in 2023 an average effective interest rate (beia) of around 3.1% (2022: 2.8%); an effective tax rate (beia) of around 27% (2022: 27.7%) and a significant increase in other net finance expenses  driven by the expected impact from foreign currencies in some emerging markets. As a result  net profit (beia) is expected to grow organically in line or below the operating profit (beia).Finally  HEINEKEN expects investments in capital expenditure related to property  plant and equipment and intangible assets to amount to c.9% of net revenue (beia) (2022: c.7%)Total Dividend For 2022The Heineken N.V. dividend policy is to pay a ratio of 30% to 40% of full year net profit (beia). For 2022  a total cash dividend of €1.73 per share  representing an increase of 40% (2021: €1.24)  and a payout ratio of 35.1%  in the middle of the range of Heineken N.V.'s policy  will be proposed to the Heineken N.V. Annual General Meeting on 20 April 2023. If approved  a final dividend of €1.23 per share will be paid on 2 May 2023  as an interim dividend of €0.50 per share was paid on 11 August 2022.If Heineken N.V. shareholders approve the proposed dividend  Heineken Holding N.V. will  according to its Articles of Association  pay an identical dividend per share. A final dividend of €1.23 per share of €1.60 nominal value will be payable as of 2 May 2023.Both the Heineken Holding N.V. shares and the Heineken N.V. shares will trade ex-dividend on 24 April 2023. The dividend payment will be subject to a 15% Dutch withholding tax.Translational Calculated Currency ImpactThe translational currency impact for 2022 was positive  amounting to €1 582 million on net revenue (beia)  €258 million at operating profit (beia) and €198 million at net profit (beia).Applying spot rates as of 13 February 2023 to the 2022 financial results as a base  the calculated currency translational impact would be negative  approximately €560 million in net revenue (beia)  €80 million at operating profit (beia)  and €40 million at net profit (beia).Board of Directors CompositionMrs C.L. de Carvalho-Heineken and Mr M.R. de Carvalho will have completed their four-year appointment term upon conclusion of the Heineken Holding N.V.

LTD (“CTTQ”)  a subsidiary of Sino Biopharm  in connection with the previously announced licensing and collaboration agreement dated September 21  2022.Cash and cash equivalents at year end also included the €25.0 million tranche of the previously announced unsecured loan agreement executed with the European Investment Bank (“EIB”) on May 16  2022  which the Company received on December 8  2022  the €9.3 million gross proceeds (€8.8 million net proceeds) raised through the Company’s At-The-Market (“ATM”) Program on June 15  2022  and the proceeds of three previously announced loan agreements with a syndicate of French banks for a total amount of €5.3 million. One of the loans was contracted as part of a French state-guaranteed loan facility with Bpifrance  and the two other loans were obtained as part of a French state stimulus economic plan granted by Crédit Agricole Champagne-Bourgogne and Société Générale.Story continuesResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased generally in line with the increase recorded during the first three quarters of 2022  and amounted to €60.5 million for the full year 2022  compared to €48.5 million in 2021. This increase was driven mostly by the costs associated with the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in NASH  including a full twelve months of operation for the U.S. affiliate and  to a lesser extent  with the LEGEND Phase IIa combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin in patients with NASH and type 2 diabetes (“T2D”).Net cash used in operating activities amounted to (€44.9) million for the full year 2022  compared to (€47.7) million in 2021. Net cash used in operating expenses in 2022 was driven primarily by R&D expenses  partially offset by the upfront payment received from CTTQ.Net cash generated from (used in) investing activities amounted to €8.9 million for the full year 2022 compared to (€1.8) million net cash used for the same period in 2021. The variance is mainly due to the change in short term deposits between both periods.Net cash generated from financing activities amounted to €37.3 million for the full year 2022 compared to €25.4 million for 2021. Net cash generated from financing activities in 2022 has been driven by the proceeds of the first tranche of €25 million from the EIB loan  proceeds of €9.3 million from the sale of securities through the Company’s ATM program and proceeds of €5.3 million from three French state partially guaranteed loans  as described above.For the full year 2022  the Company recorded a negative exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents of (€1.0) million versus a positive effect of €4.8 million for 2021  due to the strengthening of USD versus Euro.Considering its current R&D and clinical development programs  the Company estimates that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits should allow the Company to fund its operations through the fourth quarter of 20232. This cash runway estimate does not include the conditional second tranche of €25.0 million of the EIB loan agreement3.RevenuesThe Company’s revenues for the full year 2022 amounted to €12.2 million  as compared to €4.2 million for 2021. The revenues recorded in 2022 were driven mostly by the Company’s development agreement with CTTQ  executed on September 21  2022  and revenues recorded in 2021 primarily consisted of a €4.0 million milestone payment for a milestone that was recorded following the launch by AbbVie of the Phase IIb clinical trial with cedirogant. As previously disclosed  this trial of cedirogant has since been discontinued by AbbVie and the partnership with AbbVie has been terminated.Next key milestones expectedPublication of the topline results of the investigator-initiated study with lanifibranor in patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (“NAFLD”) and T2D – planned for the first quarter of 2023Publication of the topline results of the LEGEND Phase IIa combination trial of lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin in patients with NASH and T2D – planned for the second half of 2023Last Patient First Visit of the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in NASH – targeted for the second half of 2023Upcoming investor conference participationCowen 43 rd Annual Health Care Conference – March 6-8 – Boston  MAGuggenheim Health Altitudes Summit 2023 – March 13-16 – Telluride  ColoradoEvercore ISI NASH Renaissance – March 30 – VirtualKempen Life Sciences Conference – April 25-26 – AmsterdamUpcoming scientific conference participationGlobal NASH – March 2-3 – LondonAEEH – March 15-17 _ MadridLiver Connect conference – March 23-26 – Huntington Beach   CAAASLD Emerging topic: NASH Cirrhosis from mechanisms to management – March 25-26- Los Angeles  CANext financial results publicationFull-Year 2022 financial results: Wednesday  March 29  2023 (after U.S. market close)About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH  mucopolysaccharidoses (“MPS”) and other diseases with significant unmet medical need.

Our dream is to shape the future of beer and beyond to win the hearts of consumers. We are also shaping the future with our ambition to become the best digitally connected brewer  raising the bar on sustainability and responsibility and evolving our culture  operating model and capabilities. At the same time  we are stepping up on productivity to fund the investments required and improve profitability and capital efficiency.SHAPE THE FUTURE OF BEER AND BEYONDSuperior and balanced growthOur superior and balanced growth ambition is grounded in our advantaged geographic footprint  our ability to scale strong premium beer brands  including non-alcoholic variants  and in developing winning beverage propositions in fast-growing segments.Revenue for the full year 2022 was €34 676 million (2021: 26 583 million). Net revenue (beia) increased by 21.2% organically  with total consolidated volume growing by 6.4% and net revenue (beia) per hectolitre up 13.9%. The underlying price-mix on a constant geographic basis was up 14.3%  driven by pricing for inflation and by premiumisation. All regions contributed with double-digit organic growth. Currency translation positively impacted net revenue (beia) by €1 582 million or 7.2%  mainly driven by the Mexican Peso  Brazilian Real  Vietnamese Dong and the US Dollar. Consolidation changes positively impacted net revenue (beia) by €570 million or 2.6%  mainly from the consolidation of United Breweries Limited (UBL) in India.Beer volume grew 6.9% organically for the full year and was ahead of 2019 by 2.7% on an organic basis. The growth was led by the sharp recovery of Asia Pacific in the second half of the year  the reopening of the on-trade in Europe in the first half following the COVID-related restrictions of last year and continued growth in the Americas and Africa  Middle East & Eastern Europe regions.Beer volume 4Q22 Organicgrowth FY22 Organicgrowth (in mhl) 4Q21 FY21 Heineken N.V. 63.3 61.1 3.5 % 256.9 231.2 6.9 % Africa  Middle East & Eastern Europe 9.8 10.1 -3.3 % 39.2 38.9 1.5 % Americas 23.8 23.9 -0.5 % 88.5 85.4 3.7 % Asia Pacific 12.2 10.0 22.9 % 48.0 29.4 29.3 % Europe 17.5 17.1 1.9 % 81.2 77.5 4.6 %In the fourth quarter  net revenue (beia) grew organically by 17.4%  with double-digit growth across all regions. Total consolidated volume grew 3.0% and net revenue (beia) per hectolitre was up 14.0%. Price-mix on a constant geographic basis was up 14.5%  again driven by pricing and premiumisation. Beer volume grew 3.5%  driven by Asia Pacific and continued growth in Europe  more than offsetting lower volume in other regions.Driving premiumisation at scale  led by Heineken®Premium beer volume grew 11.4% versus last year and came 15.6% ahead of 2019  organically. Our premium brands outperformed the total portfolio in the majority of our markets and accounted for more than half of our total organic growth in beer volume in 2022.This growth is led by Heineken®  up 12.5% versus last year (14.5% excluding Russia) and 31.5% relative to 2019  significantly outperforming the total beer market. The growth was broad-based with more than 50 markets growing double-digits in 2022. The strong growth was led by Heineken® Original  bolstered by the remarkable performance of its line extensions. Heineken® Silver more than doubled its volume  driven by excellent performances in Vietnam and China and its global rollout  reaching 28 markets in total by the end of 2022.Heineken® volume 4Q22 Organicgrowth FY22 Organicgrowth (in mhl) Total 14.8 11.2 % 54.9 12.5 % Africa Middle East & Eastern Europe 1.7 -9.5 % 6.4 -2.7 % Americas 6.4 6.9 % 22.2 13.5 % Asia Pacific 2.9 51.3 % 9.5 33.4 % Europe 3.7 7.8 % 16.8 8.0 %Heineken® connects with millions of consumers every year with world-class campaigns and sponsorships to share our brand DNA in a meaningful way to spark growth  and to contribute to our sustainability goals and responsibility initiatives. In 2022  we launched the ‘Cheers to All Fans’ campaign  tackling gender bias affecting football's players and fans. 2022 was Heineken®’s first year as a leading sponsor of the UEFA Women’s EUROs  with the objective to become the most inclusive sponsor of the tournament.We continued to successfully premiumise at scale via our international brands portfolio  complementing Heineken® by connecting with an even more diverse range of consumer needs. Amstel grew volume in the mid-twenties  with more than 15 markets growing double-digits  with a particularly strong performance in Brazil and continued momentum behind Amstel Ultra. Birra Moretti grew in the mid-teens versus last year  sharing the true taste of Italy across Europe  with outstanding growth in the Netherlands  Serbia  Romania  Switzerland and Ireland. In the UK  Birra Moretti more than doubled its volume versus 2019 and became the market leader of the premium segment by value. 2022 was the year of the Tiger; our brand roared back to volume growth of more than 40%  driven by the recovery in Southeast Asia  the success of Tiger Crystal and continued growth in Nigeria and Brazil.Pioneer choice in low & no-alcoholWe believe in empowering consumers seeking to enjoy a lower or no-alcohol-content beverage by ensuring there is always a choice – everywhere and on any occasion. Meeting this consumer need  our Low & No-Alcohol (LONO) portfolio grew by low-single-digit as continued momentum in the majority of our markets was partially offset by declines in Egypt  Russia and Poland. Our non-alcoholic beer and cider portfolio grew by mid-single-digit  led by the growth of Heineken® 0.0 in the low-teens in Europe and the Americas regions.We continued to introduce consumer-inspired innovations to enhance our non-alcoholic beer and cider portfolio. For example  in the United States  Lagunitas launched Hoppy Refresher  an adult beverage proposition of hop-infused sparkling water that can compete with carbonated soft drinks. In Nigeria  we launched ZAGG  a malt-based energy drink  entering a new category in Nigeria with potential to scale beyond within the Region. In Mexico  we are currently introducing Tecate 0.0  a non-alcoholic variant to our second largest brand globally by volume  aiming to counter the stigma that beer cannot be enjoyed during mid-day meal occasions.Explore beyond beerAs we expand our view of consumer demand  we see opportunities beyond beer for flavoured  innovative  natural and moderate propositions leveraging our industrial and route to market base. We are leveraging our scale as the second largest player in this segment outside of the United States to explore further this consumer space. Our overall volume of flavoured beer and beyond beer alcoholic propositions grew by a mid-single-digit to 12.9 million hectolitres (2021: 12.3 million hectolitres).Desperados is the leading ""spirit beer"" for high energy occasions with a presence in more than 80 countries. It continued its growth momentum in 2022  doubling its volume in Nigeria  with continued growth in Europe (particularly in Germany  the UK  Spain and France) and boosted by Desperados cocktail inspired line extensions and Virgin 0.0.We expanded our global leadership position in Cider. Global volume grew by a low-single-digit to 5.0 million hectolitres (2021: 4.9 million)  mainly driven by the strong growth of Strongbow in South Africa. We launched Strongbow Ultra  a low-calorie  low-carb and natural proposition to renovate the brand and the overall cider category with strong early results. In the UK  Strongbow Ultra Dark Fruit reached c.70% of the size of the total hard seltzer category in its first year of launch.In Mexico  we launched Sol Mangoyada  further strengthening our leadership position in beyond beer. In the United States  building on the success of Dos Equis Lime and Salt around rituals that consumers follow  we launched Dos Equis Classic Lime Margarita.Our advantaged footprintWe continue to develop and expand our geographical and portfolio footprint to enhance our long-term  sustained growth advantage.Between 18 and 24 January 2023 the Competition Tribunal of South Africa held the hearings related to the transaction with Distell Group Holdings Limited and Namibia Breweries Limited  and we are awaiting their final decision. We remain very excited with the opportunity to bring together strong businesses to create a regional beverage champion  and we are committed to being a strong partner for growth and to make a positive impact in the communities in which we operate. We continue to expect the transaction to close in the coming months.We continue to make progress to transfer the ownership of our business in Russia whilst dealing with frequently changing regulations. We remain optimistic in our ability to reach an agreement in the coming months. Based on our current assessment  an impairment of €88 million is recorded for the period ended 31 December 2022. See page 14 for more details.On 19 October 2022  we acquired 28.2% of the shares of Grupa Zywiec (GZ) and  on 20 December 2022  concluded a mandatory tender bid for the remaining 6.6% of the shares. On 19 January 2023  we acquired the remaining shares of GZ through a squeeze-out process  becoming the sole owner of the company. GZ has filed an application to delist from the Warsaw Stock Exchange.BECOME THE BEST-CONNECTED BREWERHEINEKEN wants to become the best-connected  most relevant brewer for customers living in the digital age. To achieve this  we are digitally transforming our business and modernising our technology landscape at the same time.Digitise our route-to-consumerWe continue to deploy our business-to-business digital (eB2B) platforms  supported by the eBusiness team  which is driving this capability globally. By the end of 2022  the platforms captured €9.2 billion in gross merchandise value  2.5x the value of last year. We now connect more than half a million customers  over 50% more than last year. The growth was driven by Vietnam  Nigeria  Mexico  Brazil  the UK  Ireland  France  Italy and Cambodia.The digitisation of customer relationships unlocks new growth with more and better services and data insights  increasing sales and productivity. For example  with AIDDA  an artificial intelligence application  we support our sales representatives to help our customers grow  making our sales organisation more effective and efficient.We will start migrating our eB2B platforms under a single brand name and identity: eazle  business made easy. The transition will enable better features at scale resulting in improved customer experience with increased efficiency  helping them to grow their business.FUND THE GROWTH  FUEL THE PROFITOur growth algorithm aims to deliver superior  balanced growth enabled by incremental investments behind the power of our brands  digital transformation  capabilities and sustainability objectives. We are bringing balance to our growth  investing behind the power of our brands which enables us to price responsibly. To fund the growth and offset inflationary pressures  we are structurally addressing our cost base and building a cost-conscious culture. We are embedding this into an ongoing continuum of productivity improvements to fuel profit growth ahead of revenue growth over time.During 2022  we made significant progress in the delivery of our productivity programme  targeting €2 billion of structural gross savings by 2023  relative to our cost base of 2019. By the end of 2022  we captured €1.7 billion of these gross savings and are well on track to deliver ahead of our target in 2023.We are improving our performance on cost and embedding cost management in the capabilities of the organisation. Our teams are advancing thousands of initiatives across all our operating companies and the head office. We are also accelerating large-scale transformation programmes  such as the transition to a network model for our supply chain in Europe. These achievements gave us the confidence to declare our new ambition to deliver ongoing productivity gains of €400 million year on year.We continued to invest in our business and in addition  we reversed the significant cost mitigation actions undertaken in 2021 to partially offset the financial impact of COVID-related restrictions. Last year  these represented a reduction of expenses (beia) of circa €0.5 billion for the full year relative to 2019.Operating profit (beia) grew 24.0% organically driven by the volume recovery in Asia Pacific and Europe  pricing for inflation  premiumisation and the delivery of our productivity programme  partially offset by inflationary pressures in our cost base and incremental investments behind our growth agenda. Currency translation positively impacted operating profit (beia) by €258 million  or 7.6%  mainly driven by the Mexican Peso  Vietnamese Dong and Brazilian Real. Operating profit declined by 4.5% as the strong profit recovery this year was offset by lower exceptional gains  which in the previous year included the €1.3 billion remeasurement to fair value of the previously held equity interest in United Breweries (UBL) in India.Net profit (beia) grew 30.7% organically to €2 836 million (2021: €2 041 million)  ahead of the growth in operating profit (beia) due to a lower effective tax rate. Currency translation positively impacted net profit (beia) by €198 million or 9.7%  driven mainly by the Mexican Peso  Vietnamese Dong and Brazilian Real. Net profit after exceptional items and amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles was €2 682 million (2021: €3 324 million)  lower than last year due to the exceptional gains in 2021 as explained above.For more details  please refer to the Financial Review.RAISE THE BAR ON SUSTAINABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITYBrew a Better World is our 2030 strategy to drive progress towards a net zero  fairer and more balanced world. We are making good progress across all three pillars and are building executional momentum to deliver our ambitions.Environmental: Path to net zero impactOur ambition is to reach net zero carbon emissions across our value chain by 2040  with an intermediate 2030 goal to reach net zero in scope 1 and 2  reduce our emissions in scope 3 by 21%  and across our value chain (scope 1  2 and 3) by 30%. Since 2018  we have reduced our absolute carbon emissions in scope 1 and 2 by 18% (2021: 16%). We also increased the percentage of combined renewable energy to 37% (2021: 27%). We are driving progress in scope 3 by engaging our top packaging  cooling and raw material partners globally to set science-based targets and unlock low-carbon solutions. We also achieved an “A” score for Climate from the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) in 2022.We continue to focus on healthy watersheds via water efficiency  water circularity and water balancing. Our 2030 ambition is to reduce water usage to 2.6 hectolitre per hectolitre (hl/hl) in water-stressed areas and 2.9 hl/hl worldwide. In 2022  we reached 3.0 hl/hl and 3.3 hl/hl (2021: 3.1 and 3.4)  respectively. 26 of our 31 sites in water-stressed areas have begun watershed protection programmes and 29% of these sites are fully balanced. 97% of our total wastewater volume is now treated before discharge.When it comes to circularity  more than 75% of our production sites are now landfill-free  meaning 99% of our total waste volume globally was reused or recycled in 2022.Social: Path to an inclusive  fair and equitable worldWe are making progress when it comes to gender diversity. Over the last 5 years  we increased the percentage of senior management positions held by women from 19% to 27% (2021: 25%). Our ambition is to achieve 30% by 2025 and 40% by 2030 on the path to gender balance.We also aim for equal pay for equal work between female and male colleagues and want to ensure that all employees worldwide earn at least a fair wage by 2023. By the end of 2022  100% of operating companies have been assessed on equal pay and have detailed action plans to drive year-on-year progress. Regarding fair wage  100% of operating companies have been assessed and over 99% of direct employees earn at least a fair wage  as defined by the Fair Wage Network.1As part of our ambition to create a positive impact in our communities  we reached our annual target of having a social impact initiative in place in 100% of our in-scope markets. We also increased the volume of locally sourced agricultural raw materials in Africa by 26% compared to a 2020 baseline  meaning we are halfway to our goal of 50% by 2025.1 A fair wage is often higher than the minimum wage and should be sufficient for a decent standard of living  covering the basic needs for the employee and their family: from food  housing and education to healthcare  transportation and some discretionary income and savings. Data on fair wages is obtained from the Fair Wage Network.Responsible: Path to moderate and no harmful useOur ambition is to make 0.0 alcohol options available for consumers everywhere so that there is always a choice. Heineken® 0.0 is now available in close to 110 markets and  by 2023  we aim for a zero-alcohol option to be available for at least two strategic brands in the majority of our operating companies  accounting for 90% of our business by volume. By the end of 2022  we were at 46% (2021: 43%).We continue to use the power of our flagship brand to advance responsible consumption and make moderation cool. In 2022  our operating companies invested over 10% of Heineken® media spend reaching at least 1.2 billion unique consumers worldwide.In addition to this  100% of our in-scope markets had a partnership with governments and society to address alcohol-related harm.GovernanceIn 2022  we continued to raise the bar on our ways of working  governance and transparent reporting. Given the importance of sustainability and responsibility for long-term value creation:We introduced three ESG metrics in our long-term incentive plan for senior managers  representing 25% of total remuneration. This proposal was approved for the Executive Board at the 2022 AGM in April;We further integrated sustainability & responsibility into our existing planning processes  including ring-fencing the required investments;We are enhancing our reporting capabilities to meet emerging requirements such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). We also completed our first TCFD analysis and the outcomes are included in the Annual Report.UNLOCKING THE FULL POTENTIAL OF OUR PEOPLE AND ORGANISATIONCritical to the success of our multi-year EverGreen strategy is the evolution of our culture. Since the launch of EverGreen  we have been focused on this shift towards disciplined entrepreneurship with more agility  external focus  and clear accountability. Throughout the organisation  we have redesigned processes to facilitate horizontal learning and codified new behaviours that support EverGreen in our ambition to shape the future of beer and beyond.Our Employee Engagement scores rank in the top quartile of the benchmark of high performing companies and we aspire to maintain this. In 2022  we scored even higher whilst our teams were dealing with uncertainty and change  a clear sign of the strength and commitment of our people.Outlook 2023On 30 November 2022  ahead of our Capital Markets Event  we reconfirmed our guidance to our outlook statements. These expectations remain unchanged and are included here as a reminder with further details.For 2023  we expect operating profit (beia) to grow organically mid- to high-single-digit  subject to any significant unforeseen macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. This outlook is based on continued progress on EverGreen  a challenging global economic environment and lower consumer confidence in certain markets.We expect further progress towards building great brands  our digital route to consumer  strategic capabilities and our Brew a Better World activities with commensurate investments. We also expect stable to modestly growing volume  increasing in developing markets and declining in Europe. We will continue the discipline to price responsibly as per local market conditions  aiming to cover most of the absolute impact of inflation in our cost base. We anticipate an increase in our input costs in the high teens per hectolitre and significantly higher energy costs  particularly in Europe. We will deliver on our gross savings ahead of the €2 billion target relative to the cost base of 2019  including an increased ambition of savings in Europe. Overall as a result  net revenue (beia) will grow organically ahead of operating profit (beia). Due to the phasing of marketing and selling expenses and input cost pressures  the operating profit (beia) organic growth will be skewed towards the second half.We also expect in 2023 an average effective interest rate (beia) of around 3.1% (2022: 2.8%); an effective tax rate (beia) of around 27% (2022: 27.7%) and a significant increase in other net finance expenses  driven by the expected impact from foreign currencies in some emerging markets. As a result  net profit (beia) is expected to grow organically in line or below the operating profit (beia).Finally  we expect investments in capital expenditure related to property  plant and equipment and intangible assets to amount to c.9% of net revenue (beia) (2022: c.7%)Total Dividend For 2022The Heineken N.V. dividend policy is to pay a ratio of 30% to 40% of full year net profit (beia). For 2022  a total cash dividend of €1.73 per share  representing an increase of 40% (2021: €1.24)  and a payout ratio of 35.1%  in the middle of the range of our policy  will be proposed to the Annual General Meeting on 20 April 2023 (""2023 AGM""). If approved  a final dividend of €1.23 per share will be paid on 2 May 2023  as an interim dividend of €0.50 per share was paid on 11 August 2022. The payment will be subject to a 15% Dutch withholding tax. The ex-dividend date for Heineken N.V. shares will be 24 April 2023.Translational Calculated Currency ImpactThe translational currency impact for 2022 was positive  amounting to €1 582 million on net revenue (beia)  €258 million at operating profit (beia) and €198 million at net profit (beia).Applying spot rates as of 13 February 2023 to the 2022 financial results as a base  the calculated currency translational impact would be negative  approximately €560 million in net revenue (beia)  €80 million at operating profit (beia)  and €40 million at net profit (beia).Supervisory Board CompositionOn 20 December 2022  HEINEKEN announced the nomination of Mrs. Beatriz Pardo and Mr. Lodewijk Hijmans van den Bergh for appointment as members of the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) on 20 April 2023 for a four-year term.Mrs. Beatriz Pardo  a Spanish national  is Vice President General Manager of Starbucks Reserve in the United States at the Starbucks Coffee Company.

18510,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4578436-lyrical-asset-management-2022-global-review-letter,Lyrical Asset Management 2022 Global Review Letter,Lyrical Asset Management published its 2022 Global Review Letter recently. Click here to read the full fund letter.,scyther52022 Global Value Review*Partial year  inception date of 5/31/19. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Click to enlargeThe Global Value portfolio outperformed the MSCI World index by 290 bps in 2022. For the first three quarters of the year  the portfolio was slightly behind the index  before surging in the fourth quarter  with a +15.1% return  compared to +9.8% for the MSCI World.Since inception in 2019  the portfolio has generated a 9.6% annualized return  with 100 bps and 220 bps of annual outperformance  against the MSCI World and MSCI World Value indices  respectively. We have achieved this result while climbing a wall of worry that has included: a value downcycle in 2019  COVID in 2020  an economic reopening in 2021  and then inflation  rising interest rates  the war in Ukraine  and a weakened European economy in 2022.From a valuation perspective  the portfolio is trading at 9.4x 12-month forward earnings  which is as cheap as it’s been since the strategy was launched in 2019. And  from an earnings perspective  the portfolio shows superior fundamentals with better historical earnings growth and more resilient earnings during economic downturns. Since inception  we have not seen as attractive a combination of value and growth in our portfolio.LOOKING BACKThe Global Value portfolio ended 2022 ahead of the MSCI World but behind the MSCI World Value. The portfolio lagged the value index in 2022  with most of this underperformance attributable to differences in sector composition. Relative to the World Value index  the portfolio is overweight Information Technology and Consumer Discretionary by 31%  which we estimate created an ~5% headwind to returns. The portfolio is 15% underweight Energy and Consumer Staples  which hurt performance by another ~5%. In summary  sector weightings explain all the -8.8% relative return to the value index and then some.While the sector differences to the value benchmark hurt the performance in 2022  we think that our positioning is right for the long haul. These sector weights emerge from our bottom-up stock selection process  not from an active top-down approach.Besides Value  we look for Quality and Analyzability. The traits of Quality and Analyzability have led us toward cheap stocks with attractive growth within the Information Technology and Consumer Discretionary sectors  and away from cheap unanalyzable stocks within the Energy sector and expensive stocks within Staples.THE ERROR OF TRACKING VALUE INDICESWe worry little about tracking the MSCI World Value  which is structured to own lower-growth businesses (like consumer staples) or lower-quality businesses (like energy and commodities). This hasn’t been a winning long-term approach for that index. On the graph below  we present the annual return of the MSCI World Value relative to the MSCI World going back to 2000. The tech bubble burst in March 2000 and the value index had an amazing year  outperforming by over 13 percentage points. Over the next six years  the value index continued to outperform  and over the full seven-year period  the value index cumulative return was 52.9% compared to just 16.1% for the MSCI World  an outperformance margin of 36.8 percentage points.In 2007 the good run for the MSCI World Value ended  and for the next 15 years it underperformed almost every year. Over that period  the value index still appreciated 99.7%  but it lagged the 193.2% return of the MSCI World by a whopping 93.5 percentage points. Now  finally  in 2022 the value index had its best year of relative performance since the tech bubble ended in 2000  outperforming by 11.6 percentage points.MSCI World Value Returns Relative to MSCI WorldSource: FactSetLyrical’s returns have not always been in sync with those of the value indices  and we see this is as a good thing. Since we launched in 2019  we outperformed the MSCI World by 4 percentage points cumulatively while the MSCI World Value underperformed the World index by 5 percentage points.TIME FOR DEEP VALUEThe biggest difference between our portfolio and the MSCI World Value is that we are deeper value  trading at a 30% cheaper P/E ratio. Unlike the index  we only invest in the cheapest stocks in the market because these stocks have delivered a consistent source of alpha. As shown below  the cheapest 20% of stocks in global developed markets have delivered outperformance of nearly 6% per year compared to the MSCI World since 1974. Notably  the MSCI World Value has underperformed over this entire period  in the process giving value a bad name.Why Global Value StocksSource: FactSet. Lyrical exercised discretion in determining the dates of each cycle.Owning truly cheap stocks has been a winning formula over the very long-term  but value does go through downcycles. The table below shows the data from the above chart  comparing the performance of the cheapest stocks in global markets to the MSCI World. We highlight value upcycles in blue. As summarized at the bottom  value upcycles have lasted about seven years in global markets  and they’ve been interrupted by downcycles lasting almost two years. From March 2018 to May 2020  global value stocks had their second worst downcycle  underperforming the MSCI World by -14.8%  annualized.TIME FOR DEEP VALUEOwning truly cheap stocks has been a winning formula over the very long-term  but value does go through downcycles. The table below shows the data from the above chart  comparing the performance of the cheapest stocks in global markets to the MSCI World. We highlight value upcycles in blue. As summarized at the bottom  value upcycles have lasted about seven years in global markets  and they’ve been interrupted by downcycles lasting almost two years. From March 2018 to May 2020  global value stocks had their second worst downcycle  underperforming the MSCI World by -14.8%  annualized.History of Global Value Performance CyclesSource: FactSet. Lyrical exercised discretion in determining the dates of each cycle.Historically  the worse a downcycle is in value stocks  the better the upcycle on the other side  and we believe this sets the stage for abnormally good returns in value stocks from here for years to come. When value stocks underperform—as they did from 2018 to 2020—the valuation spread between these cheap stocks and the market widens. As shown below  the P/E for the median stock in our 2 500-stock global universe is 15.8x  or 105% more expensive than the median stock in the cheapest part of the market. This is an extreme spread that is wider than we saw in the Global Financial Crisis  after which value stocks outperformed for nine years at more than 6% per year. We outperformed during a challenging period for value stocks  but now we think the wind is at our back and expect future returns to be even better.Value Spreads Abnormally WideSPOTLIGHT ON EUROPE: GLOBAL COMPOUNDERS ON SALEIn 2022  we initiated nine positions  five of them in Europe. This increased our European exposure to 20% of the portfolio  which is in line with the MSCI World’s exposure. An increased exposure to Europe during a year that saw a ground war  an energy crisis  and a collapsing currency may raise some eyebrows. With such a tumultuous macroeconomic backdrop  investors may wonder why one would want more European exposure. While we don’t disagree with these macro concerns  we believe this broad-based macroeconomic fear has created a wonderful opportunity to own good  global businesses  trading at deep discounts.Macro concerns around Europe are real. However  these concerns have depressed the valuations of many European-listed global businesses. For the five European businesses we added in 2022  less than 50% of revenues comes from Europe on average. In the chart below  we show the portfolio exposure by stock listing and by business revenue. While we have added to Europe  we remain widely diversified across developed economies by both listing and revenues.Portfolio Revenues are Globally DiversifiedSource: FactSetVALUING RESILIENCYIt’s important that the European businesses in the portfolio are more global in nature  but it is equally important that they have flexible business models that can withstand macroeconomic shocks. Because we don’t forecast macroeconomic conditions  it’s critical we own resilient businesses; since we cannot predict the macroeconomic conditions  we must own businesses that can quickly adapt to changing macroeconomic scenarios.As a result  we favor variable cost and low capital-intensity businesses. Of the portfolio’s exposure to European-listed businesses  70% is within consumer or business services. Even when times are tough  these businesses can adjust. In the financial crisis in 2008-2009 and during the pandemic of 2020  the earnings for the European businesses (in the current portfolio) fell significantly less than those of the market  as you can see below.Lyrical European Companies Resilient in the Worst of TimesOWNING COMPANIES THAT GROW IN ANY MACRO  INCLUDING EURONEXTFor example  in 2022 we purchased Euronext (OTCPK:EUXTF)  a market exchange business that operates seven local country exchanges across Europe  including the Paris Stock Exchange and the Borsa Italiana. In the chart below  we show the stock price  EPS  and forward P/E for Euronext since the company was spun off from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in 2014. As shown in the middle of the chart  the company has compounded EPS at a 19% annualized rate. Despite this impressive growth  we were able to acquire the shares for only 12x P/E  one of the lowest valuations ever for the business and 50% cheaper than market exchange peers that have grown at a slower rate on average.Euronext: Cheapest Global Exchange despite Industry-Leading EPS GrowthSource: FactSet. A list of all recommendations is available upon request.Exchanges are classic network effects businesses  and they are resilient. The exchange that connects the most buyers and sellers of any asset allows for the most accurate pricing  which drives more buyers and sellers to its platform. In Europe  Euronext is the scale exchange. By combining seven local markets into one trading platform  the company has created the deepest liquidity pool in Europe  with a market share above 70% across its footprint. This scale advantage for Euronext  combined with a capital-light business model  drives its operating margin above 50%. The business is highly defensive  as about 60% of Euronext’s revenues are recurring  including fees from licensing their index data for ETFs and fees for providing unique European government bond data. The remaining 40% of revenues are driven by trading  which is countercyclical. During periods of crisis  people tend to trade more. We saw this during COVID when revenues rose 30% in 2020. Beyond being defensive  Euronext is also a business that has grown faster than its underlying GDP.In fact  in aggregate  the European portfolio companies have organically expanded their topline two percentage points above their local GDP over the past five years.Over the past five years  Euronext has grown organic revenues around 6% per year  more than three percentage points better than the European economy. As Euronext continues to add services and data offerings and as it continues to consolidate the fragmented European exchange market  we expect organic growth to continue  even if Europe were to enter a prolonged recessionary period. This growth in sales comes with a limited need to grow its relatively small  fixed cost base. As such  we expect the company to continue growing EPS at a double-digit rate.PUTTING IT TOGETHER: COMPOUNDERS IN THE BARGAIN BINIn the European region  we’ve put together a portfolio of companies that we believe should succeed no matter what the macroeconomic conditions bring. These companies have already delivered 7% earnings growth since 2007  during a period when Europe has had more than its fair share of turmoil and while the STOXX Europe 600 benchmark grew earnings at just ~1%. Despite this growth and resiliency in the portfolio  the European stocks trade at just 10x 12-month forward earnings.While the European stocks only make up 20% of the portfolio  the remaining 80% of the portfolio is similarly attractive. The broad global portfolio trades with a forward P/E of 9.4x but has delivered 7.7% EPS growth since 2007  as shown below. And while these stocks are cheap on forward P/E  that only tells part of the story. With their exceptional growth rates  we see the portfolio trading at an average of 4.8x five-year forward earnings  compared with the long-term median multiple for the universe of 9x.Uncommon Combination of Value and GrowthSource: FactSetLOOKING FORWARDWe anticipate strong returns on an absolute and relative basis from here. The MSCI World trades for about a 60% premium to the portfolio  and we see the upside to intrinsic value above 80%.As bottom-up investors  that’s a positive  as it creates opportunities in the cheapest part of the market to find good businesses at bargain prices. Over time the fundamentals should shine through.Andrew Wellington  John Mullins  and Dan KaskawitsTHIS IS NOT AN OFFERING OR THE SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO INVEST IN THE STRATEGY PRESENTED.

(“CoolCo” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has filed a registration statement with the U.S...,"Cool Company Ltd.Bermuda  February 14  2023: Cool Company Ltd. (“CoolCo” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)  with the intention of directly listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). Subject to the registration statement being declared effective by the SEC  the Company’s shares will be registered with the SEC and listed for trading on the NYSE in addition to the Euronext Growth Oslo under the ticker “CLCO” from March 15  2023. No new CoolCo securities will be issued in connection with the share listing on the NYSE.In connection with a listing on the NYSE  CoolCo also expects to change its ticker code on Euronext Growth Oslo from “COOL” to “CLCO”. Further details on the change of ticker code will be provided in due course.In order to facilitate transfer of shares between the two trading venues  CoolCo intends to amend the registration structure for its shares whereby all shares will be primarily held and settled within the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) in the United States and secondarily held and settled in Euronext Securities Oslo (the “VPS”) through a Central Securities Depository (“CSD”) link (the “Reregistration Process”). Following the Reregistration Process  the Company’s shares will be able to be moved between the DTC and VPS to enable trading between the respective trading venues. A trading suspension in the CoolCo shares will be required for a period of time in connection with the Reregistration Process  expected to be two trading days  and the Company will make a request to Oslo Børs to approve such suspension. No action will be required by an investor holding shares in the VPS in connection with the reregistration and investors’ registered holdings in the VPS will continue. See below for further details on the Reregistration Process.CoolCo CEO Richard Tyrrell commented:“By listing on the NYSE  we are expanding our investor base and providing US investors with access to CoolCo’s unique combination of attractive dividends and exposure to the fast-growing global demand for LNG transportation. Upon listing  CoolCo will be one of the largest of a limited number of U.S. publicly traded companies that are connecting global markets with LNG  which is crucial to energy security and has an important role in the global transition to a lower-carbon future. Our new presence in the U.S. market will generate immediate value for all CoolCo shareholders by providing easier access to CoolCo shares and additional trading liquidity. Additionally  the dual listing further strengthens CoolCo’s financial flexibility  supplementing our strong balance sheet  significant internal cash generation  and proven access to competitively priced debt in ensuring that we are well positioned to seize attractive growth opportunities in a prudent manner that maximizes shareholder value.”Story continuesDetails on the contemplated Reregistration Process and associated temporary Trading Suspension in CoolCo’s sharesNo action is required by an investor holding shares in the VPS in connection with the Reregistration Process  and investors’ holdings in the VPS will continue. The Company’s shares will continue to trade under the same ISIN as today (BMG2415A1137).The dates set out in the following paragraphs are preliminary only and subject to change depending on the date that the Company’s registration statement is declared effective by the SEC and the NYSE commences trading of CoolCo shares. Hence these dates should be treated as indicative only. Further confirmation of the exact timing of the contemplated Reregistration Process and Trading Suspension will be provided in due course.The Reregistration Process is expected to be completed during the period March 13  2023  to March 14  2023. Due to technical settlement requirements in the VPS  a trading suspension in the CoolCo shares will be required from and including March 13  2023  to and including March 14  2023 (the “Trading Suspension”). The Company will make a request to Oslo Børs to approve the Trading Suspension prior to implementation of the Reregistration Process. During the Trading Suspension  the Company’s shares will be temporarily suspended from trading on Euronext Growth Oslo. From the perspective of an investor holding the Company’s shares in the VPS  the last settlement cycle for shares traded prior to the Trading Suspension will take place on March 14  2023. Investors trading in the Company’s shares prior to start of the Trading Suspension should not agree to settlement periods that would imply settlement after March 14  2023. Any such trades with settlement after March 14  2023  are expected to be cancelled.Following completion of the Reregistration Process  the Trading Suspension will end  and the Company’s shares will resume trading as normal  which is expected to occur from and including the start of trading on March 15  2023.Following completion of the Reregistration Process  the Company’s shares will be registered in the Company’s Register of Members in Bermuda in the name of DTC’s nominee  Cede & Co. and DTC will act as the primary securities depository for the shares. All shares in the Company will be primarily recorded in the DTC and secondarily recorded in the VPS through a CSD link. DNB Bank ASA  Registrars’ Department (the “VPS Registrar”) will continue to administrate the Company’s VPS register.To facilitate the secondary registration of the shares in the VPS  the Company will enter into a deposit and registrar agreement (the ""Registrar Agreement"") with the VPS Registrar. A custodian of the VPS Registrar will be registered as the holder of the primarily registered securities in the DTC pursuant to which the VPS registered shares are derived from.Following the Reregistration Process  the book entry interests recorded in the VPS and listed on Euronext Growth Oslo will still be regarded as the Company’s shares pursuant to the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (“CSDR”). The shares in the VPS will not carry any direct voting rights in the Company  but shareholders in the VPS may instruct the VPS Registrar to vote for their shares. The Company will furnish voting materials to the VPS Registrar and the VPS Registrar will notify the owners of the shares of upcoming votes and arrange to deliver the Company's voting materials to the owners of the shares. The VPS Registrar's notice will describe the information in the voting materials and explain how owners of the shares may instruct the VPS Registrar (who would then instruct the holder of such shares registered in the Register of Members) to vote the underlying shares.

The BEL® ESG Index is designed to facilitate the adoption of mainstream ESG investment solutions by investors. It is the fifth ESG Index variant for national blue-chip indices  following the launch of the CAC® 40 ESG (France)  the MIB® ESG (Italy)  the AEX® ESG (The Netherlands) and the OBX® ESG (Norway). For the index market data  Euronext has partnered with Sustainalytics  a leading global provider of ESG research  ratings and data. Sustainalytics provides the ESG assessment of companies for the composition of the index. The BEL® ESG has been designed to be fully compliant with the Central Labelling Agency's 'Towards Sustainability' label  a high-quality standard for sustainable financial products such as indices and funds. The BEL® ESG's selection methodology is as follows: The index universe comprises companies within the BEL ® 20 and BEL ® Mid indices meeting specific free float market cap and velocity criteria 1 .20 and BEL Mid indices meeting specific free float market cap and velocity criteria . Exclusion filters are applied based on broad ESG standards and approaches adopted by institutional and private investors to exclude companies breaching Global Standards Principles 2 and companies with involvement in controversial activities (specific product involvement in Tobacco  Small Arms  Controversial Weapons  Military Contracting Weapons  Thermal Coal  Oil Sands  Shale Energy  Arctic Oil & Gas  Oil & Gas and Power Generation) according to Sustainalytics' data 3 . Companies with a free float market cap below 100.000 * BEL 20 level and companies with a free float velocity lower than 20% won't be selected UN Global Compact principles  UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs)  OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and ILO Conventions The methodology will evolve to integrate new EU regulations and standards as they emerge | 1 of 3An additional filter is applied to companies based on their Sustainalytics Subindustry ESG Risk Rating percentile ranking 4 .. Eligible companies are ranked based on their Sustainalytics ESG ratings. The first 20 are selected and are free-float market capitalisation weighted in the BEL ® ESG Index 5 . The composition of the index will be revised on a quarterly basis. The governance of the index will be aligned with the BEL Family rules. The 20 companies composing the BEL® ESG on launch date are: AB Inbev Ackermans Van Haren Aedifica Aperam Barco Bekaert Bpost Cofinimmo Elia Group Fagron GBL KBC Group Lotus Bakeries Proximus Shurgard Sofina Solvay Telenet UCB WDP Stéphane Boujnah  CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext N.V.: ""Euronext is committed to support companies taking ambitious steps towards more sustainable business models. By combining the recognized BEL brand with a stringent and consensual ESG methodology while maintaining liquidity  The BEL® ESG responds to the market's growing demand for sustainable investment tools. As a leading index provider in Europe  we are determined to accelerate the transition to sustainable investments through the launch of indices such as this new BEL® ESG index. Other countries are successfully moving into the space of domestic ESG blue chip indices  following the launch of the CAC® 40 ESG in France  the AEX® ESG in the Netherlands  the OBX® ESG in Norway and the MIB® ESG in Italy."" Ita Demyttenaere  Director Client Relations  Sustainalytics: ""We are pleased to support our partnership with Euronext through the launch of the BEL® ESG index - a significant milestone for the Belgian market thanks to its compliance with the Central Labelling Agency's 'Towards Sustainability' label.

HEINEKEN's dream is to shape the future of beer and beyond to win the hearts of consumers. HEINEKEN is also shaping the future with its ambition to become the best digitally connected brewer  raising the bar on sustainability and responsibility and evolving its culture  operating model and capabilities. At the same time  we are stepping up on productivity to fund the investments required and improve profitability and capital efficiency.HEINEKEN's superior and balanced growth ambition is grounded in its advantaged geographic footprint  its ability to scale strong premium beer brands  including non-alcoholic variants  and in developing winning beverage propositions in fast-growing segments.Revenue for the full year 2022 was €34 676 million (2021: 26 583 million). Net revenue (beia) increased by 21.2% organically  with total consolidated volume growing by 6.4% and net revenue (beia) per hectolitre up 13.9%. The underlying price-mix on a constant geographic basis was up 14.3%  driven by pricing for inflation and by premiumisation. All regions contributed with double-digit organic growth. Currency translation positively impacted net revenue (beia) by €1 582 million or 7.2%  mainly driven by the Mexican Peso  Brazilian Real  Vietnamese Dong and the US Dollar. Consolidation changes positively impacted net revenue (beia) by €570 million or 2.6%  mainly from the consolidation of United Breweries Limited (UBL) in India.Beer volume grew 6.9% organically for the full year and was ahead of 2019 by 2.7% on an organic basis. The growth was led by the sharp recovery of Asia Pacific in the second half of the year  the reopening of the on-trade in Europe in the first half following the COVID-related restrictions of last year and continued growth in the Americas and Africa  Middle East & Eastern Europe regions.Beer volume 4Q22 Organicgrowth FY22 Organicgrowth (in mhl) 4Q21 FY21 Heineken N.V. 63.3 61.1 3.5 % 256.9 231.2 6.9 %In the fourth quarter  net revenue (beia) grew organically by 17.4%  with double-digit growth across all regions. Total consolidated volume grew 3.0% and net revenue (beia) per hectolitre was up 14.0%. Price-mix on a constant geographic basis was up 14.5%  again driven by pricing and premiumisation. Beer volume grew 3.5%  driven by Asia Pacific and continued growth in Europe  more than offsetting lower volume in other regions.Premium beer volume grew 11.4% versus last year and came 15.6% ahead of 2019  organically. HEINEKEN's premium brands outperformed the total portfolio in the majority of its markets and accounted for more than half of our total organic growth in beer volume in 2022.This growth is led by Heineken®  up 12.5% versus last year (14.5% excluding Russia) and 31.5% relative to 2019  significantly outperforming the total beer market. The growth was broad-based with more than 50 markets growing double-digits in 2022. The strong growth was led by Heineken® Original  bolstered by the remarkable performance of its line extensions. Heineken® Silver more than doubled its volume  driven by excellent performances in Vietnam and China and its global rollout  reaching 28 markets in total by the end of 2022.Heineken® volume 4Q22 Organicgrowth FY22 Organicgrowth (in mhl) Total 14.8 11.2 % 54.9 12.5 %Outlook 2023For 2023  HEINEKEN expects operating profit (beia) to grow organically mid- to high-single-digit  subject to any significant unforeseen macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. This outlook is based on continued progress on HEINEKEN's EverGreen strategy  a challenging global economic environment and lower consumer confidence in certain markets.HEINEKEN expects further progress towards building great brands  its digital route to consumer  strategic capabilities and HEINEKEN's Brew a Better World activities with commensurate investments. HEINEKEN also expects stable to modestly growing volume  increasing in developing markets and declining in Europe. HEINEKEN will continue the discipline to price responsibly as per local market conditions  aiming to cover most of the absolute impact of inflation in its cost base. HEINEKEN anticipates an increase in its input costs in the high teens per hectolitre and significantly higher energy costs  particularly in Europe. HEINEKEN will deliver on its gross savings ahead of the €2 billion target relative to the cost base of 2019  including an increased ambition of savings in Europe. Overall as a result  net revenue (beia) will grow organically ahead of operating profit (beia). Due to the phasing of marketing and selling expenses and input cost pressures  the operating profit (beia) organic growth will be skewed towards the second half.HEINEKEN also expects in 2023 an average effective interest rate (beia) of around 3.1% (2022: 2.8%); an effective tax rate (beia) of around 27% (2022: 27.7%) and a significant increase in other net finance expenses  driven by the expected impact from foreign currencies in some emerging markets. As a result  net profit (beia) is expected to grow organically in line or below the operating profit (beia).Finally  HEINEKEN expects investments in capital expenditure related to property  plant and equipment and intangible assets to amount to c.9% of net revenue (beia) (2022: c.7%)Total Dividend For 2022The Heineken N.V. dividend policy is to pay a ratio of 30% to 40% of full year net profit (beia). For 2022  a total cash dividend of €1.73 per share  representing an increase of 40% (2021: €1.24)  and a payout ratio of 35.1%  in the middle of the range of Heineken N.V.'s policy  will be proposed to the Heineken N.V. Annual General Meeting on 20 April 2023. If approved  a final dividend of €1.23 per share will be paid on 2 May 2023  as an interim dividend of €0.50 per share was paid on 11 August 2022.If Heineken N.V. shareholders approve the proposed dividend  Heineken Holding N.V. will  according to its Articles of Association  pay an identical dividend per share. A final dividend of €1.23 per share of €1.60 nominal value will be payable as of 2 May 2023.Both the Heineken Holding N.V. shares and the Heineken N.V. shares will trade ex-dividend on 24 April 2023. The dividend payment will be subject to a 15% Dutch withholding tax.Translational Calculated Currency ImpactThe translational currency impact for 2022 was positive  amounting to €1 582 million on net revenue (beia)  €258 million at operating profit (beia) and €198 million at net profit (beia).Applying spot rates as of 13 February 2023 to the 2022 financial results as a base  the calculated currency translational impact would be negative  approximately €560 million in net revenue (beia)  €80 million at operating profit (beia)  and €40 million at net profit (beia).Board of Directors CompositionMrs C.L. de Carvalho-Heineken and Mr M.R. de Carvalho will have completed their four-year appointment term upon conclusion of the Heineken Holding N.V.

Being part of the BEL ESG Index is an important recognition of Proximus' efforts and achievements in fighting climate change and actively contributing to an inclusive and trustworthy digital society.With the BEL ESG Index  Euronext identifies and tracks the BEL 20 and BEL Mid companies that demonstrate the best Environmental  Social  and Governance (ESG) practices. The index takes into account a rating of ESG risks by Sustainalytics  a leading global provider of ESG research and assessments  and was built in line with the Towards Sustainability label by the Central Labelling Agency (CLA). The composition of the index will be revised on a quarterly basis  with an evolutive rating methodology to incorporate new EU regulations and standards as they emerge.For Proximus  the inclusion in the BEL ESG Index is an important recognition for the company's strong focus on ESG  embedded in the corporate strategy. Proximus is fully engaged in the fight against climate change (both on CO₂ emissions and circularity) and actively contributes to digital accessibility  cybersecurity and diversity & inclusion. Beyond its commitments to be circular by 2030 and reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across its entire value chain by 2040  Proximus empowers other businesses and organizations to limit their own footprint through innovation and smart digital solutions. In parallel  the company aims to bring gigabit connectivity to 100% of the Belgian population as quickly as possible and with careful attention to the digital inclusion of all citizens.From a more general perspective  Proximus welcomes this new Euronext initiative as it values the increasingly prominent place of sustainability in today's business landscape. It is designed to facilitate the adoption of mainstream sustainable investment solutions  helping investors to identify companies that are leading the way to a more sustainable future by combining economic performance with ESG considerations.

The growth was led by the sharp recovery of Asia Pacific in the second half of the year  the reopening of the on-trade in Europe in the first half following the COVID-related restrictions of last year and continued growth in the Americas and Africa  Middle East & Eastern Europe regions.Beer volume 4Q22 Organicgrowth FY22 Organicgrowth (in mhl) 4Q21 FY21 Heineken N.V. 63.3 61.1 3.5 % 256.9 231.2 6.9 % Africa  Middle East & Eastern Europe 9.8 10.1 -3.3 % 39.2 38.9 1.5 % Americas 23.8 23.9 -0.5 % 88.5 85.4 3.7 % Asia Pacific 12.2 10.0 22.9 % 48.0 29.4 29.3 % Europe 17.5 17.1 1.9 % 81.2 77.5 4.6 %In the fourth quarter  net revenue (beia) grew organically by 17.4%  with double-digit growth across all regions. Total consolidated volume grew 3.0% and net revenue (beia) per hectolitre was up 14.0%. Price-mix on a constant geographic basis was up 14.5%  again driven by pricing and premiumisation. Beer volume grew 3.5%  driven by Asia Pacific and continued growth in Europe  more than offsetting lower volume in other regions.Driving premiumisation at scale  led by Heineken®Premium beer volume grew 11.4% versus last year and came 15.6% ahead of 2019  organically. Our premium brands outperformed the total portfolio in the majority of our markets and accounted for more than half of our total organic growth in beer volume in 2022.This growth is led by Heineken®  up 12.5% versus last year (14.5% excluding Russia) and 31.5% relative to 2019  significantly outperforming the total beer market. The growth was broad-based with more than 50 markets growing double-digits in 2022. The strong growth was led by Heineken® Original  bolstered by the remarkable performance of its line extensions. Heineken® Silver more than doubled its volume  driven by excellent performances in Vietnam and China and its global rollout  reaching 28 markets in total by the end of 2022.Heineken® volume 4Q22 Organicgrowth FY22 Organicgrowth (in mhl) Total 14.8 11.2 % 54.9 12.5 % Africa Middle East & Eastern Europe 1.7 -9.5 % 6.4 -2.7 % Americas 6.4 6.9 % 22.2 13.5 % Asia Pacific 2.9 51.3 % 9.5 33.4 % Europe 3.7 7.8 % 16.8 8.0 %Heineken® connects with millions of consumers every year with world-class campaigns and sponsorships to share our brand DNA in a meaningful way to spark growth  and to contribute to our sustainability goals and responsibility initiatives. In 2022  we launched the ‘Cheers to All Fans’ campaign  tackling gender bias affecting football's players and fans. 2022 was Heineken®’s first year as a leading sponsor of the UEFA Women’s EUROs  with the objective to become the most inclusive sponsor of the tournament.We continued to successfully premiumise at scale via our international brands portfolio  complementing Heineken® by connecting with an even more diverse range of consumer needs. Amstel grew volume in the mid-twenties  with more than 15 markets growing double-digits  with a particularly strong performance in Brazil and continued momentum behind Amstel Ultra. Birra Moretti grew in the mid-teens versus last year  sharing the true taste of Italy across Europe  with outstanding growth in the Netherlands  Serbia  Romania  Switzerland and Ireland. In the UK  Birra Moretti more than doubled its volume versus 2019 and became the market leader of the premium segment by value. 2022 was the year of the Tiger; our brand roared back to volume growth of more than 40%  driven by the recovery in Southeast Asia  the success of Tiger Crystal and continued growth in Nigeria and Brazil.Pioneer choice in low & no-alcoholWe believe in empowering consumers seeking to enjoy a lower or no-alcohol-content beverage by ensuring there is always a choice – everywhere and on any occasion. Meeting this consumer need  our Low & No-Alcohol (LONO) portfolio grew by low-single-digit as continued momentum in the majority of our markets was partially offset by declines in Egypt  Russia and Poland. Our non-alcoholic beer and cider portfolio grew by mid-single-digit  led by the growth of Heineken® 0.0 in the low-teens in Europe and the Americas regions.We continued to introduce consumer-inspired innovations to enhance our non-alcoholic beer and cider portfolio. For example  in the United States  Lagunitas launched Hoppy Refresher  an adult beverage proposition of hop-infused sparkling water that can compete with carbonated soft drinks. In Nigeria  we launched ZAGG  a malt-based energy drink  entering a new category in Nigeria with potential to scale beyond within the Region. In Mexico  we are currently introducing Tecate 0.0  a non-alcoholic variant to our second largest brand globally by volume  aiming to counter the stigma that beer cannot be enjoyed during mid-day meal occasions.Explore beyond beerAs we expand our view of consumer demand  we see opportunities beyond beer for flavoured  innovative  natural and moderate propositions leveraging our industrial and route to market base. We are leveraging our scale as the second largest player in this segment outside of the United States to explore further this consumer space. Our overall volume of flavoured beer and beyond beer alcoholic propositions grew by a mid-single-digit to 12.9 million hectolitres (2021: 12.3 million hectolitres).Desperados is the leading ""spirit beer"" for high energy occasions with a presence in more than 80 countries. It continued its growth momentum in 2022  doubling its volume in Nigeria  with continued growth in Europe (particularly in Germany  the UK  Spain and France) and boosted by Desperados cocktail inspired line extensions and Virgin 0.0.We expanded our global leadership position in Cider. Global volume grew by a low-single-digit to 5.0 million hectolitres (2021: 4.9 million)  mainly driven by the strong growth of Strongbow in South Africa. We launched Strongbow Ultra  a low-calorie  low-carb and natural proposition to renovate the brand and the overall cider category with strong early results. In the UK  Strongbow Ultra Dark Fruit reached c.70% of the size of the total hard seltzer category in its first year of launch.In Mexico  we launched Sol Mangoyada  further strengthening our leadership position in beyond beer. In the United States  building on the success of Dos Equis Lime and Salt around rituals that consumers follow  we launched Dos Equis Classic Lime Margarita.Our advantaged footprintWe continue to develop and expand our geographical and portfolio footprint to enhance our long-term  sustained growth advantage.Between 18 and 24 January 2023 the Competition Tribunal of South Africa held the hearings related to the transaction with Distell Group Holdings Limited and Namibia Breweries Limited  and we are awaiting their final decision. We remain very excited with the opportunity to bring together strong businesses to create a regional beverage champion  and we are committed to being a strong partner for growth and to make a positive impact in the communities in which we operate. We continue to expect the transaction to close in the coming months.We continue to make progress to transfer the ownership of our business in Russia whilst dealing with frequently changing regulations. We remain optimistic in our ability to reach an agreement in the coming months. Based on our current assessment  an impairment of €88 million is recorded for the period ended 31 December 2022. See page 14 for more details.On 19 October 2022  we acquired 28.2% of the shares of Grupa Zywiec (GZ) and  on 20 December 2022  concluded a mandatory tender bid for the remaining 6.6% of the shares. On 19 January 2023  we acquired the remaining shares of GZ through a squeeze-out process  becoming the sole owner of the company. GZ has filed an application to delist from the Warsaw Stock Exchange.BECOME THE BEST-CONNECTED BREWERHEINEKEN wants to become the best-connected  most relevant brewer for customers living in the digital age. To achieve this  we are digitally transforming our business and modernising our technology landscape at the same time.Digitise our route-to-consumerWe continue to deploy our business-to-business digital (eB2B) platforms  supported by the eBusiness team  which is driving this capability globally. By the end of 2022  the platforms captured €9.2 billion in gross merchandise value  2.5x the value of last year. We now connect more than half a million customers  over 50% more than last year. The growth was driven by Vietnam  Nigeria  Mexico  Brazil  the UK  Ireland  France  Italy and Cambodia.The digitisation of customer relationships unlocks new growth with more and better services and data insights  increasing sales and productivity. For example  with AIDDA  an artificial intelligence application  we support our sales representatives to help our customers grow  making our sales organisation more effective and efficient.We will start migrating our eB2B platforms under a single brand name and identity: eazle  business made easy. The transition will enable better features at scale resulting in improved customer experience with increased efficiency  helping them to grow their business.FUND THE GROWTH  FUEL THE PROFITOur growth algorithm aims to deliver superior  balanced growth enabled by incremental investments behind the power of our brands  digital transformation  capabilities and sustainability objectives. We are bringing balance to our growth  investing behind the power of our brands which enables us to price responsibly. To fund the growth and offset inflationary pressures  we are structurally addressing our cost base and building a cost-conscious culture. We are embedding this into an ongoing continuum of productivity improvements to fuel profit growth ahead of revenue growth over time.During 2022  we made significant progress in the delivery of our productivity programme  targeting €2 billion of structural gross savings by 2023  relative to our cost base of 2019. By the end of 2022  we captured €1.7 billion of these gross savings and are well on track to deliver ahead of our target in 2023.We are improving our performance on cost and embedding cost management in the capabilities of the organisation. Our teams are advancing thousands of initiatives across all our operating companies and the head office. We are also accelerating large-scale transformation programmes  such as the transition to a network model for our supply chain in Europe. These achievements gave us the confidence to declare our new ambition to deliver ongoing productivity gains of €400 million year on year.We continued to invest in our business and in addition  we reversed the significant cost mitigation actions undertaken in 2021 to partially offset the financial impact of COVID-related restrictions. Last year  these represented a reduction of expenses (beia) of circa €0.5 billion for the full year relative to 2019.Operating profit (beia) grew 24.0% organically driven by the volume recovery in Asia Pacific and Europe  pricing for inflation  premiumisation and the delivery of our productivity programme  partially offset by inflationary pressures in our cost base and incremental investments behind our growth agenda. Currency translation positively impacted operating profit (beia) by €258 million  or 7.6%  mainly driven by the Mexican Peso  Vietnamese Dong and Brazilian Real. Operating profit declined by 4.5% as the strong profit recovery this year was offset by lower exceptional gains  which in the previous year included the €1.3 billion remeasurement to fair value of the previously held equity interest in United Breweries (UBL) in India.Net profit (beia) grew 30.7% organically to €2 836 million (2021: €2 041 million)  ahead of the growth in operating profit (beia) due to a lower effective tax rate. Currency translation positively impacted net profit (beia) by €198 million or 9.7%  driven mainly by the Mexican Peso  Vietnamese Dong and Brazilian Real. Net profit after exceptional items and amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles was €2 682 million (2021: €3 324 million)  lower than last year due to the exceptional gains in 2021 as explained above.For more details  please refer to the Financial Review.RAISE THE BAR ON SUSTAINABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITYBrew a Better World is our 2030 strategy to drive progress towards a net zero  fairer and more balanced world. We are making good progress across all three pillars and are building executional momentum to deliver our ambitions.Environmental: Path to net zero impactOur ambition is to reach net zero carbon emissions across our value chain by 2040  with an intermediate 2030 goal to reach net zero in scope 1 and 2  reduce our emissions in scope 3 by 21%  and across our value chain (scope 1  2 and 3) by 30%. Since 2018  we have reduced our absolute carbon emissions in scope 1 and 2 by 18% (2021: 16%). We also increased the percentage of combined renewable energy to 37% (2021: 27%). We are driving progress in scope 3 by engaging our top packaging  cooling and raw material partners globally to set science-based targets and unlock low-carbon solutions. We also achieved an “A” score for Climate from the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) in 2022.We continue to focus on healthy watersheds via water efficiency  water circularity and water balancing. Our 2030 ambition is to reduce water usage to 2.6 hectolitre per hectolitre (hl/hl) in water-stressed areas and 2.9 hl/hl worldwide. In 2022  we reached 3.0 hl/hl and 3.3 hl/hl (2021: 3.1 and 3.4)  respectively. 26 of our 31 sites in water-stressed areas have begun watershed protection programmes and 29% of these sites are fully balanced. 97% of our total wastewater volume is now treated before discharge.When it comes to circularity  more than 75% of our production sites are now landfill-free  meaning 99% of our total waste volume globally was reused or recycled in 2022.Social: Path to an inclusive  fair and equitable worldWe are making progress when it comes to gender diversity. Over the last 5 years  we increased the percentage of senior management positions held by women from 19% to 27% (2021: 25%). Our ambition is to achieve 30% by 2025 and 40% by 2030 on the path to gender balance.We also aim for equal pay for equal work between female and male colleagues and want to ensure that all employees worldwide earn at least a fair wage by 2023. By the end of 2022  100% of operating companies have been assessed on equal pay and have detailed action plans to drive year-on-year progress. Regarding fair wage  100% of operating companies have been assessed and over 99% of direct employees earn at least a fair wage  as defined by the Fair Wage Network.1As part of our ambition to create a positive impact in our communities  we reached our annual target of having a social impact initiative in place in 100% of our in-scope markets. We also increased the volume of locally sourced agricultural raw materials in Africa by 26% compared to a 2020 baseline  meaning we are halfway to our goal of 50% by 2025.1 A fair wage is often higher than the minimum wage and should be sufficient for a decent standard of living  covering the basic needs for the employee and their family: from food  housing and education to healthcare  transportation and some discretionary income and savings. Data on fair wages is obtained from the Fair Wage Network.Responsible: Path to moderate and no harmful useOur ambition is to make 0.0 alcohol options available for consumers everywhere so that there is always a choice. Heineken® 0.0 is now available in close to 110 markets and  by 2023  we aim for a zero-alcohol option to be available for at least two strategic brands in the majority of our operating companies  accounting for 90% of our business by volume. By the end of 2022  we were at 46% (2021: 43%).We continue to use the power of our flagship brand to advance responsible consumption and make moderation cool. In 2022  our operating companies invested over 10% of Heineken® media spend reaching at least 1.2 billion unique consumers worldwide.In addition to this  100% of our in-scope markets had a partnership with governments and society to address alcohol-related harm.GovernanceIn 2022  we continued to raise the bar on our ways of working  governance and transparent reporting. Given the importance of sustainability and responsibility for long-term value creation:We introduced three ESG metrics in our long-term incentive plan for senior managers  representing 25% of total remuneration. This proposal was approved for the Executive Board at the 2022 AGM in April;We further integrated sustainability & responsibility into our existing planning processes  including ring-fencing the required investments;We are enhancing our reporting capabilities to meet emerging requirements such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). We also completed our first TCFD analysis and the outcomes are included in the Annual Report.UNLOCKING THE FULL POTENTIAL OF OUR PEOPLE AND ORGANISATIONCritical to the success of our multi-year EverGreen strategy is the evolution of our culture. Since the launch of EverGreen  we have been focused on this shift towards disciplined entrepreneurship with more agility  external focus  and clear accountability. Throughout the organisation  we have redesigned processes to facilitate horizontal learning and codified new behaviours that support EverGreen in our ambition to shape the future of beer and beyond.Our Employee Engagement scores rank in the top quartile of the benchmark of high performing companies and we aspire to maintain this. In 2022  we scored even higher whilst our teams were dealing with uncertainty and change  a clear sign of the strength and commitment of our people.Outlook 2023On 30 November 2022  ahead of our Capital Markets Event  we reconfirmed our guidance to our outlook statements. These expectations remain unchanged and are included here as a reminder with further details.For 2023  we expect operating profit (beia) to grow organically mid- to high-single-digit  subject to any significant unforeseen macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. This outlook is based on continued progress on EverGreen  a challenging global economic environment and lower consumer confidence in certain markets.We expect further progress towards building great brands  our digital route to consumer  strategic capabilities and our Brew a Better World activities with commensurate investments. We also expect stable to modestly growing volume  increasing in developing markets and declining in Europe. We will continue the discipline to price responsibly as per local market conditions  aiming to cover most of the absolute impact of inflation in our cost base. We anticipate an increase in our input costs in the high teens per hectolitre and significantly higher energy costs  particularly in Europe. We will deliver on our gross savings ahead of the €2 billion target relative to the cost base of 2019  including an increased ambition of savings in Europe. Overall as a result  net revenue (beia) will grow organically ahead of operating profit (beia). Due to the phasing of marketing and selling expenses and input cost pressures  the operating profit (beia) organic growth will be skewed towards the second half.We also expect in 2023 an average effective interest rate (beia) of around 3.1% (2022: 2.8%); an effective tax rate (beia) of around 27% (2022: 27.7%) and a significant increase in other net finance expenses  driven by the expected impact from foreign currencies in some emerging markets. As a result  net profit (beia) is expected to grow organically in line or below the operating profit (beia).Finally  we expect investments in capital expenditure related to property  plant and equipment and intangible assets to amount to c.9% of net revenue (beia) (2022: c.7%)Total Dividend For 2022The Heineken N.V. dividend policy is to pay a ratio of 30% to 40% of full year net profit (beia). For 2022  a total cash dividend of €1.73 per share  representing an increase of 40% (2021: €1.24)  and a payout ratio of 35.1%  in the middle of the range of our policy  will be proposed to the Annual General Meeting on 20 April 2023 (""2023 AGM""). If approved  a final dividend of €1.23 per share will be paid on 2 May 2023  as an interim dividend of €0.50 per share was paid on 11 August 2022. The payment will be subject to a 15% Dutch withholding tax. The ex-dividend date for Heineken N.V. shares will be 24 April 2023.Translational Calculated Currency ImpactThe translational currency impact for 2022 was positive  amounting to €1 582 million on net revenue (beia)  €258 million at operating profit (beia) and €198 million at net profit (beia).Applying spot rates as of 13 February 2023 to the 2022 financial results as a base  the calculated currency translational impact would be negative  approximately €560 million in net revenue (beia)  €80 million at operating profit (beia)  and €40 million at net profit (beia).Supervisory Board CompositionOn 20 December 2022  HEINEKEN announced the nomination of Mrs. Beatriz Pardo and Mr. Lodewijk Hijmans van den Bergh for appointment as members of the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) on 20 April 2023 for a four-year term.Mrs. Beatriz Pardo  a Spanish national  is Vice President General Manager of Starbucks Reserve in the United States at the Starbucks Coffee Company.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com .ContactsInvestorsIpsen:Craig MarksVice President  Investor Relations+44 7484 349 193Media Ipsen:Jess SmithHead of R&D and Global Partnering Communications+44 7557 267634IRICoR:Alix MolinierProject manager+1 514-343-6111 #0324IRIC:Noémie Desbois MackenzieManager – Communication+1 514 475 7682Ioana PiscociuSenior Manager  Global MediaRelations+33 6 69 09 12 96Attachment,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.72,0.18,0.1,True,English,"['two new discovery-stage programs', 'existing oncology partnership', 'exclusive license agreement', 'Montréal', 'Ipsen', 'de', 'IRICoR', 'Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program', 'two new oncology discovery-stage programs', 'two new discovery-stage programs', 'global, mid-sized biopharmaceutical company', 'interdisciplinary drug discovery scientists', 'two discovery-stage programs', 'pre-clinical stage program', 'new drug-discovery program', 'Christelle Huguet SVP', 'Dr. Michel Bouvier', 'long-term value creation', 'differentiated technological platforms', 'high-quality therapeutic compounds', 'drug candidate stage', 'new multi-year collaboration', 'low double-digit-tiered royalties', 'high-value oncology targets', 'subsequent license agreement', 'VP Business Development', 'exclusive license agreement', 'potential oncology applications', 'existing oncology partnership', 'de Montréal', 'fruitful research collaboration', 'two compounds', 'new compounds', 'new collaboration', 'exclusive rights', 'fruitful collaboration', 'drug candidates', 'high-value projects', 'licensed asset', 'upfront payment', 'commercial milestones', 'net sales', 'great partnerships', 'great possibilities', 'External Innovation', 'investigational treatment', 'solid tumors', 'hematological cancers', 'up to', 'fantastic partner', 'promising molecule', 'breakthrough therapies', 'current standards', 'Director General', 'natural expansion', 'Claude Larose', 'Mr. Larose', 'Rare Disease', 'total sales', 'external-innovation strategy', 'leading biotechnological', 'life-science hubs', 'U.K.', 'U.S.', 'Canadian government', 'pan-Canadian leader', 'early-stage assets', 'novel therapies', 'development activities', 'additional development', 'Early Development', 'development journey', 'key development', 'development efforts', 'strategic partnership', 'option agreement', 'recent advancement', 'transformative medicines', 'research funding', 'commercialization activities', 'Ipsen Pharma', 'IRICoR', 'PARIS', 'FRANCE', 'MONTREAL', 'CANADA', 'February', 'Euronext', 'IPN', 'ADR', 'IPSEY', 'result', 'May', 'terms', 'Head', 'REED', 'number', 'team', 'Institute', 'Immunology', 'identification', 'synthesis', 'payments', 'mid-single', 'product', 'Story', 'expertise', 'patients', 'care', 'signing', 'initiation', 'leadership', 'order', 'opportunities', 'ENDS', 'Neuroscience', 'FY', '100 countries', 'innovative', 'heart', 'Oxford', 'Cambridge', 'Shanghai', 'China', '5,000 colleagues', 'information', 'Centre', 'Excellence', 'CECR', 'risking', 'field', 'mandate']",2023-02-15,2023-02-15,finance.yahoo.com

XpertEye reduces their need to travel  which is a key factor for limiting their carbon footprint  while promoting active collaboration  skill sharing and productivity gains  in addition to facilitating decision-making​ for its users.To assess the CO 2 emissions avoided  AMA based its approach on the ADEME QuantiGES and Carbone 4 Net Zero Initiative methods to determine the net emissions  i.e. taking into account the emissions resulting from the use of XpertEye solutions.The trips avoided by using XpertEye solutions  calculated with support from a certified carbon coach (SAMI)  were estimated based on the following assumptions:Each XpertEye call makes it possible to avoid one trip.For international calls  the distance between two different countries (e.g. France-Germany) was estimated using the latitudes/longitudes of their capital cities.For national calls  the distance was assessed based on assumptions for average travel distances within a country.The means of transport considered are the plane for trips over 500km or a mix of train and car (90%/10%) for trips under 500km.This award highlights AMA’s ability to support its clients in their commitment to a sustainable future and helps provide them with key performance indicators to show their progress in this major climate-related area.Next financial press release2022 full-year results: April 28  2023 (before start of trading)Story continuesDisclaimer: This press release contains certain non-factual elements  including but not restricted to certain statements concerning its future results and other future events.

In 2005  the company installed  in the same site  a production unit for rolling shutter casing designed by its R&D department  under the name Coferm'Prod.In 2021  the company posted turnover of €7.7 million. It will be consolidated in the Group's accounts as of 15 February 2023 within the Industrial Joinery division.The synergies to be implemented with ATLANTEM will allow to broaden its rolling shutter offer and to expand the Group's customer portfolio. HERIGE is thus pursuing its strategy of profitable growth while reducing the impact of its activities on the environment.Commenting on this operation  Benoît Hennaut  Chairman of the Executive Board of HERIGE Group  said :“ The acquisition of Coferm'Ing and Coferm'Prod assets is fully in line with our development ambitions in the home joinery market  supported by the RE 2020 and the acceleration of renovation work to increase energy performance in buildings. With wooden made products contributing to complete our rolling shutter offer for improved housing insulation  this operation is generating important industrial and commercial synergies with our production site in Languidic and is strengthening our prescription approach on the collective housing market.”All our financial communications are available on our website: www.groupe-herige.fr/enAbout HERIGEHERIGE Group focuses on three sectors of the building industry: Building Materials Trading  the Concrete Industry and Industrial Joinery.

LTD (“CTTQ”)  a subsidiary of Sino Biopharm  in connection with the previously announced licensing and collaboration agreement dated September 21  2022.Cash and cash equivalents at year end also included the €25.0 million tranche of the previously announced unsecured loan agreement executed with the European Investment Bank (“EIB”) on May 16  2022  which the Company received on December 8  2022  the €9.3 million gross proceeds (€8.8 million net proceeds) raised through the Company’s At-The-Market (“ATM”) Program on June 15  2022  and the proceeds of three previously announced loan agreements with a syndicate of French banks for a total amount of €5.3 million. One of the loans was contracted as part of a French state-guaranteed loan facility with Bpifrance  and the two other loans were obtained as part of a French state stimulus economic plan granted by Crédit Agricole Champagne-Bourgogne and Société Générale.Research and development (“R&D”) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased generally in line with the increase recorded during the first three quarters of 2022  and amounted to €60.5 million for the full year 2022  compared to €48.5 million in 2021. This increase was driven mostly by the costs associated with the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in NASH  including a full twelve months of operation for the U.S. affiliate and  to a lesser extent  with the LEGEND Phase IIa combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin in patients with NASH and type 2 diabetes (“T2D”).Net cash used in operating activities amounted to (€44.9) million for the full year 2022  compared to (€47.7) million in 2021. Net cash used in operating expenses in 2022 was driven primarily by R&D expenses  partially offset by the upfront payment received from CTTQ.Net cash generated from (used in) investing activities amounted to €8.9 million for the full year 2022 compared to (€1.8) million net cash used for the same period in 2021. The variance is mainly due to the change in short term deposits between both periods.Net cash generated from financing activities amounted to €37.3 million for the full year 2022 compared to €25.4 million for 2021. Net cash generated from financing activities in 2022 has been driven by the proceeds of the first tranche of €25 million from the EIB loan  proceeds of €9.3 million from the sale of securities through the Company’s ATM program and proceeds of €5.3 million from three French state partially guaranteed loans  as described above.For the full year 2022  the Company recorded a negative exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents of (€1.0) million versus a positive effect of €4.8 million for 2021  due to the strengthening of USD versus Euro.Considering its current R&D and clinical development programs  the Company estimates that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits should allow the Company to fund its operations through the fourth quarter of 20232. This cash runway estimate does not include the conditional second tranche of €25.0 million of the EIB loan agreement3.RevenuesThe Company’s revenues for the full year 2022 amounted to €12.2 million  as compared to €4.2 million for 2021. The revenues recorded in 2022 were driven mostly by the Company’s development agreement with CTTQ  executed on September 21  2022  and revenues recorded in 2021 primarily consisted of a €4.0 million milestone payment for a milestone that was recorded following the launch by AbbVie of the Phase IIb clinical trial with cedirogant. As previously disclosed  this trial of cedirogant has since been discontinued by AbbVie and the partnership with AbbVie has been terminated.Next key milestones expectedPublication of the topline results of the investigator-initiated study with lanifibranor in patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (“NAFLD”) and T2D – planned for the first quarter of 2023Publication of the topline results of the LEGEND Phase IIa combination trial of lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin in patients with NASH and T2D – planned for the second half of 2023Last Patient First Visit of the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in NASH – targeted for the second half of 2023Upcoming investor conference participationCowen 43 rd Annual Health Care Conference – March 6-8 – Boston  MAAnnual Health Care Conference – March 6-8 – Boston  MA Guggenheim Health Altitudes Summit 2023 – March 13-16 – Telluride  ColoradoEvercore ISI NASH Renaissance – March 30 – VirtualKempen Life Sciences Conference – April 25-26 – AmsterdamUpcoming scientific conference participationGlobal NASH – March 2-3 – LondonAEEH – March 15-17 _ MadridLiver Connect conference – March 23-26 – Huntington Beach   CAAASLD Emerging topic: NASH Cirrhosis from mechanisms to management – March 25-26- Los Angeles  CANext financial results publicationFull-Year 2022 financial results: Wednesday  March 29  2023 (after U.S. market close)About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH  mucopolysaccharidoses (“MPS”) and other diseases with significant unmet medical need.

(“CoolCo” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)  with the intention of directly listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). Subject to the registration statement being declared effective by the SEC  the Company’s shares will be registered with the SEC and listed for trading on the NYSE in addition to the Euronext Growth Oslo under the ticker “CLCO” from March 15  2023. No new CoolCo securities will be issued in connection with the share listing on the NYSE.In connection with a listing on the NYSE  CoolCo also expects to change its ticker code on Euronext Growth Oslo from “COOL” to “CLCO”. Further details on the change of ticker code will be provided in due course.In order to facilitate transfer of shares between the two trading venues  CoolCo intends to amend the registration structure for its shares whereby all shares will be primarily held and settled within the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) in the United States and secondarily held and settled in Euronext Securities Oslo (the “VPS”) through a Central Securities Depository (“CSD”) link (the “Reregistration Process”). Following the Reregistration Process  the Company’s shares will be able to be moved between the DTC and VPS to enable trading between the respective trading venues. A trading suspension in the CoolCo shares will be required for a period of time in connection with the Reregistration Process  expected to be two trading days  and the Company will make a request to Oslo Børs to approve such suspension. No action will be required by an investor holding shares in the VPS in connection with the reregistration and investors’ registered holdings in the VPS will continue. See below for further details on the Reregistration Process.CoolCo CEO Richard Tyrrell commented:“By listing on the NYSE  we are expanding our investor base and providing US investors with access to CoolCo’s unique combination of attractive dividends and exposure to the fast-growing global demand for LNG transportation. Upon listing  CoolCo will be one of the largest of a limited number of U.S. publicly traded companies that are connecting global markets with LNG  which is crucial to energy security and has an important role in the global transition to a lower-carbon future. Our new presence in the U.S. market will generate immediate value for all CoolCo shareholders by providing easier access to CoolCo shares and additional trading liquidity. Additionally  the dual listing further strengthens CoolCo’s financial flexibility  supplementing our strong balance sheet  significant internal cash generation  and proven access to competitively priced debt in ensuring that we are well positioned to seize attractive growth opportunities in a prudent manner that maximizes shareholder value.”Details on the contemplated Reregistration Process and associated temporary Trading Suspension in CoolCo’s sharesNo action is required by an investor holding shares in the VPS in connection with the Reregistration Process  and investors’ holdings in the VPS will continue. The Company’s shares will continue to trade under the same ISIN as today (BMG2415A1137).The dates set out in the following paragraphs are preliminary only and subject to change depending on the date that the Company’s registration statement is declared effective by the SEC and the NYSE commences trading of CoolCo shares. Hence these dates should be treated as indicative only. Further confirmation of the exact timing of the contemplated Reregistration Process and Trading Suspension will be provided in due course.The Reregistration Process is expected to be completed during the period March 13  2023  to March 14  2023. Due to technical settlement requirements in the VPS  a trading suspension in the CoolCo shares will be required from and including March 13  2023  to and including March 14  2023 (the “Trading Suspension”). The Company will make a request to Oslo Børs to approve the Trading Suspension prior to implementation of the Reregistration Process. During the Trading Suspension  the Company’s shares will be temporarily suspended from trading on Euronext Growth Oslo. From the perspective of an investor holding the Company’s shares in the VPS  the last settlement cycle for shares traded prior to the Trading Suspension will take place on March 14  2023. Investors trading in the Company’s shares prior to start of the Trading Suspension should not agree to settlement periods that would imply settlement after March 14  2023. Any such trades with settlement after March 14  2023  are expected to be cancelled.Following completion of the Reregistration Process  the Trading Suspension will end  and the Company’s shares will resume trading as normal  which is expected to occur from and including the start of trading on March 15  2023.Following completion of the Reregistration Process  the Company’s shares will be registered in the Company’s Register of Members in Bermuda in the name of DTC’s nominee  Cede & Co. and DTC will act as the primary securities depository for the shares. All shares in the Company will be primarily recorded in the DTC and secondarily recorded in the VPS through a CSD link. DNB Bank ASA  Registrars’ Department (the “VPS Registrar”) will continue to administrate the Company’s VPS register.To facilitate the secondary registration of the shares in the VPS  the Company will enter into a deposit and registrar agreement (the ""Registrar Agreement"") with the VPS Registrar. A custodian of the VPS Registrar will be registered as the holder of the primarily registered securities in the DTC pursuant to which the VPS registered shares are derived from.Following the Reregistration Process  the book entry interests recorded in the VPS and listed on Euronext Growth Oslo will still be regarded as the Company’s shares pursuant to the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (“CSDR”). The shares in the VPS will not carry any direct voting rights in the Company  but shareholders in the VPS may instruct the VPS Registrar to vote for their shares. The Company will furnish voting materials to the VPS Registrar and the VPS Registrar will notify the owners of the shares of upcoming votes and arrange to deliver the Company's voting materials to the owners of the shares. The VPS Registrar's notice will describe the information in the voting materials and explain how owners of the shares may instruct the VPS Registrar (who would then instruct the holder of such shares registered in the Register of Members) to vote the underlying shares. The VPS Registrar will only vote or attempt to vote on the instruction of the owners of shares and will not itself exercise any voting rights.ABOUT COOLCOCoolCo is a growth-oriented owner  operator and manager of fuel-efficient liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) carriers.

After the setback of our Phase 3 trial in pancreatic cancer  we have been looking to leverage our established company structure and capabilities by adding a clinical stage asset in an area of high unmet need. AMR is a major health challenge and phage therapy is a promising approach to target pathogenic bacteria such as S. aureus  E. coli  and P. aeruginosa which in aggregate are responsible for over 800 000 resistant infections annually in the US and Europe. The team at PHERECYDES has made tremendous strides with its programs to date  and we at ERYTECH believe that our capabilities  expertise and assets could significantly complement and add to these efforts and accelerate the path to value creation. We and our board of directors believe the combination of ERYTECH and PHERECYDES would form a company well positioned to be a global leader in phage therapies and provide a much-needed solution to address the increasingly alarming health context caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. We will also explore the opportunity to combine both companies' know-how and capabilities to broaden to other therapeutic areas of high unmet need. We are excited to begin this new path.” said Gil Beyen  Chief Executive Officer of ERYTECH.“Our board of directors fully supports this transaction and is convinced that ERYTECH and PHERECYDES will gather critical expertise and capabilities enabling to boost our research programs  as well as a seasoned and very complementary management team  and an international position providing access to US investors and stakeholders.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

XpertEye reduces their need to travel  which is a key factor for limiting their carbon footprint  while promoting active collaboration  skill sharing and productivity gains  in addition to facilitating decision-making​ for its users.To assess the CO 2 emissions avoided  AMA based its approach on the ADEME QuantiGES and Carbone 4 Net Zero Initiative methods to determine the net emissions  i.e. taking into account the emissions resulting from the use of XpertEye solutions.The trips avoided by using XpertEye solutions  calculated with support from a certified carbon coach (SAMI)  were estimated based on the following assumptions:Each XpertEye call makes it possible to avoid one trip.For international calls  the distance between two different countries (e.g. France-Germany) was estimated using the latitudes/longitudes of their capital cities.For national calls  the distance was assessed based on assumptions for average travel distances within a country.The means of transport considered are the plane for trips over 500km or a mix of train and car (90%/10%) for trips under 500km.This award highlights AMA’s ability to support its clients in their commitment to a sustainable future and helps provide them with key performance indicators to show their progress in this major climate-related area.Next financial press release2022 full-year results: April 28  2023 (before start of trading)Disclaimer: This press release contains certain non-factual elements  including but not restricted to certain statements concerning its future results and other future events.

The survey found that two-thirds (66%) of patients have questions after a provider encounter and one in five patients (19%) has new questions following the appointment. The research found that patients are eager to receive educational materials from their providers  but when left without those resources  patients turn to unvetted sources of information including website articles  peer recommendations  and social media.Patients demand trusted  reliable health informationWhile more than half of respondents (63%) reported that they routinely receive provider-offered educational materials to help answer their questions  almost a third of patients (32%) are not offered any. However  94% of respondents stated they would likely access these materials if they were provided.“Evidence shows that treatment adherence and outcomes are improved when patients are active participants in their own care  but ready access to evidence-based patient education content between visits is a critical gap in healthcare today ” said Jason Burum  Vice President and General Manager  Healthcare Provider Segment for Clinical Effectiveness at Wolters Kluwer. “We have a long history of delivering trusted clinical content like UpToDate® and Emmi. And now with resources like UpToDate and Emmi  it is more accessible than ever  to empower hospitals  health plans  and other members of the healthcare ecosystem to provide the credible  reliable educational resources to help patients take a role in managing their health.”One in ten patients reported their health encounters have been mostly or entirely virtual over the past two years. More patients  especially Millennials and Gen Z  now use digital healthcare like telehealth. Ongoing engagement with providers and the sharing of vigorously vetted patient education content is crucial to ensure all patients can access the best possible care  including outside of traditional face-to-face visits.Providers benefit from consistent engagement with patientsWhen supporting content is shared with them  patients have a better experience and are more satisfied with their care. 68% said they are more likely to return to a provider that offers educational materials in the future.Moreover  almost half of patients believe that access to educational materials would reduce the number of follow-up questions they have – indicating significant time savings for providers and minimizing the need for patients to turn to unreliable information from other sources. As some healthcare systems turn to charging patients for patient portal messages to manage physician workload  a reduction in question volume could represent a better experience for both providers and patients.The survey  conducted by CITE Research and commissioned by Wolters Kluwer Health  included 1 034 U.S. adults  18 and older  and is weighed by age  gender  ethnicity  household income  and education to be representative of the total U.S. population according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The survey was conducted online in November 2022.Wolters Kluwer offers multiple solutions that help providers  health plans  and digital health technology firms easily embed evidence-based health education content within the patient experience.Emmi  the market leading Patient Engagement solution recently ranked #1 by KLAS delivers trusted patient education videos and leaflets right in the workflow.

Our order book expanded from 325 buses at the end of 2021 to 1 474 at the end of 2022 predominantly as the result of Ebusco winning the large Deutsche Bahn tender and the commercial success of the innovative Ebusco 3.0. We also continued to invest in our workforce which has nearly doubled to support the strong demand.Having said this  not everything is in our control and a resurgence of COVID-19 in China in December has resulted in a delay of shipment of 21 buses which will now contribute to the 2023 revenue.Based on the well filled order book and the investments we have made over the past years we look forward to 2023 with confidence.""Record year for order intake and organizational developmentThe year-end order book is reflected in the table below:Type Fixed contracts Call off Options Total Ebusco 2.2 190 251 645 1 086 Ebusco 3.0 375 - 13 388 Total 565 251 658 1 474Included in the 375 contracted orders for the Ebsuco 3.0 are 184 orders for the Ebusco 3.0 18-meter which was revealed in December 2022.During 2022 we have taken important steps to move the Ebusco 3.0 from prototype production to serial production as we invested in our tooling  equipment and workforce. Despite the tough labour markets  the attractive profile of Ebusco enabled us to grow from 309 FTE (including 90 contractors) to 607 FTE (including 189 contractors) at the end of 2022.During the year we have also invested considerable time and resources in the improvement and optimisation of our supply chain. The supply chain has to a large extent recovered and parts availability and lead times improving. However  on a small number of parts the supply chain has not fully returned to the pre COVID-19 state. This continued to impact our operations and let to longer production times  higher costs and inefficiencies.Full year 2022 revenue contribution updateThe resurgence of COVID-19 in China during December in combination with supply chain constraints resulted in longer than expected assembly times. Due to these circumstances  orders for in total 21 Ebusco 2.2 18-meter did not contribute to the 2022 revenue as initially budgeted and has shifted to the beginning of 2023. As a result  Ebusco ended the year with 261 buses contributing to revenue versus an earlier guidance of 285.The supply chain constraints also resulted in higher than expected transport costs compared to previous expectations as a number of parts had to be transported by air instead of by sea.First buses successfully delivered to Berlin in early 2023Availability of some customer-specific IT systems as well as heating and cooling systems has pushed the delivery schedule and revenue recognition of 90 Ebusco 2.2 buses from December 2022 into 2023.The availability of these parts has since improved and the first batch of 17 buses has been delivered and accepted by BVG in January 2023. The remaining buses are expected to be delivered to the client in the coming months.Feedback from BVG regarding the operational performance of the Ebusco 2.2 in relation to drivability  reliability and range has been very positive. The buses that have entered the operations of BVG have been in operation for 18 hours per day. Despite the winter conditions in Berlin  the battery capacity left at the end of their shift would enable the buses to stay operational for an additional 12 hours.Full year resultsEbusco's full year results will be issued on 29 March.[1] All figures in this document are unaudited.",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.36,0.16,0.47,True,English,"['record order book', 'Ebusco N', 'Full year 2022 revenue contribution update', 'large Deutsche Bahn tender', 'tough labour market', 'COVID-19 related slowdown', 'Type Fixed contracts', 'pre COVID-19 state', 'full year results', 'customer-specific IT systems', 'year-end order book', 'supply chain constraints', 'longer production times', 'record order book', 'trading update', 'First Ebusco 2.2 buses', 'large extent', 'Record year', 'order intake', 'charging systems', 'prototype production', 'serial production', 'lead times', 'assembly times', 'cooling systems', 'first batch', 'Peter Bijvelds', 'prior years', 'commercial success', 'strong demand', 'past years', 'important steps', 'attractive profile', 'considerable time', 'higher costs', 'earlier guidance', 'transport costs', 'previous expectations', 'delivery schedule', 'coming months', 'operational performance', 'winter conditions', 'battery capacity', 'revenue recognition', 'First buses', 'organizational development', 'additional 12 hours', 'electric buses', 'remaining buses', 'innovative Ebusco', 'Ebusco 3.0 18-meter', '21 Ebusco 2.2 18-meter', 'year end', 'small number', 'Total Ebusco', '90 Ebusco 2.2 buses', 'parts availability', '2023 revenue', '18 hours', '1,474 buses', '325 buses', '21 buses', '261 buses', '17 buses', 'Deurne', '14 February', 'Euronext', 'pioneer', 'frontrunner', 'release', '29th', 'March', 'FTE', 'Berlin', 'founder', 'CEO', 'recovery', 'expansion', 'workforce', 'everything', 'control', 'resurgence', 'China', 'December', 'delay', 'shipment', 'investments', 'confidence', 'table', 'Options', 'orders', 'Ebsuco', 'tooling', 'equipment', '90 contractors', '189 contractors', 'resources', 'improvement', 'operations', 'inefficiencies', 'combination', 'circumstances', 'beginning', 'air', 'sea', 'early', 'heating', 'BVG', 'January', 'client', 'Feedback', 'relation', 'drivability', 'reliability', 'range', 'day', 'shift', 'figures', 'document', '375']",2023-02-14,2023-02-15,marketscreener.com

The Company believes that PXT3003 in CMT1A is its best near-term opportunity for value creation  with results from the pivotal Phase III clinical trial  the PREMIER trial  expected in Q4 2023.In this context  the Company's Board of Directors has decided to stop the development of its drug candidate PXT864 in Alzheimer's disease. Although PXT864 has generated interesting and encouraging preclinical and clinical results  these remain insufficient for commercialization in the short or medium term. Further development of PXT864 in Alzheimer's disease would require the implementation of a considerable additional clinical development plan that the Company does not wish to finance at this time.Nonetheless  data from clinical studies conducted with PXT864 are encouraging and the medical needs of Alzheimer's disease remain significant. PXT864 has generated promising in vitro and in vivo preclinical results[1] (available here)  and has conducted Phase I and IIa clinical studies in healthy volunteers and in patients with Alzheimer's disease[2] (CTAD conference poster available here). Further development of PXT864 would therefore be justified  and Pharnext will continue to seek an industrial partner with the resources to pursue the development of PXT864 in Alzheimer's disease. Some companies have already expressed interest in licensing PXT864 from Pharnext and pursuing its development. Other companies interested in licensing the product may contact Pharnext directly ( contact@pharnext.com ).Meanwhile  Pharnext reminds that PXT864 has also been tested for the treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (""ALS"" also known as Charcot's disease or Lou-Gehrig's disease)  an indication for which the medical needs are also consequential. Very encouraging in vitro and in vivo preclinical results have been obtained in this indication[3] (available here). Pharnext is currently considering the best strategy to pursue the development of PXT864 in ALS (preclinical and clinical): in-licensing to an industrial partner or resuming a more advanced development program internally  after the potential success of the pivotal Phase III of PXT3003 in CMT1A.Hugo Brugière  Chairman and CEO of Pharnext  said: ""As I stated when joining Pharnext  I set myself three priorities: to ensure the Company's ability to complete clinical trials with PXT3003  to reduce the financing needs as much as possible in order to limit the use of financing lines and to enhance the value of assets. Today's decision is perfectly in line with these three objectives. However  the results obtained with PXT864 in Alzheimer's disease are far from anecdotal  making it essential to find the right partner  capable of giving this product every chance of success. This is what Pharnext teams are now working on”.About PXT864PXT864 is a novel fixed-dose synergistic combination of baclofen and acamprosate formulated as a pill given twice a day. PXT864's assumed main mechanism of action in neurodegenerative diseases is the restoration of balance between excitatory (glutamate activity) and inhibitory (GABA activity) pathways.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently without satisfactory therapeutic solutions. Pharnext has a first-in-class drug candidate  PXT3003  in development for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A)  a rare  disabilitating  inherited peripheral neuropathy. PXT3003 benefits from orphan drug status in Europe and the United States. In 2018  PXT3003 completed a Phase III clinical trial  the PLEO-CMT trial  with encouraging topline results. This trial was followed by an open-label extension study  the PLEO-CMT-FU trial  with 120 patients continuing treatment with PXT3003. Long-term data suggest a sustained benefit  safety  and efficacy  after 5 years of total trial time. An international pivotal Phase III study of PXT3003  the PREMIER trial  is currently ongoing with 387 CMT1A patients enrolled. PREMIER topline results are expected in Q4 2023. PXT3003 originated from the Pleotherapy™ R&D approach. Pharnext draws the attention of investors to the financial and other risk factors detailed in its financial reports.
