In order to encourage a common interest for the participants and the shareholders of long-term good return and the company's ability to recruit and retain key employees  the Board of Directors considers that the company shall have cash-based incentive programs. Such programs should be approved annually and have performance conditions related to (i) the relative value development of Essity's class B share  and (ii) reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The Board of Directors also considers that there should be a requirement for the participants' own investment in Essity shares and that such shares should be held for a period of at least three years. It is noted that the Program is exclusively cash-based and does not result in any dilution or other impact on the rights of the shares.Essity has for a number of years resolved on similar cash-based programs  which are described in the company's Annual and Sustainability Report and in the remuneration report approved by the Annual General Meeting 2022. The Board of Directors' assessment is that these programs have worked very well.Against this background  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2023 resolves on a cash-based incentive program  as further described below.Principal terms and conditions of the ProgramThe proposed Program for 2023–2025 shall be based on the following principal terms and conditions.a. The Program is proposed to be open to senior management as well as certain other executives and key employees in the Essity group  a total of approximately 380 persons (the ""Participants"").b. The Participants shall have the opportunity  depending on satisfaction of certain performance conditions in accordance with paragraph (c) below  to obtain a cash remuneration (the ""Cash Remuneration"") after the end of a measurement period which covers the years 2023–2025 (the ""Measurement Period""). The Cash Remuneration for each Participant may not exceed a certain percentage of the Participant's fixed annual salary (gross) for 2025  as follows: (i) for the President  a maximum of 50 per cent  (ii) for other members of the senior management  a maximum of 80 per cent and (iii) for other Participants  a maximum of 50 per cent. The maximum variable remuneration level shall be determined per individual  taking into account the total remuneration in relation to the specific role  the local market  the terms of employment or the individual performance.c. Payment of the Cash Remuneration shall depend on the degree on satisfaction of the following performance conditions for the Program under the Measurement Period:i. A financial target consisting of the total shareholder return (""TSR"") on the company's class B share under the Measurement Period in relation to a benchmark group of other companies (the ""TSR Condition"").[1] The benchmark group shall to 60 per cent consist of companies which are comparable with the operations in the company's business area Consumer Goods and to 20 per cent each consist of companies that are comparable with the operations in the business area Health & Medical and Professional Hygiene  respectively.[2]A condition for payment is that the TSR of Essity's class B share is not lower than the weighted TSR outcome for the benchmark group under the Measurement Period (the ""TSR Minimum Level""). If the TSR Minimum Level is not reached  no payment of Cash Remuneration related to the TSR Condition will be made. For maximum payment (100 per cent)  it is required that the TSR of Essity's class B share exceeds the weighted TSR outcome for the Benchmark Group with at least 5 percentage points during the Measurement Period (the ""TSR Maximum Level""). Should the TSR of Essity's class B share be between the TSR Minimum Level and the TSR Maximum Level during the Measurement Period  a linear payment will be made.ii. A sustainability target related to the company's reduction of greenhouse gas emissions during the Measurement Period (the ""Sustainability Condition"").[3]A condition for payment of Cash Remuneration related to Sustainability Condition is that the company reduces greenhouse gas emissions during the Measurement Period by at least 7.5 per cent compared to the base year 2016 (the ""Sustainability Target""). If the Sustainability Target is reached  full payment of Cash Remuneration relating to the Sustainability Condition will be made. If the Sustainability Target is not reached  no payment relating to this target will be made.iii. The TSR Condition will be weighted 80 per cent and the Sustainability Condition 20 per cent  when payment of the Cash Remuneration is decided.d. Cash Remuneration will normally be paid only after the expiration of the Measurement Period and shall in general not qualify for the basis for pension computation.e. Participants shall normally be invited to the Program during the first year of the Program. A prerequisite for a Participant to be able to receive full Cash Remuneration  is that the Participant has been permanently employed withing the Essity group throughout the Measurement Period. If a Participant has commenced its employment within the Essity group during the Measurement Period  the payment of Cash Remuneration shall be made pro rata.f. Each Participant shall undertake  for as long as the Participant is employed within the Essity group  to acquire Essity shares for (i) the total paid net amount of the Cash Remuneration regarding senior management  and (ii) at least half the total paid net amount regarding other Participants  no later than 30 June 2026 (or as soon as possible thereafter if the Participant has been prevented from acquiring Essity shares at such time due to applicable insider rules)  and to retain such shares for a period of at least three years after the acquisition  with certain exemptions approved by the Board of Directors. If a Participant does not acquire or retain Essity shares in accordance with the above  the Participant's right to payment under future incentive programs to which the Participant has been invited to participate  shall lapse.g. If extraordinary changes in the Essity group or in the market occur which  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  would result in a situation where the conditions for Cash Remuneration under the Program become unreasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Program  including  among other things  be entitled to resolve on a reduced right to Cash Remuneration  or that no Cash Remuneration shall be paid at all.h. The Board of Directors shall be authorized to establish the detailed terms and conditions for the Program. The Board of Directors may  in that regard  make necessary adjustments of these general terms and conditions due to changed circumstances or to satisfy certain regulations or market conditions outside Sweden.i. Participation in the Program presupposes that such participation is legally possible in the various jurisdictions concerned.Measurement Period and vesting periodThe Measurement Period for the performance conditions under the proposed Program will cover the financial years 2023–2025. The intention of the Board of Directors is that also future programs shall have a measurement period of three years. In order to receive full Cash Remuneration  employment within the Essity group throughout the vesting period is required. Further  the vesting period  which is three years  shall be combined with a requirement that the Participant must undertake to acquire and hold Essity shares for at least a three-year period after the acquisition  in accordance with above. Required long-term nature of the Program is achieved by the above stated requirements which totals six years.Costs for the Program  dilution  etc.The cost for the Program  including social security charges  including approximately 380 employees  amounts to a maximum of SEK 260 million assuming 100 per cent satisfaction of all of the performance conditions for all Participants in the Program. The cost of the Program amounts to a maximum of 1.7 per cent of Essity's total cost for salaries and remuneration  including social security charges.The Program is cash-based and does not entail any dilution for the company's shareholders. No hedging arrangements are intended to be made with regard to the Program's financial exposure.Preparations of the proposalThe proposed Program has been prepared by Essity's Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee has presented documentation to the Board of Directors  whereafter the Board of Directors has resolved that the Program shall be referred to the Annual General Meeting 2023 for approval.Majority requirementsThe Annual General Meeting's resolution on approval of the Program requires a simple majority of the votes cast.Previous incentive programs in EssityThe company's other incentive programs are described more in detail in Essity's report on remuneration for 2022  which is included in the company's Annual and Sustainability Report 2022 and available on the company's website  www.essity.com.Proposal for resolution under Item 16The Board of Directors makes the assessment that it would be advantageous for the company to be able to adapt the capital structure and to be able to acquire own shares to be used as payment or financing on account of company acquisitions and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value. Hence  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition and transfer of own class B shares mainly as follows.a. Acquisition of own sharesAcquisition of class B shares shall be made on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the at each time prevailing price interval for the share on the marketplace  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price. Payment for the shares shall be made in cash. The authorisation may be utilised on one or several occasions until the Annual General Meeting 2024. A maximum of so many class B shares may be acquired that Essity's holding at each time amount to a maximum of 10 per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in Essity.The Board of Directors has issued a statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act.b. Transfer of own shares on account of company acquisitionsTransfer of class B shares may be made on Nasdaq Stockholm  as well as outside of Nasdaq Stockholm  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and with or without provisions regarding contribution in kind or set-off rights. The shares may be used as payment upon acquisition of companies or businesses or as to finance acquisition of companies or businesses. Transfer may be made of the maximum number of shares held by Essity at the time of the Board of Directors' resolution. The authorisation may be utilized on one or several occasions until the Annual General Meeting 2024. Transfer upon acquisition of companies or businesses may be made at a minimum price per share corresponding to an amount in close connection with the price of the company's class B shares on Nasdaq Stockholm at the time of the decision of transfer. Transfers made on Nasdaq Stockholm to finance acquisition of companies or businesses may be made at a price within the each time prevailing price interval of the share.The purpose of the authorisation to acquire shares in the company is to be able to adapt the company's capital structure and to be able to use repurchased shares in connection with the potential company acquisitions and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value. The purpose of the authorisation to transfer own shares is to give the Board of Directors increased flexibility when financing company acquisitions. The reason for deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to create alternative forms of payment upon acquisition of companies or businesses.Majority requirementsThe Meeting's resolution under Item 16 requires that shareholders representing at least two-thirds of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the Meeting approve the resolution.The Nomination CommitteeThe Nomination Committee for the Annual General Meeting 2023 is composed of Helena Stjernholm  AB Industrivärden  the Chairman of the Nomination Committee  Anders Oscarsson  AMF and AMF Fonder  Ola Peter Krohn Gjessing  Norges Bank Investment Management  Marianne Nilsson  Swedbank Robur Fonder and Pär Boman  Chairman of the Board of Essity.Shares and votesThe total number of shares in the company amounts to 702 342 489 shares  of which 61 158 914 are class A shares and 641 183 575 are class B shares  representing a total of 1 252 772 715 votes.

The volume weighted average price of the share during the fourth quarter 2022 is compared with the volume weighted average price of the share during the fourth quarter 2025  including dividend and other return.[2] When implementing the Program  the benchmark group comprises of the following companies. For Consumer Goods: Procter & Gamble  Kimberly-Clark  Unicharm and Ontex. For Health & Medical: Smith & Nephew  Convatec and Hartman. For Professional Hygiene: Kimberly-Clark  Ecolab and Diversey. Each company has the same significance within the respective business area.

Ernst & Young Oy has announced that Mikko Järventausta  APA  would continue as the principally responsible auditor. Change of the Company's business name (agenda item 16) The Board of Directors proposes that Article 1 of the Articles of Association be amended to change the business name of the Company to ""Metso"". In its amended form  said provision of the Articles of Association would read as follows: ""1 § Business name and domicileAnnual General Meeting 2023 The business name of the Company is Metso Oyj in Finnish and Metso Corporation in English. The domicile of the Company is Helsinki."" Amendment of Article 10 of the Articles of Association (agenda item 17) The Board of Directors proposes that Article 10 of the Articles of Association be amended to enable holding a general meeting entirely without a meeting venue as a so-called remote meeting in addition to the Company's domicile (Helsinki)  Espoo or Vantaa.

The last day for advance notice may be assigned to be no earlier than ten days before the meeting and it may not be assigned to be on a Sunday  Saturday  Midsummer's Eve  Christmas Eve  New Year's Eve or any other public holiday. The General Meeting may be held in the domicile of the Company  Espoo or Vantaa. In addition  the Board of Directors may resolve on organizing the General Meeting without a meeting venue whereby the shareholders have the right to exercise their power of decision in full in real time during the meeting using telecommunication connection and technical means."" The proposal regarding the meeting venue is based on the changes to Chapter 5 of the Finnish Companies Act  including the possibility to arrange general meetings remotely. The legislative changes are based on the premise that  irrespective of the chosen general meeting format  shareholders' rights must not be compromised and that all participating shareholders can exercise their shareholder rights in full in real time  including the right to present questions and vote. The possibility to organize general meetings remotely enables the Company to prepare for rapid changes in the Company's operating environment and society in general  which may be caused  for example  by pandemics. It is important that the Company has the necessary means to offer its shareholders the possibility to exercise their shareholder rights and resolve on any matters that are presented in a general meeting under any circumstances. In addition  the possibility to organize a general meeting remotely would enable the use of a more sustainable meeting form with a smaller carbon footprint. Authorizing the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of the Company's own shares (agenda item 18) The Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of an aggregate maximum of 82 000 000 of the Company's own shares. The proposed amount of shares corresponds to approximately 9.9 percent of all the current shares of the Company. However  the Company together with its subsidiaries cannot at any moment own more than 10 percent of all the shares of the Company. Own shares may be repurchased on the basis of this authorization only by using unrestricted equity. Own shares can be repurchased at a price formed in trading on regulated market on the date of the repurchase or otherwise at a price formed on the market. The Board of Directors is entitled to resolve how shares are repurchased. Own shares may be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the shares held by the shareholders (directed repurchase). The authorization shall be in force until the closing of the Annual General Meeting 2024. Authorizing the Board of Directors to resolve on the issuance of shares and the issuance of special rights entitling to shares (agenda item 19) The Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to resolve on the issuance of shares and the issuance of special rights entitling to shares referred to in Chapter 10  Section 1 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act as follows: The number of shares to be issued on the basis of this",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,True,English,"['Metso Outotec Oyj', ""Shareholders' Nomination Board"", 'Proposals', 'Directors', 'relevant dividend record date', 'price Annual General Meeting', 'fixed total annual remuneration', ""The Shareholders' Nomination Board"", 'first dividend instalment', 'second dividend instalment', 'Euroclear Finland Oy', 'Finnish book-entry system', 'stock exchange release', 'Klaus Cawén', 'Terhi Koipijärvi', 'Ian W.

In order to encourage a common interest for the participants and the shareholders of long-term good return and the company's ability to recruit and retain key employees  the Board of Directors considers that the company shall have cash-based incentive programs. Such programs should be approved annually and have performance conditions related to (i) the relative value development of Essity's class B share  and (ii) reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The Board of Directors also considers that there should be a requirement for the participants' own investment in Essity shares and that such shares should be held for a period of at least three years. It is noted that the Program is exclusively cash-based and does not result in any dilution or other impact on the rights of the shares.Essity has for a number of years resolved on similar cash-based programs  which are described in the company's Annual and Sustainability Report and in the remuneration report approved by the Annual General Meeting 2022. The Board of Directors' assessment is that these programs have worked very well.Against this background  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2023 resolves on a cash-based incentive program  as further described below.Principal terms and conditions of the ProgramThe proposed Program for 2023–2025 shall be based on the following principal terms and conditions.a. The Program is proposed to be open to senior management as well as certain other executives and key employees in the Essity group  a total of approximately 380 persons (the ""Participants"").b. The Participants shall have the opportunity  depending on satisfaction of certain performance conditions in accordance with paragraph (c) below  to obtain a cash remuneration (the ""Cash Remuneration"") after the end of a measurement period which covers the years 2023–2025 (the ""Measurement Period""). The Cash Remuneration for each Participant may not exceed a certain percentage of the Participant's fixed annual salary (gross) for 2025  as follows: (i) for the President  a maximum of 50 per cent  (ii) for other members of the senior management  a maximum of 80 per cent and (iii) for other Participants  a maximum of 50 per cent. The maximum variable remuneration level shall be determined per individual  taking into account the total remuneration in relation to the specific role  the local market  the terms of employment or the individual performance.c. Payment of the Cash Remuneration shall depend on the degree on satisfaction of the following performance conditions for the Program under the Measurement Period:i. A financial target consisting of the total shareholder return (""TSR"") on the company's class B share under the Measurement Period in relation to a benchmark group of other companies (the ""TSR Condition"").[1] The benchmark group shall to 60 per cent consist of companies which are comparable with the operations in the company's business area Consumer Goods and to 20 per cent each consist of companies that are comparable with the operations in the business area Health & Medical and Professional Hygiene  respectively.[2]A condition for payment is that the TSR of Essity's class B share is not lower than the weighted TSR outcome for the benchmark group under the Measurement Period (the ""TSR Minimum Level""). If the TSR Minimum Level is not reached  no payment of Cash Remuneration related to the TSR Condition will be made. For maximum payment (100 per cent)  it is required that the TSR of Essity's class B share exceeds the weighted TSR outcome for the Benchmark Group with at least 5 percentage points during the Measurement Period (the ""TSR Maximum Level""). Should the TSR of Essity's class B share be between the TSR Minimum Level and the TSR Maximum Level during the Measurement Period  a linear payment will be made.ii. A sustainability target related to the company's reduction of greenhouse gas emissions during the Measurement Period (the ""Sustainability Condition"").[3]A condition for payment of Cash Remuneration related to Sustainability Condition is that the company reduces greenhouse gas emissions during the Measurement Period by at least 7.5 per cent compared to the base year 2016 (the ""Sustainability Target""). If the Sustainability Target is reached  full payment of Cash Remuneration relating to the Sustainability Condition will be made. If the Sustainability Target is not reached  no payment relating to this target will be made.iii. The TSR Condition will be weighted 80 per cent and the Sustainability Condition 20 per cent  when payment of the Cash Remuneration is decided.d. Cash Remuneration will normally be paid only after the expiration of the Measurement Period and shall in general not qualify for the basis for pension computation.e. Participants shall normally be invited to the Program during the first year of the Program. A prerequisite for a Participant to be able to receive full Cash Remuneration  is that the Participant has been permanently employed withing the Essity group throughout the Measurement Period. If a Participant has commenced its employment within the Essity group during the Measurement Period  the payment of Cash Remuneration shall be made pro rata.f. Each Participant shall undertake  for as long as the Participant is employed within the Essity group  to acquire Essity shares for (i) the total paid net amount of the Cash Remuneration regarding senior management  and (ii) at least half the total paid net amount regarding other Participants  no later than 30 June 2026 (or as soon as possible thereafter if the Participant has been prevented from acquiring Essity shares at such time due to applicable insider rules)  and to retain such shares for a period of at least three years after the acquisition  with certain exemptions approved by the Board of Directors. If a Participant does not acquire or retain Essity shares in accordance with the above  the Participant's right to payment under future incentive programs to which the Participant has been invited to participate  shall lapse.g. If extraordinary changes in the Essity group or in the market occur which  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  would result in a situation where the conditions for Cash Remuneration under the Program become unreasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Program  including  among other things  be entitled to resolve on a reduced right to Cash Remuneration  or that no Cash Remuneration shall be paid at all.h. The Board of Directors shall be authorized to establish the detailed terms and conditions for the Program. The Board of Directors may  in that regard  make necessary adjustments of these general terms and conditions due to changed circumstances or to satisfy certain regulations or market conditions outside Sweden.i. Participation in the Program presupposes that such participation is legally possible in the various jurisdictions concerned.Measurement Period and vesting periodThe Measurement Period for the performance conditions under the proposed Program will cover the financial years 2023–2025. The intention of the Board of Directors is that also future programs shall have a measurement period of three years. In order to receive full Cash Remuneration  employment within the Essity group throughout the vesting period is required. Further  the vesting period  which is three years  shall be combined with a requirement that the Participant must undertake to acquire and hold Essity shares for at least a three-year period after the acquisition  in accordance with above. Required long-term nature of the Program is achieved by the above stated requirements which totals six years.Costs for the Program  dilution  etc.The cost for the Program  including social security charges  including approximately 380 employees  amounts to a maximum of SEK 260 million assuming 100 per cent satisfaction of all of the performance conditions for all Participants in the Program. The cost of the Program amounts to a maximum of 1.7 per cent of Essity's total cost for salaries and remuneration  including social security charges.The Program is cash-based and does not entail any dilution for the company's shareholders. No hedging arrangements are intended to be made with regard to the Program's financial exposure.Preparations of the proposalThe proposed Program has been prepared by Essity's Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee has presented documentation to the Board of Directors  whereafter the Board of Directors has resolved that the Program shall be referred to the Annual General Meeting 2023 for approval.Majority requirementsThe Annual General Meeting's resolution on approval of the Program requires a simple majority of the votes cast.Previous incentive programs in EssityThe company's other incentive programs are described more in detail in Essity's report on remuneration for 2022  which is included in the company's Annual and Sustainability Report 2022 and available on the company's website  www.essity.com.Proposal for resolution under Item 16The Board of Directors makes the assessment that it would be advantageous for the company to be able to adapt the capital structure and to be able to acquire own shares to be used as payment or financing on account of company acquisitions and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value. Hence  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition and transfer of own class B shares mainly as follows.a. Acquisition of own sharesAcquisition of class B shares shall be made on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the at each time prevailing price interval for the share on the marketplace  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price. Payment for the shares shall be made in cash. The authorisation may be utilised on one or several occasions until the Annual General Meeting 2024. A maximum of so many class B shares may be acquired that Essity's holding at each time amount to a maximum of 10 per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in Essity.The Board of Directors has issued a statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act.b. Transfer of own shares on account of company acquisitionsTransfer of class B shares may be made on Nasdaq Stockholm  as well as outside of Nasdaq Stockholm  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and with or without provisions regarding contribution in kind or set-off rights. The shares may be used as payment upon acquisition of companies or businesses or as to finance acquisition of companies or businesses. Transfer may be made of the maximum number of shares held by Essity at the time of the Board of Directors' resolution. The authorisation may be utilized on one or several occasions until the Annual General Meeting 2024. Transfer upon acquisition of companies or businesses may be made at a minimum price per share corresponding to an amount in close connection with the price of the company's class B shares on Nasdaq Stockholm at the time of the decision of transfer. Transfers made on Nasdaq Stockholm to finance acquisition of companies or businesses may be made at a price within the each time prevailing price interval of the share.The purpose of the authorisation to acquire shares in the company is to be able to adapt the company's capital structure and to be able to use repurchased shares in connection with the potential company acquisitions and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value. The purpose of the authorisation to transfer own shares is to give the Board of Directors increased flexibility when financing company acquisitions. The reason for deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to create alternative forms of payment upon acquisition of companies or businesses.Majority requirementsThe Meeting's resolution under Item 16 requires that shareholders representing at least two-thirds of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the Meeting approve the resolution.The Nomination CommitteeThe Nomination Committee for the Annual General Meeting 2023 is composed of Helena Stjernholm  AB Industrivärden  the Chairman of the Nomination Committee  Anders Oscarsson  AMF and AMF Fonder  Ola Peter Krohn Gjessing  Norges Bank Investment Management  Marianne Nilsson  Swedbank Robur Fonder and Pär Boman  Chairman of the Board of Essity.Shares and votesThe total number of shares in the company amounts to 702 342 489 shares  of which 61 158 914 are class A shares and 641 183 575 are class B shares  representing a total of 1 252 772 715 votes.

The volume weighted average price of the share during the fourth quarter 2022 is compared with the volume weighted average price of the share during the fourth quarter 2025  including dividend and other return.[2] When implementing the Program  the benchmark group comprises of the following companies. For Consumer Goods: Procter & Gamble  Kimberly-Clark  Unicharm and Ontex. For Health & Medical: Smith & Nephew  Convatec and Hartman. For Professional Hygiene: Kimberly-Clark  Ecolab and Diversey. Each company has the same significance within the respective business area. The benchmark group can be adjusted according to the Board of Directors' decision if the Board of Directors deems it appropriate.[3] The calculation of greenhouse gas emissions shall be based on the target adopted by the company according to Science Based Targets (SBTi) in Scope 1 and 2. The assessment shall be made on the basis of the actual greenhouse gas emissions within the specified classes during the Measurement Period  taking into account acquisitions or divestments made.

The order book reserved for 2023 is estimated at EUR 85 9 million  growing 68 4% compared to beginning of the year 2022.Based on the order book and current market dynamics  the revenue guidance for the year 2023 is set at EUR 145-155 million.The revenue range demonstrates the ambition of EVS to continue the organic growth  in a year with no Big Event Rental revenue.With the growth engine launched  the focus in 2023 for EVS will be on profitable growth.EVS plans no further growth in team members nor do we expect an increase in our capital expenditure envelope.We expect to pay out dividends in 2023 in line with our dividend policy  namely a base dividend per share of EUR 1 10.Story continuesKey figuresEUR millions  except earnings per share expressed in EUR 2H22 2H21 Variance FY22 FY21 Variance Revenue 80 5 75 8 4 7 148 2 137 6 10 6 Gross profit 53 0 53 2 -0 2 98 8 95 8 3 0 Gross margin % 65 8% 70 3% -4 5 Pts 66 7% 69 6% -2 9 Pts Operating profit – EBIT 16 0 21 7 -5 7 31 7 37 1 -5 4 Operating margin – EBIT % 19 9% 28 6% -8 7 Pts 21 4% 27 0% -5 6 Pts Net profit (Group share) 15 9 19 3 -3 5 31 3 34 9 -3 6 Fully diluted EPS (Group share) 1 14 1 42 -0 28 2 29 2 57 -0 28CommentsSerge Van Herck  CEO comments:“I’m proud to say that 2022 was again quite a successful year for EVS. Our PlayForward strategy  as defined at the end of 2019  is starting to deliver the expected growth momentum.In 2022  we had a second record year in a row  with strong growth in revenues  order intake  and team member size. We showed significant growth in North America  announced our largest contract ever in August with the ""Big Tech 22 contract” worth over 50MioUSD  and successfully fought against inflation and component shortages throughout the year.We feel we are winning market share in our Live Audience Business and protecting our position in the Live Service Providers markets. We successfully supported many of our customers in delivering the live TV production of major sports events in Asia  the Middle East  and North America.The growth of our team is clearly unlocking our sustainable growth ambitions. Our strong employer branding has enabled us to successfully hire strong talent across the world. Our team member engagement survey shows again further improvements compared to the years before  resulting in our recent “Top Employer” certification.We are making good progress in our vision of developing a strong ecosystem relying on our VIA platform as we are successfully moving from product to solution sales. Our introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in XtraMotion is a revolution in the industry and it represents a major differentiator.The Axon acquisition in May 2020 has translated into our Media Infrastructure revenue growth and positively contributes to our bottom line  demonstrating our capability to execute successfully large acquisitions. We have also launched our new ERP and upgraded our VIA Portal applications such as our customer ticketing system to support our long-term growth ambitions.In line with our commitments  we continued to deliver strong dividends for our shareholders. Our sustainability strategy has started to deliver strong results aligned with our customer’s expectations  and resulting in good ESG ratings like the Ecovadis Silver medal. We completed our first carbon footprint analysis: this will be a critical management tool for taking the right sustainability decisions in the future.In conclusion  our PlayForward strategy  is clearly being appreciated by our customers and channel partners. This is helping us to get back into growth mode. While economic market conditions remain very challenging with high inflation  component shortages and with the war in Ukraine  we feel that our customers increasingly appreciate the reliability  performance and innovative edge of our solutions and services.Our ambition for the next years is to continue to deliver growth on both our top and bottomline. We are convinced that by focusing on cost control we will be able to deliver upon this promise.”Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said:“Our 2022 revenue results clearly demonstrate our ability to achieve organic growth. Even despite increased delivery terms  announced early 2022  and with a declining Big Event Rental revenue  we are able to realize a strong top line performance. All indicators lead us to conclude that this organic growth is here to stay: the revenue performance  together with the strong secured revenue position for 2023  are a solid basis to continue our growth path.Being a company in growth mode  means that the necessary resources need to be invested to support this growth: 2022 has been a year where we invested in additional resources  in new product developments  and in the back-bone of our operations. This backbone  a globally released new ERP system  has allowed us to optimize our processes and refine our cost control. As a result  the granularity of our reporting is improving  which has led to a decision to write off EUR 0 7 million of Bill of Material costs in 4Q22.Our operational expenses grew in a controlled way. Control over our spending patterns remains an attention point for 2023  especially in the current volatile market.Thanks to sound treasury management and tax benefits  we are able to generate a strong Net Profit worth EUR 31 3 million  driving a diluted Earnings Per Share of EUR 2 29.Our balance sheet also remains healthy with a very low debt level and a sound cash position. Our cash position is declining throughout 2022  as a consequence of high dividends paid  and as a consequence on increased Net Working Capital requirements. The impact on Net Working Capital is temporary: the implementation of the new ERP system has created a delay in invoicing in the fourth quarter – the quarter with the highest volume – resulting in a large volume of receivables not due at the end of 2022. This is a temporary effect  that will normalize early in 2023  as soon as the invoices become due.Based on the strong results for the year 2022  we are able to maintain our dividend policy defined earlier in 2022.”Market & customersThe record high numbers in terms of revenues  order intake and order book translate the market traction that EVS is living. Our main growth drivers are North America and Media Infrastructure. The performance of our MediaInfra solution clearly demonstrates the power of our acquisition strategy. It is the fruit of our investment in Axon in 2020  and this acquisition demonstrates its return on investment 2 years later.The high order intake is also thanks to our biggest contract signed in the history of EVS: our Big Tech 2022. This contract proved an exceptional milestone in the history of EVS. This contract is a 10-year agreement that covers the delivery of EVS’ live production  replay and highlight solutions LiveCeption®  combined with a long-term services level agreement. The contract provides our US based customer access to the latest technology innovations for the next 10 years  a full upgrade of its installed base  a predictable operational spend and an ease of operations.2022 was a year with important Big Events  that EVS was able to support successfully. New solutions  like MediaHub and MediaInfra Strada  were introduced in our Big Event Rental business with success.Market conditions have been challenging throughout the year  with volatile interest rates  inflation and a continued erratic components market. This volatile market has urged EVS to implement a systemic price increase policy. Twice a year the sales prices are evaluated based on the underlying cost for components and inflation of labour cost. EVS has introduced 2 price increases in 2022: a first one in February 2022  and a second one in September 2022. The price increase policy aims to guarantee the overall profitability of the solutions of EVS.The erratic components market also forced EVS to extend its delivery periods early 2022 and to change the supply chain approach. However  as most components suffer longer lead-times  EVS has pro-actively invested in inventory to ensure these delivery terms are met.EVS has received many awards in 2022  and this for different business dimensions. Ranging from technology awards (Neuron Protect Best of Show Award at the NAB Show)  to Wallonia International Business Awards  to IABM Environmental Sustainability award  to Top Employer Certification 2023.Three years after the PLAYForward strategic exercise that has moved the focus from products to solutions  we can confidently say that this solution driven approach is highly appreciated by our customers and contributes to the differentiation reflected in the order book.TechnologiesDuring 2022  new generation of AI products did surface on the market. EVS continues to invest in the development of specific machine learning algorithms for broadcast specific components and also integrates in parallel existing AI technologies or libraries inside the solution portfolio or the workflows deployed for our customers.EVS also further developed and evangelized this year the concept of “Balanced computing” as the best distribution of the computing workload between on-prem  datacenter and public cloud based on the economic benefits and the technical constraints for a specific workflow. This concept has been well received by the market where some players start to discover the limitations in terms of feature and the significant impact on Total Cost of Ownership for the production of premium events.EVS also currently invests in the development of important solution components that will be later embraced in the different solutions. Thanks to the capability to track the benefits brought by these components in the future  these developments are activated. These developments will contribute to the future sustainable growth of EVS.Corporate topics2022 marks the moment where the Axon acquisition really starts to pay off for EVS. The initial assumptions made in terms of greographical expansion of the market are becoming a reality. Also the developments made to ensure end-to-end integration with EVS products demonstrate the complementarity of this company within the EVS portfolio. It comforts us in our Acquisition strategy and our ability to integrate companies.One of the axes of the PLAYforward strategy is improving our internal way of working. As a company we want to ensure that we have efficient processes in place that promote end-to-end collabration across all our departments. Having an efficient operational back-bone is important in that context. In October 2022  EVS launched a new global ERP system to ensure optimimal functioning of our company. The launch was a success and did not cause any major business interruption: shipping  production and support were active as of day 1. We now have a solid base to continously optimize our processes and ensure an optimal team member and customer experience.Speaking about improved processes  2022 is also the year where we first implemented a systemic listprice adjustment. The market conditions require a clear methodology to offset the impact of rising component prices and increasing inflation over labour costs. EVS now evaluates the need for price adjustments twice a year to protect the margin generation of the company.2022 is also the year where we continue to expand our sustainability efforts in terms of ESG. After a first hollistic report published in 2021  we continue to structure our efforts in terms of sustainability. Our current ESG strategy and reporting has already received postive feedback from the market: we received a silver medal from Ecovadis  obtained encouriging score from other rating companies and recently obtained the certification of Top Employer for 2023. By the end of 2022  we also realized our first EVS Carbon Footprint analysis: it provides us not only insight on our direct and indirect CO2 emissions  but most importantly  helps us to define our roadmap to reduce our carbon footprint in the future.EVS also reinvented the way it collaborates with its channel partners. A structured channel partner program has been developed  focused on sustainable relationships with partners more than on opportunistic market responses  starting to develop certification paths and clear objectives. This program allows EVS to reach a broader set of clients and even penetrate new markets.Being a company in growth mode  EVS further invested in additional team members. Additional resources were primarily allocated to support and operations roles  as to fuel our future growth  and some research and development resources  as to staff some important developments ensuring future growth. Thanks to a strong employer branding  EVS was able to attract this high number of talents in a relatively short time frame.Also to support our future growth ambition  EVS further strengthened its leadership team  early 2022. A new CTO  Alex Redfern  was welcomed and Xavier Orri was named EVP of Projects & Operations.Revenue in 2H22 and FY22In 2H22  EVS revenue reached EUR 80 5 million: an increase of EUR 4 7 million or 6 2% compared to 2H21  despite a drop of EUR 4 2 million on Big Event Rentals.At constant currency  revenue decreased by 1.6% YoY.Revenue – EUR millions 2H22 2H21 2H22/2H21 Total reported 80 5 75 8 6 0% Total at constant currency 74 7 75 8 -1.6% Total at constant currency and excluding big event rentals 70 5 66 8 5.6%For the full year 2022  EVS revenue reached EUR 148 2 million: an increase of EUR 10 6 million or 7 7% compared to 2021  despite a drop of EUR 3 7 million on Big Event Rentals and despite an increased delivery term announced early 2022. This performance demonstrates the organic growth realized in 2022.At constant currency  revenue increased by 3 5% YoY.Revenue – EUR millions FY22 FY21 FY22/FY21 Total reported 148 158 137 578 7 7% Total at constant currency 142 382 137 578 3.5% Total at constant currency and excluding big event rentals 132 532 124 044 6.8%Currency fluctuations primarily impact EVS revenues by the EUR/USD conversion  which can have a significant impact on our results even if EUR/USD fluctuations also impact the cost of our US operations and partially our cost of goods sold.In the second half of the year  (excl. Big Event Rentals) LSP represented 40% (31% in 2H21) of the revenue  LAB 55% (57% in 2H21).Geographically  revenues (excl. Big Event Rentals) are distributed in 2H22 as follows:Europe  Middle East and Africa (EMEA): EUR 39 1 million (EUR 31 7 million in 2H21)Americas (NALA): EUR 25 9 million (EUR 21 7 million in 2H21)Asia & Pacific (APAC): EUR 11 3 million (EUR 13 4 million in 2H21)  impacted by the slowdown in the region following COVID implications (primarily in China). The order intake for APAC in 2H22 do recomfort us that this trend can be reversed.Overall 2022 resultsConsolidated gross margin was at 66 7% for FY22  compared to 69 6% in FY21 (-2 9 Pts) explained by different drivers:Important investments in the operations & support department to ensure we continue to deliver quality support all over the world  in line with our growth patterns (representing -1 4 Pts)Impact of the change in solution mix is representing -1.1 Pts following the relative weight of Media Infrastructure in the overall portfolio.Write-off worth EUR 0 7 million linked to bill of material costs  following more granuler inventory reporting thanks to optimized processes in our new ERP (-0 4 Pts)In order to maintain gross profit levels  the impact of cost price increases and inflation have been systematically modeled by corresponding sales price increases. This has resulted primarily in improved margins for our Media Infrastructure and MediaCeption solutions.Operating expenses increased by 11% YoY (remaining below the guidance provided) explained by inflation on labour cost and energy prices and post-COVID spending patterns impacting spend for travel  marketing  … EVS did also invest in additional Research & Development resources in 2022  both through internal engagements as well as external contracts. These additional resources were staffed on 2 important developments  recognized as intangible assets in 2022. The associated spend was therefore capitalised on the balance sheet.Overall EBIT performance is of EUR 31 7 million  generating an EBIT margin of 21 4%.The net profit ends at EUR 31 3 million benefiting from a strong financial income following pro-active cash flow management and low income taxes (EUR 1 4 million compared to EUR 2 8 million last year) resulting from an excess in tax paid in 2021 and various tax latencies linked to prior years.The net profit leads to a fully diluted earnings per share of EUR 2 29 (versus EUR 2 57 in 2021).Overall second half 2022 resultsThe gross profit margin in 2H22 was of 65 9% compared to 70 3% in the same period last year. The drop is a consequence of lesser revenue from Big Event Rentals and a higher weight of Media Infrastructure solution in the overall mix. In addition  the impact of the hirings done in 2022 to ensure continued quality operations and support affect the comparison.Operating expenses grew 13.8% in 2H22  compared to the same period last year and are a reflection of post-COVID spending patterns and impact of inflation.The 2H22 EBIT margin was 19 8%  compared to 28 6% in 2H21: the EBIT margin is dropping primarily following investments in the past 12 months to support our growth pattern.The Group net profit amounted to EUR 15 9 million in 2H22  compared to EUR 19 3 million in 2H21. Fully diluted earnings per share amounted to EUR 1 14 in 2H22 compared to EUR 1 42 in 2H21.Team membersAt the end of 2022  EVS employed 613 team members (FTE). This is an increase by 62 team members compared to the end of 2021 (551 FTE). This increase in team members reflects our continued investments in the growth of EVS. We expect no further growth of our team member base in 2023  and we will ensure that we balance the priorities of EVS with the existing workforce.Balance sheet and cash flow statementEVS continues to have a strong balance sheet with net cash position of EUR 33 8 million with low debt level (of which EUR 12 5 million related to IFRS 16) resulting in a total equity representing 75 4% of the total balance sheet as of the end of 2022. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents (EUR -23 1 million) compared to end of 2021 is mainly driven by the dividends paid in May and November (including exceptional additional dividend)  combined with the increase in working capital requirements at the end of 2022.The working capital requirements are growing  primarily linked to growing trade receivables. The trade receivables evolve largely in line with our overall sales volumes. 71% of our trade receivables is not due at year-end  with a large volume of invoices issued in the second half of the fourth quarter  given a temporary hold of invoicing operations after the Go-Live of our new ERP system. We expect these trade receivales to restore in 1Q23. A sound cash position remains a priority for EVS.Other intangible assets include the costs for internal development capitalized during 2022 according to IAS 38 (Intangible assets).Lands and building mainly include the headquarters in Liège as well as the right of use for the offices abroad (IFRS16).Inventories amount to EUR 28 8 million  an increase of EUR 2 8 million compared to the beginning of the year as a reflection of a pro-active supply chain management to ensure we systematically meet our customers’ delivery terms.Liabilities include EUR 15 3 million of financial debt (including long term and short-term portion)  mainly related to the lease liabilities for EUR 12 5 million and borrowings for EUR 2 8 million. Long-term provisions include the provision for technical warranty on EVS products for labor and parts. Other amounts payable mainly represent deferred income and advance payments received from customers on contracts in progress.Net cash from operating activities amounts to EUR 11 0 million for the full year 2022  compared to EUR 38 7 million in 2021. The decrease is mainly driven by higher working capital requirements resulting from higher trade receivables (as described above) and lower trade payables  combined with lower net profit. On December 31  2022  cash and cash equivalents total EUR 49 1 million  compared to EUR 72 1 million at the end of 2021. The decrease is mainly driven by lower cash from operating activities  combined with the increase of the net cash used in investing activities mainly due to the investments in intangible and tangible assets (specifically in the internal development of intangible assets) together with the increase of the net cash used in financing activities following the higher amount of dividends distributed during 2022  including the exceptional dividend.At the end of December 2022  there were 14.327.024 EVS shares outstanding  of which 908.014 were owned by the company. At the same date  492.975 warrants were outstanding with average exercise price of EUR 16 95 and maturities between October 2026 and September 2028.Corporate updateThere has been no further change to the composition of the Board of Directors since the last General Assembly on May 17th during which the shareholders had appointed two new directors  Frédéric Vincent and Marco Miserez  both for a period of 4 years.

The accounting framework and standards adopted by the European Commission can be accessed through the following link on the website: http://ec.europa.eu/finance/company-reporting/index_en.htm.The condensed interim financial statements of the Group for the 12 month-period ending December 31  2022  were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on February 16  2023. This interim report only provides an explanation of events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in financial position and reporting since the last annual reporting period and should therefore be read in conjunction with the full 2022 consolidated financial statements from which these condensed financial statements have been derived and which are planned to be published on EVS Group’s website by April 14  2023. The interim condensed financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.NOTE 5.2.1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODSThese condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting  as issued by the IASB  and as adopted by the EU. The accounting policies and methods adopted for the preparation of the company's IFRS consolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the 2021 consolidated financial statements. The company’s IFRS accounting policies and methods are available in the 2021 annual report on www.evs.com  except for the accounting policy on intangible assets which include the capitalization of development cost for the first time (see note 5.10) as well as the new  amended or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC Interpretations that have been in effect since January 1  2022. The adoption of these new  amended or revised pronouncements did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.NOTE 5.2.2: JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATESImpacts of current market volatility and macroeconomic developmentsThe impacts of the current market volatility and macroeconomic developments were taken into account by the company to assess potential effects on EVS’s financial performance and the valuation of its assets and liabilities. In particular  key assumptions used in the calculation of the pension obligations have been reviewed to ensure a proper valuation as per 31 December 2022. Also  the key assumptions that are used for estimating the recoverable amounts of cash generating units in the context of goodwill impairment test reflect latest market conditions for interest rates and weighted average cost of capitalEstimation of useful life and residual valueProperty  Plant and Equipment are depreciated using a straight-line method to allocate their depreciable amount on a systematic basis over their useful life. For the headquarter building in Liège  the depreciable amount is the cost less its estimated residual value. Useful life and residual value of an asset is estimated on a realistic basis based on the experience of the Group with similar assets and reviewed on a regular basis. The effect of changes in useful life are recognized prospectively.Functional currency of the Group entitiesThe individual financial statements of each subsidiary are prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. When the factors set out by IAS 21 to determine the functional currency are mixed and the functional currency is not obvious  management judgment is used to determine which functional currency most faithfully represents the economic effects of its underlying transactions  events and conditions. The functional currency of the EVS Group entities is EUR except for the US entity EVS Inc. for which US Dollar is assessed by management to be the functional currency.Claims and contingent liabilitiesRelated to claims and contingencies  judgement is necessary in assessing the existence of an obligation resulting from a past event  in assessing the probability of an economic outflow  and in quantifying the probable outcome of economic resources. This judgment is reviewed when new information becomes available and often with support of internal and external expert advice.Impact of the war in Ukraine on our activitiesGiven the nature and location of its operations and the fact that EVS does not currently have activities in Russia nor in Ukraine or with Russian companies  The Company does not foresee a direct impact of the Ukrainian conflict on its business.NOTE 5.3: SEGMENT REPORTINGFrom an operational point of view  the company is vertically integrated with the majority of its staff located in the headquarters in Belgium  including the R&D  production  marketing and administration departments. Therefore the majority of investments and costs are located at the level of the Belgian parent company. Resources securing the customer facing interactions such as sales  operations and support profiles are primarily hired within the respective regions. The foreign subsidiaries are primarily sales and representative offices. The Chief Operating Decision Maker  being the Executive Committee  reviews the operating results  operating plans  and makes resource allocation decisions on a company-wide basis. Revenue related to products of the same nature (digital broadcast production equipment) are realized by commercial polyvalent teams. The company’s internal reporting is the reflection of the above-mentioned operational organization and is characterized by the strong integration of the activities of the company.By consequence  the company is composed of one segment according to the IFRS 8 definition  and the consolidated income statement of the Group reflects this unique segment. All long-term assets are located in the parent company EVS Broadcast Equipment SA in Belgium.The company provides one class of business defined as solutions based on tapeless workflows with a consistent modular architecture. There are no other significant classes of business  either singularly or in aggregate. Identical modules can meet the needs of different markets  and our customers themselves are often multi-markets. Providing information for each module is therefore not relevant for EVS.At the geographical level  our activities are divided into the following regions: Asia-Pacific (“APAC”)  Europe  Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”)  and America (“NALA”). This division follows the organization of the commercial and support services within the Group  which operates worldwide. A fourth region is dedicated to the worldwide events (“big event rentals”).The company provides additional information with a presentation of the revenue by market pillar: “Live Service provider”  “Live Audience Business” and “Big Event Rentals” for rental contracts relating to the big sporting events.Finally  sales are presented by nature: systems and services.5.3.1.

INFORMATION ON IMPORTANT CLIENTSOver the last 12 months  no external client of the company represented more than 10% of the revenue (similar in 2021).NOTE 5.4: EQUITY SECURITIESThe variance in number of treasury shares and outstanding warrants in the period is as follows:2022 2021 Number of own shares at January 1 925.140 928.207 Acquisition of own shares on the market - - Sale of own shares on the market - - Allocation to Employees Profit Sharing Plans -17.126 -3.067 Sale related to Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) and other transactions - - Number of own shares at December 31 908.014 925.140 Outstanding warrants at December 31 492.975 456.432In 2022  the Group did not repurchase own shares on the stock market. No shares were used to satisfy the exercise of warrants by employees.The Ordinary General Meeting of shareholders of May 17  2022 approved the allocation of 17.126 shares to EVS employees (grant of 56 shares to each staff member in proportion to their effective or assimilated time of occupation in 2021) as a reward for their contribution to the Group successes. The expense recorded in the consolidated income statement amounts to EUR 329k in 2022.NOTE 5.5: DIVIDENDSThe Ordinary General Meeting of May 17  2022  approved the payment of a total gross dividend of EUR 1.50 per share for the year 2021  which includes EUR 0.50 per share exceptional dividend to honor past commitments on dividend payout.For the year 2022  an interim dividend of EUR 0.50 per share was paid in November 2022. Full year dividend of EUR 1 60 per share will be proposed to the Ordinary General Meeting of shareholders  which also includes EUR 0.50 per share exceptional dividend to honor past commitments on dividend payout.(EUR thousands  gross) # Coupon Declaration date 2022 2021 - Final dividend for 2020(EUR 0 50 per share excl. treasury shares) 30 May 2021 - 6.699 - Interim dividend for 2021(EUR 0 50 per share excl. treasury shares) 31 Nov. 2021 - 6.701 - Final dividend for 2021 (incl. exceptional dividend)(EUR 1 00 per share excl. treasury shares) 32 May 2022 13.402 - Interim dividend for 2022(EUR 0 50 per share excl. treasury shares) 33 Nov. 2022 6.710 Total paid dividends 20.112 13.400A new dividend guidance for upcoming years has been issued early 2022 and is as follows*:In € per share per fiscal year 2022 2023 2024 Base dividend 1 10 1 10 1 10 Exceptional additional dividend 0 50 0 00 0 00 Total dividend 1 60 1 10 1 10*subject to market conditions and to the approval of the Ordinary General Meeting of ShareholdersNOTE 5.6: OTHER NET FINANCIAL INCOME / (EXPENSES)(EUR thousands) FY22 FY21 - Exchange results 1.393 1.117 - Fair value variation of financial instruments 324 -7 - Other financial results 76 144 Other net financial income / (expenses) 1.793 1.254The functional currency of EVS Broadcast Equipment SA as well as all subsidiaries is the Euro  except for EVS Inc. subsidiary in the USA whose functional currency is the US dollar. Entity Axon Digital Design LTD. in the UK changed functional currency from GBP to EUR starting as of July 1st 2022  following updated Management assesment driven by new implementation of EUR invoicing at the affiliate. The presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements of EVS Group is the Euro. For more information on exchange rates  see also the note 5.9. The favourable exchange result is mainly explained by the appreciation of USD vs. EUR in the period.The estimated fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are equal to their fair book values in the balance sheet.Since 2022  EVS systematically measures the Group’s anticipated exposure to transactional exchange risk  mainly relating to the EUR/USD risk. Given the Group has a long position in USD and based on revenue forecasts  EVS hedges future USD net inflows through forward or option foreign exchange contracts. The change in the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts is recorded directly to the income statement since the Group does not apply hedge accounting on these transactions. The valuation techniques used are mainly based on spot rates  forward rates and interest rate curves.On December 31  2022  the Group holds EUR/USD FX forward and option contracts for a total notional amount of USD 34 0 million with monthly maturities between January 2023 and June 2024. The fair value of those financial instruments on December 31  2022 amounts to EUR 0 3 million.NOTE 5.7: INCOME TAX EXPENSE(EUR thousands) FY22 FY21 - Current tax expense -569 -1.245 - Deferred tax expense -853 -1.552 Income tax expense -1.422 -2.797Income tax expense amounts to EUR 1 4 million for the full year 2022  compared to EUR 2 8 million in 2021. The decrease is mainly explained by lower taxable profit  tax relief of EUR 0 6 million received in December 2022 and decrease of the deferred tax expenses due to lower consumption of recoverable tax latencies (EUR 1 2 million in 2022 compared to 8 6 million in 2021).The effective tax rate for the period ended on December 31  2022 is 4 3%  compared to 7 5% in 2021.NOTE 5.8: HEADCOUNT(in full time equivalents) At December 31 2022 613 2021 551 Variation +62NOTE 5.9: EXCHANGE RATESThe main exchange rates that influence the consolidated financial accounts are USD/EUR and GBP/EUR which were considered as follows:Exchange rate USD/EUR Average FY At December 31 2022 1 0537 1 0666 2021 1 1830 1 1326 Variation -10 9% -5 8%Exchange rate GBP/EUR Average FY At December 31 2022 0 8527 0 8869 2021 0 8599 0 8403 Variation -0 7% 5 5%NOTE 5.10: INTANGIBLE ASSETSDuring 2022  intangible assets increased by EUR 7 1 million due to capitalization of internal development costs of EUR 8 4 million less depreciations of EUR 1 3 million.The capitalized costs during 2022 include mainly the internal personnel costs and external consultants’ costs. These costs are only related to the development phase of 2 important projects that should secure future growth for EVS.At the beginning of the period  the Group identified internal development projects  that for the first time of EVS Broadcast Equipment’s history fulfilled all the conditions to be capitalized according to IAS 38 Intangible assets. This ability arises after the implementation of extensive business cases  where R&D together with the solutions and sales departments perform an end-to-end exercise whereby objectives  costs  market analysis and return are clearly identified.These internal development projects consist of software that will be commercialized at the end of the development period (expected return on investment is scheduled for 2024). These 2 projects complement the PLAYForward strategy of the Group. The progress of these internal developments is monitored frequently as to ensure the future economic benefit remains assured.We refer to H1 2022 press release for the update of the accounting policy 2.11 related to the intagible assets applicable as of fiscal year 2022 and that replaces the accounting policy disclosed in 2021 annual report.NOTE 5.11: TANGIBLE ASSETSThe decrease of lands and buildings of EUR -2 1 million during 2022 is mainly explained by the depreciation of the period partially offset by investments in progress of EUR 0 5 million. The increase in other tangible assets of EUR 0 4 million is mainly driven by investments in office and IT equipment of EUR 1 1 million  net of the depreciation of the year of EUR 0 7 million.NOTE 5.12: FINANCIAL LIABILITIES(EUR thousands) 2022 2021 Long term financial debts Bank loans 1.675 2.779 Long term lease liabilities 9.853 10.775 Amount due within 12 months (shown under current liabilities) Bank loans 1.105 1.095 Short term lease liabilities 2.645 2.633 Total financial debt (short and long-term) 15.278 17.282 The total financial debt is repayable as follows: - within one year 3.750 3.728 - after one year but no more than five 8.676 9.673 - more than five years 2.852 3.881In June 2020  a loan of EUR 5 5 million was put in place with BNP Paribas Fortis to partially finance the acquisition of Axon. The repayment schedule foresees first repayment of EUR 0 6 million in 2020 and annual installments of EUR 1 1 million between 2021 and 2024  with final repayment of EUR 0 6 million in 2025 at loan maturity.For full year 2022  lease liabilities variation includes repayment of EUR 2 5 million  excluding interest of EUR 0 4 million.In June 2020  a roll over credit line of EUR 5 0 million was put in place with Belfius bank to partially finance the acquisition of Axon. This amortizing credit line will end at the latest on 30/06/2025. As of this date  EVS has not used this credit facility.NOTE 5.13: OTHER LIABILITIES - PENSIONOther long-term liabilities mainly correspond to pension obligations. Changes recorded in 2022 in the Belgian pension defined benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were as follows:(EUR thousands) 2022 2021 Defined benefit obligation Fair value of plan assets Net defined benefit liability Defined benefit obligation Fair value of plan assets Net defined benefit liability As of January 1 10.587 -8.762 1.825 8.670 -7.686 984 Service cost 1.156 1.156 1.398 1.398 Administrative costs 28 28 18 18 Net interest expenses 120 -106 14 41 -38 3 Sub-total included in profit or loss 1.276 -78 1.198 1.439 -20 1.419 Benefits paid -179 179 0 -141 141 0 Return on plan assets -153 -153 -106 -106 Actuarial changes (assumptions) of which: Arising from changes in demographic assumptions 235 235 0 Arising from changes in financial assumptions -1.349 -1.349 -1.172 -1.172 Arising from experience adjustments -367 -350 -717 1.791 -69 1.722 Sub-total included in OCI -1.481 -350 -1.831 619 -69 550 Contributions by employer -1.078 -1.078 -1.128 -1.128 As of December 31 10.203 -10.089 114 10.587 -8.762 1.825The decrease in the net defined benefit liability of EUR -1 7 million is mainly driven by actuarial changes included in OCI arising from changes in financial assumptions of EUR -1 3 million (mainly increase in discount rate from 1 15% to 3 80%) and from experience adjustments of EUR -0 7 million  combined with employer contributions in the period of EUR -1 1 million and partially offset by service cost recorded in income statement of EUR 1 2 million.The main assumptions used for the actuarial valuation are as follows:Salary increase for financial year 2022 of 14 5% (5 7% in 2021)Discount rate p.a. of 3 8% (1 15% in 2021)Long term salary increase (inflation included) p.a. of 2 4% (2 1% in 2021)NOTE 5.14: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIESThe Group enters into derivative transactions  principally forward and option currency contracts  with the purpose to secure its sales and purchases in foreign currencies against negative variations of these currencies. The Group has transactional currency exposure arising from sales or purchases by operating entities in currencies other than the Group’s functional currency. Foreign currency risk is described in note 5.14.1.The Group’s main financial instruments  other than derivatives  comprise bank loans  finance leases  cash and short-term deposits. The purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors  which arise directly from its operations. The Group’s policy is  and has always been  that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. Credit risk is described in note 5.14.2.5.14.1 FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKSince 2022  EVS systematically measures the Group’s anticipated exposure to transactional exchange risk over six to eighteen months. In its current structure  the Group’s exposure is mainly linked to the EUR/USD risk. The Group invoices all clients in Euro  except in the United States where invoices are denominated in USD. Since the majority of operating expenses are denominated in Euro  the Group has a long position in USD  i.e. all of the Group’s activities generate globally a positive net cash flow in USD.On the basis of the forecasts and according to the market conditions  the Group hedges a portion of the exchange rate risk on estimated net future flows  mainly through foreign exchange forward and option contracts. EVS does not apply hedge accounting according to IAS 39 for those transactions.Foreign exchange contracts are revalued at each closing date at their market value. The generated exchange rate profit or loss is recorded in the “Other net financial income/(charges)” account in the consolidated income statement. The valuation techniques used are mainly based on spot rates  forward rates and interest rate curves. Details of fair value at closing date are presented in note 5.6.5.14.2 CREDIT RISKCredit exposure is controlled and reviewed regularly by the management.Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers  spread across many geographical areas. The evolution of the credit risk is monitored permanently. As of December 31  2022  it is assumed that the carrying amounts of those trade receivables are the most appropriate estimate to the fair value of those assets.The credit risk on financial instruments is contained as it is spread over a selection of different counterparties which are financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.As of December 31  2022  the maximum amount the Group could have to pay if guarantees are called on is EUR 0 8 million (similar to EUR 0 8 million in December 2021).NOTE 5.15: SUBSEQUENT EVENTSThere are no subsequent events that may have a material impact on the condensed financial statements of the Group.NOTE 5.16: RISK AND UNCERTAINTIESInvesting in the stock of EVS involves risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties relating to the current year are similar to the risks and uncertainties that have been identified by the management of the company and that are listed in the management report of the annual report (available at www.evs.com).In terms of new risks arising since the last annual report we highlight the macro-economic environment that drives energy prices  components prices and labour cost to higher levels. EVS closely monitors the developments in this area and pro-actively takes actions to keep these rising costs under control or to minimize their effect on the profitability of the company. We also reiterate the potential impacts following the war in Ukraine. The company continues to comply with the sanction screening in vigor.Certification of responsible personsSerge Van Herck  CEO*Veerle De Wit  CFO*Certify that  based on their knowledge a) the condensed financial statements  prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the European Union  fairly present in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of the issuer and the companies included in the consolidation b) the Directors’ report fairly presents the important events and related parties transactions of 2022  including their impact on the condensed financial statements  and a description of the existing risks and uncertainties for the remaining months of the fiscal year.* acting on behalf of a BVExternal AuditorThe condensed consolidated financial statements of EVS Broadcast SA for the year ending December 31  2022 were authorized of issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors on February 16  2023.

(NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today announce that Pfizer...,"VALNEVANew York & Saint-Herblain (France)  February 17  2023 – Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today announce that Pfizer  as the study sponsor  has decided to discontinue a significant percentage of participants in the U.S. who had been enrolled in the Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524) Phase 3 clinical study. The study is investigating the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of an investigational Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15. These study participants  representing approximately half of the total recruited participants in the trial  are being discontinued following violations of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) at certain clinical trial sites run by a third-party clinical trial site operator. The discontinuation of these participants was not due to any safety concerns with the investigational vaccine and was not prompted by a participant-reported adverse event.GCP is the international ethical and scientific quality standard for clinical trials that all clinical researchers need to follow. These standards are designed to put participants’ interests first and ensure high scientific integrity. Once Pfizer learned of potential violations of GCP  it conducted a thorough review of the operations and data collection at the clinical trial sites run by the third party and followed standard operating safeguards to determine the correct course of action.The clinical trial remains ongoing with other sites not operated by the third party  and Pfizer continues to enroll new participants at those sites. The companies intend to work with regulatory authorities  and as previously announced 1 2 aim for Pfizer to potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025  pending successful completion of the Phase 3 studies and subject to the agreement of these regulatory agencies to proposed modifications of the clinical trial plan.Participants are being notified and Pfizer has also notified the FDA  other regulatory agencies and the independent Institutional Review Board for this study.Integrity of data collected in clinical trials is critical to provide evidence and confidence in a potential vaccine or medicine’s safety and efficacy. Pfizer and Valneva are committed to collecting robust data needed for potential regulatory submission of VLA15. While VLA15 is still under investigation  to date the companies have been encouraged by the data from the Phase 2 clinical studies  which demonstrated strong immunogenicity and acceptable safety and tolerability profiles.2-4About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immune response and satisfactory safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA15  with updates to the terms within this agreement made in June 2022.5 6 The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. FDA in July 2017.7About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes ticks.8 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.9 While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the United States and 130 000 people in Europe.10 11 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.12 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.10About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

All the fundamentals for topline performance are strong: EVS realizes a record-high order intake and achieves a historical revenue number  despite the increased delivery terms in 2022. EVS is able to demonstrate a strong net profit result and as a consequence  realizes a solid Earnings Per Share.FY22 HighlightsRecord order intake at EUR 218 8 million  growing 46 5% YoY.Revenue performance in line with expectations at EUR 148 2 million  growing 7 7% vs. FY21 despite increased delivery terms announced early 2022 and despite reduced Big Event Rental (BER) activity. The growth is realized through strong growth in North America and in the MediaInfra solution.Controlled OPEX growth  in line with market expectations.Healthy net profit at EUR 31 3 million driven by a strong financial income performance and a one-off benefit in taxes  resulting in fully diluted earnings per share of EUR 2 29.2H22 HighlightsRecord order intake of EUR 130 1 million (including Big Tech 2022 contract).Revenue for the second half of 2022 at EUR 80 5 million  growing 6 1% compared to the same period last year. Big Event Rental revenue at EUR 4 2 million  down EUR 4 9 million compared to 2H21. Revenue excluding Big Event Rental at EUR 76 3 million  growing EUR 9 5 million.Net profit amounts to EUR 15 9 million  leading to fully diluted earnings per share of EUR 1 14.Outlook 2023The important order intake of 2022 has considerably fueled the order book to be delivered in future periods. The total order book at the end of 2022 is of EUR 141 8 million  growing 122% compared to last year. The order book reserved for 2023 is estimated at EUR 85 9 million  growing 68 4% compared to beginning of the year 2022.Based on the order book and current market dynamics  the revenue guidance for the year 2023 is set at EUR 145-155 million.The revenue range demonstrates the ambition of EVS to continue the organic growth  in a year with no Big Event Rental revenue.With the growth engine launched  the focus in 2023 for EVS will be on profitable growth.EVS plans no further growth in team members nor do we expect an increase in our capital expenditure envelope.We expect to pay out dividends in 2023 in line with our dividend policy  namely a base dividend per share of EUR 1 10.Key figuresEUR millions  except earnings per share expressed in EUR 2H22 2H21 Variance FY22 FY21 Variance Revenue 80 5 75 8 4 7 148 2 137 6 10 6 Gross profit 53 0 53 2 -0 2 98 8 95 8 3 0 Gross margin % 65 8% 70 3% -4 5 Pts 66 7% 69 6% -2 9 Pts Operating profit – EBIT 16 0 21 7 -5 7 31 7 37 1 -5 4 Operating margin – EBIT % 19 9% 28 6% -8 7 Pts 21 4% 27 0% -5 6 Pts Net profit (Group share) 15 9 19 3 -3 5 31 3 34 9 -3 6 Fully diluted EPS (Group share) 1 14 1 42 -0 28 2 29 2 57 -0 28CommentsSerge Van Herck  CEO comments:“I’m proud to say that 2022 was again quite a successful year for EVS. Our PlayForward strategy  as defined at the end of 2019  is starting to deliver the expected growth momentum.In 2022  we had a second record year in a row  with strong growth in revenues  order intake  and team member size. We showed significant growth in North America  announced our largest contract ever in August with the ""Big Tech 22 contract” worth over 50MioUSD  and successfully fought against inflation and component shortages throughout the year.We feel we are winning market share in our Live Audience Business and protecting our position in the Live Service Providers markets. We successfully supported many of our customers in delivering the live TV production of major sports events in Asia  the Middle East  and North America.The growth of our team is clearly unlocking our sustainable growth ambitions. Our strong employer branding has enabled us to successfully hire strong talent across the world. Our team member engagement survey shows again further improvements compared to the years before  resulting in our recent “Top Employer” certification.We are making good progress in our vision of developing a strong ecosystem relying on our VIA platform as we are successfully moving from product to solution sales. Our introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in XtraMotion is a revolution in the industry and it represents a major differentiator.The Axon acquisition in May 2020 has translated into our Media Infrastructure revenue growth and positively contributes to our bottom line  demonstrating our capability to execute successfully large acquisitions. We have also launched our new ERP and upgraded our VIA Portal applications such as our customer ticketing system to support our long-term growth ambitions.In line with our commitments  we continued to deliver strong dividends for our shareholders. Our sustainability strategy has started to deliver strong results aligned with our customer’s expectations  and resulting in good ESG ratings like the Ecovadis Silver medal. We completed our first carbon footprint analysis: this will be a critical management tool for taking the right sustainability decisions in the future.In conclusion  our PlayForward strategy  is clearly being appreciated by our customers and channel partners. This is helping us to get back into growth mode. While economic market conditions remain very challenging with high inflation  component shortages and with the war in Ukraine  we feel that our customers increasingly appreciate the reliability  performance and innovative edge of our solutions and services.Our ambition for the next years is to continue to deliver growth on both our top and bottomline. We are convinced that by focusing on cost control we will be able to deliver upon this promise.”Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said:“Our 2022 revenue results clearly demonstrate our ability to achieve organic growth. Even despite increased delivery terms  announced early 2022  and with a declining Big Event Rental revenue  we are able to realize a strong top line performance. All indicators lead us to conclude that this organic growth is here to stay: the revenue performance  together with the strong secured revenue position for 2023  are a solid basis to continue our growth path.Being a company in growth mode  means that the necessary resources need to be invested to support this growth: 2022 has been a year where we invested in additional resources  in new product developments  and in the back-bone of our operations. This backbone  a globally released new ERP system  has allowed us to optimize our processes and refine our cost control. As a result  the granularity of our reporting is improving  which has led to a decision to write off EUR 0 7 million of Bill of Material costs in 4Q22.Our operational expenses grew in a controlled way. Control over our spending patterns remains an attention point for 2023  especially in the current volatile market.Thanks to sound treasury management and tax benefits  we are able to generate a strong Net Profit worth EUR 31 3 million  driving a diluted Earnings Per Share of EUR 2 29.Our balance sheet also remains healthy with a very low debt level and a sound cash position. Our cash position is declining throughout 2022  as a consequence of high dividends paid  and as a consequence on increased Net Working Capital requirements. The impact on Net Working Capital is temporary: the implementation of the new ERP system has created a delay in invoicing in the fourth quarter – the quarter with the highest volume – resulting in a large volume of receivables not due at the end of 2022. This is a temporary effect  that will normalize early in 2023  as soon as the invoices become due.Based on the strong results for the year 2022  we are able to maintain our dividend policy defined earlier in 2022.”Market & customersThe record high numbers in terms of revenues  order intake and order book translate the market traction that EVS is living. Our main growth drivers are North America and Media Infrastructure. The performance of our MediaInfra solution clearly demonstrates the power of our acquisition strategy. It is the fruit of our investment in Axon in 2020  and this acquisition demonstrates its return on investment 2 years later.The high order intake is also thanks to our biggest contract signed in the history of EVS: our Big Tech 2022. This contract proved an exceptional milestone in the history of EVS. This contract is a 10-year agreement that covers the delivery of EVS’ live production  replay and highlight solutions LiveCeption®  combined with a long-term services level agreement. The contract provides our US based customer access to the latest technology innovations for the next 10 years  a full upgrade of its installed base  a predictable operational spend and an ease of operations.2022 was a year with important Big Events  that EVS was able to support successfully. New solutions  like MediaHub and MediaInfra Strada  were introduced in our Big Event Rental business with success.Market conditions have been challenging throughout the year  with volatile interest rates  inflation and a continued erratic components market. This volatile market has urged EVS to implement a systemic price increase policy. Twice a year the sales prices are evaluated based on the underlying cost for components and inflation of labour cost. EVS has introduced 2 price increases in 2022: a first one in February 2022  and a second one in September 2022. The price increase policy aims to guarantee the overall profitability of the solutions of EVS.The erratic components market also forced EVS to extend its delivery periods early 2022 and to change the supply chain approach. However  as most components suffer longer lead-times  EVS has pro-actively invested in inventory to ensure these delivery terms are met.EVS has received many awards in 2022  and this for different business dimensions. Ranging from technology awards (Neuron Protect Best of Show Award at the NAB Show)  to Wallonia International Business Awards  to IABM Environmental Sustainability award  to Top Employer Certification 2023.Three years after the PLAYForward strategic exercise that has moved the focus from products to solutions  we can confidently say that this solution driven approach is highly appreciated by our customers and contributes to the differentiation reflected in the order book.TechnologiesDuring 2022  new generation of AI products did surface on the market. EVS continues to invest in the development of specific machine learning algorithms for broadcast specific components and also integrates in parallel existing AI technologies or libraries inside the solution portfolio or the workflows deployed for our customers.EVS also further developed and evangelized this year the concept of “Balanced computing” as the best distribution of the computing workload between on-prem  datacenter and public cloud based on the economic benefits and the technical constraints for a specific workflow. This concept has been well received by the market where some players start to discover the limitations in terms of feature and the significant impact on Total Cost of Ownership for the production of premium events.EVS also currently invests in the development of important solution components that will be later embraced in the different solutions. Thanks to the capability to track the benefits brought by these components in the future  these developments are activated. These developments will contribute to the future sustainable growth of EVS.Corporate topics2022 marks the moment where the Axon acquisition really starts to pay off for EVS. The initial assumptions made in terms of greographical expansion of the market are becoming a reality. Also the developments made to ensure end-to-end integration with EVS products demonstrate the complementarity of this company within the EVS portfolio. It comforts us in our Acquisition strategy and our ability to integrate companies.One of the axes of the PLAYforward strategy is improving our internal way of working. As a company we want to ensure that we have efficient processes in place that promote end-to-end collabration across all our departments. Having an efficient operational back-bone is important in that context. In October 2022  EVS launched a new global ERP system to ensure optimimal functioning of our company. The launch was a success and did not cause any major business interruption: shipping  production and support were active as of day 1. We now have a solid base to continously optimize our processes and ensure an optimal team member and customer experience.Speaking about improved processes  2022 is also the year where we first implemented a systemic listprice adjustment. The market conditions require a clear methodology to offset the impact of rising component prices and increasing inflation over labour costs. EVS now evaluates the need for price adjustments twice a year to protect the margin generation of the company.2022 is also the year where we continue to expand our sustainability efforts in terms of ESG. After a first hollistic report published in 2021  we continue to structure our efforts in terms of sustainability. Our current ESG strategy and reporting has already received postive feedback from the market: we received a silver medal from Ecovadis  obtained encouriging score from other rating companies and recently obtained the certification of Top Employer for 2023. By the end of 2022  we also realized our first EVS Carbon Footprint analysis: it provides us not only insight on our direct and indirect CO2 emissions  but most importantly  helps us to define our roadmap to reduce our carbon footprint in the future.EVS also reinvented the way it collaborates with its channel partners. A structured channel partner program has been developed  focused on sustainable relationships with partners more than on opportunistic market responses  starting to develop certification paths and clear objectives. This program allows EVS to reach a broader set of clients and even penetrate new markets.Being a company in growth mode  EVS further invested in additional team members. Additional resources were primarily allocated to support and operations roles  as to fuel our future growth  and some research and development resources  as to staff some important developments ensuring future growth. Thanks to a strong employer branding  EVS was able to attract this high number of talents in a relatively short time frame.Also to support our future growth ambition  EVS further strengthened its leadership team  early 2022. A new CTO  Alex Redfern  was welcomed and Xavier Orri was named EVP of Projects & Operations.Revenue in 2H22 and FY22In 2H22  EVS revenue reached EUR 80 5 million: an increase of EUR 4 7 million or 6 2% compared to 2H21  despite a drop of EUR 4 2 million on Big Event Rentals.At constant currency  revenue decreased by 1.6% YoY.Revenue – EUR millions 2H22 2H21 2H22/2H21 Total reported 80 5 75 8 6 0% Total at constant currency 74 7 75 8 -1.6% Total at constant currency and excluding big event rentals 70 5 66 8 5.6%For the full year 2022  EVS revenue reached EUR 148 2 million: an increase of EUR 10 6 million or 7 7% compared to 2021  despite a drop of EUR 3 7 million on Big Event Rentals and despite an increased delivery term announced early 2022. This performance demonstrates the organic growth realized in 2022.At constant currency  revenue increased by 3 5% YoY.Revenue – EUR millions FY22 FY21 FY22/FY21 Total reported 148 158 137 578 7 7% Total at constant currency 142 382 137 578 3.5% Total at constant currency and excluding big event rentals 132 532 124 044 6.8%Currency fluctuations primarily impact EVS revenues by the EUR/USD conversion  which can have a significant impact on our results even if EUR/USD fluctuations also impact the cost of our US operations and partially our cost of goods sold.In the second half of the year  (excl. Big Event Rentals) LSP represented 40% (31% in 2H21) of the revenue  LAB 55% (57% in 2H21).Geographically  revenues (excl. Big Event Rentals) are distributed in 2H22 as follows:Europe  Middle East and Africa (EMEA): EUR 39 1 million (EUR 31 7 million in 2H21)EUR 39 1 million (EUR 31 7 million in 2H21) Americas (NALA): EUR 25 9 million (EUR 21 7 million in 2H21)EUR 25 9 million (EUR 21 7 million in 2H21) Asia & Pacific (APAC): EUR 11 3 million (EUR 13 4 million in 2H21)  impacted by the slowdown in the region following COVID implications (primarily in China). The order intake for APAC in 2H22 do recomfort us that this trend can be reversed.Overall 2022 resultsConsolidated gross margin was at 66 7% for FY22  compared to 69 6% in FY21 (-2 9 Pts) explained by different drivers:Important investments in the operations & support department to ensure we continue to deliver quality support all over the world  in line with our growth patterns (representing -1 4 Pts)Impact of the change in solution mix is representing -1.1 Pts following the relative weight of Media Infrastructure in the overall portfolio.Write-off worth EUR 0 7 million linked to bill of material costs  following more granuler inventory reporting thanks to optimized processes in our new ERP (-0 4 Pts)In order to maintain gross profit levels  the impact of cost price increases and inflation have been systematically modeled by corresponding sales price increases. This has resulted primarily in improved margins for our Media Infrastructure and MediaCeption solutions.Operating expenses increased by 11% YoY (remaining below the guidance provided) explained by inflation on labour cost and energy prices and post-COVID spending patterns impacting spend for travel  marketing  … EVS did also invest in additional Research & Development resources in 2022  both through internal engagements as well as external contracts. These additional resources were staffed on 2 important developments  recognized as intangible assets in 2022. The associated spend was therefore capitalised on the balance sheet.Overall EBIT performance is of EUR 31 7 million  generating an EBIT margin of 21 4%.The net profit ends at EUR 31 3 million benefiting from a strong financial income following pro-active cash flow management and low income taxes (EUR 1 4 million compared to EUR 2 8 million last year) resulting from an excess in tax paid in 2021 and various tax latencies linked to prior years.The net profit leads to a fully diluted earnings per share of EUR 2 29 (versus EUR 2 57 in 2021).Overall second half 2022 resultsThe gross profit margin in 2H22 was of 65 9% compared to 70 3% in the same period last year. The drop is a consequence of lesser revenue from Big Event Rentals and a higher weight of Media Infrastructure solution in the overall mix. In addition  the impact of the hirings done in 2022 to ensure continued quality operations and support affect the comparison.Operating expenses grew 13.8% in 2H22  compared to the same period last year and are a reflection of post-COVID spending patterns and impact of inflation.The 2H22 EBIT margin was 19 8%  compared to 28 6% in 2H21: the EBIT margin is dropping primarily following investments in the past 12 months to support our growth pattern.The Group net profit amounted to EUR 15 9 million in 2H22  compared to EUR 19 3 million in 2H21. Fully diluted earnings per share amounted to EUR 1 14 in 2H22 compared to EUR 1 42 in 2H21.Team membersAt the end of 2022  EVS employed 613 team members (FTE). This is an increase by 62 team members compared to the end of 2021 (551 FTE). This increase in team members reflects our continued investments in the growth of EVS. We expect no further growth of our team member base in 2023  and we will ensure that we balance the priorities of EVS with the existing workforce.Balance sheet and cash flow statementEVS continues to have a strong balance sheet with net cash position of EUR 33 8 million with low debt level (of which EUR 12 5 million related to IFRS 16) resulting in a total equity representing 75 4% of the total balance sheet as of the end of 2022. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents (EUR -23 1 million) compared to end of 2021 is mainly driven by the dividends paid in May and November (including exceptional additional dividend)  combined with the increase in working capital requirements at the end of 2022.The working capital requirements are growing  primarily linked to growing trade receivables. The trade receivables evolve largely in line with our overall sales volumes. 71% of our trade receivables is not due at year-end  with a large volume of invoices issued in the second half of the fourth quarter  given a temporary hold of invoicing operations after the Go-Live of our new ERP system. We expect these trade receivales to restore in 1Q23. A sound cash position remains a priority for EVS.Other intangible assets include the costs for internal development capitalized during 2022 according to IAS 38 (Intangible assets).Lands and building mainly include the headquarters in Liège as well as the right of use for the offices abroad (IFRS16).Inventories amount to EUR 28 8 million  an increase of EUR 2 8 million compared to the beginning of the year as a reflection of a pro-active supply chain management to ensure we systematically meet our customers’ delivery terms.Liabilities include EUR 15 3 million of financial debt (including long term and short-term portion)  mainly related to the lease liabilities for EUR 12 5 million and borrowings for EUR 2 8 million. Long-term provisions include the provision for technical warranty on EVS products for labor and parts. Other amounts payable mainly represent deferred income and advance payments received from customers on contracts in progress.Net cash from operating activities amounts to EUR 11 0 million for the full year 2022  compared to EUR 38 7 million in 2021. The decrease is mainly driven by higher working capital requirements resulting from higher trade receivables (as described above) and lower trade payables  combined with lower net profit. On December 31  2022  cash and cash equivalents total EUR 49 1 million  compared to EUR 72 1 million at the end of 2021. The decrease is mainly driven by lower cash from operating activities  combined with the increase of the net cash used in investing activities mainly due to the investments in intangible and tangible assets (specifically in the internal development of intangible assets) together with the increase of the net cash used in financing activities following the higher amount of dividends distributed during 2022  including the exceptional dividend.At the end of December 2022  there were 14.327.024 EVS shares outstanding  of which 908.014 were owned by the company. At the same date  492.975 warrants were outstanding with average exercise price of EUR 16 95 and maturities between October 2026 and September 2028.Corporate updateThere has been no further change to the composition of the Board of Directors since the last General Assembly on May 17th during which the shareholders had appointed two new directors  Frédéric Vincent and Marco Miserez  both for a period of 4 years.

The accounting framework and standards adopted by the European Commission can be accessed through the following link on the website: http://ec.europa.eu/finance/company-reporting/index_en.htm.The condensed interim financial statements of the Group for the 12 month-period ending December 31  2022  were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on February 16  2023. This interim report only provides an explanation of events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in financial position and reporting since the last annual reporting period and should therefore be read in conjunction with the full 2022 consolidated financial statements from which these condensed financial statements have been derived and which are planned to be published on EVS Group’s website by April 14  2023. The interim condensed financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.NOTE 5.2.1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODSThese condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting  as issued by the IASB  and as adopted by the EU. The accounting policies and methods adopted for the preparation of the company's IFRS consolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the 2021 consolidated financial statements. The company’s IFRS accounting policies and methods are available in the 2021 annual report on www.evs.com  except for the accounting policy on intangible assets which include the capitalization of development cost for the first time (see note 5.10) as well as the new  amended or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC Interpretations that have been in effect since January 1  2022. The adoption of these new  amended or revised pronouncements did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.NOTE 5.2.2: JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATESImpacts of current market volatility and macroeconomic developmentsThe impacts of the current market volatility and macroeconomic developments were taken into account by the company to assess potential effects on EVS’s financial performance and the valuation of its assets and liabilities. In particular  key assumptions used in the calculation of the pension obligations have been reviewed to ensure a proper valuation as per 31 December 2022. Also  the key assumptions that are used for estimating the recoverable amounts of cash generating units in the context of goodwill impairment test reflect latest market conditions for interest rates and weighted average cost of capitalEstimation of useful life and residual valueProperty  Plant and Equipment are depreciated using a straight-line method to allocate their depreciable amount on a systematic basis over their useful life. For the headquarter building in Liège  the depreciable amount is the cost less its estimated residual value. Useful life and residual value of an asset is estimated on a realistic basis based on the experience of the Group with similar assets and reviewed on a regular basis. The effect of changes in useful life are recognized prospectively.Functional currency of the Group entitiesThe individual financial statements of each subsidiary are prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. When the factors set out by IAS 21 to determine the functional currency are mixed and the functional currency is not obvious  management judgment is used to determine which functional currency most faithfully represents the economic effects of its underlying transactions  events and conditions. The functional currency of the EVS Group entities is EUR except for the US entity EVS Inc. for which US Dollar is assessed by management to be the functional currency.Claims and contingent liabilitiesRelated to claims and contingencies  judgement is necessary in assessing the existence of an obligation resulting from a past event  in assessing the probability of an economic outflow  and in quantifying the probable outcome of economic resources. This judgment is reviewed when new information becomes available and often with support of internal and external expert advice.Impact of the war in Ukraine on our activitiesGiven the nature and location of its operations and the fact that EVS does not currently have activities in Russia nor in Ukraine or with Russian companies  The Company does not foresee a direct impact of the Ukrainian conflict on its business.NOTE 5.3: SEGMENT REPORTINGFrom an operational point of view  the company is vertically integrated with the majority of its staff located in the headquarters in Belgium  including the R&D  production  marketing and administration departments. Therefore the majority of investments and costs are located at the level of the Belgian parent company. Resources securing the customer facing interactions such as sales  operations and support profiles are primarily hired within the respective regions. The foreign subsidiaries are primarily sales and representative offices. The Chief Operating Decision Maker  being the Executive Committee  reviews the operating results  operating plans  and makes resource allocation decisions on a company-wide basis. Revenue related to products of the same nature (digital broadcast production equipment) are realized by commercial polyvalent teams. The company’s internal reporting is the reflection of the above-mentioned operational organization and is characterized by the strong integration of the activities of the company.By consequence  the company is composed of one segment according to the IFRS 8 definition  and the consolidated income statement of the Group reflects this unique segment. All long-term assets are located in the parent company EVS Broadcast Equipment SA in Belgium.The company provides one class of business defined as solutions based on tapeless workflows with a consistent modular architecture. There are no other significant classes of business  either singularly or in aggregate. Identical modules can meet the needs of different markets  and our customers themselves are often multi-markets. Providing information for each module is therefore not relevant for EVS.At the geographical level  our activities are divided into the following regions: Asia-Pacific (“APAC”)  Europe  Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”)  and America (“NALA”). This division follows the organization of the commercial and support services within the Group  which operates worldwide. A fourth region is dedicated to the worldwide events (“big event rentals”).The company provides additional information with a presentation of the revenue by market pillar: “Live Service provider”  “Live Audience Business” and “Big Event Rentals” for rental contracts relating to the big sporting events.Finally  sales are presented by nature: systems and services.5.3.1.

The expense recorded in the consolidated income statement amounts to EUR 329k in 2022.NOTE 5.5: DIVIDENDSThe Ordinary General Meeting of May 17  2022  approved the payment of a total gross dividend of EUR 1.50 per share for the year 2021  which includes EUR 0.50 per share exceptional dividend to honor past commitments on dividend payout.For the year 2022  an interim dividend of EUR 0.50 per share was paid in November 2022. Full year dividend of EUR 1 60 per share will be proposed to the Ordinary General Meeting of shareholders  which also includes EUR 0.50 per share exceptional dividend to honor past commitments on dividend payout.(EUR thousands  gross) # Coupon Declaration date 2022 2021 - Final dividend for 2020(EUR 0 50 per share excl. treasury shares) 30 May 2021 - 6.699 - Interim dividend for 2021(EUR 0 50 per share excl. treasury shares) 31 Nov. 2021 - 6.701 - Final dividend for 2021 (incl. exceptional dividend)(EUR 1 00 per share excl. treasury shares) 32 May 2022 13.402 - Interim dividend for 2022(EUR 0 50 per share excl. treasury shares) 33 Nov. 2022 6.710 Total paid dividends 20.112 13.400A new dividend guidance for upcoming years has been issued early 2022 and is as follows*:In € per share per fiscal year 2022 2023 2024 Base dividend 1 10 1 10 1 10 Exceptional additional dividend 0 50 0 00 0 00 Total dividend 1 60 1 10 1 10*subject to market conditions and to the approval of the Ordinary General Meeting of ShareholdersNOTE 5.6: OTHER NET FINANCIAL INCOME / (EXPENSES)(EUR thousands) FY22 FY21 - Exchange results 1.393 1.117 - Fair value variation of financial instruments 324 -7 - Other financial results 76 144 Other net financial income / (expenses) 1.793 1.254The functional currency of EVS Broadcast Equipment SA as well as all subsidiaries is the Euro  except for EVS Inc. subsidiary in the USA whose functional currency is the US dollar. Entity Axon Digital Design LTD. in the UK changed functional currency from GBP to EUR starting as of July 1st 2022  following updated Management assesment driven by new implementation of EUR invoicing at the affiliate. The presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements of EVS Group is the Euro. For more information on exchange rates  see also the note 5.9. The favourable exchange result is mainly explained by the appreciation of USD vs. EUR in the period.The estimated fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are equal to their fair book values in the balance sheet.Since 2022  EVS systematically measures the Group’s anticipated exposure to transactional exchange risk  mainly relating to the EUR/USD risk. Given the Group has a long position in USD and based on revenue forecasts  EVS hedges future USD net inflows through forward or option foreign exchange contracts. The change in the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts is recorded directly to the income statement since the Group does not apply hedge accounting on these transactions. The valuation techniques used are mainly based on spot rates  forward rates and interest rate curves.On December 31  2022  the Group holds EUR/USD FX forward and option contracts for a total notional amount of USD 34 0 million with monthly maturities between January 2023 and June 2024. The fair value of those financial instruments on December 31  2022 amounts to EUR 0 3 million.NOTE 5.7: INCOME TAX EXPENSE(EUR thousands) FY22 FY21 - Current tax expense -569 -1.245 - Deferred tax expense -853 -1.552 Income tax expense -1.422 -2.797Income tax expense amounts to EUR 1 4 million for the full year 2022  compared to EUR 2 8 million in 2021. The decrease is mainly explained by lower taxable profit  tax relief of EUR 0 6 million received in December 2022 and decrease of the deferred tax expenses due to lower consumption of recoverable tax latencies (EUR 1 2 million in 2022 compared to 8 6 million in 2021).The effective tax rate for the period ended on December 31  2022 is 4 3%  compared to 7 5% in 2021.NOTE 5.8: HEADCOUNT(in full time equivalents) At December 31 2022 613 2021 551 Variation +62NOTE 5.9: EXCHANGE RATESThe main exchange rates that influence the consolidated financial accounts are USD/EUR and GBP/EUR which were considered as follows:Exchange rate USD/EUR Average FY At December 31 2022 1 0537 1 0666 2021 1 1830 1 1326 Variation -10 9% -5 8%Exchange rate GBP/EUR Average FY At December 31 2022 0 8527 0 8869 2021 0 8599 0 8403 Variation -0 7% 5 5%NOTE 5.10: INTANGIBLE ASSETSDuring 2022  intangible assets increased by EUR 7 1 million due to capitalization of internal development costs of EUR 8 4 million less depreciations of EUR 1 3 million.The capitalized costs during 2022 include mainly the internal personnel costs and external consultants’ costs. These costs are only related to the development phase of 2 important projects that should secure future growth for EVS.At the beginning of the period  the Group identified internal development projects  that for the first time of EVS Broadcast Equipment’s history fulfilled all the conditions to be capitalized according to IAS 38 Intangible assets. This ability arises after the implementation of extensive business cases  where R&D together with the solutions and sales departments perform an end-to-end exercise whereby objectives  costs  market analysis and return are clearly identified.These internal development projects consist of software that will be commercialized at the end of the development period (expected return on investment is scheduled for 2024). These 2 projects complement the PLAYForward strategy of the Group. The progress of these internal developments is monitored frequently as to ensure the future economic benefit remains assured.We refer to H1 2022 press release for the update of the accounting policy 2.11 related to the intagible assets applicable as of fiscal year 2022 and that replaces the accounting policy disclosed in 2021 annual report.NOTE 5.11: TANGIBLE ASSETSThe decrease of lands and buildings of EUR -2 1 million during 2022 is mainly explained by the depreciation of the period partially offset by investments in progress of EUR 0 5 million. The increase in other tangible assets of EUR 0 4 million is mainly driven by investments in office and IT equipment of EUR 1 1 million  net of the depreciation of the year of EUR 0 7 million.NOTE 5.12: FINANCIAL LIABILITIES(EUR thousands) 2022 2021 Long term financial debts Bank loans 1.675 2.779 Long term lease liabilities 9.853 10.775 Amount due within 12 months (shown under current liabilities) Bank loans 1.105 1.095 Short term lease liabilities 2.645 2.633 Total financial debt (short and long-term) 15.278 17.282 The total financial debt is repayable as follows: - within one year 3.750 3.728 - after one year but no more than five 8.676 9.673 - more than five years 2.852 3.881In June 2020  a loan of EUR 5 5 million was put in place with BNP Paribas Fortis to partially finance the acquisition of Axon. The repayment schedule foresees first repayment of EUR 0 6 million in 2020 and annual installments of EUR 1 1 million between 2021 and 2024  with final repayment of EUR 0 6 million in 2025 at loan maturity.For full year 2022  lease liabilities variation includes repayment of EUR 2 5 million  excluding interest of EUR 0 4 million.In June 2020  a roll over credit line of EUR 5 0 million was put in place with Belfius bank to partially finance the acquisition of Axon. This amortizing credit line will end at the latest on 30/06/2025. As of this date  EVS has not used this credit facility.NOTE 5.13: OTHER LIABILITIES - PENSIONOther long-term liabilities mainly correspond to pension obligations. Changes recorded in 2022 in the Belgian pension defined benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were as follows:(EUR thousands) 2022 2021 Defined benefit obligation Fair value of plan assets Net defined benefit liability Defined benefit obligation Fair value of plan assets Net defined benefit liability As of January 1 10.587 -8.762 1.825 8.670 -7.686 984 Service cost 1.156 1.156 1.398 1.398 Administrative costs 28 28 18 18 Net interest expenses 120 -106 14 41 -38 3 Sub-total included in profit or loss 1.276 -78 1.198 1.439 -20 1.419 Benefits paid -179 179 0 -141 141 0 Return on plan assets -153 -153 -106 -106 Actuarial changes (assumptions) of which: Arising from changes in demographic assumptions 235 235 0 Arising from changes in financial assumptions -1.349 -1.349 -1.172 -1.172 Arising from experience adjustments -367 -350 -717 1.791 -69 1.722 Sub-total included in OCI -1.481 -350 -1.831 619 -69 550 Contributions by employer -1.078 -1.078 -1.128 -1.128 As of December 31 10.203 -10.089 114 10.587 -8.762 1.825The decrease in the net defined benefit liability of EUR -1 7 million is mainly driven by actuarial changes included in OCI arising from changes in financial assumptions of EUR -1 3 million (mainly increase in discount rate from 1 15% to 3 80%) and from experience adjustments of EUR -0 7 million  combined with employer contributions in the period of EUR -1 1 million and partially offset by service cost recorded in income statement of EUR 1 2 million.The main assumptions used for the actuarial valuation are as follows:Salary increase for financial year 2022 of 14 5% (5 7% in 2021)Discount rate p.a. of 3 8% (1 15% in 2021)Long term salary increase (inflation included) p.a. of 2 4% (2 1% in 2021)NOTE 5.14: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIESThe Group enters into derivative transactions  principally forward and option currency contracts  with the purpose to secure its sales and purchases in foreign currencies against negative variations of these currencies. The Group has transactional currency exposure arising from sales or purchases by operating entities in currencies other than the Group’s functional currency. Foreign currency risk is described in note 5.14.1.The Group’s main financial instruments  other than derivatives  comprise bank loans  finance leases  cash and short-term deposits. The purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors  which arise directly from its operations. The Group’s policy is  and has always been  that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. Credit risk is described in note 5.14.2.5.14.1 FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKSince 2022  EVS systematically measures the Group’s anticipated exposure to transactional exchange risk over six to eighteen months. In its current structure  the Group’s exposure is mainly linked to the EUR/USD risk. The Group invoices all clients in Euro  except in the United States where invoices are denominated in USD. Since the majority of operating expenses are denominated in Euro  the Group has a long position in USD  i.e. all of the Group’s activities generate globally a positive net cash flow in USD.On the basis of the forecasts and according to the market conditions  the Group hedges a portion of the exchange rate risk on estimated net future flows  mainly through foreign exchange forward and option contracts. EVS does not apply hedge accounting according to IAS 39 for those transactions.Foreign exchange contracts are revalued at each closing date at their market value. The generated exchange rate profit or loss is recorded in the “Other net financial income/(charges)” account in the consolidated income statement. The valuation techniques used are mainly based on spot rates  forward rates and interest rate curves. Details of fair value at closing date are presented in note 5.6.5.14.2 CREDIT RISKCredit exposure is controlled and reviewed regularly by the management.Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers  spread across many geographical areas. The evolution of the credit risk is monitored permanently. As of December 31  2022  it is assumed that the carrying amounts of those trade receivables are the most appropriate estimate to the fair value of those assets.The credit risk on financial instruments is contained as it is spread over a selection of different counterparties which are financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.As of December 31  2022  the maximum amount the Group could have to pay if guarantees are called on is EUR 0 8 million (similar to EUR 0 8 million in December 2021).NOTE 5.15: SUBSEQUENT EVENTSThere are no subsequent events that may have a material impact on the condensed financial statements of the Group.NOTE 5.16: RISK AND UNCERTAINTIESInvesting in the stock of EVS involves risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties relating to the current year are similar to the risks and uncertainties that have been identified by the management of the company and that are listed in the management report of the annual report (available at www.evs.com).In terms of new risks arising since the last annual report we highlight the macro-economic environment that drives energy prices  components prices and labour cost to higher levels. EVS closely monitors the developments in this area and pro-actively takes actions to keep these rising costs under control or to minimize their effect on the profitability of the company. We also reiterate the potential impacts following the war in Ukraine. The company continues to comply with the sanction screening in vigor.Certification of responsible personsSerge Van Herck  CEO*Veerle De Wit  CFO*Certify that  based on their knowledge a) the condensed financial statements  prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the European Union  fairly present in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of the issuer and the companies included in the consolidation b) the Directors’ report fairly presents the important events and related parties transactions of 2022  including their impact on the condensed financial statements  and a description of the existing risks and uncertainties for the remaining months of the fiscal year.* acting on behalf of a BVExternal AuditorThe condensed consolidated financial statements of EVS Broadcast SA for the year ending December 31  2022 were authorized of issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors on February 16  2023.

All the fundamentals for topline performance are strong: EVS realizes a record-high order intake and achieves a historical revenue number  despite the increased delivery terms in 2022. EVS is able to demonstrate a strong net profit result and as a consequence  realizes a solid Earnings Per Share. FY22 Highlights Record order intake at EUR 218 8 million  growing 46 5% YoY.Revenue performance in line with expectations at EUR 148 2 million  growing 7 7% vs. FY21 despite increased delivery terms announced early 2022 and despite reduced Big Event Rental (BER) activity. The growth is realized through strong growth in North America and in the MediaInfra solution.Controlled OPEX growth  in line with market expectations.Healthy net profit at EUR 31 3 million driven by a strong financial income performance and a one-off benefit in taxes  resulting in fully diluted earnings per share of EUR 2 29. 2H22 Highlights Record order intake of EUR 130 1 million (including Big Tech 2022 contract).Revenue for the second half of 2022 at EUR 80 5 million  growing 6 1% compared to the same period last year. Big Event Rental revenue at EUR 4 2 million  down EUR 4 9 million compared to 2H21. Revenue excluding Big Event Rental at EUR 76 3 million  growing EUR 9 5 million.Net profit amounts to EUR 15 9 million  leading to fully diluted earnings per share of EUR 1 14.Outlook 2023 The important order intake of 2022 has considerably fueled the order book to be delivered in future periods. The total order book at the end of 2022 is of EUR 141 8 million  growing 122% compared to last year. The order book reserved for 2023 is estimated at EUR 85 9 million  growing 68 4% compared to beginning of the year 2022.Based on the order book and current market dynamics  the revenue guidance for the year 2023 is set at EUR 145-155 million.The revenue range demonstrates the ambition of EVS to continue the organic growth  in a year with no Big Event Rental revenue.With the growth engine launched  the focus in 2023 for EVS will be on profitable growth.EVS plans no further growth in team members nor do we expect an increase in our capital expenditure envelope.We expect to pay out dividends in 2023 in line with our dividend policy  namely a base dividend per share of EUR 1 10.

Our PlayForward strategy  as defined at the end of 2019  is starting to deliver the expected growth momentum. In 2022  we had a second record year in a row  with strong growth in revenues  order intake  and team member size. We showed significant growth in North America  announced our largest contract ever in August with the ""Big Tech 22 contract” worth over 50MioUSD  and successfully fought against inflation and component shortages throughout the year. We feel we are winning market share in our Live Audience Business and protecting our position in the Live Service Providers markets. We successfully supported many of our customers in delivering the live TV production of major sports events in Asia  the Middle East  and North America. The growth of our team is clearly unlocking our sustainable growth ambitions. Our strong employer branding has enabled us to successfully hire strong talent across the world. Our team member engagement survey shows again further improvements compared to the years before  resulting in our recent “Top Employer” certification. We are making good progress in our vision of developing a strong ecosystem relying on our VIA platform as we are successfully moving from product to solution sales. Our introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in XtraMotion is a revolution in the industry and it represents a major differentiator. The Axon acquisition in May 2020 has translated into our Media Infrastructure revenue growth and positively contributes to our bottom line  demonstrating our capability to execute successfully large acquisitions. We have also launched our new ERP and upgraded our VIA Portal applications such as our customer ticketing system to support our long-term growth ambitions. In line with our commitments  we continued to deliver strong dividends for our shareholders. Our sustainability strategy has started to deliver strong results aligned with our customer’s expectations  and resulting in good ESG ratings like the Ecovadis Silver medal. We completed our first carbon footprint analysis: this will be a critical management tool for taking the right sustainability decisions in the future. In conclusion  our PlayForward strategy  is clearly being appreciated by our customers and channel partners. This is helping us to get back into growth mode. While economic market conditions remain very challenging with high inflation  component shortages and with the war in Ukraine  we feel that our customers increasingly appreciate the reliability  performance and innovative edge of our solutions and services. Our ambition for the next years is to continue to deliver growth on both our top and bottomline. We are convinced that by focusing on cost control we will be able to deliver upon this promise.” Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said: “Our 2022 revenue results clearly demonstrate our ability to achieve organic growth. Even despite increased delivery terms  announced early 2022  and with a declining Big Event Rental revenue  we are able to realize a strong top line performance. All indicators lead us to conclude that this organic growth is here to stay: the revenue performance  together with the strong secured revenue position for 2023  are a solid basis to continue our growth path. Being a company in growth mode  means that the necessary resources need to be invested to support this growth: 2022 has been a year where we invested in additional resources  in new product developments  and in the back-bone of our operations. This backbone  a globally released new ERP system  has allowed us to optimize our processes and refine our cost control. As a result  the granularity of our reporting is improving  which has led to a decision to write off EUR 0 7 million of Bill of Material costs in 4Q22. Our operational expenses grew in a controlled way. Control over our spending patterns remains an attention point for 2023  especially in the current volatile market. Thanks to sound treasury management and tax benefits  we are able to generate a strong Net Profit worth EUR 31 3 million  driving a diluted Earnings Per Share of EUR 2 29. Our balance sheet also remains healthy with a very low debt level and a sound cash position. Our cash position is declining throughout 2022  as a consequence of high dividends paid  and as a consequence on increased Net Working Capital requirements. The impact on Net Working Capital is temporary: the implementation of the new ERP system has created a delay in invoicing in the fourth quarter – the quarter with the highest volume – resulting in a large volume of receivables not due at the end of 2022. This is a temporary effect  that will normalize early in 2023  as soon as the invoices become due. Based on the strong results for the year 2022  we are able to maintain our dividend policy defined earlier in 2022.” Market & customers The record high numbers in terms of revenues  order intake and order book translate the market traction that EVS is living. Our main growth drivers are North America and Media Infrastructure. The performance of our MediaInfra solution clearly demonstrates the power of our acquisition strategy. It is the fruit of our investment in Axon in 2020  and this acquisition demonstrates its return on investment 2 years later. The high order intake is also thanks to our biggest contract signed in the history of EVS: our Big Tech 2022. This contract proved an exceptional milestone in the history of EVS. This contract is a 10-year agreement that covers the delivery of EVS’ live production  replay and highlight solutions LiveCeption®  combined with a long-term services level agreement. The contract provides our US based customer access to the latest technology innovations for the next 10 years  a full upgrade of its installed base  a predictable operational spend and an ease of operations. 2022 was a year with important Big Events  that EVS was able to support successfully. New solutions  like MediaHub and MediaInfra Strada  were introduced in our Big Event Rental business with success. Market conditions have been challenging throughout the year  with volatile interest rates  inflation and a continued erratic components market. This volatile market has urged EVS to implement a systemic price increase policy. Twice a year the sales prices are evaluated based on the underlying cost for components and inflation of labour cost. EVS has introduced 2 price increases in 2022: a first one in February 2022  and a second one in September 2022. The price increase policy aims to guarantee the overall profitability of the solutions of EVS. The erratic components market also forced EVS to extend its delivery periods early 2022 and to change the supply chain approach. However  as most components suffer longer lead-times  EVS has pro-actively invested in inventory to ensure these delivery terms are met. EVS has received many awards in 2022  and this for different business dimensions. Ranging from technology awards (Neuron Protect Best of Show Award at the NAB Show)  to Wallonia International Business Awards  to IABM Environmental Sustainability award  to Top Employer Certification 2023. Three years after the PLAYForward strategic exercise that has moved the focus from products to solutions  we can confidently say that this solution driven approach is highly appreciated by our customers and contributes to the differentiation reflected in the order book. Technologies During 2022  new generation of AI products did surface on the market. EVS continues to invest in the development of specific machine learning algorithms for broadcast specific components and also integrates in parallel existing AI technologies or libraries inside the solution portfolio or the workflows deployed for our customers. EVS also further developed and evangelized this year the concept of “Balanced computing” as the best distribution of the computing workload between on-prem  datacenter and public cloud based on the economic benefits and the technical constraints for a specific workflow. This concept has been well received by the market where some players start to discover the limitations in terms of feature and the significant impact on Total Cost of Ownership for the production of premium events. EVS also currently invests in the development of important solution components that will be later embraced in the different solutions. Thanks to the capability to track the benefits brought by these components in the future  these developments are activated. These developments will contribute to the future sustainable growth of EVS. Corporate topics 2022 marks the moment where the Axon acquisition really starts to pay off for EVS. The initial assumptions made in terms of greographical expansion of the market are becoming a reality. Also the developments made to ensure end-to-end integration with EVS products demonstrate the complementarity of this company within the EVS portfolio. It comforts us in our Acquisition strategy and our ability to integrate companies. One of the axes of the PLAYforward strategy is improving our internal way of working. As a company we want to ensure that we have efficient processes in place that promote end-to-end collabration across all our departments. Having an efficient operational back-bone is important in that context. In October 2022  EVS launched a new global ERP system to ensure optimimal functioning of our company. The launch was a success and did not cause any major business interruption: shipping  production and support were active as of day 1. We now have a solid base to continously optimize our processes and ensure an optimal team member and customer experience. Speaking about improved processes  2022 is also the year where we first implemented a systemic listprice adjustment. The market conditions require a clear methodology to offset the impact of rising component prices and increasing inflation over labour costs. EVS now evaluates the need for price adjustments twice a year to protect the margin generation of the company. 2022 is also the year where we continue to expand our sustainability efforts in terms of ESG. After a first hollistic report published in 2021  we continue to structure our efforts in terms of sustainability. Our current ESG strategy and reporting has already received postive feedback from the market: we received a silver medal from Ecovadis  obtained encouriging score from other rating companies and recently obtained the certification of Top Employer for 2023. By the end of 2022  we also realized our first EVS Carbon Footprint analysis: it provides us not only insight on our direct and indirect CO2 emissions  but most importantly  helps us to define our roadmap to reduce our carbon footprint in the future. EVS also reinvented the way it collaborates with its channel partners. A structured channel partner program has been developed  focused on sustainable relationships with partners more than on opportunistic market responses  starting to develop certification paths and clear objectives. This program allows EVS to reach a broader set of clients and even penetrate new markets. Being a company in growth mode  EVS further invested in additional team members. Additional resources were primarily allocated to support and operations roles  as to fuel our future growth  and some research and development resources  as to staff some important developments ensuring future growth. Thanks to a strong employer branding  EVS was able to attract this high number of talents in a relatively short time frame. Also to support our future growth ambition  EVS further strengthened its leadership team  early 2022. A new CTO  Alex Redfern  was welcomed and Xavier Orri was named EVP of Projects & Operations. Revenue in 2H22 and FY22 In 2H22  EVS revenue reached EUR 80 5 million: an increase of EUR 4 7 million or 6 2% compared to 2H21  despite a drop of EUR 4 2 million on Big Event Rentals.

Big Event Rentals) are distributed in 2H22 as follows: Europe  Middle East and Africa (EMEA): EUR 39 1 million (EUR 31 7 million in 2H21)EUR 39 1 million (EUR 31 7 million in 2H21) Americas (NALA): EUR 25 9 million (EUR 21 7 million in 2H21)EUR 25 9 million (EUR 21 7 million in 2H21) Asia & Pacific (APAC): EUR 11 3 million (EUR 13 4 million in 2H21)  impacted by the slowdown in the region following COVID implications (primarily in China). The order intake for APAC in 2H22 do recomfort us that this trend can be reversed.Overall 2022 results Consolidated gross margin was at 66 7% for FY22  compared to 69 6% in FY21 (-2 9 Pts) explained by different drivers: Important investments in the operations & support department to ensure we continue to deliver quality support all over the world  in line with our growth patterns (representing -1 4 Pts)Impact of the change in solution mix is representing -1.1 Pts following the relative weight of Media Infrastructure in the overall portfolio.Write-off worth EUR 0 7 million linked to bill of material costs  following more granuler inventory reporting thanks to optimized processes in our new ERP (-0 4 Pts)In order to maintain gross profit levels  the impact of cost price increases and inflation have been systematically modeled by corresponding sales price increases. This has resulted primarily in improved margins for our Media Infrastructure and MediaCeption solutions. Operating expenses increased by 11% YoY (remaining below the guidance provided) explained by inflation on labour cost and energy prices and post-COVID spending patterns impacting spend for travel  marketing  … EVS did also invest in additional Research & Development resources in 2022  both through internal engagements as well as external contracts. These additional resources were staffed on 2 important developments  recognized as intangible assets in 2022. The associated spend was therefore capitalised on the balance sheet. Overall EBIT performance is of EUR 31 7 million  generating an EBIT margin of 21 4%. The net profit ends at EUR 31 3 million benefiting from a strong financial income following pro-active cash flow management and low income taxes (EUR 1 4 million compared to EUR 2 8 million last year) resulting from an excess in tax paid in 2021 and various tax latencies linked to prior years. The net profit leads to a fully diluted earnings per share of EUR 2 29 (versus EUR 2 57 in 2021). Overall second half 2022 results The gross profit margin in 2H22 was of 65 9% compared to 70 3% in the same period last year. The drop is a consequence of lesser revenue from Big Event Rentals and a higher weight of Media Infrastructure solution in the overall mix. In addition  the impact of the hirings done in 2022 to ensure continued quality operations and support affect the comparison. Operating expenses grew 13.8% in 2H22  compared to the same period last year and are a reflection of post-COVID spending patterns and impact of inflation. The 2H22 EBIT margin was 19 8%  compared to 28 6% in 2H21: the EBIT margin is dropping primarily following investments in the past 12 months to support our growth pattern. The Group net profit amounted to EUR 15 9 million in 2H22  compared to EUR 19 3 million in 2H21. Fully diluted earnings per share amounted to EUR 1 14 in 2H22 compared to EUR 1 42 in 2H21. Team members At the end of 2022  EVS employed 613 team members (FTE). This is an increase by 62 team members compared to the end of 2021 (551 FTE). This increase in team members reflects our continued investments in the growth of EVS. We expect no further growth of our team member base in 2023  and we will ensure that we balance the priorities of EVS with the existing workforce. Balance sheet and cash flow statement EVS continues to have a strong balance sheet with net cash position of EUR 33 8 million with low debt level (of which EUR 12 5 million related to IFRS 16) resulting in a total equity representing 75 4% of the total balance sheet as of the end of 2022. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents (EUR -23 1 million) compared to end of 2021 is mainly driven by the dividends paid in May and November (including exceptional additional dividend)  combined with the increase in working capital requirements at the end of 2022. The working capital requirements are growing  primarily linked to growing trade receivables. The trade receivables evolve largely in line with our overall sales volumes. 71% of our trade receivables is not due at year-end  with a large volume of invoices issued in the second half of the fourth quarter  given a temporary hold of invoicing operations after the Go-Live of our new ERP system. We expect these trade receivales to restore in 1Q23. A sound cash position remains a priority for EVS. Other intangible assets include the costs for internal development capitalized during 2022 according to IAS 38 (Intangible assets). Lands and building mainly include the headquarters in Liège as well as the right of use for the offices abroad (IFRS16). Inventories amount to EUR 28 8 million  an increase of EUR 2 8 million compared to the beginning of the year as a reflection of a pro-active supply chain management to ensure we systematically meet our customers’ delivery terms. Liabilities include EUR 15 3 million of financial debt (including long term and short-term portion)  mainly related to the lease liabilities for EUR 12 5 million and borrowings for EUR 2 8 million. Long-term provisions include the provision for technical warranty on EVS products for labor and parts. Other amounts payable mainly represent deferred income and advance payments received from customers on contracts in progress. Net cash from operating activities amounts to EUR 11 0 million for the full year 2022  compared to EUR 38 7 million in 2021. The decrease is mainly driven by higher working capital requirements resulting from higher trade receivables (as described above) and lower trade payables  combined with lower net profit. On December 31  2022  cash and cash equivalents total EUR 49 1 million  compared to EUR 72 1 million at the end of 2021. The decrease is mainly driven by lower cash from operating activities  combined with the increase of the net cash used in investing activities mainly due to the investments in intangible and tangible assets (specifically in the internal development of intangible assets) together with the increase of the net cash used in financing activities following the higher amount of dividends distributed during 2022  including the exceptional dividend. At the end of December 2022  there were 14.327.024 EVS shares outstanding  of which 908.014 were owned by the company. At the same date  492.975 warrants were outstanding with average exercise price of EUR 16 95 and maturities between October 2026 and September 2028.

The accounting framework and standards adopted by the European Commission can be accessed through the following link on the website: http://ec.europa.eu/finance/company-reporting/index_en.htm. The condensed interim financial statements of the Group for the 12 month-period ending December 31  2022  were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on February 16  2023. This interim report only provides an explanation of events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in financial position and reporting since the last annual reporting period and should therefore be read in conjunction with the full 2022 consolidated financial statements from which these condensed financial statements have been derived and which are planned to be published on EVS Group’s website by April 14  2023. The interim condensed financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. NOTE 5.2.1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS These condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting  as issued by the IASB  and as adopted by the EU. The accounting policies and methods adopted for the preparation of the company's IFRS consolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the 2021 consolidated financial statements. The company’s IFRS accounting policies and methods are available in the 2021 annual report on www.evs.com  except for the accounting policy on intangible assets which include the capitalization of development cost for the first time (see note 5.10) as well as the new  amended or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC Interpretations that have been in effect since January 1  2022. The adoption of these new  amended or revised pronouncements did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. NOTE 5.2.2: JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES Impacts of current market volatility and macroeconomic developmentsThe impacts of the current market volatility and macroeconomic developments were taken into account by the company to assess potential effects on EVS’s financial performance and the valuation of its assets and liabilities. In particular  key assumptions used in the calculation of the pension obligations have been reviewed to ensure a proper valuation as per 31 December 2022. Also  the key assumptions that are used for estimating the recoverable amounts of cash generating units in the context of goodwill impairment test reflect latest market conditions for interest rates and weighted average cost of capital Estimation of useful life and residual valueProperty  Plant and Equipment are depreciated using a straight-line method to allocate their depreciable amount on a systematic basis over their useful life. For the headquarter building in Liège  the depreciable amount is the cost less its estimated residual value. Useful life and residual value of an asset is estimated on a realistic basis based on the experience of the Group with similar assets and reviewed on a regular basis. The effect of changes in useful life are recognized prospectively. Functional currency of the Group entitiesThe individual financial statements of each subsidiary are prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. When the factors set out by IAS 21 to determine the functional currency are mixed and the functional currency is not obvious  management judgment is used to determine which functional currency most faithfully represents the economic effects of its underlying transactions  events and conditions. The functional currency of the EVS Group entities is EUR except for the US entity EVS Inc. for which US Dollar is assessed by management to be the functional currency. Claims and contingent liabilitiesRelated to claims and contingencies  judgement is necessary in assessing the existence of an obligation resulting from a past event  in assessing the probability of an economic outflow  and in quantifying the probable outcome of economic resources. This judgment is reviewed when new information becomes available and often with support of internal and external expert advice. Impact of the war in Ukraine on our activitiesGiven the nature and location of its operations and the fact that EVS does not currently have activities in Russia nor in Ukraine or with Russian companies  The Company does not foresee a direct impact of the Ukrainian conflict on its business. NOTE 5.3: SEGMENT REPORTING From an operational point of view  the company is vertically integrated with the majority of its staff located in the headquarters in Belgium  including the R&D  production  marketing and administration departments. Therefore the majority of investments and costs are located at the level of the Belgian parent company. Resources securing the customer facing interactions such as sales  operations and support profiles are primarily hired within the respective regions. The foreign subsidiaries are primarily sales and representative offices. The Chief Operating Decision Maker  being the Executive Committee  reviews the operating results  operating plans  and makes resource allocation decisions on a company-wide basis. Revenue related to products of the same nature (digital broadcast production equipment) are realized by commercial polyvalent teams. The company’s internal reporting is the reflection of the above-mentioned operational organization and is characterized by the strong integration of the activities of the company. By consequence  the company is composed of one segment according to the IFRS 8 definition  and the consolidated income statement of the Group reflects this unique segment. All long-term assets are located in the parent company EVS Broadcast Equipment SA in Belgium. The company provides one class of business defined as solutions based on tapeless workflows with a consistent modular architecture. There are no other significant classes of business  either singularly or in aggregate. Identical modules can meet the needs of different markets  and our customers themselves are often multi-markets. Providing information for each module is therefore not relevant for EVS. At the geographical level  our activities are divided into the following regions: Asia-Pacific (“APAC”)  Europe  Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”)  and America (“NALA”). This division follows the organization of the commercial and support services within the Group  which operates worldwide. A fourth region is dedicated to the worldwide events (“big event rentals”). The company provides additional information with a presentation of the revenue by market pillar: “Live Service provider”  “Live Audience Business” and “Big Event Rentals” for rental contracts relating to the big sporting events. Finally  sales are presented by nature: systems and services. 5.3.1. INFORMATION ON REVENUE BY DESTINATION Revenue can be presented by Market Pillar: “Live Service provider”  “Live Audience Business” and “Big event rentals”.

Entity Axon Digital Design LTD. in the UK changed functional currency from GBP to EUR starting as of July 1st 2022  following updated Management assesment driven by new implementation of EUR invoicing at the affiliate. The presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements of EVS Group is the Euro. For more information on exchange rates  see also the note 5.9. The favourable exchange result is mainly explained by the appreciation of USD vs. EUR in the period. The estimated fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are equal to their fair book values in the balance sheet. Since 2022  EVS systematically measures the Group’s anticipated exposure to transactional exchange risk  mainly relating to the EUR/USD risk. Given the Group has a long position in USD and based on revenue forecasts  EVS hedges future USD net inflows through forward or option foreign exchange contracts. The change in the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts is recorded directly to the income statement since the Group does not apply hedge accounting on these transactions. The valuation techniques used are mainly based on spot rates  forward rates and interest rate curves. On December 31  2022  the Group holds EUR/USD FX forward and option contracts for a total notional amount of USD 34 0 million with monthly maturities between January 2023 and June 2024. The fair value of those financial instruments on December 31  2022 amounts to EUR 0 3 million. NOTE 5.7: INCOME TAX EXPENSE (EUR thousands) FY22 FY21 - Current tax expense -569 -1.245 - Deferred tax expense -853 -1.552 Income tax expense -1.422 -2.797 Income tax expense amounts to EUR 1 4 million for the full year 2022  compared to EUR 2 8 million in 2021. The decrease is mainly explained by lower taxable profit  tax relief of EUR 0 6 million received in December 2022 and decrease of the deferred tax expenses due to lower consumption of recoverable tax latencies (EUR 1 2 million in 2022 compared to 8 6 million in 2021). The effective tax rate for the period ended on December 31  2022 is 4 3%  compared to 7 5% in 2021. NOTE 5.8: HEADCOUNT (in full time equivalents) At December 31 2022 613 2021 551 Variation +62 NOTE 5.9: EXCHANGE RATES The main exchange rates that influence the consolidated financial accounts are USD/EUR and GBP/EUR which were considered as follows: Exchange rate USD/EUR Average FY At December 31 2022 1 0537 1 0666 2021 1 1830 1 1326 Variation -10 9% -5 8% Exchange rate GBP/EUR Average FY At December 31 2022 0 8527 0 8869 2021 0 8599 0 8403 Variation -0 7% 5 5% NOTE 5.10: INTANGIBLE ASSETS During 2022  intangible assets increased by EUR 7 1 million due to capitalization of internal development costs of EUR 8 4 million less depreciations of EUR 1 3 million. The capitalized costs during 2022 include mainly the internal personnel costs and external consultants’ costs. These costs are only related to the development phase of 2 important projects that should secure future growth for EVS. At the beginning of the period  the Group identified internal development projects  that for the first time of EVS Broadcast Equipment’s history fulfilled all the conditions to be capitalized according to IAS 38 Intangible assets. This ability arises after the implementation of extensive business cases  where R&D together with the solutions and sales departments perform an end-to-end exercise whereby objectives  costs  market analysis and return are clearly identified. These internal development projects consist of software that will be commercialized at the end of the development period (expected return on investment is scheduled for 2024). These 2 projects complement the PLAYForward strategy of the Group. The progress of these internal developments is monitored frequently as to ensure the future economic benefit remains assured. We refer to H1 2022 press release for the update of the accounting policy 2.11 related to the intagible assets applicable as of fiscal year 2022 and that replaces the accounting policy disclosed in 2021 annual report. NOTE 5.11: TANGIBLE ASSETS The decrease of lands and buildings of EUR -2 1 million during 2022 is mainly explained by the depreciation of the period partially offset by investments in progress of EUR 0 5 million. The increase in other tangible assets of EUR 0 4 million is mainly driven by investments in office and IT equipment of EUR 1 1 million  net of the depreciation of the year of EUR 0 7 million. NOTE 5.12: FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (EUR thousands) 2022 2021 Long term financial debts Bank loans 1.675 2.779 Long term lease liabilities 9.853 10.775 Amount due within 12 months (shown under current liabilities) Bank loans 1.105 1.095 Short term lease liabilities 2.645 2.633 Total financial debt (short and long-term) 15.278 17.282 The total financial debt is repayable as follows: - within one year 3.750 3.728 - after one year but no more than five 8.676 9.673 - more than five years 2.852 3.881 In June 2020  a loan of EUR 5 5 million was put in place with BNP Paribas Fortis to partially finance the acquisition of Axon. The repayment schedule foresees first repayment of EUR 0 6 million in 2020 and annual installments of EUR 1 1 million between 2021 and 2024  with final repayment of EUR 0 6 million in 2025 at loan maturity. For full year 2022  lease liabilities variation includes repayment of EUR 2 5 million  excluding interest of EUR 0 4 million. In June 2020  a roll over credit line of EUR 5 0 million was put in place with Belfius bank to partially finance the acquisition of Axon. This amortizing credit line will end at the latest on 30/06/2025. As of this date  EVS has not used this credit facility. NOTE 5.13: OTHER LIABILITIES - PENSION Other long-term liabilities mainly correspond to pension obligations. Changes recorded in 2022 in the Belgian pension defined benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were as follows: (EUR thousands) 2022 2021 Defined benefit obligation Fair value of plan assets Net defined benefit liability Defined benefit obligation Fair value of plan assets Net defined benefit liability As of January 1 10.587 -8.762 1.825 8.670 -7.686 984 Service cost 1.156 1.156 1.398 1.398 Administrative costs 28 28 18 18 Net interest expenses 120 -106 14 41 -38 3 Sub-total included in profit or loss 1.276 -78 1.198 1.439 -20 1.419 Benefits paid -179 179 0 -141 141 0 Return on plan assets -153 -153 -106 -106 Actuarial changes (assumptions) of which: Arising from changes in demographic assumptions 235 235 0 Arising from changes in financial assumptions -1.349 -1.349 -1.172 -1.172 Arising from experience adjustments -367 -350 -717 1.791 -69 1.722 Sub-total included in OCI -1.481 -350 -1.831 619 -69 550 Contributions by employer -1.078 -1.078 -1.128 -1.128 As of December 31 10.203 -10.089 114 10.587 -8.762 1.825 The decrease in the net defined benefit liability of EUR -1 7 million is mainly driven by actuarial changes included in OCI arising from changes in financial assumptions of EUR -1 3 million (mainly increase in discount rate from 1 15% to 3 80%) and from experience adjustments of EUR -0 7 million  combined with employer contributions in the period of EUR -1 1 million and partially offset by service cost recorded in income statement of EUR 1 2 million. The main assumptions used for the actuarial valuation are as follows: Salary increase for financial year 2022 of 14 5% (5 7% in 2021)Discount rate p.a. of 3 8% (1 15% in 2021)Long term salary increase (inflation included) p.a. of 2 4% (2 1% in 2021)NOTE 5.14: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES The Group enters into derivative transactions  principally forward and option currency contracts  with the purpose to secure its sales and purchases in foreign currencies against negative variations of these currencies. The Group has transactional currency exposure arising from sales or purchases by operating entities in currencies other than the Group’s functional currency. Foreign currency risk is described in note 5.14.1. The Group’s main financial instruments  other than derivatives  comprise bank loans  finance leases  cash and short-term deposits. The purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors  which arise directly from its operations. The Group’s policy is  and has always been  that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. Credit risk is described in note 5.14.2. 5.14.1 FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK Since 2022  EVS systematically measures the Group’s anticipated exposure to transactional exchange risk over six to eighteen months. In its current structure  the Group’s exposure is mainly linked to the EUR/USD risk. The Group invoices all clients in Euro  except in the United States where invoices are denominated in USD. Since the majority of operating expenses are denominated in Euro  the Group has a long position in USD  i.e. all of the Group’s activities generate globally a positive net cash flow in USD. On the basis of the forecasts and according to the market conditions  the Group hedges a portion of the exchange rate risk on estimated net future flows  mainly through foreign exchange forward and option contracts. EVS does not apply hedge accounting according to IAS 39 for those transactions. Foreign exchange contracts are revalued at each closing date at their market value. The generated exchange rate profit or loss is recorded in the “Other net financial income/(charges)” account in the consolidated income statement. The valuation techniques used are mainly based on spot rates  forward rates and interest rate curves. Details of fair value at closing date are presented in note 5.6. 5.14.2 CREDIT RISK Credit exposure is controlled and reviewed regularly by the management. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers  spread across many geographical areas. The evolution of the credit risk is monitored permanently. As of December 31  2022  it is assumed that the carrying amounts of those trade receivables are the most appropriate estimate to the fair value of those assets. The credit risk on financial instruments is contained as it is spread over a selection of different counterparties which are financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. As of December 31  2022  the maximum amount the Group could have to pay if guarantees are called on is EUR 0 8 million (similar to EUR 0 8 million in December 2021). NOTE 5.15: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS There are no subsequent events that may have a material impact on the condensed financial statements of the Group. NOTE 5.16: RISK AND UNCERTAINTIES Investing in the stock of EVS involves risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties relating to the current year are similar to the risks and uncertainties that have been identified by the management of the company and that are listed in the management report of the annual report (available at www.evs.com). In terms of new risks arising since the last annual report we highlight the macro-economic environment that drives energy prices  components prices and labour cost to higher levels. EVS closely monitors the developments in this area and pro-actively takes actions to keep these rising costs under control or to minimize their effect on the profitability of the company. We also reiterate the potential impacts following the war in Ukraine. The company continues to comply with the sanction screening in vigor.

(NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today announce that Pfizer  as the study sponsor  has decided to discontinue a significant percentage of participants in the U.S. who had been enrolled in the Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524) Phase 3 clinical study. The study is investigating the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of an investigational Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15. These study participants  representing approximately half of the total recruited participants in the trial  are being discontinued following violations of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) at certain clinical trial sites run by a third-party clinical trial site operator. The discontinuation of these participants was not due to any safety concerns with the investigational vaccine and was not prompted by a participant-reported adverse event.GCP is the international ethical and scientific quality standard for clinical trials that all clinical researchers need to follow. These standards are designed to put participants’ interests first and ensure high scientific integrity. Once Pfizer learned of potential violations of GCP  it conducted a thorough review of the operations and data collection at the clinical trial sites run by the third party and followed standard operating safeguards to determine the correct course of action.The clinical trial remains ongoing with other sites not operated by the third party  and Pfizer continues to enroll new participants at those sites. The companies intend to work with regulatory authorities  and as previously announced 1 2 aim for Pfizer to potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025  pending successful completion of the Phase 3 studies and subject to the agreement of these regulatory agencies to proposed modifications of the clinical trial plan.Participants are being notified and Pfizer has also notified the FDA  other regulatory agencies and the independent Institutional Review Board for this study.Integrity of data collected in clinical trials is critical to provide evidence and confidence in a potential vaccine or medicine’s safety and efficacy. Pfizer and Valneva are committed to collecting robust data needed for potential regulatory submission of VLA15. While VLA15 is still under investigation  to date the companies have been encouraged by the data from the Phase 2 clinical studies  which demonstrated strong immunogenicity and acceptable safety and tolerability profiles.2-4About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immune response and satisfactory safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA15  with updates to the terms within this agreement made in June 2022.5 6 The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. FDA in July 2017.7About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes ticks.8 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.9 While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the United States and 130 000 people in Europe.10 11 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.12 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.10About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

18774,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4579351-galp-energia-promising-outlook-2023-will-support-stock-price,Galp Energia: A Promising Outlook For 2023 Will Support The Share Price (GLPEF),Galp Energia is the second largest oil-producing company on the Iberian peninsula  behind Repsol. Read more here.,mtcurado/iStock Unreleased via Getty ImagesIntroductionGalp Energia (OTCPK:GLPEF) (OTCPK:GLPEY) is a Portuguese integrated oil and gas company. It has a production rate of just over 100 000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day  owns a refinery and has recently been investing in renewable energy sources. The stock is still trading below the 15 EUR level it was trading at when I last discussed the company in 2019  despite just having completed a year with phenomenal oil prices which boosted the free cash flow result to almost 1.7B EUR  which is in excess of 2 EUR per share. 2023 likely won't be as strong as the oil prices have been trending lower  but in this article I'll explain why the official guidance for 2023 still makes Galp relatively appealing.Yahoo FinanceGalp's primary listing is on Euronext Lisbon where the stock is trading with GALP as its ticker symbol. There are currently approximately 815M shares outstanding after completing a 150M EUR share buyback program in 2022  resulting in a market capitalization of just over 9.8B EUR. As Galp has announced a 500M EUR share buyback  one could expect the share count to decrease by almost 5% this year  to less than 780M shares. The average daily volume in Lisbon is approximately 2.2 million shares.A look at the 2023 guidance reveals a high base case oil priceGalp's guidance for 2023 is pretty straightforward. The company anticipates an EBITDA of 3.2B EUR and an operating cash flow of 2.2B EUR this year  mainly thanks to another strong result in the upstream segment. Adjusting for the sale of the Angolan assets  Galp anticipates its upstream segment to generate north of 2B EUR in EBITDA and an operating cash flow of in excess of 1.1B EUR.Galp Energia Investor RelationsThe industrial and midstream assets will contribute about 550M EUR in EBITDA and operating cash flow  while the commercial segment will also contribute a few hundred million Euro. The renewables division should generate about 180M EUR in EBITDA and as such  will represent just over 5% of the anticipated consolidated EBITDA. So unlike its Iberian peer Repsol (OTCQX:REPYY) (OTCQX:REPYF)  Galp still is very fossil fuel heavy.What's interesting is that Galp is using a Brent oil price of US$85/barrel in its base case scenario and that's not really conservative. On the other hand  the company does use an EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.15 which is about 8% more conservative than the current FX rate which gets you 1.07 USD for every Euro. This also means that $85 Brent at a 1.15 conversion rate is just under 74 EUR per barrel while the current Brent oil price expressed in Euro is 79 EUR. So although $85 Brent optically looks pretty high  it's actually a slight discount to the current price when expressed in Euro.Galp also uses a refining margin of just $9/barrel. That's also pretty conservative given the strong fourth quarter on the refining side.Fortunately Galp also provided a sensitivity analysis. For every $5 difference in the Brent oil price  the operating cash flow will move by 85M EUR. So applying a Brent oil price of $70 would remove about 255M EUR from the operating cash flow  which would subsequently come in at approximately 1.95B EUR. And for every dollar difference in the refining margin  the operating cash flow will move by 65M EUR.Galp Energia Investor RelationsSo if we would apply $75 Brent  a $10 refining margin and an EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.10  the operating cash flow would be just 25M EUR lower than the base case scenario of 2.2B EUR. The main takeaway here is that the anticipated cash flows appear to be pretty robust.Investment thesisGalp Energia is often overlooked in the energy space. Repsol is by far the most important oil and gas company on the Iberian peninsula and Galp is for sure its smaller brother  but let's not neglect the Portuguese company. Even if the oil price doesn't come in at $85 Brent throughout the year  odds are Galp will still generate in excess of 2B EUR in operating cash flow. And considering the capex (including growth capex) is budgeted at - on average - 1B EUR for the years to come  I think it's okay to assume Galp will pretty consistently generate about 1B EUR in free cash flow per year. Keep in mind Galp only provides guidance on the 'net' capex  so it remains to be seen if we will see any divestments beyond the Angolan sale in the future.This represents approximately 1.35 EUR per share and although that doesn't make the stock look extremely attractive at first sight (its peers are trading at a higher free cash flow yield)  keep in mind this includes some serious investments in the renewable energy space where the company wants to almost triple its operating capacity by 2025.Galp Energia Investor RelationsGiven the strong balance sheet with a net debt of 1.56B EUR (excluding lease liabilities) and a TTM EBITDA of approximately 3.7B EUR (also excluding lease payments)  the debt ratio is just around 0.4. Even if one would apply the lower EBITDA of around 3B EUR in 2023 (the 3.2B EUR guidance minus the anticipated lease payments)  the net debt level will be just around 0.5 times EBITDA. That excludes the proceeds from the anticipated sale of the Angolan assets. Galp entered into an agreement to sell its Angolan upstream business for total net proceeds of 830M USD (on an after-tax basis) including $175M in contingent payments based on the Brent oil price. The US$655M upfront cash payment represents approximately 600M EUR and will further reduce the net debt to less than 1B EUR (of course subject to the pace of the 500M EUR share buyback this year). As the EBITDA guidance already assumes the sale of the Angolan assets  the debt ratio will thus drop below 0.35. This also makes Galp a pure play on Brazil.I'm encouraged by Galp's guidance so I will keep an eye on this company with renewed interest.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The management team and I are extremely proud of our employees  both offshore and onshore  for their efforts and contributions in achieving so muc…,Dear Shareholders 2022 was an extraordinary and transformative year for Seadrill. The management team and I are extremely proud of our employees  both offshore and onshore  for their efforts and contributions in achieving so much through the year. We find ourselves at a fascinating time for our industry in the face of geopolitical tensions and economic headwinds. Last year the need for affordable and reliable sources of energy was felt acutely around the globe and we believe as a company we have a crucial role to play in that regard. We believe the steps the company took laid the foundations for growth and enhanced performance for years to come.The board of directors and the management team have made it clear that we are highly focused on delivering value to you - our shareholders. As we reflect on the past year  we are firmly of the view that we achieved this through the delivery of safe and efficient operations for our customers and the execution of several important strategic initiatives  none more so than the sale of our jack-ups in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in October and the all-stock acquisition of Aquadrill LLC that we announced in late December and expect to close mid-2023. Looking ahead through 2023 and beyond  at the beginning of what we believe will be a sustained upcycle for offshore drilling  we are confident that Seadrill is very well-placed to capitalize on market developments and reaffirm our focus on generating value and returns for shareholders.In February 2022  Seadrill successfully emerged from its financial restructuring. Soon thereafter we re-entered public markets in April with a listing on the Euronext Expand in Oslo  followed by an up-listing to the main Oslo Børs in November. The Norwegian investor community is closely associated with Seadrill and we intend to build on existing relationships and foster new ones. In October  we re-entered U.S. markets by establishing our primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The steps we took in the capital markets last year were crucial for the company and its shareholders  improving liquidity in our equity and broadening our investor base. We look forward to working proactively and collaboratively with existing and prospective shareholders and investors as we continue to assess options with regard to the optimization of Seadrill's capital structure.Along with these milestones in capital markets  over the course of 2022 we repositioned Seadrill strategically to focus on key segments and geographies  where we believe we can differentiate the company and create value.In September  we announced the sale of our jack-up business in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to ADES Arabia Holding Ltd. The strategic rationale for this transaction was compelling  crystalizing highly attractive valuations on an implied equity basis and creating an opportunity for the company to utilize the sale proceeds to significantly deleverage. The interest rate environment during 2022 changed markedly  driven by the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical headwinds  and we regarded the opportunity to deleverage as vitally important. We executed debt paydowns of USD 442 million in the fourth quarter after closing the transaction. In taking this step we anticipate realizing interest savings of approximately USD 75 million per annum  enhancing the company's free cash flow outlook.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.49,0.2,0.3,True,English,"['2022 AGM CEO Letter', 'Seadrill', 'free cash flow outlook', 'several important strategic initiatives', 'ADES Arabia Holding Ltd', 'main Oslo Børs', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Norwegian investor community', 'interest rate environment', 'U.S. markets', 'stock acquisition', 'strategic rationale', 'Saudi Arabia', 'investor base', 'interest savings', 'public markets', 'capital markets', 'management team', 'fascinating time', 'geopolitical tensions', 'economic headwinds', 'reliable sources', 'crucial role', 'efficient operations', 'Aquadrill LLC', 'late December', 'sustained upcycle', 'offshore drilling', 'market developments', 'financial restructuring', 'capital structure', 'key segments', 'attractive valuations', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'geopolitical headwinds', 'debt paydowns', 'fourth quarter', 'transformative year', 'past year', 'existing relationships', 'equity basis', 'Dear Shareholders', 'prospective shareholders', 'primary listing', 'sale proceeds', 'extraordinary', 'Seadrill', 'employees', 'efforts', 'contributions', 'industry', 'face', 'need', 'affordable', 'energy', 'globe', 'company', 'regard', 'steps', 'foundations', 'growth', 'performance', 'years', 'board', 'directors', 'value', 'view', 'delivery', 'safe', 'customers', 'execution', 'Kingdom', 'October', 'beginning', 'focus', 'returns', 'February', 'April', 'Euronext', 'November', 'The', 'liquidity', 'investors', 'options', 'optimization', 'milestones', 'course', 'geographies', 'September', 'transaction', 'opportunity', 'fallout', 'annum']",2023-02-17,2023-02-18,marketscreener.com

(“Abrar”) as announced in November 2022[1]. As part of this process  Visiomed Group has decided to create a joint venture with two powerful partners  Abrar and Al-Ghazzawi Group.The formation phase of the joint venture that will bring together Visiomed Group's operations in Saudi Arabia has been launched  in partnership with Abrar and Al-Ghazzawi Group. Following the recent signing of a shareholders' agreement  announced via the release of 2022 results[2]  business licenses were requested. These licenses will allow Visiomed Group to position itself in the preventive care  diagnostics and large-scale medical screening markets  key business lines already successfully developed in Dubai via Smart Salem.Industrial partners with a strong local footprint and recognized track record in supporting foreign companies establishing operations in Saudi ArabiaTo ensure a successful expansion into a new major market  Visiomed Group has made the strategic choice to join forces with two partners with a strong local presence. The initial agreement entered with Abrar has consequently been extended to Al-Ghazzawi Group.Founded in 1993  Abrar (www.abrars.co) is a leading Saudi player in the deployment and integration of technological solutions  particularly for the transportation  telecommunication  defense  and energy sectors. As an industrial partner  Abrar is recognized for its success in assisting foreign companies establishing operations in Saudi Arabia (e.g.  Thales and Motorola). The Group currently employs over 400 people in Saudi Arabia in Riyadh  Jeddah  Dammam  Madinah and Yanbu.Al-Ghazzawi Group (www.ghazzawigroup.com) is one of the largest family-owned conglomerates in Saudi Arabia operating in multiple sectors including real estate development  trading  catering  legal services  manufacturing  and telecommunication. The Group is continuously looking to invest in new projects where it can leverage its skills  experience  and expertise. Al-Ghazzawi Group sealed many partnerships with foreign companies (including Nokia) and currently employs over 1 200 people.Structure of the joint ventureThe company will be 59% owned by Visiomed Group  36% by Abrar and 5% by Al-Ghazzawi Group.Visiomed will bring its expertise in healthcare and preventive care (medical analysis  radiology  data analysis and management)  as well as its experience in the roll-out of innovative medical centers.As industrial groups with strong footprints in Saudi Arabia  Abrar and Al-Ghazzawi Group will play a key role in implementing the joint-venture through their engagement with local stakeholders (including counterparts from the healthcare  real estate  infrastructure  legal and financial sectors).During this initial incorporation phase  the company will be capitalized by its shareholders (€125k  including €74k from Visiomed Group)  prior to defining a broader financing plan  that will include funding from local banks.Strategic positioning and a first target locationThe priority segments will be Iqama Medical Tests (Medical Fitness)  health tests for insurance renewals (a market representing nearly 3.5 million tests per year in Saudi Arabia) and medical check-ups.The aim is to open a first medical center in Riyadh in 2023  located in the heart of the King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD). Now covering c. 1.6 million square meters of land and consisting of over 80 buildings  including nearly 60 office towers  KAFD is a densely populated area and represents a strategic location for Visiomed Group's entry into the Saudi market.Dr. Rafat Samman  Founder and CEO of Abrar  and Member of the Executive Board of the French-Saudi Chamber of Commerce  said: “As part of our strategic development plan in the healthcare sector  finding a credible partner in the medical and diagnostics field was essential. We are honored to be part of this new company alongside our partner Visiomed Group. Visiomed Group's recent success  its strong growth in the United Arab Emirates in the Medical Fitness market and its vision around preventive care provide the basis for a promising start in Saudi Arabia. We are proud to welcome Visiomed Group to our network of industrial partners  which includes Thales and Motorola. Saudi Arabia is growing rapidly  and these partnerships enable us to play an active role in the development of our economy.”Eng. Radwan Samman  Development Director at Abrar  said: “The growing demand for medical screening and preventive care in Saudi Arabia was a key factor in our decision to expand our operations in this industry. Visiomed Group will become our strategic partner. Driven by the Ministry of Health's comprehensive plan to develop and modernize the healthcare sector  we are confident that our strategy to establish a presence in Riyadh  and subsequently in other parts of Saudi Arabia  will be a success.”Guillaume Bremond  Visiomed Group Chairman  said: “Establishing a new company in Saudi Arabia is the second phase of our expansion plan in the Middle East. We are honored to be able to launch this project alongside Abrar and Al-Ghazzawi Group  two experienced and top tier partners. The Saudi market is booming  with considerable demand for fast  digital and reliable medical services. Firstly  Saudi Arabia's population is projected to grow from 36 million in 2022 to over 50 million by 2030. Secondly  extensive investment programs are planned between now and 2030 that include over $60 billion in healthcare infrastructure investments  of which $1.5 billion invested in digital transformation  with contribution of private companies playing a key role. The expansion of Visiomed Group into Saudi Arabia was therefore a natural step.”Visiomed Group CEO Thomas Picquette said: “We are delighted to cement our collaboration in Saudi Arabia with two prestigious industrial partners. The combined expertise of our respective groups will be a powerful asset to address this dynamic market  which is driven by a desire to make the best preventive care and healthcare services available for everyone. All our teams are now working actively to ensure a swift implementation of our development plan and vision in Saudi Arabia.”Visiomed Group will keep the market regularly informed of the progress of this new strategic venture.About VISIOMED GROUPFounded in 2007  VISIOMED GROUP relies on a long experience in the health sector to invest in innovative health technologies and services in France and abroad.The Group now has two subsidiaries and holdings:Smart Salem  the first digital medical analysis center accredited by the Dubai Ministry of Health (DHA) in the United Arab Emirates  100% owned by Visiomed Group.The Smart Salem offer is based on know-how in medical analysis  radiology and data analysis and processing to detect nearly 35 diseases in 7 minutes in a patient (in particular HIV  hepatitis and tuberculosis) by offering reliable results  readability and exceptional patient experience enabled by advanced artificial intelligence and virtual reality technologies.Smart Salem's “Medical Fitness Assessment” offer resulting from this know-how thus makes it possible to obtain a residence or work visa in the space of 30 minutes compared to 10 to 15 days in historical health centers.Smart Salem is a technological platform offering many growth opportunities  as shown by the opening of the second center in Dubai in September 2022 and the authorization received for the opening of a third center  planned to open in the first quarter of 2023.Bewellthy  created in 2022  a leading player in connected health and teleconsultation solutions and is 49.88% owned by Visiomed Group.Bewellthy offers an enriched technological universe combining medical devices  software and ""health and well-being concierge"" services to meet all the needs and use cases of telehealth.Bewellthy's flagship product  VisioCheck  is the 1st telemedicine station weighing less than 300g for healthcare professionals  available as a case  station or modular healthcare space.Bewellthy is now deploying its solutions and services in France and abroad  particularly in Italy and the USA.Based in Paris  VISIOMED GROUP is listed on Euronext Growth (ALVMG).

(NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today announce that Pfizer  as the study sponsor  has decided to discontinue a significant percentage of participants in the U.S. who had been enrolled in the Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524) Phase 3 clinical study. The study is investigating the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of an investigational Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15. These study participants  representing approximately half of the total recruited participants in the trial  are being discontinued following violations of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) at certain clinical trial sites run by a third-party clinical trial site operator. The discontinuation of these participants was not due to any safety concerns with the investigational vaccine and was not prompted by a participant-reported adverse event.GCP is the international ethical and scientific quality standard for clinical trials that all clinical researchers need to follow. These standards are designed to put participants’ interests first and ensure high scientific integrity. Once Pfizer learned of potential violations of GCP  it conducted a thorough review of the operations and data collection at the clinical trial sites run by the third party and followed standard operating safeguards to determine the correct course of action.The clinical trial remains ongoing with other sites not operated by the third party  and Pfizer continues to enroll new participants at those sites. The companies intend to work with regulatory authorities  and as previously announced 1 2 aim for Pfizer to potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025  pending successful completion of the Phase 3 studies and subject to the agreement of these regulatory agencies to proposed modifications of the clinical trial plan.Participants are being notified and Pfizer has also notified the FDA  other regulatory agencies and the independent Institutional Review Board for this study.Integrity of data collected in clinical trials is critical to provide evidence and confidence in a potential vaccine or medicine’s safety and efficacy. Pfizer and Valneva are committed to collecting robust data needed for potential regulatory submission of VLA15. While VLA15 is still under investigation  to date the companies have been encouraged by the data from the Phase 2 clinical studies  which demonstrated strong immunogenicity and acceptable safety and tolerability profiles.2-4About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immune response and satisfactory safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA15  with updates to the terms within this agreement made in June 2022.5 6 The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. FDA in July 2017.7About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes ticks.8 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.9 While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the United States and 130 000 people in Europe.10 11 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.12 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.10About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

Amsterdam Interim Report & Unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements first six months of 2022 Cabka N.V. | 2022HY Interim Report | Page 1 of 32 Company Statement Introduction to the first six months of Cabka N.V. in 2022 This half-year report is the first of its kind published by Cabka N.V. (Cabka) marking the transformation of Cabka from a privately owned company to a listed company following the support of 100% of Dutch Star Companies TWO B.V. (DSC2) shareholders for a business combination of Cabka Group GmbH and DSC2 into Cabka N.V. and subsequent listing on Euronext Amsterdam  on 1 March 2022. This report covers all operations of Cabka N.V. as of 1 January 2022 so retroactive from listing on 1 March 2022. Governance As a result of the listing governance of Cabka changed significantly to meet the requirements as a listed company. A two-tier Board was installed with a Management Board consisting of Mr. Tim Litjens CEO and Mr. Necip Küpcü CFO as well as a Supervisory Board of six members: Mr. Manuel Beja (Chair) Mr. Gat Ramon (Vice-Chair)  Mr. Niek Hoek (Vice-Chair)  Mrs. Tova Posner Henkin  Mrs. Jeanine Holscher  and Mr. Stephan Nanninga. Of the supervisory board members Messrs. Ramon  Hoek and Nanninga are not considered independent in accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. Mr. Özgür Yildirim is the corporate secretary for both the Management Board and Supervisory Board. The Board of Management is further supported by a Management Team including Mr. Geert de Wilde as Chief Operations Officer  Mr. Jean-Marc van Maren as Chief Product Development Officer  and as of 1 July 2022 Mr. Wouter van der Woerd as Chief People officer responsible for HR and organizational development. Financial and operational performance first six months of 2022 The first half of 2022 was dominated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February and its subsequent impact on social and economic developments as well as financial markets. Although Cabka had no direct exposure to the Ukraine  Russia or Belarus  indirect impact was significant. First and foremost  as energy and material prices increased unprecedentedly leading to significantly higher costs for energy and materials. Cabka is leading the industry in pricing and has achieved several price increases to compensate for the higher input costs. Nevertheless  despite compensation in pricing the higher production costs led to at least a temporarily margin pressure due to delays in passing on increased costs to customers as well as lower margins as (energy and material) costs now represent a higher fraction of total revenues. On the other hand  as lumber prices and supplies are far more impacted than plastics  the relative competitive position of plastic pallets and large containers improved. Overall  we have seen exceptionally strong commercial results showing high demand for our products that continued throughout the half year leading to strong sales over the period of EUR 102.2 million (up 27% YoY). Various rounds of price increases and indexation covered rapidly rising costs for energy and materials (albeit with a delay)  accounting for a total favorable price effect of 15% Year-on-Year. The remaining 40% of the increase was based on organic growth especially from customized solutions underlining Cabka's focus on key strategic objectives. The US-business with large containers was highly successful with a multi-year contract with Target bringing in significant revenues as of the third quarter 2022. Also  the European large container market looks promising as reflected in the new contracts with  among others  BMW and a leading material handling company starting up production in Q3 of 2022 but only resulting in new sales in the first half of next year. Although Cabka has been able to compensate most of its higher costs through its product prices  the steep rise over a short period had bottom line impact (albeit partly temporarily due to a delay in translating higher costs into price increases). With an additional price increase of 5% announced early July for 1 August  pricing should be at par with costs at that moment and providing no extreme increases going further. In order to be able to react more dynamically to Cabka N.V. | 2022HY Interim Report | Page 2 of 32 the currently highly volatile conditions in the energy and material market  an indexed pricing adjustment mechanism has been introduced as a prerequisite for all new contracts. The increase in sales and ability to translate cost increases into product prices clearly reflects the resilient and strong market position of Cabka. In addition  Cabka was able to partly mitigate impact of the shortage and price increase of materials as Cabka sources a high amount of feed stock (up to 70%) from internal production recycling activities. However  due to lagging in time as well as an overall higher cost base  margins are affected at least in the short-term. The restructuring of the Eco business with the closure of Genthin and shift to Weira is set to additionally improve long-term profitability albeit having a temporarily negative operational impact of EUR 0.8 million in the second quarter of 2022. This was mainly triggered by the temporary shutdown of production to facilitate the move  which conclusively reduced the intake of mixed plastics. However  this effect is expected to be offset in the second half of the year as economies of scale and increase of additional processing capacities should result in a higher output. Overall  the 27% increase in total revenues over the first half year compared to the same period of 2021 could not fully compensate the 67% increase in the costs for materials  energy and purchased services resulting in just a EUR 5 million higher gross profit at EUR 47.3 million (2021HY: EUR 42.3 million) and a lower relative gross margin (gross profit/sales) down to 46.3% from 52.4% in 2021HY. Overall management is positive on top line development and absolute margins  however  long- term impact on the relative margins is highly depending on the development of costs for energy and materials and the probability of returning to the levels of previous years. To improve margins management closely followed market developments and the opportunity to translate cost inflation in prices. In addition  several actions were initiated primarily focused to reduce costs with a target of 10% for this year and local management requested to also allow for bottom-up initiatives to drive local costs down. Given the current markets Cabka is shifting its own production facilities to higher added value (customized) products and using tollers as much as possible for more standardized products. EBITDA Group EBITDA excluding extraordinary items came in at EUR 13.1 million (2021HY: EUR 14.7 million). This result primarily reflects the trends underlying the development in revenue and gross profit. The latter is affected especially as due to lag in price increases some EUR 1.2 million in higher energy costs over the first quarter 2022 could not be recovered. Further a lower intake of mixed plastics due to the physical consolidation led to missing revenues in the Eco Products business of EUR 0.8 million in the second quarter of the year. Additionally  higher production and revenues in the first half year 2022 (+27%) resulted in higher personnel and operating expenses versus the comparable period in prior year. Salary and wage adjustments in the entire Group were made beginning of the second quarter to compensate inflationary developments. The table below compares the buildup of EBITDA excluding extraordinary items as reported earlier based on German GAAP to the current IFRS based figures.

Higher requirements for working capital were mainly driven by inflation as higher product pricing leads to higher inventory value and higher receivables. Nevertheless  actions were taken to improve the NWC position which is expected to normalize in line with the supply side. Cash flows from operating activities came in at EUR -11.0 million  predominantly by the increase of Net Working Capital by EUR 11.4 million. Based on higher demand for products in the first half year 2022 the trade account receivables increased by EUR 2.6 million and the inventories by EUR 8.6 million. The latter is caused by producing certain customer demands on stock  but also by inflation. Additionally  some of the raw materials were secured at still decent cost prices versus market developments. Trade account payables were reduced by EUR 0.2 million. The other non-cash transactions are including primarily the value change of warrants EUR 3.5 million and change in share-based programs EUR 1.5 million besides other non-cash items. Cash flows from investing activities totaling EUR 32.8 million are including sale of assets EUR 0.7 million  investments for growth  maintenance  and replacement EUR 10.9 million  intangible asset of EUR 0.2 million  US minority shares EUR 1.8 million and the cash injection from the Business combination of EUR 45.2 million. Cash flows from financing activities combined from repayments and receipt are totaling EUR 4.7 million. The changes in cash and cash equivalents result in a cash position of EUR 36.5 million. CAPEX Group CAPEX for first six months of 2022 came in at EUR 13 million including the acquisition of minority shares of the US subsidiary totaling EUR 1.8 million. The remaining investments mainly account for ECO Restructuring and new molds (EUR 8.7 million). Maintenance and replacement CAPEX is at EUR 2.4 million or with 2.3% of revenues in line with then mid-term guidance (app. 4%) also due to the significant increase in revenues. Commercial performance The first half of 2022 showed record sales of EUR 102.2 million a 27% increase over the same period last year. Growth was especially strong in reusable transport packaging (RTP)  whereas RTP US up 49% to EUR 15.0million as well in customized solutions and contract manufacturing in Europe  up respectively 40% to EUR 18.7 million and 46% to EUR 20.3 million. The increase of European RTP portfolio to EUR 32.6 million was approximately in line with the regular price increases  while ECO products temporarily shrunk by 6% as a result of the relocation of activities to Weira. The geographical spread of sales did not significantly change in the first half-year except for sales in the US that showed a very strong increase by 50% to EUR 15 million (2021HY: EUR 10 million). Average daily order intake in first half-year 2022 was up 36% compared to same period last year  with especially high order intake for June as a result of the new multi-year Target contract. Strategic progress Cabka has made substantial progress with regard to its strategic objectives. With major long- term commercial contracts  the company is underlining its focus on providing highly customized solutions and is growing its footprint in the large container segment. Actual NWC includes liabilities for invoices to be received in trade payables under IFRS  corresponding NWC under German GAAP would be app. 24% of revenue Cabka N.V. | 2022HY Interim Report | Page 4 of 32 Operationally  the closure of the Genthin site on 31 May 2022  enables the company to concentrate all Eco production activities in the Weira plant. This consolidation helps Cabka in its efforts to continuously improve production efficiencies within its Eco-product lineup. Principal risks As every company in these challenging times  Cabka underlies some business-related risks that must be mentioned. Though central risks have been previously detailed in the Shareholder Circular issued in the course of Cabka's IPO on 1 March 2022  there are some factors that need to be revisited or addressed separately. The war between Russia and Ukraine has not had direct implications for the organization. Nonetheless  it caused high uncertainty in the energy markets which led to highly volatile prices for gas and energy in general. As a production company specialized in injection molding  energy scarcity and ambiguous energy pricing are highly relevant factors for Cabka and are  thus  being closely monitored on a regular basis. The war in the region has not only impacted value chains and commodity prices but has also created pressure on finance markets and exchange rates. As a result  the Euro has suffered from substantial depreciation versus the US-Dollar in Q3-2022. This is an important factor for Cabka due to its operations and broad customer base in the United States. With this leading to US revenues increasing there are also positive implications to this development. In the context of the USA  another geopolitical risk to be wary of is the tension with China around Taiwan. Although Cabka does not conduct business in the area and there is therefore no direct impact expected in case of an escalation  the situation might have implications in a broader  possibly global  scope. Finally  while the signing of another major long-term supply agreement in the FLC--business with US-retailer Target entails promising revenue outlooks for Cabka and helps the company to further establish its strong competitive position  it can also be associated with risks. As mentioned in the Shareholder Circular  a material share of Cabka's revenue is dependent on a limited group of large customers. The new agreement must also be accounted for in this context. The associated large volumes are also expected to intermittently occupy large shares of Cabka's overall production capacity  limiting the possibility to produce other products. However  this risk is being mitigated by an additional machine  that was acquired especially for the realization of said volumes. ESG Cabka is striving to be the circularity leader in its industry. As to circularity  with our products in the first half of 2022 for 87% made from recycled materials  100% reusable with take-back clauses for recycling and supporting the collection of additional plastics for recycling we clearly established a leading position. The average for Europe was in 2021 still at 14% recycled plastics targeting to get to 33% by 2030.2 This year we turned focus not only to the recycling of plastics  but also on how we recycle plastics. Until recently Cabka -as a privately owned company- did not specifically measure ESG performance and efforts. To counteract this  Cabka has initiated efforts to outline an ESG Strategy. Currently  the first stage of the ESG Strategy Project is ongoing with the goal to establish a running reporting structure by the end of 2022. The project comprises of a thorough analysis of Cabka's current ESG position and stakeholder expectations to meet the requirements according to the non-financial reporting directive (NFRD). A double materiality assessment supported by PwC Netherlands was conducted leading to the establishment of base ambition levels that were agreed upon with the full management team in June.
