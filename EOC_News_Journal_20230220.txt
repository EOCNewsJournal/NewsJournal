18793,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4579778-vgi-partners-investor-letter-full-year-2022,VGI Partners Investor Letter - Full Year 2022,VGI Partners Global Investments Limited made available their 2022 Investor Letter recently. Click here to read the full fund letter.,"akinbostanci/iStock via Getty Images‚ÄúEvery recession brings out the sceptics who doubt that we will ever come out of it  and who predict that we will soon fall into a depression  when new cars will sit unsold in the showrooms forever and houses will stand empty  and the country will go bankrupt.‚Äù PETER LYNCHDear Fellow Investors For the twelve months ended 31 December 2022 (CY22)  VGI Partners Global Investments Limited (ASX:VG1) generated a net return of -22.3%.[1]Global equity markets experienced a challenging year in 2022  the S&P 500 declining -19% over the period  the NASDAQ Composite retreating -33% and the broader MSCI World Index falling -19%. Few asset classes delivered a positive return for the year  as heightened inflationary pressures  rising global interest rates and a horrific conflict on the European continent saw over US$25 trillion in value erased from global equity markets over the course of the calendar year.CY22 has been incredibly disappointing for VGI Partners. Since the inception of VG1‚Äôs portfolio in 2017  we have strived to provide our investors with access to a concentrated portfolio of high-quality businesses  with the ambition to grow our capital at 10-15% per annum. The careful protection of our invested capital base and constant vigilance in avoiding situations that lead to the permanent impairment of capital has been a critical component to this approach. Quite simply  we have not adequately executed on this in 2022.As a consequence  CY22 comfortably represents the largest annual drawdown the global strategy has experienced in a calendar year since its inception. We are profoundly aware that this has been a disappointing result  and one that we have obviously sought to learn extensively from as we look to restore both our return profile and our investors‚Äô confidence over the period ahead.Pleasingly  the new year has started well  with the portfolio up +11% through to the 27th of January. However  we recognise that this is only a first step in recovering the CY22 drawdown for our investors.In this letter  we provide an update on the current positioning of the VG1 portfolio  a summary of recent changes and an overview of where we see opportunities to generate attractive returns on our capital over the 2023 year ahead. Additionally  we feel it important to reflect on a number of the missteps made during 2022  and the important lessons we have taken away from this in order to improve our processes over the years ahead.Before discussing the portfolio in more detail  we would also like to provide an update on recent corporate activities of relevance to VG1. As many investors would be aware  VGI Partners and Regal Funds Management merged on 3 June 2022  with the new combined entity renamed ‚ÄòRegal Partners‚Äô. The VGI Partners investment team continues to manage the VG1 portfolio  but is benefiting from access to Regal Funds Management‚Äôs operating infrastructure and investor relations team. Key VGI Partners investment staff continue to own substantial personal investments in VGI‚Äôs wholesale funds and VG1. The VG1 Board has also taken a number of steps to assist VG1 and its shareholders. This includes a refinement of the dividend policy in August 2022 ‚Äì VG1‚Äôs new policy is to target a dividend of at least 4.5c each six months. This is in line with VG1‚Äôs recent profile  with VG1 paying two dividends during CY22 (4.5c in April 2022 and 4.5c in September 2022). In addition  VG1 has an active on-market share buy-back program  purchasing shares when they are trading at a discount to Net Tangible Assets. This not only provides greater on-market liquidity but can be highly accretive for shareholders. Over 56m shares  or approximately 14% of VG1‚Äôs shares  have been bought back since the program began. Post completion of the merger in early June 2022  we have seen VG1‚Äôs discount to Net Tangible Assets reduce from over 20% to around 15-16% currently. We look forward to providing more updates through future investor briefings and letters.Portfolio Thoughts & PositioningWe have always viewed the opportunity to manage our investors‚Äô capital as a privilege  and we thank investors for their patience  support and encouragement over what has undoubtedly been a difficult year. While performance has been challenging  we remain highly confident that the deep fundamental investment approach taken by the VGI team  and our focus on identifying mispriced high-quality businesses  remains an attractive way to generate favourable risk-adjusted returns through the full market cycle. The team retains a high level of conviction in our core portfolio holdings  and pleasingly has taken advantage of share price weakness in a number of existing portfolio positions to progressively add exposure to incredibly high-quality businesses at what we perceive to be very attractive valuations. At writing  in the long portfolio we see  conservatively  about 30% potential upside to our estimate of fair value for the underlying stocks.As a reminder  VGI Partners seeks to build a concentrated portfolio for VG1 of under-appreciated  highquality businesses that operate within (or we believe will soon operate within) attractive industry verticals. These positions are offset by short positions in companies perceived to be encountering structural headwinds  business model weakness and/or accounting irregularities.While the concept of investing in ‚Äòquality‚Äô businesses has evolved in recent years to encompass an increasingly broad church  at VGI Partners  our preferred approach is to focus on businesses that we perceive as ‚Äòcovertly‚Äô high-quality businesses  namely those which are initially ignored  under-appreciated  or disdained by the broader market consensus  and therefore tend to provide far more attractive opportunities from a valuation perspective versus more traditional (or ‚Äòovertly‚Äô) higher-quality names. Of course  the drawback from owning covert high-quality businesses  at least initially  is that such holdings can make you stand out from the crowd  at times can make you look foolish  and can sporadically inject higher levels of volatility into a portfolio as the underlying value of these businesses is progressively appreciated by the broader market.In uncovering these covertly high-quality businesses  we look for companies that enjoy strong moats that protect the underlying business  and ideally moats that are expanding (or  at a minimum  remaining stable). We like businesses with the ability to allocate capital at attractive rates of return (that is  rates well in excess of the businesses‚Äô own cost of capital)  those with a resilient business model or underlying customer base and those that enjoy growth optionality. Additionally  we spend significant time seeking to understand the underlying industry structures in which our companies operate  given our preference for investing in businesses with the ability to generate sustained economic profits  and not just accounting profits[2].While covertly high-quality businesses are our preference  we are equally happy to deploy capital into more overtly  or already well-appreciated  businesses during times when either depressed sentiment across the broader market provides us with an attractive opportunity to do so  or when one of these businesses experiences shorter-term setbacks in their business model or growth profile  leading to their share prices over-correcting to the downside  at least over the short term.The table below provides a snapshot of the top 10 holdings in VG1‚Äôs portfolio as at 31 December 2022 and represents a collection of what we believe to be high-quality  attractively-priced  global businesses with significant potential to meaningfully grow their earnings over many years ahead. Consistent with our concentrated approach  the top 10 long positions account for 68% of our total invested capital.Top 10 Long Investments as at 31 December 2022 % of Portfolio CME Group Inc.

Click to enlargeRegular readers of our monthly reports will recognise a number of our existing longer-term positions in the above  in addition to more recent changes to the overall portfolio composition. US-listed derivatives and futures exchange operator CME Group was our largest investment position  closely followed by US technology and e-commerce conglomerate Amazon (an investment we first initiated in VGI‚Äôs global strategy in 2014). Both positions are discussed in more detail later in this letter. As a consequence of updated information and adjustments to our assessment of risk-reward  previously larger positions in multinational payments business Mastercard and Swiss-headquartered luxury watch and jewellery retailer Cie Financi√®re Richemont have been reduced  while the portfolio has exited its position in Japanese-listed optical and precision technology manufacturer Olympus Corp. (OTCPK:OCPNF)More recent additions to the portfolio include German automotive and defence supplier Rheinmetall  US listed oil services business Schlumberger (SLB)  and diversified global entertainment group The Walt Disney Company. In the case of Disney  we saw an opportunity to invest in a more overtly high-quality business that has encountered a series of short-term setbacks. We feel this has provided us with a highly attractive entry price for a business that is a global leader in theme parks  hotels and cruise lines  operating with a well-established and growing competitive moat  and that has consistently delivered high returns on invested capital. Amazon arguably feels like it is also rapidly falling into this category  as the broader market‚Äôs disdain for the company‚Äôs core cloud infrastructure and e-commerce businesses grows  despite strong underlying fundamentals. We will discuss the investment thesis and upside potential from both these positions in greater detail later in this letter.By some margin  the greatest detractor to VG1‚Äôs portfolio returns was the rotation away from high-growth and tech-oriented businesses. The portfolio had high exposure to this thematic via holdings such as Amazon  Pinterest  Qualtrics (XM) and IAC  as well as the gradual re-purchase in the first half of 2022 of holdings in Spotify (SPOT) and Palantir (PLTR). These left the portfolio vulnerable as valuations compressed and investors rotated aggressively into more defensive and/or profitable businesses. In hindsight  the portfolio was over-exposed to these higher-growth and still maturing companies. However  as we have discussed before  we think many of these businesses will start to generate substantial profitability and free cashflows over the next few years (in fact  many of them already are) and still strongly believe in the underlying businesses mentioned above.In terms of FX  the portfolio remains fully hedged to Australia Dollars ((aud)). As we take an active view on the currency  we may move back to an unhedged or partially hedged position  but only when we believe there is a clear mispricing based on our fundamental analysis. Currently  we remain positive on the AUD because of the favourable position Australia finds itself in: endowed with plenty of commodities at a time when demand for these is growing rapidly given the global undersupply and underinvestment in commodity production experienced in recent years.Short SellingOur short portfolio was a positive contributor to returns in CY22  adding ~10% to portfolio returns. After an exceptionally challenging few years for short selling strategies  the abrupt conclusion of the cheap money era has rapidly refocused market participants toward company fundamentals and valuations and  in doing so  significantly widened the opportunity set for short sellers. The portfolio currently retains a higher short exposure than historically as a result  reflecting the increasingly attractive environment (particularly in more cyclical industries where we anticipate significant risks to earnings and margins over the period ahead).The largest short contributor in CY22 was a custom basket of higher-multiple  loss-making technology stocks ‚Äì a position that we discussed in our semi-annual letter in July 2022. This basket consisted of businesses that carried  in our view  significantly challenged business models and lofty valuations  many of which subsequently experienced share price declines of 50-80% over the course of the year. While a successful outcome  we regret not leaning into this position in greater size. A secondary contributor to the short book was a basket of stocks focused on companies in the semiconductor sector  which we initiated in anticipation of the market eventually recognising that the sector is ultimately a cyclical industry and recent increases in capacity would lead to negative consequences for the industry. Again  this position was discussed in more detail in our letter of July 2022.Pleasingly  the portfolio also benefited this year from a number of single-stock shorts  including a position in Tesla (TSLA)  the well-known electric vehicle manufacturer that was experiencing a slowing in business momentum throughout the year as a result of pressures on consumer discretionary purchases  supply chain disruptions and increasing competition. We have expected for some time that the electric vehicle category would become more competitive  and more recently have begun to witness aggressive price cuts by manufacturers in an attempt to clear inventory  which is a negative trend for an industry that is only likely to see more competition over the coming years. The portfolio also benefited from a short position in a US-listed discount grocery store business  where investors were being pitched a large-scale store rollout story by senior management  albeit using forecasts that were extrapolating the temporarily favourable conditions into the long term and at a time when insider selling was rapidly accelerating. Both these short positions have now been profitably closed.Finally  our proprietary screens  which focus on identifying accounting red flags  have also displayed greater efficacy over the year  identifying a number of situations where weak cash conversion or evidence of inventory building have subsequently led to earnings downgrades and share price declines. This has been particularly prominent in the retail sector  where growing inventory problems have led to discounting and  in turn  margin compression. Additional focus has also been placed on the small pockets of the global economy that are still normalising post COVID-19  and where supply chain disruptions and/or volatility of input prices continue to create unsustainably high pricing increases  which  in some cases  are being assumed by the broader market as the ‚Äònew normal‚Äô.OpportunitiesWhile technology has obviously been a key detractor from returns in CY22  we continue to believe the sector provides a number of compelling opportunities to buy excellent businesses with the ability to generate meaningful returns on capital over the years ahead. Enterprise software  for example  continues to remain a key focus for the team  given these businesses often display highly attractive economics  including predictable and recurring revenue streams  high levels of customer ‚Äòstickiness‚Äô (often due to the mission-critical nature of their use case) and long runways for growth in markets with low overall penetration.The broader malaise across the listed technology sector through 2022 drove a significant de-rating of valuations across the enterprise software sector  which has subsequently ignited a wave of merger and acquisitions (M&A) announcements through the second half of the year. The rapid emergence of M&A activity from large tech-orientated private equity firms in the listed sector (which typically seek to purchase businesses in the private markets prior to their underlying value being realised by public market investors) would likely suggest that private market valuations for quality  growing enterprise software businesses are  in many cases  now 75% to 100% above public market valuations  a sign that the capitulation in public markets has reached peak levels.On the completely opposite end of the spectrum from enterprise software  the defence sector is another area we have recently found equally appealing. We see structural growth after years of under-investment and the Ukraine conflict has acted as a massive catalyst for defence budget acceleration  particularly in Europe. Meanwhile  the Taiwan/China stand-off is accelerating the spend in the Asian region. Western armies are short on ammunition and other ordnances; for instance  Germany requires 10 years of ammunition purchases to simply meet minimum NATO requirements. This is one of the many reasons we have started building a position in Rheinmetall  a leading German defence business  which we discuss later in the letter. The shift to digital capabilities by military departments also bodes well for one of our other holdings  Palantir  whose core business revolves around supplying software solutions to Western government agencies and the military globally.Similar to enterprise software  we have seen acquisitions in the defence sector at significant premiums to public market valuations ‚Äì one such example was Maxar Technologies (MAXR)  which received a private equity takeover proposal in December 2022 at a 129% premium to the last traded price. Again  this highlights the dislocation between public market prices and those that an informed  private buyer is prepared to pay given a 5-year view. We find this encouraging.In addition to defence  we have focused our efforts on other new sectors where we see structural growth  including energy and medical technology. The long-term outlook for energy looks highly attractive given many years of under-investment and more recently amplified by ESG constraints and corporate discipline. Although we reviewed commodity owners (where we leveraged the expertise of the Regal resources team)  we focused our efforts on the second derivative ‚Äì the oil service companies. These are the picks-and shovels of the industry and arguably the highest-quality way to gain exposure. As a result  we invested in Schlumberger earlier this year and grew this to a circa 8% weight during the year (now circa 3%).Similarly  medical technology has been an area of ongoing focus. Olympus was sold during the year after generating an attractive return (briefly discussed later in the letter). In turn  this has led us to other opportunities in the sector. We are in the process of building two holdings in medical technology ‚Äì companies that operate in highly consolidated industry structures  are mission-critical to customers and are exposed to attractive long-term structural growth drivers. We will be discussing these in more detail in future communications.Hidden Risks & SignpostsA large contributor to the significant drawdown in technology and growth stocks has been the growth in ‚Äòcross-over‚Äô funds over the last decade  particularly in the US. These funds (many of them household names in the growth hedge fund complex) have substantially grown their assets and  in turn  their allocations to completely illiquid Venture Capital (VC) investments. The rising interest rate environment and subsequent reassessment of growth asset valuations forced the ‚Äòcross-over‚Äô funds to cover redemptions by selling their listed investments. We believe that a number of the names in the VG1 portfolio have been caught up in this downdraft over the last 12 months. We are mindful that a further leg down in growth valuations could be led by a re-pricing of the illiquid VC investments within these portfolios. Whilst this has been a well-publicised dynamic  private equity funds may prove to be a hidden risk in the system.In fact  warning signs are developing in what is a completely unregulated segment of the financial markets with substantial amounts of hidden leverage and opaqueness. Private equity firms have been slow to take downward re-valuations. We see potential that 2023 reveals an avalanche of redemptions as negative returns are revealed to investors in private market or cross-over funds (which hold public equities and unlisted assets) over the next 3-6 months  triggering gates reminiscent of the Global Financial Crisis. Asset-liability mismatches are starting to become apparent and the canary in the coal mine looks like the Blackstone (BX) B-REIT situation (where Blackstone began to limit redemptions from its real estate trust after withdrawal requests spiked). Property-skewed funds and cross-over funds seem to be the most vulnerable. At writing  additional warning signs have come to our attention and we believe the amber lights are flashing and potentially are about to turn red.In meetings with investors over the last six months  we have said that the signposts that we are closer to an equity market bottom would include the reveal of a large fraud as well as a sell-off in Tesla  the retail investor poster-boy. We have seen the collapse of FTX  a large crypto company  and evidence that it is an outright fraud  along with a severe unwind in the Tesla share price (where we fortunately had a short position during CY22; since closed). Interestingly  FTX ranks as the fourth largest corporate failure in history by market cap. We are yet to see signs of outright capitulation and fear amongst investors  which will likely be the final stage  nor have we seen central banks globally meaningfully withdraw liquidity from the system.Pressures are also building for consumers globally. Looking at the US as an example  the household consumption picture prima facie remains healthy  but digging below the surface there are worrying signs. Inflationary pressures are squeezing consumer budgets and consumers have been forced to lean into excess savings or  even worse  take on credit card debt to fund consumption (US credit card debt is growing at the fastest pace in a decade  while the savings rate for US households is near all-time lows). Households are also facing pressure from the higher cost of debt  which is feeding through into collapsing demand for large-ticket items  such as new homes and new auto purchases. These are the largest assets for the average household  and both home and used car prices have been under severe pressure. Consumers are being hit from all sides but job losses have yet to become widespread. We are therefore keeping a close eye on the general consumer environment with all the pressures that are building.MistakesWe constantly assess and review our past investments  aiming to improve our decision-making going forward. For every investment  we like to conduct a pre-mortem review (to identify risks and how an investment can go wrong when we first make the investment) and then a post-mortem review to understand the extent to which our investment thesis did or did not play out after the fact  with an emphasis on identifying mistakes and learning from these. We think this is a critical process so that we can improve and avoid repeating errors going forward.As previously highlighted  our high exposure to technology  high-growth oriented businesses drove the bulk of our underperformance in CY22. One key mistake we made was with Qualtrics (XM)  which was the second largest detractor in the year. With the benefit of hindsight  we over-estimated the company‚Äôs growth profile and overpaid for the business. We assumed the category would be more resilient even in an environment where customers are scrutinising IT budgets and we failed to change our mind when growth began to disappoint. Our valuation approach was also overly reliant on long-term free cashflows ‚Äì because we like to think about businesses with a long-term mindset ‚Äì but we did not pay enough attention to near-term valuations and expectations. Lastly  we were insufficiently critical when XM announced a large acquisition at the peak of the software bubble in mid-2021  as this was a potential sign that the outlook for XM‚Äôs core business had deteriorated.The big lesson that we draw from our XM investment is one of sizing ‚Äì given the wide range of outcomes  this should have been reflected through a smaller-sized investment. We continue to own XM today as the valuation and expectations have been reset  and XM remains the undisputed leader in an emerging  mission-critical software category with a long growth runway. This view has been substantiated by our conversations with customers at the XM Innovation Sydney event in November 2022 and recent CIO surveys affirming XM‚Äôs pole position amongst emerging software vendors. In recent days  SAP have announced a strategic review of its XM stake  removing a key overhang for the stock and increasing the probability that XM will trade more in line with peers or be acquired.IAC was another key detractor during the year  as we made the mistake of holding onto our investment for too long. A key part of our original IAC thesis was underpinned by a near-term catalyst in the form of an upcoming spin-off (Vimeo) providing a chance to crystallise value and for the business to narrow the discount to its sum-of-the-parts. While this thesis played out  we then held onto our IAC investment  thinking the business continued to trade at a meaningful discount to the value of the assets it owned. We failed to appreciate that IAC was entering a ‚Äòre-build‚Äô stage and  given the lack of upcoming spin-offs  would continue to trade at a deep discount to the value of its net assets.In addition  IAC undertook a meaningful acquisition (Meredith)  which is a business complementary to one of its existing assets (Dotdash). This increased IAC‚Äôs exposure to the advertising market (Dotdash & Meredith generate all revenues through advertising) at a time when the ad market was starting to slow. We made the mistake of not realising quickly enough that the integration of the two businesses was taking longer and facing some hiccups  which  in turn  caused management to delay its financial targets. One of IAC‚Äôs other businesses  Angi  similarly faced issues with its strategic direction  leading to management changes and the IAC CEO having to step in to turn around the business. Overall  a key mistake we made was failing to appreciate that investments relying on sum-of-the-parts valuations tend to perform poorly in weaker market conditions when investors demand a larger discount versus the net asset value ‚Äì unless there is a clear path to unlock value (e.g. through a spin-off). We continue to own IAC as we believe that the management team are now addressing the recent issues appropriately and that their actions can assist with closing the large discount to net assets over time.As we mentioned at the start  we have gone through an extensive process of scrutinising all of our key positions and re-underwriting assumptions. We feel excited about our current portfolio but acknowledge the need to remain mentally flexible to avoid mistakes and to change our mind quickly when we think our investment thesis is drifting.Portfolio UpdateBelow we provide an update on some of our key holdings.CME (~12% weighting)CME is a business likely familiar to you  being one we have owned in our global strategy since 2008 and which was our largest VG1 position at the end of 2022.CME operates futures and derivatives exchanges  including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  the New York Mercantile Exchange  the Chicago Board of Trade  and the Dow Jones Index Services. On top of this  CME also owns other key assets related to foreign exchange trading & infrastructure and a strategic shareholding in Standard & Poor‚Äôs (S&P) Index business.The key driver of trading activity for CME is in its interest rate derivatives products  where it has an effective monopoly in the exchange trading of interest rate derivatives in the United States  with benchmark products across the entirety of the interest rate curve. Demand for interest rate derivatives is driven by volatility in interest rate markets  whose effect is compounded by the number of bonds held by those looking to manage interest rate risk and  by extension  market liquidity. The below chart of average daily volumes of interest rate derivatives and US Federal debt held by the public illustrates the extremely strong relationship the size of the US Treasury market and volumes growth  although there are deviations around this primarily around Fed intervention (for example  at the start of the pandemic  volumes were suppressed by an enormous amount of Quantitative Easing (QE) and effectively zero interest rates which reduced the demand for hedging products). We expect the growth in the size of the US Treasury market  particularly in relation to privately held US treasuries as the Fed undergoes a balance sheet unwind  to remain a powerful underpinning of CME‚Äôs interest rate derivatives business.Size of the US Federal Debt Held by the Public vs Average Daily Volume of CME Interest Rate ContractsSource: CME Group  Congressional Budget Office.As such  we are high conviction that the reversal of QE and the normalisation of bond market conditions will provide a significant tailwind for CME‚Äôs trading activity in the near term  while its net interest margin should benefit from greater investment income on margin collateral. Other derivatives complexes  including equity and energy  are likely to also benefit from a normalisation of market conditions and we note that incremental futures contracts generate an extremely high drop-through rate to cash earnings due to CME‚Äôs strong operating leverage as a primarily digital platform. As a result  we believe current conditions are highly favourable for CME‚Äôs interest rate derivatives business  other derivatives complexes and net interest margin and we see substantial upside risk to consensus earnings and free cashflow estimates.At writing  CME is trading at a CY23 PE of 20x  free cashflow yield of 6% and dividend yield of 5%.Amazon (~12% weighting)Amazon is a dominant player in e-commerce (#1 globally)  cloud computing (#1 globally)  and digital advertising (#3 globally)  all massive and structurally growing end markets. Amazon‚Äôs share price declined nearly 50% in calendar 2022 due to a myriad of macro and company-specific headwinds  including slowing economic growth  rising inflation  tighter monetary policy  and substantial overinvestment. Free cashflow turned deeply negative. We are disappointed  to say the least. Nevertheless  the investment case for Amazon today is remarkably compelling. Market expectations have been reset  the valuation is extremely attractive  and management is intent on improving profitability and reducing capital intensity. Amazon remains a high conviction holding and we are incredibly excited by its prospects.For the past year  the market has been concerned about the growth and profit outlook for its e-commerce business  which is presently loss-making due to overinvestment and cost inflation. Management has responded by laying off more than 18 000 employees ‚Äî the biggest reduction in Amazon‚Äôs history. Beyond the reduction in force  Amazon has frozen hiring in its e-commerce and corporate divisions  cancelled or delayed warehouse openings  raised prices on a variety of products (including Prime memberships)  eliminated several unprofitable lines of business and seeded new ones (e.g. Buy with Prime) to fill excess capacity. (Amazon doubled the size of its e-commerce footprint over 2020-2021.) Buy with Prime has been shown to increase shopper conversion by 25% on average and is now widely available to US-based merchants.Looking past the short-term headwinds  we are highly optimistic about the trajectory of the e-commerce business. Whilst logistics investments have led to short-term losses  they have strengthened the competitive moat of the e-commerce business and its ability to meet customer demand for years to come. E-commerce is a highly valuable business which has spawned the 3rd largest advertising business in the world (the best search results in the world for advertisers are those of Amazon customers) and a subscription business (Amazon Prime) which acts as a powerful flywheel to e-commerce and other business lines such as devices  streaming video/music and soon satellite broadband (via Amazon‚Äôs Kuiper business). We think the market is overly pessimistic about the prospects for e-commerce (inclusive of advertising) and underwrite scenarios where we estimate the e-commerce business alone is worth more than US$60 per share.As we wrote last year  we reiterate our view that Amazon‚Äôs current share price is more than underpinned by its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business alone. Cloud computing remains in the early stages of growth  with customers across the industry only around 30% through the migration of their workloads from onpremise infrastructure to the cloud  based on commentary from industry experts  key corporates and Chief Technology Officers. Until recently  cloud spending has been largely resilient amidst macro headwinds. This changed last result when all three hyper-scalers warned of a slowdown in growth as enterprises scrutinise technology budgets. Indeed  Amazon is proactively working with its customers to cost-optimise  which will have a negative impact on short-term sales growth but is the prudent long-term business decision. As a result  we forecast AWS growth to slow further in 2023 before re-accelerating in 2024. The long-term revenue growth profile of AWS remains robust  and sustainable operating margins have the potential to exceed 40% given a concentrated industry structure  AWS scale advantages  and a mix shift toward value-added software.As we look to the future  Amazon‚Äôs focus on improving operating efficiencies  reducing working capital  and lowering capital expenditures should result in an exponential increase in free cashflow and shareholder value. We forecast a return to positive free cashflow in 2023. By 2025  we expect free cashflow to exceed US$70 billion  representing a growing 8% free cashflow yield  which we consider incredibly attractive for an asset of this quality.Deutsche B√∂rse (~7% weighting)On the back of recent purchases and relative share price performance  Deutsche B√∂rse (DB1) has grown to the portfolio‚Äôs third largest position. DB1 is a well-diversified exchange group whose activities touch most aspects of European capital markets  offering a blend of transactional and non-transactional revenue exposure. It provides trading  clearing  pre/post-trading and data & analytic services in four key operating segments: Trading & Clearing  Fund Services  Security Services and Data & Analytics.The transactional side of the business  like CME  has strong structural tailwinds as artificial depression of policy rates by central banks coupled with QE in the Eurozone begin to reverse and DB1‚Äôs Trading & Clearing businesses (including Europe‚Äôs largest derivatives exchange Eurex) benefit from a larger hedging market and continued macro volatility. Current uncertainty also benefits its EEX business (the dominant venue for power trading in Europe)  which is poised to grow as tension in European energy markets  and the ongoing structural shift in electricity generation to renewables  continues to support trading activity. As per CME  DB1 operates a digital platform which enables an extremely high drop through to cash earnings from each incremental dollar of trading revenue.On the other side  Clearstream is the keystone to DB1‚Äôs non-transactional revenue stream  with over US$13.5trn of securities in custody (including around 40% of Eurobonds in issue and 100% of all issued securities in Germany). Because of the size and stickiness of Eurobond custody assets  much of Clearstream‚Äôs revenue base is highly stable and the rising rate backdrop acts as a strong tailwind for net interest margin earnings (as greater collateral margin requirements  coupled with increased yields  produces powerful earnings potential for the group); this had previously been a source of downgrades during 2019-21. Moreover  we expect the acquisition of ISS within the Data & Analytics segment to drive long-term non-transactional revenues by expanding the scope and quality of DB1's ESG offering as demand for ESG products continues to accelerate.Despite these strong tailwinds and solid execution over the last year  DB1 trades at a discount relative to peers and below our fair valuation. We view this as unjustified given the quality of earnings and organic growth potential. At writing  DB1 is trading on a CY23 free cashflow yield of 6%  PE of 16x and a dividend yield of 3%.Richemont (~7% weighting)Richemont is a position we have written extensively about since 2019. It remains a Top 10 holding and the business continued to perform strongly during 2022.Demand for high-end luxury has proved sustainable thus far  as the top 1% of households by net worth continue to spend more on luxury items such as jewellery  watches and handbags. Richemont‚Äôs super luxury jewellery brands  Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels  are the crown jewels of the group‚Äôs portfolio of brands; these account for the majority of Richemont‚Äôs profitability and  consistent with our investment thesis  have posted accelerating revenue growth in recent periods.Geographically  the highlight has been Europe  where growth was led by strong local demand and the resumption of inbound tourism from the US and Middle East. Asia Pacific was weaker during 2022 because of the store closures in mainland China and Macau due to the enforcement of the zero-COVID policy in China. However  given China‚Äôs recent reopening under less stringent COVID policies  we expect Chinese demand to rebound and turn into a tailwind this year (note that this has already started to be reflected in expectations with a 17% re-rate over the last few weeks).One of the reasons we have long admired and invested in super-luxury businesses is their pricing power. Higher prices add to the allure of luxury products while simultaneously creating exclusivity. Encouragingly  during 2022  Richemont raised prices on key brands such as Cartier and Van Cleef and across multiple geographies  a trend which we expect to continue going forward. Financially  price increases are highly attractive as the revenue delta drops straight through to the bottom line. This  alongside operating leverage  has allowed Richemont to expand margins.During 2022  Richemont reached an agreement to sell its online operations  YNAP  to Farfetch  the leading luxury e-commerce retailer. The disposal of YNAP has been a key part of our CFR investment thesis  as we believed this was a distraction for management and masked underlying profitability. This has simplified the story for investors: the deal will allow Richemont to retain upside on the equity of both YNAP and Farfetch and allow management to focus wholly on running Richemont‚Äôs core business.We have recently started to reduce our portfolio weighting in Richemont. The recent share price increase is reducing the risk-reward profile and we think this is the best of times for luxury goods companies.SAP (~7% weighting)SAP is in the midst of a multi-year transition of its business to the cloud which continues to gain momentum. We attribute much of its success ‚Äì which has not been without challenges and setbacks ‚Äì to the strategy initiated by Christian Klein after he became sole CEO in mid-2020  in particular ‚ÄúRISE with SAP.‚Äù Launched in January 2021  RISE is a commercial construct to migrate customers onto SAP cloud products such as S/4HANA Cloud (Cloud ERP) and SAP‚Äôs Business Technology Platform (BTP).Late last year  we travelled to Germany and met with SAP management to learn more about BTP specifically. The platform offers data and application services which customers and partners can use to integrate SAP and non-SAP applications  in effect a ‚Äúdigital core‚Äù with powerful flywheel effects. It is foundational to SAP‚Äôs RISE offering with 80% of customers adopting the platform. The BTP business has a sales run rate exceeding ‚Ç¨1.5 billion with high margins and we expect it to grow substantially over the next few years.SAP‚Äôs cloud transition has resulted in some one-time and duplicative costs (infrastructure  R&D and sales)  resulting in a circa ‚Ç¨200 million lower operating profit in 2022 versus 2019  despite circa ‚Ç¨3 billion higher sales. Having studied these transitions  we believe the shift is camouflaging the underlying earnings power of what will be higher quality earnings (>80% recurring revenue). We expect the one-time and duplicative costs will dissipate from 2023 onwards  resulting in positive operating leverage and sustainable double-digit operating profit growth.Recent results from SAP have been mostly supportive of our thesis with leading indicators  specifically Current Cloud Backlog  accelerating despite macroeconomic uncertainties. The BTP flywheel has improved integration between SAP‚Äôs cloud modules (SuccessFactors  Concur  etc.) and S/4HANA  leading to improved cross-sell/upsell rates. Recent results from back-office software peers Oracle and Workday have also been resilient.SAP‚Äôs moat is stable-to-growing and the business is well-positioned in many of the world‚Äôs largest corporations as an essential component of their IT operating platform. Our field trip to Germany gave us incremental confidence that the strategy is gaining traction following a painful period of transition. We also view the appointment of a new CFO  Dominik Asam  who joins in March from Airbus and has a solid reputation  as one of the many positive catalysts building in the business.Given the cloud transition and some execution missteps  SAP trades at a meaningful discount to fair value. Earnings are poised to accelerate as they execute on the cloud transition. In our view  a more meaningful reflection of the company‚Äôs earnings power requires looking out to at least 2025  with SAP trading at a 6% free cashflow yield and a 15.5x PER on our forecasts.New LONG Position: Walt Disney Co. (~4% weighting)The Walt Disney Company is a diversified media conglomerate operating media networks  theme parks  film and TV studios and direct-to-consumer streaming services. It is the global leader in theme parks with hotels and cruise lines aimed at families. Key assets within Disney are the instantly recognisable entertainment franchises that have multiple avenues of monetisation such as Mickey Mouse  Star Wars  ABC and Marvel‚Äôs Avengers.Disney‚Äôs share price declined due to a number of factors in 2022  presenting us the chance to purchase a long-admired business and its unique collection of valuable intellectual property assets at what we consider to be a very attractive valuation. Summarily  the EPS of Disney has declined from US$7 in 2018 to ~US$2.60 in 2022 but we believe that the earnings power of the assets has not diminished to anywhere near this extent.Disney is currently undergoing a business transition within the Media and Entertainment Distribution division (DMED) from traditional media property distribution via third parties (i.e. cinemas and broadcast networks) to a Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) model via the Disney+ streaming service. A key element of our thesis is that the earnings power of the company is currently being masked by the marketing and content investments within Disney+ and that this will normalise over the next several years. To put this in perspective  Disney+ (DTC sub-segment) currently generates operating losses of over US$3.3bn (a negative 14% operating margin) compared to operating margins at its nearest streaming competitor  Netflix  of +15.5%.A secondary concern around Disney has been the CEO leadership transition from Bob Iger to Bob Chapek that occurred in February 2020. As well documented in the media  the changes that Bob Chapek made to the organisational structure of the business affecting the creative output at Disney did not resonate with senior executives nor investors and he was ultimately removed by the board. Hollywood loves a sequel ‚Äì Bob Iger was sensationally reinstated to the CEO role in November of 2022. During his original tenure as CEO  Mr Iger was a well-respected leader  overseeing successful acquisitions of Pixar  Marvel Entertainment and Lucasfilm. We view the board actions as supportive of long-term shareholder value creation as Mr Iger seeks to unify the executive team and navigate the company through the current challenges.The resilient cashflows of the Disney components have allowed it to invest heavily in the DTC content space and give the management team the necessary flexibility to prove out the earnings power of the business. In this context  it would be remiss of us to not discuss the Parks  Experiences and Products division (PEP) of Disney  which makes up 35% of revenue and 49% of operating profits (ex DTC losses) but has been overlooked recently given the intense focus on the media business. PEP is a solid business  with the opportunity to invest alongside the core franchises in a ‚Äòflywheel‚Äô of value creation (i.e. Star Wars and Avengers attractions at Parks). After suffering as a result of COVID  the business has bounced back remarkably well  with operating profit now 8% above the FY19 level. Further upside will come from the full re-opening of International Parks ‚Äì prior to COVID these represented 10% of operating profit of the division. Contrary to conventional wisdom  Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) in this business is estimated at 18% and there is further opportunity to invest material amounts of capital at high rates of return.When we built our stake  Disney was trading at more than a 35% discount to fair value  and we could underwrite the valuation if the streaming business simply broke even. On our FY26 estimates  Disney is trading on a 7% FCFF (free cashflow) yield  despite profitability still being depressed and continuing to reinvest aggressively as highlighted. Using conservative profitability assumptions  we expect the stock to re-rate back to a 4-5% free cashflow yield in FY26.Walt Disney (DIS) DTC Operating Profit and FCFF YieldSource: Company filings  VGI Partners analysis.New LONG Position: Rheinmetall AG (~4% weighting)Increased geopolitical tensions in 2022 have created a renewed willingness by nations to invest in defence capabilities and energy security. Whilst not traditionally an area of focus for VGI  team members have been conscious of this theme and on the lookout for any investment opportunities that may arise as a result. The return of travel in a post-COVID world enabled several members of the team to get back on the road and do one thing we love as part of the investing process ‚Äì meet in-person with management teams and extensively tour company facilities. After several preliminary calls  we were able to meet with Rheinmetall management in person in late 2022 and came away impressed with the management team and their shareholder alignment  with incentive compensation linked to Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and operating cashflow  unique in the European market.Rheinmetall is an international systems provider for defence products  with regional leadership positions in weapons and ammunition  vehicle systems and electronic solutions. There are a number of elements to the moat of the business: a) the currently approved production facilities in a highly sensitive areas (air defence systems  weapons and vehicle systems) where barriers to entry are high  b) technological capabilities and c) relationships with key customers.The conflict in Ukraine has provided the catalyst for a significant renewal of defence capabilities across the European region  with NATO signatories having committed to significantly increase their spending after a long period of material under-investment; Rheinmetall will grow with these commitments. The current war is seeing supplies rapidly diminish through direct/indirect transfers and it is estimated that 10 years could be required to replenish German stocks to NATO commitment levels in Rheinmetall‚Äôs ‚Äòhome‚Äô market. In light of this  the German government has increased its defence spending commitment to 2% of GDP and established a 100bn euro special fund. New members have joined NATO and other countries have also committed larger percentages of budget spending to defence (Spain and Italy: 1.4% to 2%; UK: 2.2% to 3%). These commitments provide a strong multi-year tailwind to the Rheinmetall business.Over the last several years  Rheinmetall has been undergoing a portfolio transformation process as it seeks to become a pure play defence technology business. Traditionally  the business has had a large exposure to Auto Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) customers (and Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles in particular) with ~50% of the revenue and operating profits in the business coming from the auto division in 2018. Whilst the company has made investments to capture component revenue from EVs  their exposure to the ICE supply chain has been a drag on the trading multiple and sentiment. Recent portfolio management activities have created a ‚Äòcleaner‚Äô business with higher expected ROIC. Disposal of the pistons unit removes automotive revenue exposure and we project that  following a shrewd recent acquisition in the ammunition space (Expal)  by FY25 ~70% of sales and over 80% of profits will come from the defence division.Rheinmetall Sales and EBITSource: Company filings  VGI Partners analysis.From a valuation perspective  we believe that there are a number of areas supporting valuation. Rheinmetall has a strong history of dividend payments  with dividends increasing at an 18% CAGR from FY17-22. At the FY22 Investor Day  Rheinmetall committed to increasing the dividend payout ratio from 35% to 40% ‚Äì at expected FY25 dividend of 7.5 per share and assuming the business trades in line with historical dividend yields  we believe the shares are trading at a more than 20% discount to fair value. Historically Rheinmetall has traded in a range of 5x-7x EV/EBITDA ‚Äì with a chance to re-rate to 6x-8x EV/EBITDA on a significantly higher earnings base.European defence names generally trade at a significant discount to their US peers  but with such strong budgetary commitments  we see optionality here for a re-rate. The US defence landscape re-rated post a budgetary change from 2011-2020. The French defence budget markedly increased post the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014  providing a tailwind to Thales.Potential risks here stem from the lumpiness of defence sector contracts ‚Äì indeed we have already seen during our ownership period a delay in several contract awards  but we view these as short-term setbacks vs the longer arc of renewed defence spending in Europe. Further risks are in the relationship with key customers  such as the German government  highlighted by a recent issue with PUMA tanks malfunctioning in live fire exercises. Any export controls would also be a cause of concern given the business has 35% ex Europe revenue exposure and cause us to review the investment thesis.Exited Position: Olympus (~8% weighting)We flagged in our last investor letter that we had started reducing our holding in Olympus  the global leader in the manufacturing of gastrointestinal endoscopes. Since then  we have completely exited the position after generating an attractive return on our investment (the stock compounded at ~18% p.a. during our holding period). We took the view that Olympus had reached a close-to-fair valuation and we saw less scope for further margin improvement in the near term following the restructuring programs already instituted by management. The stock has fallen by 20% since our sale and we are continuing to follow it closely in case we see an opportunity to re-initiate a position. Given the appeal of the healthcare industry  where there are a number of high-quality businesses with durable moats and attractive growth opportunities  we have already found better uses of capital and started building stakes in two other healthcare businesses.In ClosingRecent returns have been truly disappointing and  in our opinion  not representative of our team‚Äôs collective efforts nor the underlying quality of the portfolio we hold  which we strongly believe is materially under-valued.Since VGI Partners‚Äô establishment in 2008  we have been entirely focused on managing our portfolio. Our commitment is to preserve and grow our collective capital over the long term  regardless of the market environment  by owning a portfolio of high-quality businesses which have been purchased with a margin of safety coupled with a series of businesses that have utterly under-appreciated or subject to camouflaged quality characteristics ignored by the crowd.When we have made errors in the past  we have learnt from them and kept moving forward. Our performance in 2022 has generated much self-reflection and self-assessment. We can do better and we will do better.To be clear  we cannot eliminate short-term volatility from our returns; however  we are more confident than ever that our process and investment philosophy position our portfolio to produce attractive returns over the long term and through the cycle.We are very grateful that we have long-term oriented investors who entrust us with their capital.

Further  the Board of Directors proposes that ¬ß 11 of the Articles of Association is amended so that a General Meeting  in addition to being able to be held in Gothenburg  may also be held in Stockholm.Current wording ¬ß 4 Proposed wording ¬ß 4 The company's share capital shall be no less than SEK 75 000 000 and no more than SEK 300 000 000.

General Meetings shall be held in Gothenburg or Stockholm. An Annual General Meeting shall be held in G√∂teborg or Stockholm within six months of the expiry of each financial year.Item 17 ‚Äì Resolution on the approval of the remuneration report.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' remuneration report.Item 18 ‚Äì Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on an issue of new shares  either applying or disapplying shareholders' preferential rights.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on new share issues  on one or several occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and that shares corresponding to maximum ten per cent (10%) of the Company's share capital as of the date for the first exercise of the authorisation may be issued. Further  the proposal implies that an issue may be made against cash payment  by set-off or by contribution in kind. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  shares shall be issued on market terms. The purpose of the Board of Directors' proposal is to (i) enable the Company to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses by issuing new shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisition of real property  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions; and/or (ii) enable the Company to strengthen its financial position and/or create a larger liquidity buffer for financing commitments.Item 19 ‚Äì Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on an issue of new shares  applying the shareholders' preferential rights.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on new share issues  on one or several occasions  with preferential rights for the shareholders  for the purpose of strengthening the Company's financial position. The total number of shares that may be issued by virtue of the authorisation shall amount to the number of shares that corresponds to issue proceeds of approximately SEK 10 billion. Other terms and conditions for the new share issue shall be determined by the Board of Directors.Item 20 ‚Äì Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on acquisitions and transfers of the Company's own shares.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on acquisition on one or several occasions  of the Company's own shares provided that the Company after each acquisition will not hold more than ten per cent (10%) of all the shares in the Company  and to transfer all of the Company's own shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. The objective of the Board of Directors' proposal is to allow the Company to adapt its capital structure to its capital needs from time to time and thereby contribute to an increased shareholder value  and/or to transfer own shares as payment in order to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses or by using own shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisition of real property  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions. This objective does not allow the Company to trade with its own shares for the short-term purpose of making a profit.Item 21 ‚Äì Resolution to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to reduce the Company's share capital by an amount of SEK 8 665 500 by way of cancellation of the 17 331 000 own shares held by the Company as of the date of this notice. The reduction amount shall be allocated to unrestricted equity.The resolution to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares is conditional upon the Board of Directors utilising the authorisation proposed to be resolved by the Annual General Meeting in accordance with item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting.The resolution to reduce the share capital may be carried out without obtaining an authorisation from the Swedish Companies Registration Office  since the resolution will not be executed unless the Company simultaneously carries out a rights issue by means of the Board of Directors' exercise of the authorisation proposed to be resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting as set out in item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting. This entails that the share capital  after the rights issue  will increase by an amount exceeding the amount that the share capital is being reduced with as set out above. Combined  these measures entail that neither the Company's restricted equity nor its share capital is reduced as a result of the cancellation of own shares.Resolutions proposed by the Nomination CommitteeThe Nomination Committee  consisting of Helen Fasth Gillstedt (Chair of the Nomination Committee) appointed by Handelsbanken Fonder  Ralf Spann appointed by Akelius Residential Property AB (publ)  Patrik Tillman appointed by M2 Asset Management AB and M2 Capital Management AB  Johannes Wingborg appointed by L√§nsf√∂rs√§kringar Fondf√∂rvaltning AB (publ)  and Per Berggren  Chair of the Board of Directors  has made the following proposals:Item 1 ‚Äì Election of the Chair of the meeting.The Nomination Committee proposes the attorney Wilhelm L√ºning to preside as Chair of the Annual General Meeting.Item 12 ‚Äì Determination of the number of members of the Board of Directors and auditors and deputy auditors.The Board of Directors is proposed to consist of seven Board members and the number of auditors is proposed to be one with no deputy auditor.Item 13 ‚Äì Determination of the remuneration to be paid to the members of the Board of Directors and the auditor.Remuneration to the members of the Board of Directors is proposed to be the following (2022 remuneration within brackets).The Chair of the Board of Directors: SEK 1 110 000 (SEK 1 075 000).Each of the other members of the Board of Directors: SEK 450 000 (SEK 440 000).Chair of the People Committee: SEK 100 000 (SEK 100 000).Each of the other members of the People Committee: SEK 75 000 (SEK 75 000).Chair of the Audit Committee: SEK 220 000 (SEK 220 000).Each of the other members of the Audit Committee: SEK 105 000 (SEK 105 000).A member of the Board of Directors who is employed by the Company shall not receive remuneration.It is proposed that the auditor's fee shall be paid upon approval of its invoices.Item 14 ‚Äì Election of members of the Board of Directors and Chair of the Board of Directors.The existing Board members Per Berggren  Anna-Karin Celsing  Henrik K√§ll  Joacim Sj√∂berg and Leiv Synnes are proposed to be re-elected as Board members.

Performance outcome of the established performance targets will be determined by the Board after the expiry of the three-year performance period in 2026. If the maximum performance level is reached or exceeded  the allocation will amount to (and will not exceed) the maximum number of Performance Shares following from items c) and d). If performance is below the maximum level but exceeds the minimum level  a proportionate allocation of shares will be made. No allocation will be made if performance amounts to or is below the minimum level. Information on the performance targets and the outcome will be provided no later than in connection with the allocation of Performance Shares in accordance with item g).g. If all conditions in the Share Program 2023 are met  allocation of Performance Shares will take place in the first half of 2026. Allocation will be free of charge except for tax liabilities.h. Certain deviations in or adjustments of the terms and conditions for the Share Program 2023 may be made based on local rules and regulations as well as applicable market practice or market conditions or where appropriate due to group re-organizations  including cash settlement instead of delivery of shares under certain circumstances.i. The Board of Directors  or a committee established by the Board for these purposes  shall be responsible for the preparation and management of the Share Program 2023  within the framework of the aforementioned terms and conditions.j. If material changes would occur within the Electrolux Group or on the market that  according to the Board's assessment  would lead to the conditions for allocation of Performance Shares no longer being reasonable  the Board will have the right to make also other adjustments of the Share Program 2023  including e.g. a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of shares.Costs for the Share Program 2023The total costs for the Share Program 2023 if the maximum number of Performance Shares are delivered  are estimated to a maximum of SEK 639m  which corresponds to approximately 3.1 per cent of total employment cost for 2022. The costs will be recognized over the years 2023-2025. The costs have been calculated as the sum of salary costs  including social costs  and administration costs for the program. Administration costs are estimated to be less than SEK 1m. If no allotment of shares is made  only administration costs will arise.The costs have been calculated based on the value  at the start of the program  of the Performance Shares that may be allotted at maximum performance  with a reduction of the present value of estimated dividend payments during a three-year period. The estimate on maximum costs assumes maximum performance and that the number of participants that will leave the Group during the performance period is the same as the historical average since the introduction of share programs in 2004. In the calculation  a maximum share price of SEK 247 per share has been applied.If repurchased own shares would be allocated under the program the number of outstanding shares is estimated to increase with not more than 3 965 000 shares of series B.5 Such maximum increase would have a dilutive effect on earnings per share of approximately 1.38 per cent. The total maximum increase in the number of outstanding shares of all outstanding share programs is estimated to not more than 7 874 000 shares of series B  corresponding to a dilutive effect on earnings per share of approximately 2.71 per cent. In this calculation  maximum allotment of shares has been assumed for Share Program 2023 and expected allotment has been assumed for the share programs for 2021 and 2022.Hedging measures for the Share Program 2023In order to implement Share Program 2023 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors has considered various methods for transfer of shares to the participants. The Board of Directors has found that the most cost-effective alternative is transfer of own shares  and thus proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on transfer of own shares in accordance with item 17 b) below.Should the majority required under item 17 b) below not be reached  Electrolux intends to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party.17 b) Resolution on transfers of own shares to the participants in Share Program 2023In order to secure the delivery of Performance Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the company shall transfer a maximum of 3 965 000 shares of series B in the company on the following terms and conditions:The right to receive shares shall be granted to such persons within the Electrolux Group covered by the terms and conditions pursuant to Share Program 2023. Furthermore  subsidiaries within the Electrolux Group shall have the right to acquire shares  free of consideration  and such subsidiaries shall be obligated to immediately transfer  free of consideration  shares to employees covered by the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023. The employee shall have the right to receive shares during the period when the employee is entitled to receive shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023  i.e. in 2026. Employees covered by the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023 shall receive shares of series B in the company free of consideration. The number of shares of series B in Electrolux that may be transferred under Share Program 2023 will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.Majority requirementsThe resolution of the Annual General Meeting to implement the program according to item 17 a) above requires that more than half of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting approve the proposal. The Annual General Meeting's resolution on transfer of own shares  according to item 17 b) above requires that shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the proposal.Preparation of the proposal for the Share Program 2023The proposal regarding the Share Program 2023 has been prepared by the People Committee and the Board of Directors.Previous incentive programs in ElectroluxFor a description of the company's other share related incentive programs  reference is made to the Annual Report for 2022  note 27  and the Group's website  www.electroluxgroup.com.

General Meetings shall be held in Gothenburg or Stockholm. An Annual General Meeting shall be held in G√∂teborg or Stockholm within six months of the expiry of each financial year.Item 17 ‚Äì Resolution on the approval of the remuneration report.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' remuneration report.Item 18 ‚Äì Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on an issue of new shares  either applying or disapplying shareholders' preferential rights.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on new share issues  on one or several occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and that shares corresponding to maximum ten per cent (10%) of the Company's share capital as of the date for the first exercise of the authorisation may be issued. Further  the proposal implies that an issue may be made against cash payment  by set-off or by contribution in kind. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  shares shall be issued on market terms. The purpose of the Board of Directors' proposal is to (i) enable the Company to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses by issuing new shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisition of real property  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions; and/or (ii) enable the Company to strengthen its financial position and/or create a larger liquidity buffer for financing commitments.Item 19 ‚Äì Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on an issue of new shares  applying the shareholders' preferential rights.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on new share issues  on one or several occasions  with preferential rights for the shareholders  for the purpose of strengthening the Company's financial position. The total number of shares that may be issued by virtue of the authorisation shall amount to the number of shares that corresponds to issue proceeds of approximately SEK 10 billion. Other terms and conditions for the new share issue shall be determined by the Board of Directors.Item 20 ‚Äì Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on acquisitions and transfers of the Company's own shares.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on acquisition on one or several occasions  of the Company's own shares provided that the Company after each acquisition will not hold more than ten per cent (10%) of all the shares in the Company  and to transfer all of the Company's own shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. The objective of the Board of Directors' proposal is to allow the Company to adapt its capital structure to its capital needs from time to time and thereby contribute to an increased shareholder value  and/or to transfer own shares as payment in order to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses or by using own shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisition of real property  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions. This objective does not allow the Company to trade with its own shares for the short-term purpose of making a profit.Item 21 ‚Äì Resolution to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to reduce the Company's share capital by an amount of SEK 8 665 500 by way of cancellation of the 17 331 000 own shares held by the Company as of the date of this notice. The reduction amount shall be allocated to unrestricted equity.The resolution to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares is conditional upon the Board of Directors utilising the authorisation proposed to be resolved by the Annual General Meeting in accordance with item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting.The resolution to reduce the share capital may be carried out without obtaining an authorisation from the Swedish Companies Registration Office  since the resolution will not be executed unless the Company simultaneously carries out a rights issue by means of the Board of Directors' exercise of the authorisation proposed to be resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting as set out in item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting. This entails that the share capital  after the rights issue  will increase by an amount exceeding the amount that the share capital is being reduced with as set out above. Combined  these measures entail that neither the Company's restricted equity nor its share capital is reduced as a result of the cancellation of own shares.Resolutions proposed by the Nomination CommitteeThe Nomination Committee  consisting of Helen Fasth Gillstedt (Chair of the Nomination Committee) appointed by Handelsbanken Fonder  Ralf Spann appointed by Akelius Residential Property AB (publ)  Patrik Tillman appointed by M2 Asset Management AB and M2 Capital Management AB  Johannes Wingborg appointed by L√§nsf√∂rs√§kringar Fondf√∂rvaltning AB (publ)  and Per Berggren  Chair of the Board of Directors  has made the following proposals:Item 1 ‚Äì Election of the Chair of the meeting.The Nomination Committee proposes the attorney Wilhelm L√ºning to preside as Chair of the Annual General Meeting.Item 12 ‚Äì Determination of the number of members of the Board of Directors and auditors and deputy auditors.The Board of Directors is proposed to consist of seven Board members and the number of auditors is proposed to be one with no deputy auditor.Item 13 ‚Äì Determination of the remuneration to be paid to the members of the Board of Directors and the auditor.Remuneration to the members of the Board of Directors is proposed to be the following (2022 remuneration within brackets).The Chair of the Board of Directors: SEK 1 110 000 (SEK 1 075 000) ..

For the purpose of adjusting the limits for the share capital and the number of shares in the Articles of Association in light of the Board of Directors' proposal to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve upon a rights issue as set out in item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting  the Board of Directors proposes to amend ¬ß 4 and ¬ß 5 in the Articles of Association in accordance with the below. Further  the Board of Directors proposes that ¬ß 11 of the Articles of Association is amended so that a General Meeting  in addition to being able to be held in Gothenburg  may also be held in Stockholm.

Item 17 ‚Äì Resolution on the approval of the remuneration report. The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' remuneration report. Item 18 ‚Äì Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on an issue of new shares  either applying or disapplying shareholders' preferential rights. The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on new share issues  on one or several occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and that shares corresponding to maximum ten per cent (10%) of the Company's share capital as of the date for the first exercise of the authorisation may be issued. Further  the proposal implies that an issue may be made against cash payment  by set-off or by contribution in kind. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  shares shall be issued on market terms. The purpose of the Board of Directors' proposal is to (i) enable the Company to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses by issuing new shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisition of real property  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions; and/or (ii) enable the Company to strengthen its financial position and/or create a larger liquidity buffer for financing commitments. Item 19 ‚Äì Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on an issue of new shares  applying the shareholders' preferential rights. The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on new share issues  on one or several occasions  with preferential rights for the shareholders  for the purpose of strengthening the Company's financial position. The total number of shares that may be issued by virtue of the authorisation shall amount to the number of shares that corresponds to issue proceeds of approximately SEK 10 billion. Other terms and conditions for the new share issue shall be determined by the Board of Directors. Item 20 ‚Äì Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on acquisitions and transfers of the Company's own shares. The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on acquisition on one or several occasions  of the Company's own shares provided that the Company after each acquisition will not hold more than ten per cent (10%) of all the shares in the Company  and to transfer all of the Company's own shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. The objective of the Board of Directors' proposal is to allow the Company to adapt its capital structure to its capital needs from time to time and thereby contribute to an increased shareholder value  and/or to transfer own shares as payment in order to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses or by using own shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisition of real property  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions. This objective does not allow the Company to trade with its own shares for the short-term purpose of making a profit. Item 21 ‚Äì Resolution to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares. The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to reduce the Company's share capital by an amount of SEK 8 665 500 by way of cancellation of the 17 331 000 own shares held by the Company as of the date of this notice. The reduction amount shall be allocated to unrestricted equity. The resolution to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares is conditional upon the Board of Directors utilising the authorisation proposed to be resolved by the Annual General Meeting in accordance with item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting. The resolution to reduce the share capital may be carried out without obtaining an authorisation from the Swedish Companies Registration Office  since the resolution will not be executed unless the Company simultaneously carries out a rights issue by means of the Board of Directors' exercise of the authorisation proposed to be resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting as set out in item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting. This entails that the share capital  after the rights issue  will increase by an amount exceeding the amount that the share capital is being reduced with as set out above. Combined  these measures entail that neither the Company's restricted equity nor its share capital is reduced as a result of the cancellation of own shares.

The Chairman of the Nomination Committee shall then contact the largest shareholder in terms of voting rights who has not previously been offered a seat.

Even though the Board of Directors currently has no intention to exercise an authorization to acquire additional own shares  the Board of Directors proposes the authorization is to be renewed as an authorization is valid until the following Annual General Meeting.

The Board is convinced that the proposed program will be beneficial to the company's shareholders as it will contribute to the possibilities to recruit and retain competent employees  is expected to increase the commitment and the motivation of the program participants and will strengthen the participants' ties to the Electrolux Group and its shareholders.Proposals of the Board of DirectorsThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves a) to implement Share Program 2023  and b) to transfer own shares  free of consideration  to the participants in Share Program 2023.17 a) Implementation of Share Program 2023The Board of Directors proposes  in view of the above  that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement Share Program 2023 with the following principal terms and conditions:a. The program is proposed to include up to 900 senior managers and key employees of the Electrolux Group  who are divided into seven groups; the President and CEO (""Group 1"")  other members of Group Management (""Group 2"")  and five additional groups for other senior managers and key employees (""Group 3-7""). Invitation to participate in the program shall be provided by Electrolux no later than on May 16  2023.b. Participants are offered to be allocated Performance Shares  provided that the participant remains employed until January 1  2026. Exemptions to this requirement may be prescribed in specific cases  including a participant's death  disability  retirement or the divestiture through a sale  spin-off or otherwise of the participant's employing company from the Electrolux Group.c. The Performance Shares shall be based on maximum performance values for each participant category. The maximum performance value for the participants in Group 1 will be 100 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 2  90 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 3  80 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 4  60 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 5  50 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 6  40 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  and for participants in Group 7  20 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023. The total sum of the maximum values of the Performance Shares thus defined for all participants will not exceed SEK 583m excluding social costs.d. Each maximum value shall thereafter be converted into a maximum number of Performance Shares1   based on the average closing price paid for Electrolux shares of series B on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of ten trading days before the day the participants are invited to participate in the program  reduced by the present value of estimated dividend payments for the period until shares are allotted.e. The calculation of the number of Performance Shares shall be connected to performance targets for the Group  for the performance period  established by the Board for (i) cumulative earnings per share2 and (ii) CO 2 reduction3. The performance targets adopted by the Board will stipulate a minimum level and a maximum level  with the relative weight of the performance targets (i) and (ii) being 80 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. For the participants in Group 1 and 2 (Group Management)  the granted Performance Shares based on (i) and (ii) will be multiplied by 0.75-1.25 depending on the outcome of a relative total shareholder return target4. The performance period is the financial years 2023-2025 with respect to each of the performance targets.f. Performance outcome of the established performance targets will be determined by the Board after the expiry of the three-year performance period in 2026. If the maximum performance level is reached or exceeded  the allocation will amount to (and will not exceed) the maximum number of Performance Shares following from items c) and d). If performance is below the maximum level but exceeds the minimum level  a proportionate allocation of shares will be made. No allocation will be made if performance amounts to or is below the minimum level. Information on the performance targets and the outcome will be provided no later than in connection with the allocation of Performance Shares in accordance with item g).g. If all conditions in the Share Program 2023 are met  allocation of Performance Shares will take place in the first half of 2026. Allocation will be free of charge except for tax liabilities.h. Certain deviations in or adjustments of the terms and conditions for the Share Program 2023 may be made based on local rules and regulations as well as applicable market practice or market conditions or where appropriate due to group re-organizations  including cash settlement instead of delivery of shares under certain circumstances.i. The Board of Directors  or a committee established by the Board for these purposes  shall be responsible for the preparation and management of the Share Program 2023  within the framework of the aforementioned terms and conditions.j. If material changes would occur within the Electrolux Group or on the market that  according to the Board's assessment  would lead to the conditions for allocation of Performance Shares no longer being reasonable  the Board will have the right to make also other adjustments of the Share Program 2023  including e.g. a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of shares.Costs for the Share Program 2023The total costs for the Share Program 2023 if the maximum number of Performance Shares are delivered  are estimated to a maximum of SEK 639m  which corresponds to approximately 3.1 per cent of total employment cost for 2022. The costs will be recognized over the years 2023-2025. The costs have been calculated as the sum of salary costs  including social costs  and administration costs for the program. Administration costs are estimated to be less than SEK 1m. If no allotment of shares is made  only administration costs will arise.The costs have been calculated based on the value  at the start of the program  of the Performance Shares that may be allotted at maximum performance  with a reduction of the present value of estimated dividend payments during a three-year period. The estimate on maximum costs assumes maximum performance and that the number of participants that will leave the Group during the performance period is the same as the historical average since the introduction of share programs in 2004. In the calculation  a maximum share price of SEK 247 per share has been applied.If repurchased own shares would be allocated under the program the number of outstanding shares is estimated to increase with not more than 3 965 000 shares of series B.5 Such maximum increase would have a dilutive effect on earnings per share of approximately 1.38 per cent. The total maximum increase in the number of outstanding shares of all outstanding share programs is estimated to not more than 7 874 000 shares of series B  corresponding to a dilutive effect on earnings per share of approximately 2.71 per cent. In this calculation  maximum allotment of shares has been assumed for Share Program 2023 and expected allotment has been assumed for the share programs for 2021 and 2022.Hedging measures for the Share Program 2023In order to implement Share Program 2023 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors has considered various methods for transfer of shares to the participants. The Board of Directors has found that the most cost-effective alternative is transfer of own shares  and thus proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on transfer of own shares in accordance with item 17 b) below.Should the majority required under item 17 b) below not be reached  Electrolux intends to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party.17 b) Resolution on transfers of own shares to the participants in Share Program 2023In order to secure the delivery of Performance Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the company shall transfer a maximum of 3 965 000 shares of series B in the company on the following terms and conditions:The right to receive shares shall be granted to such persons within the Electrolux Group covered by the terms and conditions pursuant to Share Program 2023. Furthermore  subsidiaries within the Electrolux Group shall have the right to acquire shares  free of consideration  and such subsidiaries shall be obligated to immediately transfer  free of consideration  shares to employees covered by the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023. The employee shall have the right to receive shares during the period when the employee is entitled to receive shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023  i.e. in 2026. Employees covered by the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023 shall receive shares of series B in the company free of consideration. The number of shares of series B in Electrolux that may be transferred under Share Program 2023 will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.Majority requirementsThe resolution of the Annual General Meeting to implement the program according to item 17 a) above requires that more than half of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting approve the proposal. The Annual General Meeting's resolution on transfer of own shares  according to item 17 b) above requires that shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the proposal.Preparation of the proposal for the Share Program 2023The proposal regarding the Share Program 2023 has been prepared by the People Committee and the Board of Directors.Previous incentive programs in ElectroluxFor a description of the company's other share related incentive programs  reference is made to the Annual Report for 2022  note 27  and the Group's website  www.electroluxgroup.com.

Further  the Board of Directors proposes that ¬ß 11 of the Articles of Association is amended so that a General Meeting  in addition to being able to be held in Gothenburg  may also be held in Stockholm.Current wording ¬ß 4 Proposed wording ¬ß 4 The company's share capital shall be no less than SEK 75 000 000 and no more than SEK 300 000 000.

General Meetings shall be held in Gothenburg or Stockholm. An Annual General Meeting shall be held in G√∂teborg or Stockholm within six months of the expiry of each financial year.Item 17 ‚Äì Resolution on the approval of the remuneration report.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' remuneration report.Item 18 ‚Äì Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on an issue of new shares  either applying or disapplying shareholders' preferential rights.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on new share issues  on one or several occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and that shares corresponding to maximum ten per cent (10%) of the Company's share capital as of the date for the first exercise of the authorisation may be issued. Further  the proposal implies that an issue may be made against cash payment  by set-off or by contribution in kind. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  shares shall be issued on market terms. The purpose of the Board of Directors' proposal is to (i) enable the Company to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses by issuing new shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisition of real property  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions; and/or (ii) enable the Company to strengthen its financial position and/or create a larger liquidity buffer for financing commitments.Item 19 ‚Äì Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on an issue of new shares  applying the shareholders' preferential rights.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on new share issues  on one or several occasions  with preferential rights for the shareholders  for the purpose of strengthening the Company's financial position. The total number of shares that may be issued by virtue of the authorisation shall amount to the number of shares that corresponds to issue proceeds of approximately SEK 10 billion. Other terms and conditions for the new share issue shall be determined by the Board of Directors.Item 20 ‚Äì Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on acquisitions and transfers of the Company's own shares.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on acquisition on one or several occasions  of the Company's own shares provided that the Company after each acquisition will not hold more than ten per cent (10%) of all the shares in the Company  and to transfer all of the Company's own shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. The objective of the Board of Directors' proposal is to allow the Company to adapt its capital structure to its capital needs from time to time and thereby contribute to an increased shareholder value  and/or to transfer own shares as payment in order to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses or by using own shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisition of real property  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions. This objective does not allow the Company to trade with its own shares for the short-term purpose of making a profit.Item 21 ‚Äì Resolution to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to reduce the Company's share capital by an amount of SEK 8 665 500 by way of cancellation of the 17 331 000 own shares held by the Company as of the date of this notice. The reduction amount shall be allocated to unrestricted equity.The resolution to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares is conditional upon the Board of Directors utilising the authorisation proposed to be resolved by the Annual General Meeting in accordance with item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting.The resolution to reduce the share capital may be carried out without obtaining an authorisation from the Swedish Companies Registration Office  since the resolution will not be executed unless the Company simultaneously carries out a rights issue by means of the Board of Directors' exercise of the authorisation proposed to be resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting as set out in item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting. This entails that the share capital  after the rights issue  will increase by an amount exceeding the amount that the share capital is being reduced with as set out above. Combined  these measures entail that neither the Company's restricted equity nor its share capital is reduced as a result of the cancellation of own shares.Resolutions proposed by the Nomination CommitteeThe Nomination Committee  consisting of Helen Fasth Gillstedt (Chair of the Nomination Committee) appointed by Handelsbanken Fonder  Ralf Spann appointed by Akelius Residential Property AB (publ)  Patrik Tillman appointed by M2 Asset Management AB and M2 Capital Management AB  Johannes Wingborg appointed by L√§nsf√∂rs√§kringar Fondf√∂rvaltning AB (publ)  and Per Berggren  Chair of the Board of Directors  has made the following proposals:Item 1 ‚Äì Election of the Chair of the meeting.The Nomination Committee proposes the attorney Wilhelm L√ºning to preside as Chair of the Annual General Meeting.Item 12 ‚Äì Determination of the number of members of the Board of Directors and auditors and deputy auditors.The Board of Directors is proposed to consist of seven Board members and the number of auditors is proposed to be one with no deputy auditor.Item 13 ‚Äì Determination of the remuneration to be paid to the members of the Board of Directors and the auditor.Remuneration to the members of the Board of Directors is proposed to be the following (2022 remuneration within brackets).The Chair of the Board of Directors: SEK 1 110 000 (SEK 1 075 000) ..

Even though the Board of Directors currently has no intention to exercise an authorization to acquire additional own shares  the Board of Directors proposes the authorization is to be renewed as an authorization is valid until the following Annual General Meeting. The Board of Directors would then be able to decide to repurchase own shares  if the conditions are appropriate and the Board of Directors were to find it would be in the best interests of the company and the shareholders.In view of the above  the Board of Directors proposes as follows.16 a) Acquisition of own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes the Annual General Meeting to authorize the Board of Directors  for the period until the next Annual General Meeting on one or several occasions  to resolve on acquisitions of shares in the company as follows.The company may acquire as a maximum so many shares of series B that  following each acquisition  the company holds at a maximum 10 per cent of all shares issued by the company. The shares may be acquired on Nasdaq Stockholm. Acquisition of shares may only be made at a price per share within the prevailing price interval for the share from time to time. Payment for the shares shall be made in cash.The purpose of the proposal is to be able to use repurchased shares on account of potential company acquisitions  the company's share related incentive programs as well as to be able to adapt the company's capital structure  thereby contributing to increased shareholder value.The Board of Directors has issued a statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act.16 b) Transfer of own shares on account of company acquisitionsThe Board of Directors proposes the Annual General Meeting to authorize the Board of Directors  for the period until the next Annual General Meeting on one or several occasions  to resolve on transfers of the company's own shares in connection with or as a consequence of company acquisitions as follows.Own shares of series B held by the company at the time of the Board of Director's decision may be transferred. The shares may be transferred with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. Transfer of shares may be made at a minimum price per share corresponding to an amount in close connection with the price of the company's shares on Nasdaq Stockholm at the time of the decision on the transfer. Payment for the transferred shares may be made in cash  by contributions in kind or by a set-off of company debt.16 c) Transfer of own shares on account of the share program for 2021The Board of Directors proposes  on account of the share program for 2021  that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the company shall be entitled  for the period until the next Annual General Meeting on one or several occasions  to transfer a maximum of 1 544 925 shares of series B in the company for the purpose of covering costs  including social security charges  that may arise as a result of the aforementioned program. Such transfers may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the prevailing price interval from time to time.Majority requirementIn order for the resolutions by the General Meeting in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposals under items 16 a)  b)  and c) above to be valid  the resolutions must be accepted by shareholders holding no less than two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the General Meeting.Item 17 ‚Äì Resolutions on a) implementation of a performance based  long-term share program for 2023  and b) transfer of own shares to the participants in the long-term share program for 2023BackgroundThe Board of Directors has decided to propose a long-term incentive program for 2023 (the ""Share Program 2023""). The Board is convinced that the proposed program will be beneficial to the company's shareholders as it will contribute to the possibilities to recruit and retain competent employees  is expected to increase the commitment and the motivation of the program participants and will strengthen the participants' ties to the Electrolux Group and its shareholders.Proposals of the Board of DirectorsThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves a) to implement Share Program 2023  and b) to transfer own shares  free of consideration  to the participants in Share Program 2023.17 a) Implementation of Share Program 2023The Board of Directors proposes  in view of the above  that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement Share Program 2023 with the following principal terms and conditions:a. The program is proposed to include up to 900 senior managers and key employees of the Electrolux Group  who are divided into seven groups; the President and CEO (""Group 1"")  other members of Group Management (""Group 2"")  and five additional groups for other senior managers and key employees (""Group 3-7""). Invitation to participate in the program shall be provided by Electrolux no later than on May 16  2023.b. Participants are offered to be allocated Performance Shares  provided that the participant remains employed until January 1  2026. Exemptions to this requirement may be prescribed in specific cases  including a participant's death  disability  retirement or the divestiture through a sale  spin-off or otherwise of the participant's employing company from the Electrolux Group.c. The Performance Shares shall be based on maximum performance values for each participant category. The maximum performance value for the participants in Group 1 will be 100 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 2  90 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 3  80 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 4  60 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 5  50 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 6  40 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  and for participants in Group 7  20 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023. The total sum of the maximum values of the Performance Shares thus defined for all participants will not exceed SEK 583m excluding social costs.d. Each maximum value shall thereafter be converted into a maximum number of Performance Shares1   based on the average closing price paid for Electrolux shares of series B on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of ten trading days before the day the participants are invited to participate in the program  reduced by the present value of estimated dividend payments for the period until shares are allotted.e. The calculation of the number of Performance Shares shall be connected to performance targets for the Group  for the performance period  established by the Board for (i) cumulative earnings per share2 and (ii) CO 2 reduction3. The performance targets adopted by the Board will stipulate a minimum level and a maximum level  with the relative weight of the performance targets (i) and (ii) being 80 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. For the participants in Group 1 and 2 (Group Management)  the granted Performance Shares based on (i) and (ii) will be multiplied by 0.75-1.25 depending on the outcome of a relative total shareholder return target4. The performance period is the financial years 2023-2025 with respect to each of the performance targets.f. Performance outcome of the established performance targets will be determined by the Board after the expiry of the three-year performance period in 2026. If the maximum performance level is reached or exceeded  the allocation will amount to (and will not exceed) the maximum number of Performance Shares following from items c) and d). If performance is below the maximum level but exceeds the minimum level  a proportionate allocation of shares will be made. No allocation will be made if performance amounts to or is below the minimum level. Information on the performance targets and the outcome will be provided no later than in connection with the allocation of Performance Shares in accordance with item g).g. If all conditions in the Share Program 2023 are met  allocation of Performance Shares will take place in the first half of 2026. Allocation will be free of charge except for tax liabilities.h. Certain deviations in or adjustments of the terms and conditions for the Share Program 2023 may be made based on local rules and regulations as well as applicable market practice or market conditions or where appropriate due to group re-organizations  including cash settlement instead of delivery of shares under certain circumstances.i. The Board of Directors  or a committee established by the Board for these purposes  shall be responsible for the preparation and management of the Share Program 2023  within the framework of the aforementioned terms and conditions.j. If material changes would occur within the Electrolux Group or on the market that  according to the Board's assessment  would lead to the conditions for allocation of Performance Shares no longer being reasonable  the Board will have the right to make also other adjustments of the Share Program 2023  including e.g. a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of shares.Costs for the Share Program 2023The total costs for the Share Program 2023 if the maximum number of Performance Shares are delivered  are estimated to a maximum of SEK 639m  which corresponds to approximately 3.1 per cent of total employment cost for 2022. The costs will be recognized over the years 2023-2025. The costs have been calculated as the sum of salary costs  including social costs  and administration costs for the program. Administration costs are estimated to be less than SEK 1m. If no allotment of shares is made  only administration costs will arise.The costs have been calculated based on the value  at the start of the program  of the Performance Shares that may be allotted at maximum performance  with a reduction of the present value of estimated dividend payments during a three-year period. The estimate on maximum costs assumes maximum performance and that the number of participants that will leave the Group during the performance period is the same as the historical average since the introduction of share programs in 2004. In the calculation  a maximum share price of SEK 247 per share has been applied.If repurchased own shares would be allocated under the program the number of outstanding shares is estimated to increase with not more than 3 965 000 shares of series B.5 Such maximum increase would have a dilutive effect on earnings per share of approximately 1.38 per cent. The total maximum increase in the number of outstanding shares of all outstanding share programs is estimated to not more than 7 874 000 shares of series B  corresponding to a dilutive effect on earnings per share of approximately 2.71 per cent. In this calculation  maximum allotment of shares has been assumed for Share Program 2023 and expected allotment has been assumed for the share programs for 2021 and 2022.Hedging measures for the Share Program 2023In order to implement Share Program 2023 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors has considered various methods for transfer of shares to the participants. The Board of Directors has found that the most cost-effective alternative is transfer of own shares  and thus proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on transfer of own shares in accordance with item 17 b) below.Should the majority required under item 17 b) below not be reached  Electrolux intends to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party.17 b) Resolution on transfers of own shares to the participants in Share Program 2023In order to secure the delivery of Performance Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the company shall transfer a maximum of 3 965 000 shares of series B in the company on the following terms and conditions:The right to receive shares shall be granted to such persons within the Electrolux Group covered by the terms and conditions pursuant to Share Program 2023. Furthermore  subsidiaries within the Electrolux Group shall have the right to acquire shares  free of consideration  and such subsidiaries shall be obligated to immediately transfer  free of consideration  shares to employees covered by the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023. The employee shall have the right to receive shares during the period when the employee is entitled to receive shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023  i.e. in 2026. Employees covered by the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023 shall receive shares of series B in the company free of consideration. The number of shares of series B in Electrolux that may be transferred under Share Program 2023 will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.Majority requirementsThe resolution of the Annual General Meeting to implement the program according to item 17 a) above requires that more than half of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting approve the proposal. The Annual General Meeting's resolution on transfer of own shares  according to item 17 b) above requires that shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the proposal.Preparation of the proposal for the Share Program 2023The proposal regarding the Share Program 2023 has been prepared by the People Committee and the Board of Directors.Previous incentive programs in ElectroluxFor a description of the company's other share related incentive programs  reference is made to the Annual Report for 2022  note 27  and the Group's website  www.electroluxgroup.com.

Further  the proposal implies that an issue may be made against cash payment  by set-off or by contribution in kind. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  shares shall be issued on market terms. The purpose of the Board of Directors' proposal is to (i) enable the Company to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses by issuing new shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisition of real property  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions; and/or (ii) enable the Company to strengthen its financial position and/or create a larger liquidity buffer for financing commitments.Item 19 ‚Äì Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on an issue of new shares  applying the shareholders' preferential rights.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on new share issues  on one or several occasions  with preferential rights for the shareholders  for the purpose of strengthening the Company's financial position.

The reduction amount shall be allocated to unrestricted equity.The resolution to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares is conditional upon the Board of Directors utilising the authorisation proposed to be resolved by the Annual General Meeting in accordance with item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting.The resolution to reduce the share capital may be carried out without obtaining an authorisation from the Swedish Companies Registration Office  since the resolution will not be executed unless the Company simultaneously carries out a rights issue by means of the Board of Directors' exercise of the authorisation proposed to be resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting as set out in item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting. This entails that the share capital  after the rights issue  will increase by an amount exceeding the amount that the share capital is being reduced with as set out above. Combined  these measures entail that neither the Company's restricted equity nor its share capital is reduced as a result of the cancellation of own shares.Resolutions proposed by the Nomination CommitteeThe Nomination Committee  consisting of Helen Fasth Gillstedt (Chair of the Nomination Committee) appointed by Handelsbanken Fonder  Ralf Spann appointed by Akelius Residential Property AB (publ)  Patrik Tillman appointed by M2 Asset Management AB and M2 Capital Management AB  Johannes Wingborg appointed by L√§nsf√∂rs√§kringar Fondf√∂rvaltning AB (publ)  and Per Berggren  Chair of the Board of Directors  has made the following proposals:Item 1 ‚Äì Election of the Chair of the meeting.The Nomination Committee proposes the attorney Wilhelm L√ºning to preside as Chair of the Annual General Meeting.Item 12 ‚Äì Determination of the number of members of the Board of Directors and auditors and deputy auditors.The Board of Directors is proposed to consist of seven Board members and the number of auditors is proposed to be one with no deputy auditor.Item 13 ‚Äì Determination of the remuneration to be paid to the members of the Board of Directors and the auditor.Remuneration to the members of the Board of Directors is proposed to be the following (2022 remuneration within brackets).The Chair of the Board of Directors: SEK 1 110 000 (SEK 1 075 000).Each of the other members of the Board of Directors: SEK 450 000 (SEK 440 000).Chair of the People Committee: SEK 100 000 (SEK 100 000).Each of the other members of the People Committee: SEK 75 000 (SEK 75 000).Chair of the Audit Committee: SEK 220 000 (SEK 220 000).Each of the other members of the Audit Committee: SEK 105 000 (SEK 105 000).A member of the Board of Directors who is employed by the Company shall not receive remuneration.It is proposed that the auditor's fee shall be paid upon approval of its invoices.Item 14 ‚Äì Election of members of the Board of Directors and Chair of the Board of Directors.The existing Board members Per Berggren  Anna-Karin Celsing  Henrik K√§ll  Joacim Sj√∂berg and Leiv Synnes are proposed to be re-elected as Board members.

These guidelines shall be applicable to agreed compensation  and amendments to compensation already agreed  after adoption of the guidelines by the 2023 Annual General Meeting. These guidelines do not apply to compensation resolved or approved by the general meeting.The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityA prerequisite for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  is that Indutrade is able to recruit and retain management with high qualifications. To this end  the company must offer competitive compensation and other terms of employment  which these guidelines enable. The forms of compensation should motivate members of the executive management to perform their utmost in order to safeguard the interests of the shareholders. For more information about the company's business strategy  please see the company's website: https://www.indutrade.com/about-indutrade/objectives--strategy/.These guidelines encompass senior executives  i.e. the CEO and other members of the group management (the executive management). For employments governed by rules other than Swedish  customary adjustments may be made for compliance with mandatory rules or established local practice  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines.Variable cash compensation covered by these guidelines shall aim to promote the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability.The types of compensationThe total compensation shall be on market terms  straightforward  long-term and quantifiable  and may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  variable cash compensation  pension benefits  as well as other benefits.The general meeting may also  irrespective of these guidelines  resolve on  among other things  share-related or share price-related compensation (for information about ongoing incentive programmes  please see the company's website: https://www.indutrade.com/about-indutrade/corporate-governance/remuneration/).The performance period with respect to criteria for awarding variable salary shall be measured over a period of one or several years. The variable cash compensation may amount to a maximum of 70 percent of the fixed annual salary for the CEO. For the other members of the executive management  the variable cash compensation may amount to a maximum of 50 percent of the fixed annual salary.The pension terms for the executive management shall be in line with the going rate in the market in respect of what applies for peer executives in the market in which the executive works  a maximum of 40 percent of the fixed annual salary  and should be based on defined contribution pension solutions or correspond to a public pension plan (in Sweden the ITP plan). Variably salary to members of the executive management not covered by the ITP plan shall not qualify for pension benefits.Other benefits may include  for example  life insurance  health insurance and company car. Premiums and other costs related to such benefits may amount to not more than 15 percent of the fixed annual salary. Awarding of non-monetary benefits shall facilitate the individuals in the execution of their duties and correspond to what can be considered reasonable in respect of practice in the market in which the respective executive is active.Termination of employmentThe notice period for a member of the executive management may not exceed 12 months if the termination is initiated by the company  and 6 months if it is initiated by the individual. Severance pay to a member of the executive management shall in aggregate not exceed 24 months' salary in the event the company serves notice  and 6 months' salary in the event the member of the executive management gives notice.Criteria for variable cash compensationThe variable compensation shall be designed so as to reward the achievement of clear objectives  in straight-forward and transparent structures  and be linked to one or several predetermined and measurable financial criteria  such as sales growth  EBITA-margin or return on operating capital/capital employed. Any non-financial criteria shall be related to sustainability. Financial criteria shall constitute at least 75 percent of all criteria.Once the period for measuring the satisfaction of criteria for awarding variable cash compensation expires  the outcome will be determined. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the CEO's outcome  while the CEO is responsible for determining the outcome for other members of the executive management. For financial objectives  the assessment shall be based on the latest financial information made public by the company  with any adjustments deemed necessary or reasonable by the Board of Directors.The terms for variable compensation shall be designed so that the Board of Directors  under exceptional financial conditions  may limit  refuse or redeem payment of variable compensation if such measure is deemed reasonable.In specific cases  arrangements may be made on one-time variable compensation  provided that such compensation does not exceed an amount corresponding to 10 percent of the fixed annual salary  and is not paid more than once each year per individual. Such compensation shall not qualify for pension benefits unless required by mandatory collective agreement provisions. Resolutions on such compensation shall be made by the Board of Directors based on a proposal from the Remuneration Committee  so far as it concerns the CEO  and by the Remuneration Committee based on a proposal from the CEO  so far as it concerns other senior executives.No other variable cash compensation shall be paid.Salary and other employment terms for employeesIn the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these compensation guidelines  salary and other employment terms for employees of the company have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total compensation  the components of the compensation and increase and growth rate over time  in the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable.The decision-making process to determine  evaluate and apply the guidelinesThe Board of Directors has appointed a Remuneration Committee with the task of preparing the Board of Directors' decisions regarding proposal for guidelines for compensation to senior executives. The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year  and submit it to the Annual General Meeting.The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programmes for variable compensation to members of the executive management  as well as the application of the guidelines in terms of compensation levels and structures. Members of the executive management do not participate in the Board of Directors' processing of  and resolutions regarding  compensation-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.Derogation from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines adopted by the general meeting  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the company's long-term interest  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability. As set out above  the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in compensation-related matters  including any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.C.VI The Board's proposal regarding (a) the implementation of a long-term incentive programme; and (b) hedging arrangements (equity swap agreement) in respect thereof(a) Implementation of the programmeThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term incentive programme (""LTIP 2023"")  as set out below.ObjectiveLTIP 2023 is designed to create long-term incentives for members of the group management  including the CEO  business unit presidents  as well as subsidiary CEOs and other key employees (the ""Participants""). The main objective of LTIP 2023 is to create additional incentive for increased engagement and performance among the Participants  strengthen the potential for recruiting and retaining key individuals  as well as to create a mutual ownership interest between the Participants and the shareholders.The Board of Directors intends to propose an annual incentive programme with an equivalent structure.Description of LTIP 2023LTIP 2023 is proposed to include all current and future members of the group of Participants  currently comprising approximately 285 employees. It is proposed that the programme  which entails an investment requirement  shall consists of performance shares. As proposed  LTIP 2023 may comprise a maximum of 435 000 shares in Indutrade  representing approximately 0.12 percent of all shares and votes in Indutrade.Investment requirementIn order to participate in LTIP 2023  the Participants are required to invest in Indutrade shares and to allocate these shares to LTIP 2023. The maximum amount that Participants may invest in Indutrade shares within LTIP 2023 corresponds to  in average  approximately 5-7 percent of the Participant's gross annual base salary at the time of enrolment in LTIP 2023 (""Investment Shares"")  as further set out below. Indutrade shares already held by the Participants at the time of implementation  may not be accounted for as Investment Shares under LTIP 2023. Should the Participant be prohibited from acquiring Indutrade shares under market abuse rules or similar at the time of enrolment in LTIP 2023  Investment Shares must instead be acquired as soon as such restrictions no longer apply.Performance Share RightsGranting under LTIP 2023 is free of charge and gives the Participant rights that entitle the Participant to receive a certain number of Indutrade shares  free of charge  for each Investment Share following the expiration of a three-year vesting period (""Performance Share Rights""). Each Performance Share Right entitles the holder to receive up to one (1) Indutrade share. Allotment of Indutrade shares pursuant to the Performance Share Rights is subject to the fulfilment of the performance condition set out below  and will generally require that the Participant retains their employment and all of their Investment Shares over a period of approximately three years from the launch of the programme until the date of announcement of the interim report for the first quarter of 2026 (the ""Vesting Period"").Granting of Performance Share Rights will generally take place as soon as practicably possible following the Annual General Meeting 2023 or a later point in time as regards newly employed Participants.Indutrade will not compensate for dividend payments and other value transfers that are in line with Indutrade's dividend policy during the Vesting Period. The number of Indutrade shares that each Performance Share Right entitles to  may be recalculated as a result of e.g. bonus issues  reverse splits or share splits  new share issues  reductions of the share capital  extraordinary dividend payments  or similar actions. The transfer of shares may be accelerated as a result of merger  demerger  major acquisitions or divestments or similar actions.Performance condition and allocationThe vesting of the Performance Share Rights is dependent upon the extent to which the performance condition is satisfied during the period 1 January 2023-31 December 2025 (the ""Performance Period"")  whereby it will be determined to which extent (if any) the Performance Share Rights entitle the Participants to receive Indutrade shares at the expiration of the Vesting Period.The performance condition for allotment of Indutrade shares is based on the cumulative profit per Indutrade share (EPS) during the entire Performance Period. Minimum allotment occurs if the threshold of a cumulative EPS of SEK 24.40 per share is reached  and increases linearly up to the maximum allotment at a cumulative EPS of SEK 27.80 per share.The maximum amount that the participants in each category can invest in Investment Shares within LTIP 2023  as well as their respective granting of Performance Share Rights  are set out below. Further  each Participant must invest at least 50 percent of the maximum amount specified for its category below in order to be entitled to Performance Share Rights.Category 1 (CEO)The CEO can invest up to SEK 625 000 in Investment Shares. Each Investment Share entitles the CEO to receive 6 Performance Share Rights.Category 2 (Group management)14 other employees of the group management can invest up to SEK 175 000 each in Investment Shares. Each Investment Share entitles these Participants to receive 5 Performance Share Rights.Category 3 (Business unit presidents)40 employees within category 3 can invest up to SEK 110 000 each in Investment Shares. Each Investment Share entitles these Participants to receive 4 Performance Share Rights.Category 4 (Subsidiary CEOs and other key individuals)230 employees within category 4 can invest up to SEK 85 000 each in Investment Shares. Each Investment Share entitles these Participants to receive 2.5 Performance Share Rights.Allotment of sharesProvided that the performance condition set out above has been satisfied during the Performance Period and that the Participant has retained their employment (unless special circumstances are at hand) as well as their Investment Shares during the Vesting Period  the allotment of Indutrade shares (""Performance Shares"") shall take place as soon as practicably possible following the expiration of the Vesting Period.In order to enable control and create predictability in relation to the maximum outcome per Participant and the costs of LTIP 2023  the maximum value of the Performance Shares that may be allotted under each Performance Share Right is limited to 200 percent of the volume-weighted average purchase price for all Investment Shares. Should the value of the allotment of Performance Shares per Performance Share Right exceed this amount at the day of allotment of Performance Shares  a proportionate reduction of the number of Performance Shares to be allotted shall be made  so that this amount is not exceeded. A corresponding reduction can be made in the event the total number of shares comprised by LTIP 2023 would be exceeded.When determining the final outcome of the Performance Share Rights  the Board of Directors shall evaluate whether the vesting level is reasonable considering Indutrade's financial results and position  conditions on the stock market and other circumstances  and if not  as determined by the Board of Directors  reduce the allotment to the lower level deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors.In the event delivery of Performance Shares to Participants cannot take place under applicable law  at a reasonable cost or with reasonable administrative measures  the Board of Directors may resolve to offer the Participants a cash settlement.Costs  dilution and effects on important key ratiosThe costs for LTIP 2023  as reported in the income statement  are calculated in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and distributed over the Vesting Period. The calculation has been made based on the assumption of an estimated annual turnover of personnel of 10 percent  an annual share price increase of 10 percent  and 50 percent fulfilment of the performance condition. In addition  the costs for LTIP 2023 have been based on the assumptions that the programme comprises a maximum of 285 Participants and that each Participant makes a maximum investment.The total cost during the entire program period  given the above assumptions  of LTIP 2023 according to IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately MSEK 28.4  excluding social security contributions (the maximum cost according to IFRS 2 is approximately MSEK 77.3). The costs for social security contributions are estimated to approximately MSEK 12.0  based on the assumption of social security contributions at a rate of 30 percent (approximately MSEK 49.5 at maximum total outcome).The expected annual costs of approximately MSEK 14  including social security contributions  correspond to approximately 0.2 percent of the group's total employee costs for the financial year 2022 (0.7 percent at maximum total outcome).As proposed  LTIP 2023 may comprise a maximum of 435 000 shares in Indutrade  corresponding to approximately 0.12 percent of all shares and votes in Indutrade  before any recalculations as a result of the above specified company events.Since the proposal does not entail an issue of new shares  LTIP 2023 will have no dilutive effect on the votes of existing shareholders or the share capital. The effect on important key figures is only marginal.Hedging arrangementsThe Board of Directors has considered different methods for hedging the financial exposure and the transfer of shares under LTIP 2023  such as repurchase of own shares  new issue of Class C shares and transfer of treasury shares. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that an equity swap agreement with a third party is the most cost-effective and flexible method for hedging the financial exposure and the transfer of shares under LTIP 2023.Preparation of the proposal  etc.The proposal regarding LTIP 2023 has been prepared by Indutrade's Remuneration Committee and adopted by the Board of Directors.The Board of Directors shall  within the framework of the above terms and conditions and guidelines  be responsible for the implementation and management of LTIP 2023. All major decisions relating to LTIP 2023 will be made by the Remuneration Committee  with approval by the Board of Directors as a whole  when required.Description of ongoing variable compensation programmesThe Company's ongoing variable compensation programmes will be described in detail in the annual report 2022 in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements  and are also described on Indutrade's website  which further outlines how Indutrade implements its guidelines for compensation to senior executives in line with the Swedish Corporate Governance Code.(b) Equity swap agreement with a third partyThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the financial exposure shall be hedged by Indutrade being able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on market terms  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares to the Participants. The Board has considered different methods and is of the opinion that the costs of such an equity swap are in line with other financing options  considering the terms and conditions for such an equity swap agreement. The costs for the equity swap agreement are not expected to exceed MSEK 4 per year until 2026.LTIP 2023 including the equity swap agreement will also result in costs for external counsel and administration attributable to LTIP 2023  including acquisition and transfer of shares. These costs are not expected to exceed MSEK 1 per year until 2026.Majority requirementsThe Annual General Meeting's resolutions under items 18 (a) and 18 (b) above requires a majority of more than half of the votes cast at the Meeting.D.

Even though the Board of Directors currently has no intention to exercise an authorization to acquire additional own shares  the Board of Directors proposes the authorization is to be renewed as an authorization is valid until the following Annual General Meeting. The Board of Directors would then be able to decide to repurchase own shares  if the conditions are appropriate and the Board of Directors were to find it would be in the best interests of the company and the shareholders.In view of the above  the Board of Directors proposes as follows.16 a) Acquisition of own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes the Annual General Meeting to authorize the Board of Directors  for the period until the next Annual General Meeting on one or several occasions  to resolve on acquisitions of shares in the company as follows.The company may acquire as a maximum so many shares of series B that  following each acquisition  the company holds at a maximum 10 per cent of all shares issued by the company. The shares may be acquired on Nasdaq Stockholm. Acquisition of shares may only be made at a price per share within the prevailing price interval for the share from time to time. Payment for the shares shall be made in cash.The purpose of the proposal is to be able to use repurchased shares on account of potential company acquisitions  the company's share related incentive programs as well as to be able to adapt the company's capital structure  thereby contributing to increased shareholder value.The Board of Directors has issued a statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act.16 b) Transfer of own shares on account of company acquisitionsThe Board of Directors proposes the Annual General Meeting to authorize the Board of Directors  for the period until the next Annual General Meeting on one or several occasions  to resolve on transfers of the company's own shares in connection with or as a consequence of company acquisitions as follows.Own shares of series B held by the company at the time of the Board of Director's decision may be transferred. The shares may be transferred with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. Transfer of shares may be made at a minimum price per share corresponding to an amount in close connection with the price of the company's shares on Nasdaq Stockholm at the time of the decision on the transfer. Payment for the transferred shares may be made in cash  by contributions in kind or by a set-off of company debt.16 c) Transfer of own shares on account of the share program for 2021The Board of Directors proposes  on account of the share program for 2021  that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the company shall be entitled  for the period until the next Annual General Meeting on one or several occasions  to transfer a maximum of 1 544 925 shares of series B in the company for the purpose of covering costs  including social security charges  that may arise as a result of the aforementioned program. Such transfers may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the prevailing price interval from time to time.Majority requirementIn order for the resolutions by the General Meeting in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposals under items 16 a)  b)  and c) above to be valid  the resolutions must be accepted by shareholders holding no less than two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the General Meeting.Item 17 - Resolutions on a) implementation of a performance based  long-term share program for 2023  and b) transfer of own shares to the participants in the long-term share program for 2023BackgroundThe Board of Directors has decided to propose a long-term incentive program for 2023 (the ""Share Program 2023""). The Board is convinced that the proposed program will be beneficial to the company's shareholders as it will contribute to the possibilities to recruit and retain competent employees  is expected to increase the commitment and the motivation of the program participants and will strengthen the participants' ties to the Electrolux Group and its shareholders.Proposals of the Board of DirectorsThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves a) to implement Share Program 2023  and b) to transfer own shares  free of consideration  to the participants in Share Program 2023.17 a) Implementation of Share Program 2023The Board of Directors proposes  in view of the above  that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement Share Program 2023 with the following principal terms and conditions:a. The program is proposed to include up to 900 senior managers and key employees of the Electrolux Group  who are divided into seven groups; the President and CEO (""Group 1"")  other members of Group Management (""Group 2"")  and five additional groups for other senior managers and key employees (""Group 3-7""). Invitation to participate in the program shall be provided by Electrolux no later than on May 16  2023.b. Participants are offered to be allocated Performance Shares  provided that the participant remains employed until January 1  2026. Exemptions to this requirement may be prescribed in specific cases  including a participant's death  disability  retirement or the divestiture through a sale  spin-off or otherwise of the participant's employing company from the Electrolux Group.c. The Performance Shares shall be based on maximum performance values for each participant category. The maximum performance value for the participants in Group 1 will be 100 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 2  90 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 3  80 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 4  60 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 5  50 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 6  40 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  and for participants in Group 7  20 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023. The total sum of the maximum values of the Performance Shares thus defined for all participants will not exceed SEK 583m excluding social costs.d. Each maximum value shall thereafter be converted into a maximum number of Performance Shares1   based on the average closing price paid for Electrolux shares of series B on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of ten trading days before the day the participants are invited to participate in the program  reduced by the present value of estimated dividend payments for the period until shares are allotted.e. The calculation of the number of Performance Shares shall be connected to performance targets for the Group  for the performance period  established by the Board for (i) cumulative earnings per share2 and (ii) CO2 reduction3. The performance targets adopted by the Board will stipulate a minimum level and a maximum level  with the relative weight of the performance targets (i) and (ii) being 80 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. For the participants in Group 1 and 2 (Group Management)  the granted Performance Shares based on (i) and (ii) will be multiplied by 0.75-1.25 depending on the outcome of a relative total shareholder return target4. The performance period is the financial years 2023-2025 with respect to each of the performance targets.f. Performance outcome of the established performance targets will be determined by the Board after the expiry of the three-year performance period in 2026. If the maximum performance level is reached or exceeded  the allocation will amount to (and will not exceed) the maximum number of Performance Shares following from items c) and d). If performance is below the maximum level but exceeds the minimum level  a proportionate allocation of shares will be made. No allocation will be made if performance amounts to or is below the minimum level. Information on the performance targets and the outcome will be provided no later than in connection with the allocation of Performance Shares in accordance with item g).g. If all conditions in the Share Program 2023 are met  allocation of Performance Shares will take place in the first half of 2026. Allocation will be free of charge except for tax liabilities.h. Certain deviations in or adjustments of the terms and conditions for the Share Program 2023 may be made based on local rules and regulations as well as applicable market practice or market conditions or where appropriate due to group re-organizations  including cash settlement instead of delivery of shares under certain circumstances.i. The Board of Directors  or a committee established by the Board for these purposes  shall be responsible for the preparation and management of the Share Program 2023  within the framework of the aforementioned terms and conditions.j. If material changes would occur within the Electrolux Group or on the market that  according to the Board's assessment  would lead to the conditions for allocation of Performance Shares no longer being reasonable  the Board will have the right to make also other adjustments of the Share Program 2023  including e.g. a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of shares.Costs for the Share Program 2023The total costs for the Share Program 2023 if the maximum number of Performance Shares are delivered  are estimated to a maximum of SEK 639m  which corresponds to approximately 3.1 per cent of total employment cost for 2022. The costs will be recognized over the years 2023-2025. The costs have been calculated as the sum of salary costs  including social costs  and administration costs for the program. Administration costs are estimated to be less than SEK 1m. If no allotment of shares is made  only administration costs will arise.The costs have been calculated based on the value  at the start of the program  of the Performance Shares that may be allotted at maximum performance  with a reduction of the present value of estimated dividend payments during a three-year period. The estimate on maximum costs assumes maximum performance and that the number of participants that will leave the Group during the performance period is the same as the historical average since the introduction of share programs in 2004. In the calculation  a maximum share price of SEK 247 per share has been applied.If repurchased own shares would be allocated under the program the number of outstanding shares is estimated to increase with not more than 3 965 000 shares of series B.5 Such maximum increase would have a dilutive effect on earnings per share of approximately 1.38 per cent. The total maximum increase in the number of outstanding shares of all outstanding share programs is estimated to not more than 7 874 000 shares of series B  corresponding to a dilutive effect on earnings per share of approximately 2.71 per cent.

The project will run until December 31  2025. The consortium of ten partners sees the project as a great opportunity to establish new innovative business models in mechanical and plant engineering in Germany. In particular  the results of ""Sunrise"" should enable small and medium-sized companies to establish subscription models for the first time.UMT AG has already been contributing to this forward-looking project  which now enjoys research funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)  with its expertise in the field of payments since 2019 and has now been appointed as an official project partner. In the project  UMT will exclusively implement the verification  authentication and processing of payment transactions automatically triggered by the production machines. In addition  UMT's agenda also includes the realization of cross-media communication from production via the corporate management level to global communication networks. In this context  UMT AG also draws on MEXS' experience in the areas of messaging and IoT.‚ÄúIndustry 4.0‚Äù with the technology of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) enables real-time planning  control and monitoring of industrial manufacturing processes. The global volume of this very technology-driven market is estimated at over $300 billion and has annual growth rates of over 20 percent.""Sunrise"" goes beyond the technology aspect and picks up on the current trend of replacing capital-binding investments in relevant economic assets with subscription models. The IT industry  in particular  is providing numerous pioneering examples in this area: Software as a Service (SaaS) replaces the purchase of software licenses  cloud computing eliminates the need to purchase one's own servers  and copiers and printers are not purchased but charged for on a per-copy basis.The advantages for the user are clear: usage-oriented  variable costs take the place of fixed costs and allow the entrepreneur more financial flexibility and security. Not having to use their own production equipment frees up capacity to concentrate on their core business.This is precisely where the ""Sunrise"" research project comes in and  in addition to providers and customers  also includes suppliers as well as enablers of the business model such as financial intermediaries and IoT service providers and will implement value creation networks on a pilot basis  taking into account technical as well as business management issues.""We are very much looking forward to the cooperation with the top-class consortium partners and expect important impulses for our future business development  especially in the SME sector  which is also the focus of MEXS. Participation in the research project confirms to us that our commitments in the areas of payment  messaging and IoT were the right decisions for the future "" says Dr. J√ºrgen Schulz  Spokesman of the Board of Management at UMT AG.Thomas Teufel  MEXS Managing Director and Member of the Board of UMT AG  adds: ""The combination of IoT and messaging is an important feature of the MEXS platform  which we are already using in medium-sized manufacturing companies - even worldwide. Combined with UMT's payment expertise  this fits perfectly into the digital future of industry. In the future  we can expect further sales revenues in this area. I am particularly pleased that know-how can be passed on to UMT via this MEXS research project.""By participating in this BMBF-funded research project  the UMT Group is making a significant contribution to the fourth industrial revolution ""Industry 4.0"" and thus sees its future strategy for the digitalization of conventional business models further confirmed.Further information on the ""Sunrise"" research project will be available in the future on the following website: www.sunrise-projekt.de.About UMT AG:UMT United Mobility Technology AG stands as a ""TechnologyHouse"" for the development and implementation of customized solutions for the digitalization of business processes.

Liz Truss  her counterpart in the UK at the time  forecast that Vladimir Putin‚Äôs oligarchs would have nowhere to hide. EU sanctions  the European Commission president  Ursula von der Leyen  said  ‚Äúare working to cripple Putin‚Äôs ability to finance his war machine‚Äù.The language before the invasion had been no less assertive. At a briefing in January 2022  US state department officials said Washington was prepared to implement sanctions ‚Äúwith massive consequences that were not considered in 2014 [when Russia annexed Crimea]. That means the gradualism of the past is out  and this time we‚Äôll start at the top of the escalation ladder and stay there.‚ÄùThe Institute for International Finance (IIF) predicted a 15% fall in Russian GDP in 2022. JP Morgan envisaged a 12% contraction. Russia‚Äôs own technocrats privately warned Putin of a possible 30% fall.Vladimir Putin attending a virtual cabinet meeting at Novo-Ogaryovo  a Russian government residence outside Moscow. Photograph: Mikhail Metzel/APThe reality was somewhat different  reflecting what analysts say was a hubristic over-confidence in the west about the speed with which sanctions that were agreed with unprecedented coordination by the G7 could damage Russia.The Russian economy contracted by only 2.2% last year. Unemployment  according to admittedly dubious official figures  now stands at 3.7 %. The construction sector has been able to grow significantly even if the car and electronics industries have suffered. A bumper harvest has driven growth in the agricultural sector.Russia is now forecast by the International Monetary Fund to grow faster in 2023 and 2024 than the UK. It is hardly financial apocalypse now.As the war approaches its one-year anniversary on 24 February  the debate about whether sanctions are effective has intensified.Defenders of sanctions say the ruble and headline gross domestic product are dreadful indicators  partly because Russian statistics are either classified or manipulated as part of the war effort. ‚ÄúPlease do not ask me about GDP figures. They do not matter ‚Äù said Elina Ribakova  the deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance  a global industry body.Vladimir Milov  a former Russian deputy energy minister and author of a Martens Centre report on sanctions  said it may be more instructive to track a dozen or so ‚Äúsoft indicators‚Äù such as alcohol sales  divorce rates  shoplifting  spending on food  opinion polls  bank customer sentiment or tax revenues.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at the watch every five minutes to see if sanctions are working. Exercise strategic patience ‚Äù said Milov  who is also an ally of the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei NavalnyAgathe Demarais  the author of Backfire  a study of US sanctions  said: ‚ÄúThis is a marathon rather than a sprint  but financing the war is getting more difficult.‚ÄùEconomists at the Kyiv School of Economics go further  arguing that a decisive turning point may already have been reached as a growing Russian fiscal deficit ‚Äì spurred by extra defence spending and collapsing hydrocarbon revenues ‚Äì forces Russia‚Äôs central bank to eat up its reserves.Initial financial blitzkrieg‚ÄúIt is understandable that the west got carried away at the beginning  leading to false expectations of a palace coup ‚Äù said Charles Lichfield  a deputy director of the Atlantic Council  a US thinktank.After all  Russians started to rush for the cash machines  fearing a run on the banks.

Photograph: Victor Berzkin/APThe gates to the oligarchs‚Äô European playgrounds were padlocked  their ostentatious toys put into dry dock. The loss of mobility and respectability was a heavy blow  particularly in London where the Conservative government suddenly turned on the Russian rich after decades of laxity and reputation laundering. Within about four months  Russian assets worth about ‚Ç¨13.8bn (¬£12.3bn) had been frozen.Even the smallest transactions were at risk of getting stuck in correspondent bank accounts for weeks if not months  as international banks became wary of facilitating transfers by Russian clients. In total the EU put sanctions on 1 386 individuals and 171 entities.Hundreds of the larger western firms from McDonalds to BP to IT multinationals ‚Äúself-sanctioned‚Äù themselves by suspending or winding down their Russian operations  even if some did not actually leave. The German chemical firm BASF suffered a $7.9bn (¬£6.5bn) writedown in the process  even if it hopes to pass it on to the taxpayer.A worker removes McDonald‚Äôs logo from a restaurant in Moscow in June 2022. Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty ImagesBut in the key opening exchange of the sanctions battle  the Russian central bank  ironically largely staffed by liberal pragmatists opposed to the invasion of Ukraine  got the better of the west. On 28 February  the west tried to ambush Russia by simply freezing what was reported by the country‚Äôs central bank to be roughly $300bn or (40%) of its total foreign exchange reserves held overseas. The remainder was not held in western currencies. ‚ÄúThe aim was to make it harder to defend the currency  increase the cost of financing the war and fuel inflation ‚Äù said Demarais.Elvira Nabiullina  the governor of the Russian central bank. Photograph: Shamil Zhumatov/ReutersBut the Russian central bank‚Äôs governor  Elvira Nabiullina  responded decisively  raising the key interest rate to 20% on 28 February  effectively shutting down mortgages and corporate lending but making deposits extremely attractive. It deterred citizens from panicking and withdrawing all their money from their accounts. On 7 March  for the first time in the modern Russian history  the central bank completely banned the sale and withdrawal of dollars and euros deposited before 24 February. Russia also negotiated for some its banks ‚Äì notably Gazprombank ‚Äì to remain in the global financial messaging system Swift because they handled payments related to oil and gas exports on which the EU were heavily reliant. After a short period of stress in March 2022  structural liquidity returned more or less to pre-sanctions levels. By June the rouble had stabilised.Once its initial financial blitzkrieg ‚Äì prepared in secret in the US Treasury in the months before war ‚Äì had been repelled  the west had to revise its strategy  accepting implicitly it had not quite started at the top of the sanctions ladder and there were further rungs to climb. The second phase was going to be more a war of attrition  constant adjustment and consensus-building across the EU.The European Commission went on to a sanctions war footing  according to a study by the Danish Institute for International Studies. ‚ÄúFormal processes that would traditionally take several weeks were concluded within a day ‚Äù it found.But flaws in the process appeared. Since EU sanction packages require unanimity  ideological outliers like Hungary held massive leverage. Viktor Orb√°n‚Äôs personal connection with specific Russian oligarchs became apparent. For instance  in September last year the Hungarian prime minister asked  probably in return for favours by Putin  for three Russian oligarchs to be removed from the EU sanctions list. Before the 15 March renewal deadline  Orb√°n has lobbied to remove the same trio plus an other six. At successive European Council meetings  his ministers have threatened use of the veto  delaying key sanctions decisions. Most recently  Orb√°n breezily insulted Ukraine as ‚Äúa no man‚Äôs land akin to Afghanistan‚Äù.Vladimir Putin presents Alisher Usmanov  the founder of USM Holdings group  the decoration For Beneficence during a ceremony at the Kremlin in Moscow in January 2017. Photograph: Kremlin Pool/AlamySome EU states found they did not have the laws  compliance departments or procedures to implement the sanctions agreed in Brussels. Only now is the European Commission working with member states for instance to establish a single contact point for enforcement and implementation issues with cross-border dimensions.Differences in the vigour with which sanctions were enforced became striking. EU figures show Greece had frozen only ‚Ç¨222 000 in Russian assets and Malta only ‚Ç¨200 000. The same two countries in April had tried to block a ban on Russian flagged ships entering EU ports. Austrian companies have hardly rushed to leave Russia. One estimate says 43 Austrian firms have stayed and only two left completely. Belgium has lobbied to keep the 500-year-old diamond industry in Antwerp open to Russia‚Äôs Alrosa mining company.Among Nato members  Turkey‚Äôs refusal to join the sanctions coalition has become a major problem.By the third quarter of 2022  Russian imports from Turkey had surged to over $1bn a month  roughly double the figure for the same period the previous year.Turkey became a route for Russia to import vital western-produced goods such as manufacturing parts. Some economists for instance have noticed a mini boomlet in trade between Italy and Turkey  suggesting enterprising Italian traders regard Istanbul as a useful access point into forbidden Russian markets.US Treasury sources say they have now elevated Turkey‚Äôs approach to trade with Russia to an issue of prime importance in the bilateral relationship.The US is also looking askance at another ally  the United Arab Emirates. Research by a team of Berlin-based data analysts examining more than 500 000 bank transactions after the war started found that  in terms of value  66% of withdrawals by non-resident customers of Russian banks went to beneficiaries located in the UAE. This represents a 40% rise on the previous year.Vladimir Putin  left  walks with Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan during an official welcome ceremony in Abu Dhabi  UAE  in 2019. Photograph: Alexander Zemlianichenko/APPutin‚Äôs throw‚Äôs energy poker game lead with dud cardThe surprising resilience of the Russian economy is not primarily due to the technical professionalism of central bank officials or murky sanctions busting  but instead a blindingly obvious structural flaw in the sanctions: Europe‚Äôs reliance on Russian oil and gas exports  the source of 40% of Russian budget revenue.‚ÄúNot imposing a Russian export embargo early on led to record high trade and fiscal surpluses that gave Putin‚Äôs regime a huge financial cushion  enough to sustain many months of the war ‚Äù said Oleg Itskhoki  a Russian-American economist. ‚ÄúOnly Putin‚Äôs imports were boycotted  while his exports continued. As a result the Russian car and electrical industry collapsed  but not the export of oil and gas.‚ÄùVarious groups of western economists  including R√ºdiger Bachmann  Moritz Schularick  Ben Moll and Christian Bayer  tried through March and April to persuade German politicians that cutting off the supply of Russian energy would not lead the German economy to crash.Moll recalled: ‚ÄúSoon after the war started  statements were being made by German politicians that an energy embargo would have dramatic economic consequences. For instance  the economics minister said there would be mass unemployment and poverty.‚ÄúWe just thought it was important to look at the data and think this through systematically so we put together a team of energy economists as well as micro- and macroeconomists and concluded it might lead to a recession between 0.5 and 3 % but not economic Armageddon. Not all of us agreed with an energy embargo. But the unions and industry lobby denounced our analysis and the chancellor called us ‚Äòirresponsible‚Äô on national TV  a reflection of the large influence of corporate Germany.‚ÄùMoll believes in retrospect his analysis of the system‚Äôs flexibility and adaptability has been proven right.But the EU could decouple itself from Russian energy only at the speed Germany  the major economy most vulnerable to Putin‚Äôs energy blackmail  was prepared to tolerate.Vladimir Putin with the former German chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der and the then Gazprom CEO  at the inauguration of the Nord Stream pipeline in September 2011. Photograph: Alexey Nikolsky/RIA Novosti/AFP/Getty ImagesIt took until June  after private lobbying by the US and evidence of war crimes in Ukraine  for the EU in its sixth sanctions package to agree to an EU-wide ban on Russian oil exports. But the ban was only to come into force in two delayed phases. The ban on the purchase  import or transfer of Russian seaborne crude oil was not to apply until 5 December and the ban on other refined oil products such as diesel came in on 5 February.The price of Europe‚Äôs caution is well known. With the exception of 2020 and 2018  oil and gas had provided 60% of Russian goods exports in every year since 2002. But the early summer of 2022 was a total bonanza for the Russian treasury  as it benefited from the record surge in energy prices. In March  Russia was making ‚Ç¨1bn a day from energy exports. Oil and gas increased to 60% of Russian fiscal revenues  up from 40%. Germany alone has bought ‚Ç¨24bn of Russian fossil fuels since the invasion.Europe funded the Russian war machine that it denounced. The surplus on Russia‚Äôs current account for the year was $227.4bn ‚Äì a 86% increase on the previous year and more than double the previous record. That helped strengthen the rouble  making imports cheaper. This in turn helped to gradually bring down inflation  taking some pressure off the real incomes of the ordinary Russian population.By the summer Russian treasury coffers were so bloated that Putin felt confident enough to launch a counterattack by slowing gas supplies to Europe. With 40 % of Europe‚Äôs gas coming from Russia  he demanded in April that any country refusing to pay for its gas in roubles would be cut off. Europe huffed but complied. By June he started tampering with the gas flow through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia into Germany. He first cut deliveries through the pipeline by 75%  from 170m cubic metres a day to roughly 40m. In July  the pipeline was shut for 10 days  citing the need for essential maintenance work. On reopening  the flow was reduced to 20m cubic metres a day.Then on 26 September an as yet unidentified intelligence service blew up the pipeline and the neighbouring Nord Stream 2 pipeline ‚Äì which had yet to go into service - leaving a mangled wreck and an unsolved crime scene at the bottom of the Baltic.Equinor‚Äôs liquefied natural gas facility in Melk√∏ya  Norway  in January 2023. Photograph: Ole Berg-Rusten/NTB/AFP/Getty Images‚ÄúPutin shot himself in the foot because by turning off the gas tap  he completely changed the calculus in the European Union and gave the impetus to Europe to diversify away from Russian gas ‚Äù Demarais said. ‚ÄúHe made the decision for Europe a lot easier.‚ÄùThrough a mixture of planning and good fortune  Europe has  in the space of six months  largely weaned itself off Russian gas. Renewables have been boosted  the lives of nuclear power stations extended and liquid natural gas terminals built at lightening speed. The European Commission sent out search parties for alternative sources of energy ranging from Morocco  Qatar  Angola  Venezuela  Norway and Nigeria. It was a form of Putin-inspired ‚Äúshock therapy‚Äù.In another blow to Putin  ‚ÄúGeneral Winter‚Äù  once assumed to be Russia‚Äôs greatest ally  failed to report for duty. Temperatures averaged well above the norm with record highs for winter broken in the Netherlands  Liechtenstein  Lithuania  Latvia  Czech Republic  Poland  Denmark and Belarus. That lowered demand for energy  as did the self-restraint of European consumers rocked by record bills. Gas storage levels in Germany in January were at 90%  the highest level ever for the month.Russian gas exports to Europe tumbled by more than 75% compared with the prewar period. The daily price of natural gas on the stock exchange Amsterdam Euronext which had peaked at more than ‚Ç¨300 a megawatt hour after the invasion  has now fallen well below 100 again  to under ‚Ç¨60  still high by the standards of 2020 . Inflation is slowly descending across Europe  and Germany looks to have avoided the widely predicted recession.Technicians inspect the East-Route pipeline at a gas-distributing station in Qinhuangdao  China. Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesPutin had played his best economic warfare card ‚Äì cutting gas exports to Europe ‚Äì and it was a dud  and will remain so next winter if the EU controls demand. In the space of a year  Putin destroyed Russia‚Äôs gas bridge to Europe  the centrepiece of Russian postwar economy.Where do we go from here?The question now is how quickly he can construct a different bridge to the east  and so keep the Russian finances afloat.Russia exports natural gas from eastern fields to China through the 2 500-mile Power of Siberia 1 pipeline  but the western fields  which had served the European markets  are not connected to this export route and cannot be easily redirected to China. Eventually a Power of Siberia 2 pipeline will connect the two fields  but the estimated completion date is 2030. China is also not such a profitable market. Russia was estimated to be charging $3 a metric million British thermal unit (MMBtu) for deliveries to China via the Power of Siberia pipeline  while the estimated charge for deliveries to Europe had been sold at $10-$25/MMBtu.Putin is also in danger of being screwed to the floor over oil  his crown jewel. After persistent US Treasury lobbying  the west supplemented the EU ban on Russian crude oil exports by introducing an unprecedented market intervention that seeks to set a world wide price cap of $60 a barrel for Russian seaborne oil. From 5 December  the same date as the EU import ban  any firm providing payments  insurance  financial services  or brokering  bunkering  piloting services to a ship carrying Russian oil could not receive insurance cover if the oil was being purchased for more than $60 a barrel. If the US or EU catches any company misrepresenting the price or submitting a fraudulent attestation  the G7 can impose sanctions on that company. The UK proposes fines of $1.2m.Putin blustered  saying he would not supply oil to any country for five months that complied with this price regime from 1 February. But this may be a bluff. For China and India do not need to endorse the cap explicitly  but they can take advantage of its existence and their purchasing power to negotiate heavy price discounts in comparison with Brent crude.The price cap is in its infancy  and since the price of seaborne Urals crude averaged $49.48 in January  below the $60 cap  EU tankers ‚Äì mainly Greek ‚Äì can legitimately carry on transporting oil to China and India. Reports suggest crude oil loading from Russian ports have reached a multi-month high. At best the cap has had the effect of institutionalising price discounts. At worst it is proving toothless. Ukraine and its expert team advisers on sanctions led by the former US envoy Michael McFaul say the cap needs to be halved especially if its purpose is to blow a hole in Russia‚Äôs budget.But the US Treasury  in setting the cap  was balancing different objectives: reducing Russia‚Äôs income and keeping enough supplies on the seas to avoid another spike in oil prices. That requires a perilous assessment of the price at which Putin decides it is not profitable to extract or export oil. The US is trying to postpone a review of the cap level until March to allow more evidence to be collated.The Kyiv School of Economics insists the numbers on the Russian dashboard are flashing red. Russia‚Äôs monthly fiscal deficit reached a record 3.9tn roubles (¬£43.3bn) in December and its total budget deficit for 2022 was 3.3tn roubles ‚Äì or 2.3% of GDP ‚Äì set against a projected an annual surplus of 1.3tn. Overall spending in 2022 was 7.3tn roubles higher than forecast  presumably due to vast defence spending.Putin plans to spend 6.3 % of GDP on defence and national security in the 2023 federal budget alone  doubling defence spending to more than 10tn roubles. The question then becomes how long this level of spending can be sustained if energy revenues are falling so fast.Demarais said the first signs of serious strain would be unplanned debt issuance and the sale of some of its 310bn yuan (¬£37.5bn)  the only currency in Russia‚Äôs reserves that can be used for interventions in the foreign exchange market.Various estimates exist  but some say Russia‚Äôs planned spending is probably sustainable on an assumed Urals crude oil pice of $70 a barrel. Russia won‚Äôt burn through its stock of yuan assets this year unless the Urals price halves and averages $25 a barrel  according to Bloomberg Economics.The US bank Citigroup estimates it would only take an average price of $35 to deplete the available yuan resources already in 2023.The NS Power tanker is moored at a petroleum depot in Vladivostok  Russia in December. Photograph: Tatiana Meel/ReutersBut as the past year has shown  Russia is not sitting idle in the face of a price cap. Learning from its growing ally  Iran  it has assembled an ageing dark fleet of smaller  older ships carrying crude oil mainly to China and India. Evasion will be attempted through multiple means: flags of convenience; the blending of crude; Russian insurance schemes; or the simple manipulation of documents. New crude oil transfer hubs are already emerging. It will depend on whether this covert market grows into a viable alternative to the G7 cap  and the price at which the oil is bought by China.In the end an international sanctions war is a game of cat and mouse in which both sides look for clues amid the disinformation to try to pre-empt the other‚Äôs moves.Ultimately it is not as decisive as the battlefield  but if the west can stay the course  Putin may yet find his options narrowing. If he survives it will be a huge blow to the power of the dollar  and one that will not go unnoticed in Beijing.,negative,0.0,0.03,0.97,negative,0.01,0.07,0.93,True,English,"['sanctions war', 'Russia', 'year', 'cat', 'mouse', 'former Russian deputy energy minister', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'US state department officials', 'growing Russian fiscal deficit', 'German foreign minister', 'deputy chief economist', 'European Commission president', 'virtual cabinet meeting', 'gross domestic product', 'global industry body', 'Martens Centre report', 'decisive turning point', 'larger western firms', 'German chemical firm', 'AFP/Getty Images B', 'dubious official figures', 'Russian opposition leader', 'Initial financial blitzkrieg', 'International Monetary Fund', 'bank customer sentiment', 'correspondent bank accounts', 'Russian government residence', 'extra defence spending', 'oligarchs‚Äô European playgrounds', 'deputy director', 'US thinktank', 'Russian economy', 'Russian GDP', 'financial apocalypse', 'Russian statistics', 'GDP figures', 'Conservative government', 'Russian assets', 'Russian clients', 'Russian operations', 'International Finance', 'central bank', 'Joe Biden', 'Annalena Baerbock', 'Liz Truss', 'massive consequences', 'escalation ladder', 'JP Morgan', 'Mikhail Metzel/AP', 'unprecedented coordination', 'construction sector', 'electronics industries', 'bumper harvest', 'agricultural sector', 'one-year anniversary', 'dreadful indicators', 'Elina Ribakova', 'soft indicators', 'alcohol sales', 'divorce rates', 'opinion polls', 'tax revenues', 'strategic patience', 'Alexei Navalny', 'Agathe Demarais', 'Kyiv School', 'hydrocarbon revenues', 'false expectations', 'palace coup', 'Charles Lichfield', 'Atlantic Council', 'cash machines', 'Victor Berzkin/AP', 'ostentatious toys', 'dry dock', 'heavy blow', 'reputation laundering', 'smallest transactions', 'IT multinationals', 'Alexander Nemenov', 'US sanctions', 'international banks', 'Putin system', 'Vladimir Putin', 'full-scale invasion', 'war machine', 'The Institute', 'possible 30% fall', 'war effort', 'Vladimir Milov', 'four months', 'EU sanctions', '15% fall', 'track', 'half', 'March', 'Ukraine', 'core', 'power', 'counterpart', 'ability', 'language', 'briefing', 'January', 'Washington', 'Crimea', 'gradualism', 'past', 'top', 'IIF', '12% contraction', 'technocrats', 'Novo-Ogaryovo', 'Moscow', 'Photograph', 'reality', 'analysts', 'confidence', 'speed', 'G7', 'Unemployment', 'growth', '24 February', 'debate', 'Defenders', 'ruble', 'headline', 'author', 'dozen', 'shoplifting', 'food', 'watch', 'ally', 'Backfire', 'study', 'marathon', 'sprint', 'Economists', 'Economics', 'collapsing', 'reserves', 'beginning', 'Russians', 'run', 'dollar', 'People', 'money', '27 February', 'gates', 'loss', 'mobility', 'London', 'decades', 'laxity', 'risk', 'weeks', 'transfers', '1,386 individuals', '171 entities', 'Hundreds', 'McDonalds', 'BP', 'BASF', '$7.9bn', 'writedown', 'process', 'taxpayer', 'worker', 'logo', 'restaurant', 'June', '3.7 %.']",2023-02-20,2023-02-20,theguardian.com

ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESERESTRICTIONS MAY CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWSAs stated in all the recent shareholder communications  DCAC has continued to explore possibleBusiness Combination targets.We now inform shareholders that DCAC has today in principle agreed to combine DCAC with thetarget business in the energy infrastructure sector  Advanced Cables  following the receipt of supportfrom the UK government‚Äôs Department of International Trade (‚ÄúDIT‚Äù) for the company‚Äôs plans  andwith the support of Advanced Cables‚Äô shareholders and other interested parties.There is no guarantee that the Advanced Cables purchase agreement will be consummated  not least itis subject to further regulatory and governmental approvals or  at the least  ‚Äònon-objection‚Äô. However shareholders contemplating submitting tenders under either the Repurchase Offer or the Stub TenderOffer should bear this progress in mind when making their decisions.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Warrant holders are strongly recommended to read theentirety of this document. Should they be in any doubt  then they should seek advice from a qualifiedprofessional.Advanced CablesThe shareholders of Advanced Cables have confirmed their intent to enter into a business combinationwith DCAC (the ‚ÄúAdvanced Cables Business Combination‚Äù) by granting DCAC first refusal toacquire all their shares for between 375 million and 400 million Swiss Francs1  subject to theconditions below. DCAC has completed its due diligence on Advanced Cables and the proposedtransaction has been approved by the boards of both DCAC and of Advanced Cables  including thepositive agreement of the independent directors of both companies. Once important governmentaland regulatory approvals have been satisfied  DCAC will issue further information to its shareholders.Whilst DIT has demonstrated its support  there is no guarantee that regulatory and/or furthergovernmental approvals  permits and authorisations  or at the least ‚Äònon-objections‚Äô  will beforthcoming.Story continuesObjectivesThe purpose of the potential listing is to diversify Advanced Cables‚Äô shareholder base  raise its profileand to have the opportunity to use listed shares to merge with complementary businesses in its largemarket segment. Advanced Cables and DCAC are exploring several opportunities to acquire thedivisions of large companies in its own and adjacent asset-rich spheres of operations  although thiscannot be guaranteed. Whilst no further capital is likely to be required to put into effect the BusinessCombination  in due course  a Further Primary Capital raise is anticipated (as noted below)  whichAdvanced Cables believes will be best achieved via the capital markets.Advanced Cables aims first to supply the burgeoning demand for HVDC cables to connect renewablepower generation to the onshore grids; and then to foster the interconnection of national grids acrossborders. This ESG goal-enhancing sector requires many billions in capital investment to expand anddeliver on the transition to NetZero; to facilitate the renewal and transformation of legacyinfrastructure; and to rise to the challenge of fighting climate change. Advanced Cables is developingworld-class cable manufacturing operations to serve these sectors  whose development is beinghampered by a severe shortage of high-quality cable. This under-invested sector has historicallydelivered strong returns on capital; and high operational margins offer the prospect of resilient longtermflows of cash earnings and thus the potential for strong dividend flows to DCAC shareholders.To date  capital constrained cable manufacturers have been unable to grasp the opportunity that theirproduction of the key component for their customers affords  in terms of taking stakes in the projectsthat their customers are developing. Nor have they teamed up with those customers to mutualadvantage. Advanced Cables has been engaged in close discussions with international grid operatorsand project developers  with whom it expects to co-invest. Capital growth may potentially come fromthe deployment of capital and expertise into building out into under-served markets; harnessing capitaland strategic stakebuilding to vertically integrate and capture and expand existing internationalopportunities; and to transform legacy business models  with the efficiencies of bringing proventechnology and expertise to bear in large scale.It is DCAC‚Äôs contention that governments and regulators prefer to see a publicly listed operation having the benefit of being subject to transparency and governance requirements. The DCAC boardand special advisers bring to Advanced Cables a strong pedigree of successfully implementing a ‚Äòbuybuild-transform‚Äô investment philosophy within a framework of strong governance  spanning theprivate  publicly listed and state-owned entities. A highly experienced independent leading sectorexpert will be appointed to chair the DCAC board  in the event that the proposed BusinessCombination proceeds.The board of DCAC wish to share the benefits of its Euronext Amsterdam listing with all those DCACOrdinary Shareholders and DCAC Warrant holders who have supported the recent reconstruction  notleast by capturing a premium to the current net asset value to reflect the value of the listing. Theestimated Net Asset Value as at 15th Feb 2023 was ¬£10.27 per DCAC Ordinary Share  being the netcash after the payment of liabilities as set out in the Shareholder Circular.However  given the smaller size of the Advanced Cables proposal than the targets originallyenvisaged  including Saxo Bank at some ‚Ç¨2.0 to ‚Ç¨2.2 billion  the DCAC board and Sponsors believeit is appropriate to reduce the dilution from the Sponsor‚Äôs ‚Äòpromote‚Äô  being the package of SponsorShares and Sponsor Warrants.Acquisition TermsThe terms of the agreements agreed in principle for the proposed Advanced Cables BusinessCombination would initially comprise a sale of Advanced Cables to DCAC in exchange for the issueof DCAC Shares at a price of GBP 11.50 per DCAC Share.The DCAC Shares would come from a combination of the issue of new DCAC Shares and Shares held intreasury. DCAC will be the ongoing Euronext Amsterdam listed entity  subject to the admission of thenew Shares to listing.Conditions Precedent applying to DCACThe proposed agreement with Advanced Cables is predicated upon  inter alia  that:(i) DCAC shareholders approve the Advanced Cables Business Combination (by shareholder voteas retained in the Amended Articles).(ii) Changes are made to reduce the Sponsor promote arrangements (as below) and  potentially to reward the Advanced Cables management rather than the Sponsors by the transfer ofSponsor Warrants to the Advanced Cables management incentive plan.(iii) The DCAC Shares and Warrants continue to be listed on Euronext Amsterdam and that DCACmaintains sufficient external shareholders to satisfy any ‚Äòfree float‚Äô requirements of EuronextAmsterdam. As Advanced Cables would have ¬±89% of the enlarged share capital  and theSponsor Group over 5%  this is estimated to amount to at least 1 750 000 shares being inpublic hands  post such Advanced Cables Business Combination.(iv) The Amended Articles contain an obligation on the Company that  in case the Company intendsto consummate a Business Combination with a target or business that is affiliated with a holderof Sponsor Shares or a director  the remaining non-affiliated director(s) either (i) obtains anopinion from an independent investment banking firm and/or (ii) procures that persons that arenot affiliated to  managed by or advised by a holder of Sponsor Shares or any Insider (or anyof its affiliates) subscribe for new shares or interests (a) in the target or business the subject ofa Business Combination at the same time and price and on the same terms as the Company or(b) in the Company at the same time and price and on the same terms the Company is proposingto issue such shares or interests to the vendors of and/or persons connected to the target orbusiness the subject of a Business Combination.As related parties hold shares in both DCAC and Advanced Cables  it is intended to addressthese conflicts of interests as follows:a. The non-affiliated directors of both Advanced Cables and DCAC have today approvedentering into substantive discussionsb. An independent investment banking firm is being appointed to provide a fairnessopinion.c. The valuation will also be subject to an independent review by the auditors.d. Certain independent Advanced Cables shareholders intend to acquire additional AdvancedCables shares shortly before Business Combinatione. Independent investors have indicated that they intend to acquire additional DCACshares on Business Combination.Changes to Sponsor Shares and Sponsor WarrantsThe Advanced Cables board and shareholders have demanded as a pre-condition of the agreement and the DCAC Board and Sponsor group have agreed in principle  the following changes to theSponsor promote arrangements:(i) The Sponsor Group will place all the DCAC Sponsor Warrants into an Advanced CablesManagement MIP. The DCAC Board believes that this will benefit all DCAC and formerAdvanced Cables shareholders not least to ensure an alignment of interest with AdvancedCables management.(ii) These ex-Sponsor Warrants and the Over-Subscription Warrants held by the Sponsor bechanged to remove the cashless exercise option  and so make them capable of cash exerciseonly.(iii) The second tranche of Founder Shares  representing approximately 10% of the total number ofOrdinary Shares .. only [granted] if the closing price of the Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds GBP13.00 per Ordinary Share  be cancelled and so no longer dilute other DCAC and formerAdvanced Cables shareholders.First Tranche of Sponsor SharesThe Advanced Cables Business Combination Agreement does not propose to change the shareholdingposition from the Prospectus for the first tranche of Sponsor Shares  so potentially giving DCACSponsors 1.5625 million Shares if the conditions are met:Post-Business Combination Completion Date  a triggering event occurs for the issuance of the first tranche ofSponsor Shares representing approximately 10% of the total number of Ordinary Shares issued to the OrdinaryShareholders [at IPO]  only if the closing price of the Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds GBP 10.00 per OrdinaryShare  for any 20 Trading Days within a 30 Trading Day period.Shareholder ConsentDCAC will distribute a shareholder circular to seek shareholder consent to the Advanced CablesBusiness Combination from its shareholders  only once the governmental and regulatoryconfirmations have been received.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will be able to vote only on such DCAC Ordinary Shares as they retainat the record date of such future EGM to consider the Advanced Cables Business Combination.No Secondary PlacingIf the proposals are approved  the Advanced Cables shareholders  who include related parties includingRTE International  will enter into customary lock up arrangements.Primary Capital Raisings envisaged post Advanced CablesSecondary ListingDCAC further intends within the next three months to seek a secondary listing on NASDAQ OMX as well as benefitting from the Euronext network of exchanges across EuropeImpact of Cash exercise of WarrantsCashless conversion does not apply to Public Warrants. Therefore  the cash exercise of Warrants when combined with the changes to ex-Sponsor Warrants and the Over-Subscription Warrants held bythe Sponsor  to make them capable of cash exercise only  could result in up to ¬£98.68 million of freshcash coming into DCAC.DCAC intends to offer improvements in the warrant terms to reward early exercise in conjunctionwith a ‚Äòrights issue‚Äô and open offer.Possible Rights Issue and Open OfferNo primary capital is expected to be required in the near term  as long as DCAC maintains sufficientexternal shareholders to satisfy any ‚Äòfree float‚Äô requirements of Euronext Amsterdam. This isestimated  post-Advanced Cables to amount to at least 1 750 000 shares in public hands  subject toconfirmation by Euronext Amsterdam.However  to enhance liquidity and to provide capital for further expansion and growth  in particularto secure both its manufacturing and the offtakers for its key outputs for several years to come Advanced Cables is in the process of and currently intends by the end of May 2023 to raise GBP 318million in the form of debt and equity.Major strategic operators have indicated their intentions to subscribe equity to an operationalsubsidiary of Advanced Cables; and a leading commercial bank that it will lend up to GBP 180 millionto the cable manufacturing operation  albeit on the condition that the bank enjoys the support of UKgovernment entities. DIT has been instrumental in assisting with these discussions. Were suchindications to be consummated  then the fundraising at the DCAC level would be of the order of GBP50 to 70 million. Strategic customers have indicated their willingness to contract with AdvancedCables and to invest via DCAC to secure their supply chain and so assure the delivery of their majorprojects.To the extent that further funding is required  notably after the possible early exercise of DCACWarrants  then it is currently intended that new DCAC Ordinary Shares and/or Convertible Loans willbe issued. The intended offer price is in the range of GBP 13.00 to 16.00 per DCAC Ordinary Share.The terms of any possible Convertible Loan have yet to be determined.To reward early exercise  it is intended that DCAC Warrant holders who exercise their warrants forcash at the time of the proposed Offer will be given a discount on the exercise price to reflect the timevalue of their warrant. The terms of any such discount have yet to be determined.The stated intentions of DCAC are that it will grant pre-emption rights to subscribe for new shares inthe Company to provide any funding requirement  before DCAC goes out to the wider market.Therefore  DCAC intends that first refusal will be given to current DCAC shareholders and to formerAdvanced Cables shareholders  including the Truell Conservation Foundation2 and Long TermAssets3  to subscribe at GBP 12.50 per new Ordinary Share.Status of the Repurchase OfferCopies of the Repurchase Tender Document and the Stub Tender Offer Circular are available onDCAC's website: www.disruptivecapitalac.com.Under the Repurchase Offer (as defined and undertaken pursuant to the Repurchase Tender Documentissued by the Company on 25 January 2023)  shareholders have been eligible to submit tenders aheadof the final date for tenders to be submitted  being the 22nd February 2023.DCAC Shareholders contemplating submitting tenders under the Repurchase Offer should bear theCompany‚Äôs progress in mind when making their decisions.Under the Advanced Cables Business Combination arrangements  if so approved  it is intended thatDCAC Ordinary Shares are to be issued at GBP 11.50 per Share.As of today 20th February 2023  GBP 69 446 789 of tenders have been or are in the process of beingsettled  all at a price of GBP 10.789 per share.The repurchased DCAC Ordinary Shares will be held as Treasury Shares  pending prospective reissueunder the Advanced Cables Business Combination. The Company confirms that  once these repurchaseshave been settled  the Company will have 64% of its share capital outstanding in public hands.Stub Tender OfferShareholders contemplating submitting tenders under the Stub Tender Offer should bear the Company‚Äôsprogress in mind when making their decisions.The maximum price on offer under the Stub Tender Offer is ¬£2.20 per DCAC Ordinary Share  whichcompares to the last trading price of ¬£10.00 per DCAC Ordinary Share  the Repurchase Offer price of¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary Share; and now the in principle agreement to issue DCAC Ordinary Sharesat ¬£11.50 per DCAC Ordinary Shares.The estimated Net Asset Value as at 15th Feb 2023 was ¬£10.27 per DCAC Ordinary Share.Accompanying Stub WarrantsShareholders contemplating submitting tenders of the accompanying Warrants under the Stub TenderOffer should bear the Company‚Äôs progress in mind when making their decisions.As under the Advanced Cables Business Combination arrangements  if so approved  it is intended thatDCAC Ordinary Shares be issued at GBP 11.50 per Share  being equivalent to the Warrant exercise price it is likely that the Warrants will trade at a level reflecting an ‚Äòat the money‚Äô option with 5 years maturity.Whilst it is difficult to predict this trading level with any certainty  it may be a multiple of the value beingoffered under the Stub Tender Offer.AdvisersDCAC has invited JP Morgan to act as adviser to the proposals. This invitation is being examinedand may or may not be accepted.Advanced Cables already has in place a full suite of advisers  including Afry  Red Penguin  and Aecom.Possible fallback Business CombinationIn the light of the experience with Saxo Bank and the inevitable uncertainties around closing theAdvanced Cables transaction  DCAC continues to be in discussions on undertaking a BusinessCombination with a target business operating in the financial services sector. Both targets haveheadquarters and principal operations in Western and/or Northern Europe.We recommend that shareholders take careful heed of the positive impact these proposals may bringto the Company; and DCAC looks forward to being in contact with further information.Edmund TruellCEO  DCACAbout DCACDCAC is a special purpose acquisition company incorporated on 29 April 2021 under the CompaniesLaw as a non-cellular company limited by shares.

This would make only the institution liable while shielding its employees including top executives  a move the Treasury believes could speed up the listing process.Story continuesThe bill also proposes restricting the liability of listing companies to cases of serious misconduct that damage investor interests due to information included in the IPO documents.In addition  the scheme reinforces the possibility of bypassing the formal IPO process through a so-called self-placement  which sees a company sell shares directly  saving the money required to line up underwriters as middlemen.As part of a drive to boost funding sources other than bank credit  a measure being discussed would allow companies to issue bonds for an amount exceeding the current limit of twice the share capital  provided that these notes were bought by professional investors.($1 = 0.9362 euros)(Reporting by Giuseppe Fonte in Rome  additional reporting by Elisa Anzolin in Milan; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",positive,0.71,0.29,0.0,mixed,0.16,0.1,0.74,True,English,"['Milan bourse', 'Italy', 'measures', 'allure', 'Treasury junior minister Federico Freni', 'Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni', '200-year-old Borsa Italiana', 'European Union peers', 'initial public offerings', 'adequate risk disclosure', 'other expansion strategies', 'formal IPO process', 'current rules companies', 'other bourses', 'IPO documents', 'current limit', 'listing process', 'Giuseppe Fonte', 'capital markets', 'infrastructure group', 'Agnelli family', 'six newcomers', 'tight grip', 'family-run businesses', 'M&A', 'previous administration', 'Mario Draghi', 'wide range', 'medium-sized enterprises', 'SME qualification', 'market watchdog', 'top executives', 'serious misconduct', 'investor interests', 'funding sources', 'bank credit', 'share capital', 'additional reporting', 'Elisa Anzolin', 'Emelia Sithole-Matarise', '680 billion euros', '500 million euros', '1 billion euros', 'government officials', 'overall capitalisation', 'holding company', 'EASING SELF-PLACEMENT', 'professional investors', 'listing companies', 'Euronext Milan', 'draft bill', '0.9362 euros', '15 companies', 'ROME', 'Reuters', 'Italy', 'measures', 'issues', 'country', 'role', 'Monday', 'value', 'Atlantia', 'Exor', 'exits', 'Amsterdam', 'regulations', 'shareholders', 'challenge', 'control', 'cash', 'parliament', 'April', 'ability', 'proposals', 'details', 'IPOs', 'firms', 'simplifications', 'incentives', 'small', 'SMEs', 'threshold', 'provision', 'savers', 'staff', 'regulators', 'Consob', 'damages', 'institution', 'employees', 'move', 'Story', 'cases', 'information', 'scheme', 'possibility', 'shares', 'money', 'underwriters', 'middlemen', 'part', 'drive', 'bonds', 'amount', 'notes', 'Editing']",2023-02-20,2023-02-20,finance.yahoo.com

18839,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4579926-verallia-glass-container-producer-available-at-10-percent-fcf-yield,Verallia: Europe's Largest Glass Container Producer Available At A 10% FCF Yield (OTCMKTS:VRLAF),Verallia is the third largest producer of glass bottles and jars. Almost half of its bottles are sold to the wine and sparkling wine industry. Read more here.,RobsonPL/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionVerallia (OTCPK:VRLAF) is a French company and a major producer of glass bottles with production in South America and Europe. The company produces approximately 17 billion bottles and jars in its 63 furnaces in 12 countries. The largest portion of the produced bottles are used for wine and sparkling wine while an additional 26% is used for beer and spirits. Verallia is the world‚Äôs third largest producer of glass bottles and jars and is the number 1 in Europe  which accounts for in excess of 85% of its revenue.Verallia Investor RelationsVerallia‚Äôs primary listing is on Euronext Paris where it is trading with VRLA as its ticker symbol. There are currently approximately 117M shares outstanding (after deducting the treasury shares) for a total market capitalization of 4.5B EUR. The average daily volume in France is just over 140 000 shares  making it the most liquid listing of Verallia.Yahoo FinanceA surprisingly strong 2022 bodes well for the futureVerallia posted an excellent result in 2022. Its plants were running at full capacity to keep up with demand and thanks to a smart energy hedging policy it was able to keep the impact of the higher natural gas prices throughout the year pretty limited. This  in combination with a strong demand for glass containers (this wasn‚Äôt Verallia-specific as for instance O-I Glass (OI) also reported very strong demand for its products) allowed Verallia to exceed expectations.The total revenue increased by in excess of 20% to 3.35B EUR while the COGS increased by just around 25% despite the pressure on the cost of raw materials. Although the COGS increased at a faster pace than the revenue  the small increase in the SG&A expenses helped to boost the operating profit by approximately 40% to in excess of 550M EUR.Verallia Investor RelationsThe net finance expenses also increased but this didn‚Äôt have a major impact: the pre-tax income came in at 478M EUR resulting in a net income of 355.6M EUR of which 13.6M EUR was attributable to non-controlling interests. This means the net income attributable to the common shareholders of Verallia was 342M EUR which works out to 2.92 EUR per share. That‚Äôs an increase of in excess of 40% compared to FY 2021.One of the main reasons why I initiated a long position in Verallia in 2022 is the company‚Äôs excellent ability to convert its net income and EBITDA into free cash flow. This wasn‚Äôt any different in 2022.The reported operating cash flow was 699M EUR but this includes about 93.5M EUR in working capital contributions while we should also deduct an additional 17M EUR in taxes based on the total taxes owed rather than the amount of taxes paid. We should also deduct the 28M EUR in interest expenses to end up with an adjusted operating cash flow of 590M EUR.Verallia Investor RelationsThe total capex was 367M EUR  resulting in a pro forma free cash flow result of 223M EUR and about 210M EUR if we would deduct the net income attributable to the non-controlling interests. Keep in mind Verallia has been investing in growth as it tries to increase its production capacity at a low single digit percentage per year. The corporate presentation (below) confirms the sustaining capex is much lower than 367M EUR. Only 270M EUR was classified as sustaining (recurring) capex. That‚Äôs higher than anticipated but that‚Äôs entirely caused by the recent inflation. Verallia budgets about 8% of its annual revenue for sustaining capex  so 270M EUR is not surprising.Verallia Investor RelationsIt does mean the underlying sustaining free cash flow came in at 307M EUR or 2.6 EUR per share  and that obviously is a good result. It allowed Verallia to hike its dividend by 33% as the company is proposing to pay a dividend of 1.40 EUR per share.Aiming for 1B EUR in EBITDA in 2023The cash flow statement also shows Verallia spent almost 250M EUR on an acquisition. This is related to the acquisition of Allied Glass  a UK based producer of glass bottles in the premium segment. The company has an annual revenue of 150M GBP but nor the EBITDA nor the net income were disclosed. But assuming the company has a 20-25% EBITDA margin (Verallia‚Äôs own EBITDA margin exceeds 25%)  it looks like Verallia acquired Allied at about 8 times EBITDA which isn‚Äôt expensive at all.The EBITDA contribution from Allied Glass also helped to boost the full-year 2023 guidance as Verallia is now guiding for a full-year EBITDA of 1B EUR.Verallia Investor RelationsAssuming the depreciation and amortization expenses increase to 325M EUR (295M EUR in FY 2022) and assuming the interest expenses increase from 28M EUR to 35M EUR  a 1B EUR EBITDA implies a pre-tax profit of 640M EUR  and a net income of in excess of 400M EUR. The free cash flow result should be slightly higher than that  and will likely exceed 3.50 EUR per share.Verallia is lucky to have locked in the interest rate on about 1B EUR of its debt. Additionally  the floating rate debt was hedged and about 92% of the total debt is either fixed or hedged. This means Verallia will be shielded from the recent interest rate increases although we will see an impact from Q4 2024 on when the 500M EUR loan will have to be refinanced. But by that time  the free cash flow machine will be nicely humming again and thanks to Verallia‚Äôs pricing power  I‚Äôm not really expecting a massive impact from increasing interest rates until 2028. And even if you would assume the 2028 loan will see a 300 basis point increase in the cost of debt  the after tax free cash flow per share would be impacted by just 10 cents per share.Verallia Investor RelationsInvestment thesisIn the ESCI portfolio  a long position was established in 2022 at an average price of 22.31 EUR with the most recent purchase being a top-up at 22.76 EUR per share in June. Ever since adding Verallia to the portfolio  I was aiming for an exit point around 40 EUR per share. As the situation got a bit trickier and as the natural gas prices remained at elevated levels until pretty recently  I didn‚Äôt want to expect too much from a heavy user of natural gas and I wrote a call option against the position which would result in an average exit price of just under 35 EUR per share for a capital gain of in excess of 50% and a total return of close to 60% in about a year time.Seeing how strong the fourth quarter was  and seeing the FY 2023 guidance  it looks like I pulled the trigger too early. While I‚Äôm definitely happy with a 60% return in about a year  I am (pleasantly) surprised by Verallia‚Äôs guidance while the decreasing natural gas price in Europe will obviously also play a big role in protecting Verallia‚Äôs margins.I will keep an eye on Verallia and perhaps I will re-enter the stock on any weakness. As based on the prospects for 2023  Verallia is still cheap.

The review classification is Priority.VLA1553 has been assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) review goal date at the end of August 2023  which is the date by which the FDA intends to take action on the application. The FDA‚Äôs acknowledgement of filing does not mean that a license will be granted  nor does it represent any evaluation of the adequacy of the data submitted.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat. As of July 2022  there were more than 3 million reported cases in the Americas1 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after three to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. It is estimated that over three quarters of the world‚Äôs population live in areas at-risk of CHIKV transmission2. High risk areas of infection are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are currently endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 100 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15533. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20194  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union‚Äôs Horizon 2020 program.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 20225  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20226 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 20227.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva‚Äôs existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to commercialize three vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against the chikungunya virus and Lyme disease.Valneva Investor and Media ContactsLaetitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to the progress  timing  results and completion of research  development and clinical trials for product candidates  to regulatory approval of product candidates and review of existing products.

This would make only the institution liable while shielding its employees including top executives  a move the Treasury believes could speed up the listing process.The bill also proposes restricting the liability of listing companies to cases of serious misconduct that damage investor interests due to information included in the IPO documents.In addition  the scheme reinforces the possibility of bypassing the formal IPO process through a so-called self-placement  which sees a company sell shares directly  saving the money required to line up underwriters as middlemen.As part of a drive to boost funding sources other than bank credit  a measure being discussed would allow companies to issue bonds for an amount exceeding the current limit of twice the share capital  provided that these notes were bought by professional investors.($1 = 0.9362 euros)(Reporting by Giuseppe Fonte in Rome  additional reporting by Elisa Anzolin in Milan; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)By Giuseppe Fonte",positive,0.71,0.29,0.0,mixed,0.14,0.11,0.74,True,English,"['Milan bourse', 'Italy', 'measures', 'allure', 'Treasury junior minister Federico Freni', 'Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni', 'European Union peers', 'initial public offerings', 'adequate risk disclosure', 'other expansion strategies', 'formal IPO process', 'current rules companies', 'other bourses', 'IPO documents', 'current limit', 'listing process', 'infrastructure group', 'Agnelli family', 'six newcomers', 'tight grip', 'family-run businesses', 'M&A', 'previous administration', 'Mario Draghi', 'wide range', 'medium-sized enterprises', 'SME qualification', 'market watchdog', 'top executives', 'serious misconduct', 'investor interests', 'funding sources', 'bank credit', 'share capital', 'Giuseppe Fonte', 'additional reporting', 'Elisa Anzolin', 'Emelia Sithole-Matarise', '680 billion euros', '500 million euros', '1 billion euros', 'overall capitalisation', 'holding company', 'EASING SELF-PLACEMENT', 'professional investors', 'listing companies', 'Euronext Milan', '0.9362 euros', '15 companies', 'value', 'Atlantia', 'Exor', 'exits', 'Amsterdam', 'regulations', 'shareholders', 'challenge', 'Italy', 'control', 'cash', 'parliament', 'April', 'ability', 'Reuters', 'government', 'proposals', 'details', 'IPOs', 'draft', 'measures', 'Rome', 'firms', 'simplifications', 'incentives', 'small', 'SMEs', 'threshold', 'provision', 'savers', 'staff', 'regulators', 'Consob', 'damages', 'institution', 'employees', 'move', 'cases', 'information', 'scheme', 'possibility', 'shares', 'money', 'underwriters', 'middlemen', 'part', 'drive', 'bonds', 'amount', 'notes', 'Editing']",2023-02-20,2023-02-20,marketscreener.com

18852,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/italy-working-on-measures-to-boost-milan-bourses-allure-1289389,Italy working on measures to boost Milan bourse‚Äôs allure,By Giuseppe Fonte ROME (Reuters) -   Italy is readying measures to address the issues holding back the country&#039;s capital markets and reinforce the role of the 200-year-old Borsa Italiana  according to government officials and a draft bill seen by Reuters‚Ä¶,With an overall capitalisation of around 680 billion euros ($726.3 billion)  the value of companies listed on Milan‚Äôs bourse lags far behind European Union peers.Last year 15 companies abandoned Euronext Milan  including the infrastructure group Atlantia and Agnelli family‚Äôs holding company Exor  with six newcomers to compensate for exits.Some of those which delisted were drawn to other bourses  notably Amsterdam  where regulations help leading shareholders to preserve a tight grip on companies.Adding to the challenge  Italy‚Äôs family-run businesses are unwilling to relinquish control by listing unless they need cash for M&A or other expansion strategies.‚ÄúWe aim to present a bill in parliament by April to strengthen Milan‚Äôs ability to encourage listing ‚Äù Treasury junior minister Federico Freni told Reuters.Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni‚Äôs government plans to adopt some proposals studied under the previous administration led by Mario Draghi  Freni added without giving details.To boost initial public offerings (IPOs) in Milan  the draft bill includes measures to simplify the listing process  which current rules companies say make it costly and cumbersome to provide adequate risk disclosure for investors.EASING SELF-PLACEMENTRome could also allow a wide range of firms to benefit from the simplifications and incentives already provided for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which plan to list.‚ÄúSME qualification is currently envisaged when capitalisation does not exceed 500 million euros: such a threshold would be increased to 1 billion euros ‚Äù the draft showed.A further measure would scrap a provision designed to protect savers that holds staff of regulators such as market watchdog Consob liable for damages. This would make only the institution liable while shielding its employees including top executives  a move the Treasury believes could speed up the listing process.The bill also proposes restricting the liability of listing companies to cases of serious misconduct that damage investor interests due to information included in the IPO documents.In addition  the scheme reinforces the possibility of bypassing the formal IPO process through a so-called self-placement  which sees a company sell shares directly  saving the money required to line up underwriters as middlemen.As part of a drive to boost funding sources other than bank credit  a measure being discussed would allow companies to issue bonds for an amount exceeding the current limit of twice the share capital  provided that these notes were bought by professional investors.($1 = 0.9362 euros)(Reporting by Giuseppe Fonte in Rome  additional reporting by Elisa Anzolin in Milan; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise),positive,0.68,0.31,0.01,mixed,0.27,0.04,0.69,True,English,"['Milan bourse', 'Italy', 'measures', 'allure', 'Treasury junior minister Federico Freni', 'Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni', 'European Union peers', 'initial public offerings', 'adequate risk disclosure', 'other expansion strategies', 'formal IPO process', 'current rules companies', 'other bourses', 'IPO documents', 'current limit', 'listing process', 'infrastructure group', 'Agnelli family', 'six newcomers', 'tight grip', 'family-run businesses', 'M&A', 'previous administration', 'Mario Draghi', 'wide range', 'medium-sized enterprises', 'SME qualification', 'market watchdog', 'top executives', 'serious misconduct', 'investor interests', 'funding sources', 'bank credit', 'share capital', 'Giuseppe Fonte', 'additional reporting', 'Elisa Anzolin', 'Emelia Sithole-Matarise', '680 billion euros', '500 million euros', '1 billion euros', 'overall capitalisation', 'holding company', 'EASING SELF-PLACEMENT', 'professional investors', 'listing companies', 'Euronext Milan', '0.9362 euros', '15 companies', 'value', 'Atlantia', 'Exor', 'exits', 'Amsterdam', 'regulations', 'shareholders', 'challenge', 'Italy', 'control', 'cash', 'parliament', 'April', 'ability', 'Reuters', 'government', 'proposals', 'details', 'IPOs', 'draft', 'measures', 'Rome', 'firms', 'simplifications', 'incentives', 'small', 'SMEs', 'threshold', 'provision', 'savers', 'staff', 'regulators', 'Consob', 'damages', 'institution', 'employees', 'move', 'cases', 'information', 'scheme', 'possibility', 'shares', 'money', 'underwriters', 'middlemen', 'part', 'drive', 'bonds', 'amount', 'notes', 'Editing']",2023-02-20,2023-02-20,fxempire.com

ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESERESTRICTIONS MAY CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWSAs stated in all the recent shareholder communications  DCAC has continued to explore possibleBusiness Combination targets.We now inform shareholders that DCAC has today in principle agreed to combine DCAC with thetarget business in the energy infrastructure sector  Advanced Cables  following the receipt of supportfrom the UK government‚Äôs Department of International Trade (‚ÄúDIT‚Äù) for the company‚Äôs plans  andwith the support of Advanced Cables‚Äô shareholders and other interested parties.There is no guarantee that the Advanced Cables purchase agreement will be consummated  not least itis subject to further regulatory and governmental approvals or  at the least  ‚Äònon-objection‚Äô. However shareholders contemplating submitting tenders under either the Repurchase Offer or the Stub TenderOffer should bear this progress in mind when making their decisions.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Warrant holders are strongly recommended to read theentirety of this document. Should they be in any doubt  then they should seek advice from a qualifiedprofessional.Advanced CablesThe shareholders of Advanced Cables have confirmed their intent to enter into a business combinationwith DCAC (the ‚ÄúAdvanced Cables Business Combination‚Äù) by granting DCAC first refusal toacquire all their shares for between 375 million and 400 million Swiss Francs1  subject to theconditions below. DCAC has completed its due diligence on Advanced Cables and the proposedtransaction has been approved by the boards of both DCAC and of Advanced Cables  including thepositive agreement of the independent directors of both companies. Once important governmentaland regulatory approvals have been satisfied  DCAC will issue further information to its shareholders.Whilst DIT has demonstrated its support  there is no guarantee that regulatory and/or furthergovernmental approvals  permits and authorisations  or at the least ‚Äònon-objections‚Äô  will beforthcoming.ObjectivesThe purpose of the potential listing is to diversify Advanced Cables‚Äô shareholder base  raise its profileand to have the opportunity to use listed shares to merge with complementary businesses in its largemarket segment. Advanced Cables and DCAC are exploring several opportunities to acquire thedivisions of large companies in its own and adjacent asset-rich spheres of operations  although thiscannot be guaranteed. Whilst no further capital is likely to be required to put into effect the BusinessCombination  in due course  a Further Primary Capital raise is anticipated (as noted below)  whichAdvanced Cables believes will be best achieved via the capital markets.Advanced Cables aims first to supply the burgeoning demand for HVDC cables to connect renewablepower generation to the onshore grids; and then to foster the interconnection of national grids acrossborders. This ESG goal-enhancing sector requires many billions in capital investment to expand anddeliver on the transition to NetZero; to facilitate the renewal and transformation of legacyinfrastructure; and to rise to the challenge of fighting climate change. Advanced Cables is developingworld-class cable manufacturing operations to serve these sectors  whose development is beinghampered by a severe shortage of high-quality cable. This under-invested sector has historicallydelivered strong returns on capital; and high operational margins offer the prospect of resilient longtermflows of cash earnings and thus the potential for strong dividend flows to DCAC shareholders.To date  capital constrained cable manufacturers have been unable to grasp the opportunity that theirproduction of the key component for their customers affords  in terms of taking stakes in the projectsthat their customers are developing. Nor have they teamed up with those customers to mutualadvantage. Advanced Cables has been engaged in close discussions with international grid operatorsand project developers  with whom it expects to co-invest. Capital growth may potentially come fromthe deployment of capital and expertise into building out into under-served markets; harnessing capitaland strategic stakebuilding to vertically integrate and capture and expand existing internationalopportunities; and to transform legacy business models  with the efficiencies of bringing proventechnology and expertise to bear in large scale.It is DCAC‚Äôs contention that governments and regulators prefer to see a publicly listed operation having the benefit of being subject to transparency and governance requirements. The DCAC boardand special advisers bring to Advanced Cables a strong pedigree of successfully implementing a ‚Äòbuybuild-transform‚Äô investment philosophy within a framework of strong governance  spanning theprivate  publicly listed and state-owned entities. A highly experienced independent leading sectorexpert will be appointed to chair the DCAC board  in the event that the proposed BusinessCombination proceeds.The board of DCAC wish to share the benefits of its Euronext Amsterdam listing with all those DCACOrdinary Shareholders and DCAC Warrant holders who have supported the recent reconstruction  notleast by capturing a premium to the current net asset value to reflect the value of the listing. Theestimated Net Asset Value as at 15th Feb 2023 was ¬£10.27 per DCAC Ordinary Share  being the netcash after the payment of liabilities as set out in the Shareholder Circular.However  given the smaller size of the Advanced Cables proposal than the targets originallyenvisaged  including Saxo Bank at some ‚Ç¨2.0 to ‚Ç¨2.2 billion  the DCAC board and Sponsors believeit is appropriate to reduce the dilution from the Sponsor‚Äôs ‚Äòpromote‚Äô  being the package of SponsorShares and Sponsor Warrants.Acquisition TermsThe terms of the agreements agreed in principle for the proposed Advanced Cables BusinessCombination would initially comprise a sale of Advanced Cables to DCAC in exchange for the issueof DCAC Shares at a price of GBP 11.50 per DCAC Share.The DCAC Shares would come from a combination of the issue of new DCAC Shares and Shares held intreasury. DCAC will be the ongoing Euronext Amsterdam listed entity  subject to the admission of thenew Shares to listing.Conditions Precedent applying to DCACThe proposed agreement with Advanced Cables is predicated upon  inter alia  that:(i) DCAC shareholders approve the Advanced Cables Business Combination (by shareholder voteas retained in the Amended Articles).(ii) Changes are made to reduce the Sponsor promote arrangements (as below) and  potentially to reward the Advanced Cables management rather than the Sponsors by the transfer ofSponsor Warrants to the Advanced Cables management incentive plan.(iii) The DCAC Shares and Warrants continue to be listed on Euronext Amsterdam and that DCACmaintains sufficient external shareholders to satisfy any ‚Äòfree float‚Äô requirements of EuronextAmsterdam. As Advanced Cables would have ¬±89% of the enlarged share capital  and theSponsor Group over 5%  this is estimated to amount to at least 1 750 000 shares being inpublic hands  post such Advanced Cables Business Combination.(iv) The Amended Articles contain an obligation on the Company that  in case the Company intendsto consummate a Business Combination with a target or business that is affiliated with a holderof Sponsor Shares or a director  the remaining non-affiliated director(s) either (i) obtains anopinion from an independent investment banking firm and/or (ii) procures that persons that arenot affiliated to  managed by or advised by a holder of Sponsor Shares or any Insider (or anyof its affiliates) subscribe for new shares or interests (a) in the target or business the subject ofa Business Combination at the same time and price and on the same terms as the Company or(b) in the Company at the same time and price and on the same terms the Company is proposingto issue such shares or interests to the vendors of and/or persons connected to the target orbusiness the subject of a Business Combination.As related parties hold shares in both DCAC and Advanced Cables  it is intended to addressthese conflicts of interests as follows:a. The non-affiliated directors of both Advanced Cables and DCAC have today approvedentering into substantive discussionsb. An independent investment banking firm is being appointed to provide a fairnessopinion.c. The valuation will also be subject to an independent review by the auditors.d. Certain independent Advanced Cables shareholders intend to acquire additional AdvancedCables shares shortly before Business Combinatione. Independent investors have indicated that they intend to acquire additional DCACshares on Business Combination.Changes to Sponsor Shares and Sponsor WarrantsThe Advanced Cables board and shareholders have demanded as a pre-condition of the agreement and the DCAC Board and Sponsor group have agreed in principle  the following changes to theSponsor promote arrangements:(i) The Sponsor Group will place all the DCAC Sponsor Warrants into an Advanced CablesManagement MIP. The DCAC Board believes that this will benefit all DCAC and formerAdvanced Cables shareholders not least to ensure an alignment of interest with AdvancedCables management.(ii) These ex-Sponsor Warrants and the Over-Subscription Warrants held by the Sponsor bechanged to remove the cashless exercise option  and so make them capable of cash exerciseonly.(iii) The second tranche of Founder Shares  representing approximately 10% of the total number ofOrdinary Shares .. only [granted] if the closing price of the Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds GBP13.00 per Ordinary Share  be cancelled and so no longer dilute other DCAC and formerAdvanced Cables shareholders.First Tranche of Sponsor SharesThe Advanced Cables Business Combination Agreement does not propose to change the shareholdingposition from the Prospectus for the first tranche of Sponsor Shares  so potentially giving DCACSponsors 1.5625 million Shares if the conditions are met:Post-Business Combination Completion Date  a triggering event occurs for the issuance of the first tranche ofSponsor Shares representing approximately 10% of the total number of Ordinary Shares issued to the OrdinaryShareholders [at IPO]  only if the closing price of the Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds GBP 10.00 per OrdinaryShare  for any 20 Trading Days within a 30 Trading Day period.Shareholder ConsentDCAC will distribute a shareholder circular to seek shareholder consent to the Advanced CablesBusiness Combination from its shareholders  only once the governmental and regulatoryconfirmations have been received.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will be able to vote only on such DCAC Ordinary Shares as they retainat the record date of such future EGM to consider the Advanced Cables Business Combination.No Secondary PlacingIf the proposals are approved  the Advanced Cables shareholders  who include related parties includingRTE International  will enter into customary lock up arrangements.Primary Capital Raisings envisaged post Advanced CablesSecondary ListingDCAC further intends within the next three months to seek a secondary listing on NASDAQ OMX as well as benefitting from the Euronext network of exchanges across EuropeImpact of Cash exercise of WarrantsCashless conversion does not apply to Public Warrants. Therefore  the cash exercise of Warrants when combined with the changes to ex-Sponsor Warrants and the Over-Subscription Warrants held bythe Sponsor  to make them capable of cash exercise only  could result in up to ¬£98.68 million of freshcash coming into DCAC.DCAC intends to offer improvements in the warrant terms to reward early exercise in conjunctionwith a ‚Äòrights issue‚Äô and open offer.Possible Rights Issue and Open OfferNo primary capital is expected to be required in the near term  as long as DCAC maintains sufficientexternal shareholders to satisfy any ‚Äòfree float‚Äô requirements of Euronext Amsterdam. This isestimated  post-Advanced Cables to amount to at least 1 750 000 shares in public hands  subject toconfirmation by Euronext Amsterdam.However  to enhance liquidity and to provide capital for further expansion and growth  in particularto secure both its manufacturing and the offtakers for its key outputs for several years to come Advanced Cables is in the process of and currently intends by the end of May 2023 to raise GBP 318million in the form of debt and equity.Major strategic operators have indicated their intentions to subscribe equity to an operationalsubsidiary of Advanced Cables; and a leading commercial bank that it will lend up to GBP 180 millionto the cable manufacturing operation  albeit on the condition that the bank enjoys the support of UKgovernment entities. DIT has been instrumental in assisting with these discussions. Were suchindications to be consummated  then the fundraising at the DCAC level would be of the order of GBP50 to 70 million. Strategic customers have indicated their willingness to contract with AdvancedCables and to invest via DCAC to secure their supply chain and so assure the delivery of their majorprojects.To the extent that further funding is required  notably after the possible early exercise of DCACWarrants  then it is currently intended that new DCAC Ordinary Shares and/or Convertible Loans willbe issued. The intended offer price is in the range of GBP 13.00 to 16.00 per DCAC Ordinary Share.The terms of any possible Convertible Loan have yet to be determined.To reward early exercise  it is intended that DCAC Warrant holders who exercise their warrants forcash at the time of the proposed Offer will be given a discount on the exercise price to reflect the timevalue of their warrant. The terms of any such discount have yet to be determined.The stated intentions of DCAC are that it will grant pre-emption rights to subscribe for new shares inthe Company to provide any funding requirement  before DCAC goes out to the wider market.Therefore  DCAC intends that first refusal will be given to current DCAC shareholders and to formerAdvanced Cables shareholders  including the Truell Conservation Foundation2 and Long TermAssets3  to subscribe at GBP 12.50 per new Ordinary Share.Status of the Repurchase OfferCopies of the Repurchase Tender Document and the Stub Tender Offer Circular are available onDCAC's website: www.disruptivecapitalac.com.Under the Repurchase Offer (as defined and undertaken pursuant to the Repurchase Tender Documentissued by the Company on 25 January 2023)  shareholders have been eligible to submit tenders aheadof the final date for tenders to be submitted  being the 22nd February 2023.DCAC Shareholders contemplating submitting tenders under the Repurchase Offer should bear theCompany‚Äôs progress in mind when making their decisions.Under the Advanced Cables Business Combination arrangements  if so approved  it is intended thatDCAC Ordinary Shares are to be issued at GBP 11.50 per Share.As of today 20th February 2023  GBP 69 446 789 of tenders have been or are in the process of beingsettled  all at a price of GBP 10.789 per share.The repurchased DCAC Ordinary Shares will be held as Treasury Shares  pending prospective reissueunder the Advanced Cables Business Combination. The Company confirms that  once these repurchaseshave been settled  the Company will have 64% of its share capital outstanding in public hands.Stub Tender OfferShareholders contemplating submitting tenders under the Stub Tender Offer should bear the Company‚Äôsprogress in mind when making their decisions.The maximum price on offer under the Stub Tender Offer is ¬£2.20 per DCAC Ordinary Share  whichcompares to the last trading price of ¬£10.00 per DCAC Ordinary Share  the Repurchase Offer price of¬£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary Share; and now the in principle agreement to issue DCAC Ordinary Sharesat ¬£11.50 per DCAC Ordinary Shares.The estimated Net Asset Value as at 15th Feb 2023 was ¬£10.27 per DCAC Ordinary Share.Accompanying Stub WarrantsShareholders contemplating submitting tenders of the accompanying Warrants under the Stub TenderOffer should bear the Company‚Äôs progress in mind when making their decisions.As under the Advanced Cables Business Combination arrangements  if so approved  it is intended thatDCAC Ordinary Shares be issued at GBP 11.50 per Share  being equivalent to the Warrant exercise price it is likely that the Warrants will trade at a level reflecting an ‚Äòat the money‚Äô option with 5 years maturity.Whilst it is difficult to predict this trading level with any certainty  it may be a multiple of the value beingoffered under the Stub Tender Offer.AdvisersDCAC has invited JP Morgan to act as adviser to the proposals. This invitation is being examinedand may or may not be accepted.Advanced Cables already has in place a full suite of advisers  including Afry  Red Penguin  and Aecom.Possible fallback Business CombinationIn the light of the experience with Saxo Bank and the inevitable uncertainties around closing theAdvanced Cables transaction  DCAC continues to be in discussions on undertaking a BusinessCombination with a target business operating in the financial services sector. Both targets haveheadquarters and principal operations in Western and/or Northern Europe.We recommend that shareholders take careful heed of the positive impact these proposals may bringto the Company; and DCAC looks forward to being in contact with further information.Edmund TruellCEO  DCACAbout DCACDCAC is a special purpose acquisition company incorporated on 29 April 2021 under the CompaniesLaw as a non-cellular company limited by shares.

The review classification is Priority.VLA1553 has been assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) review goal date at the end of August 2023  which is the date by which the FDA intends to take action on the application. The FDA‚Äôs acknowledgement of filing does not mean that a license will be granted  nor does it represent any evaluation of the adequacy of the data submitted.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat. As of July 2022  there were more than 3 million reported cases in the Americas1 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after three to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. It is estimated that over three quarters of the world‚Äôs population live in areas at-risk of CHIKV transmission2. High risk areas of infection are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are currently endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 100 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15533. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20194  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union‚Äôs Horizon 2020 program.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 20225  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20226 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 20227.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva‚Äôs existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to commercialize three vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against the chikungunya virus and Lyme disease.Valneva Investor and Media ContactsLaetitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to the progress  timing  results and completion of research  development and clinical trials for product candidates  to regulatory approval of product candidates and review of existing products.

Dr. Best will receive the Young Investigator Award for her outstanding research.""  presented by Dr. Hannah Best of Cardiff University  will feature her research on the CLN3 protein in Batten disease on Wednesday 22 February at 9am. Dr. Best will receive the Young Investigator Award for her outstanding research. The session will be followed by a poster session presenting our novel therapeutic strategy that usesBatten-1 to treat Batten disease by reducing toxic glycosphingolipids in neurons (Poster 229  Glycosphingolipid reduction with miglustat as a therapeutic strategy for CLN3 and other neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses   Dr. Emyr Lloyd-Evans  Cardiff University).Batten-1 to treat Batten disease by reducing toxic glycosphingolipids in neurons (Poster 229    Dr. Emyr Lloyd-Evans  Cardiff University). A broader presentation of the effects of Batten-1 active ingredient  miglustat  will also be given on the same day (Poster 230  Deciphering the various mechanisms of action of miglustat in the lysosomal disorders   Drs Emyr Lloyd-Evans and Charles Evans  Cardiff University).  Drs Emyr Lloyd-Evans and Charles Evans  Cardiff University). Lastly  a new series of studies will be presented  highlighting for the first time the burden of the disease as experienced by patients and their families (Poster 185  Understanding the functional burden of CLN3 through the eyes of patients and families  Skyler Jackson  Engage Health  BBDF  Theranexus).Theranexus CEO  Mathieu Charv√©riat explains: "" These different presentations by internationally recognized teams confirm the solid scientific and clinical rationale underpinning the development of our asset Batten-1 in juvenile Batten disease  for which there are significant unmet medical needs representing a considerable burden for families. To our knowledge  Batten-1 is the only candidate in active clinical development to tackle the major medical challenges of this disease. In this context  we are currently preparing the Phase III trial which should begin during 2023.""For Dr. Emyr Lloyd-Evans  an expert in lysosomal disease indications from Cardiff University  ""W e are delighted to present our innovative research on CLN3 and miglustat to our peers  underlining a solid rationale for the use of Batten-1 in juvenile Batten disease. In this disease  as in the other two similar indications for which miglustat is registered and efficacious in patients  the drug blocks the toxic buildup of glycosphingolipids. Our scientific data and in-depth knowledge of miglustat therefore converge towards a potential efficacy of this drug candidate in Batten disease and we are excited for it to be tested in the Phase III trial to be conducted by Theranexus and BBDF.""""We present initial research quantifying the significant burden suffered by patients  families and caregivers  which justifies the absolute need to develop novel therapeutic approaches. The research also highlights  as regularly observed in our discussions with patients' families and advocacy organizations  the wish of families to take part in clinical developments such as those led with Theranexus "" concludes Craig Benson  Chair of Beyond Batten Disease Foundation.About Batten-1Batten-1 is a novel and exclusive proprietary drug containing the active ingredient miglustat. The mechanism of action of this substance blocks the accumulation of glycosphingolipids and neuroinflammation. For patients over 17 years of age in the Phase I/II trial  the product is administered in solid form. In the Phase III trial  it will be administered in a liquid form better suited to pediatric patients.Phase I/II trial design: this is an open-label trial involving 6 patients over 17 years of age with CLN3 Batten disease  treated with miglustat up to 600 mg/day for a 2-year period. The primary endpoint is patient safety and tolerability  assessed using reports of adverse effects  biological tests and ECG  as well as the pharmacokinetics of miglustat. The secondary endpoints include efficacy monitoring: Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale  visual acuity  and brain MRI and optical coherence tomography scans. Administration of Batten-1 in escalating doses with a maximum of 600 mg/day was well tolerated  with no severe side effects observed causing treatment discontinuation. The most commonly reported adverse events are reversible gastrointestinal effects of often light to moderate severity  thus demonstrating the good tolerability profile of Batten-1 in this population. Batten-1 will continue to be assessed in these patients treated over a 24-month period. Further information about the trial is available on https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT05174039.About Batten diseaseJuvenile Batten disease  also known as Spielmeyer-Vogt or CLN3 disease  is a rare  fatal  inherited disorder of the nervous system for which there is no treatment or cure. Juvenile Batten disease belongs to a group of disorders referred to as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). Over 400 different errors in 13 genes have been attributed to various forms of NCL  which differ from one another primarily by when symptoms first appear. The first symptom in the juvenile form  progressive vision loss  appears between the ages of 4 and 6 which is followed by personality changes  behavioral problems  and slowed learning. Seizures commonly appear within 2-4 years of the onset of disease. Over time  patients continue to decline mentally and physically. Eventually  those affected become wheelchair-bound  are bedridden  and die prematurely. Psychiatric symptoms or psychosis can appear at any time.Juvenile Batten disease is always fatal; usually by the late teens to early 20s. In the United States and Europe  the juvenile form is the most common of the NCLs  which together  affect nearly 3 000 patients[1]. In pathophysiological terms  interactions between neurons and glial cells play key roles in the emergence and progression of all the NCLs.About Beyond Batten Disease FoundationBeyond Batten Disease Foundation (BBDF) is the world's largest nonprofit organization dedicated to funding research for a treatment and cure for juvenile (CLN3) Batten disease. Since its inception in 2008  over $35 million has been invested in research by leveraging donations  co-funding and strategic partnerships. BBDF is spearheading a unique  cohesive strategy  incorporating independent scientific resources and collaboration with related organizations to drive research in juvenile Batten Disease[2]. Today there is a treatment in sight. BBDF funded research has discovered a drug ‚Äì Batten-1 ‚Äì that slows the progression of the disease in Batten models.

(¬π) Constant Exchange Rate 2FULL YEAR 2022 RESULTS PRESS RELEASE Marc Oursin  Shurgard Chief Executive Officer  commented(¬π): ""Shurgard has been preparing the foundations for growth for many years  and 2022 was the year we put our foot on the accelerator. As part of the ramp up to building and acquiring 90 000 sqm annually by 2024  we have delivered accelerated revenue  margin and pipeline growth  while also improving our leading ESG results. This exceptional performance is a consequence of a strategic focus on transformational change. We are doing things faster and smarter  executed by our dedicated and committed teams that have once again delivered  and exceeded  our stretch targets. The inflationary environment across Europe looks set to continue into 2023  and we expect to manage these effects through a combination of operational efficiencies  digitization  and cost optimization. Revenue Growth The acceleration of our three levers of growth - redevelopments  new developments  and acquisitions - and a great performance from our same-store pool has resulted in a substantial increase in top line growth. All-store property operating revenue  which includes same store and non-same store revenue rose 11.7% in 2022 to ‚Ç¨333.0 million. The trajectory of top-line growth clearly demonstrates the validity of our long-term strategy. Between 2019 and 2020  all-store property operating revenue grew 5.5%  the following year we grew by 9.5% and last year by 11.7%. This trend is clear across both mature same-stores and newly opened or acquired stores. Same-store property operating revenue in 2022 increased 8.6% to ‚Ç¨313.7 million. This compares to growth of 3.2% in 2020 and 7.0% in 2021. Margin expansion Against a backdrop of high inflation and a cost-of-living crisis  Shurgard managed to control costs and increase margins significantly again in 2022. Our margins have been rising consistently as we have grown revenues faster than costs  a particularly impressive achievement in the current economic climate. The margin improvement follows a similar trajectory to revenue growth. All-store margin rose to 65.8% in 2022  from 64.7% in 2021. This in itself was an improvement on the 63.7% margin in 2020 and means we have more than achieved our medium-term target of increasing margins by 2.0pp (from a 2020 baseline). Shurgard's transformation strategy has been a key component of cost management. We introduced a Transformation Department in 2022 that has allowed the company to explore a range of new solutions  quickly select those that will deliver improvements  and ensure they add value to customers  employees  or development property. Despite accelerating the rate at which we are adding sqm to our portfolio  we contained costs through efficiencies in the development process. This has enabled Shurgard to temper the substantial construction cost increases experienced in 2022. Digitalization has also helped to keep costs under control. Shurgard has long been a digital leader  transitioning our customer journey from store-led to hybrid digital solutions that cater to our increasingly online customers. They are pleased with their seamless customer journey  as evidenced by our Google review scores (4.8 out of 5 collated from over 300 reviews per property all-time) which have improved year-on-year. Where the pandemic speeded up our e- rental offer  we have continued to explore the best service options across our portfolio. This has meant changing the way we operate some properties  including remote  partial  or fully managed  depending on customer needs. Meanwhile  transformation improvements in the employee journey include new ways of operating that increase our speed  efficiency  and communication across departments. (¬π) The data are presented at constant exchange rate (CER) 3FULL YEAR 2022 RESULTS PRESS RELEASE Pipeline acceleration The transformation of our property journey has been a vital part of Shurgard's acceleration program. We are filling the pipeline with redevelopments  new developments  and acquisition opportunities to achieve our target of increasing sqm by c. 90 000 annually by 2024. We can see the new strategy at work  when comparing the increase in percentage of non-same store revenue over the last three years. In 2020  revenue from acquisitions less than a year old  or developments less than three years old  accounted for just 4.3% of total revenue. This rose to more than 5.2% in 2021 and 5.8% in the year just ended  and the outlook for 2023 is another substantial increase. Shurgard set out a strategy of increased investment to accelerate property development and compared with 2021 we will double our annual investment by 2024. Included in these investments are projects to ensure our new development opportunities are cost-effective  efficient and adhere to high environmental standards. This means ensuring LED lighting in all our properties  including heat pumps and solar panels where feasible  and implementing a smart building management system  all of which are designed to both lower our energy footprint and maintain tight cost controls. We have been recognized for our concerted ESG efforts by the industry bodies whose principles we adhere to. We were rated by MSCI for the first time in 2022 and initiated with a AA rating  only one grade away from their highest level. We also retained our leading rating from Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB)  where we were awarded an excellent 5-star rating (the top banding) and a score of 90 out of 100. Financial Strength - Becoming a UK REIT Shurgard's financial strength is based on a prudent finance strategy that aims to allow us to execute our operational and investment strategy no matter the market conditions. In 2022  we decided to support this strategy by taking the decision to become a UK REIT. As part of this  we migrated our corporate seat back to Guernsey  although we will continue to be listed and traded on Euronext Brussels. This structural change brings with it many benefits. Previously we forecasted that our effective tax rate would be around 22% in 2025 and we now believe that  based on the implementation of the REIT status in the UK  this rate will be around 18%. In addition  the move will allow us to be better positioned to take part of investments opportunities present in the UK market. We will also propose to our shareholders to vote in May 2023 on the strengthening of our already robust governance by increasing the ratio of independent directors on the Board (67%) and broadening our diversity profile by increasing the ratio of women in governance (33%). With our strong balance sheet and financing strategy  we have access to all types of capital markets to optimally address any financing needs. We also have an undrawn ‚Ç¨250 million revolving facility and an uncommitted ‚Ç¨250 million shelf USPP note available. Outlook So far  Shurgard has proved itself resilient amid all social  political  and economic challenges. In this climate we have proved that our services remain vital for customers going through life changes  and we have been able to increase rental prices to reflect our own increased costs while maintaining strong levels of occupancy. We are mindful of the external environment  nonetheless  we expect our all-store revenue to grow over 8% in 2023.

EBITDA ratio between 2.0x and 2.4x at December 31  2023  including the effect of the disposal program of ‚Ç¨1bn by end-2023 Patrick KOLLER  CEO of Faurecia  declared: ‚Äú2022 has been a historic year for the Group as we closed the acquisition of a majority stake in HELLA to create FORVIA  the world‚Äôs 7th biggest automotive technology player  combining the complementary offers and strengths of the two companies. 2022  which was initially expected to be a year of recovery from the Covid crisis  turned out to be a year of continued semiconductor shortages and supply chain issues heightened by the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. The year was characterized by additional challenges  with high inflation  a surge in energy prices  rising interest rates and our disengagement from Russia. In this uncertain environment  FORVIA‚Äôs 2022 performance reflects the new size of the Group  with consolidated sales above 25 billion euros  a resilient operating margin that reached 5% of sales in the second half of the year and a strong generation of net cash flow at 471 million euros. We have fully refinanced the bridge-to-loan and bridge-to-equity to acquire HELLA. The disposals we have announced to date fulfill our 1 billion euro divestment program of non-strategic assets. The significant progress made in the integration of HELLA allows us to raise both the cost and sales synergy targets. With our assumption that 2023 volumes will be at a similar level to 2022  we target to improve our financial performance in 2023. I would like to thank all the Faurecia and HELLA teams for their commitment to the creation of FORVIA  succeeding in a tough environment to deliver resilient financial performance and to creating the conditions for future success and profitable growth  comforted by the solid order intake of 31 billion euros recorded last year.‚Äù The 2022 consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors  under the chairmanship of Michel de ROSEN  at its meeting held on February 17  2023.These financial statements have been audited.There is no full comparability between figures reported for 2021 and figures reported for 2022 as: Figures reported for 2021 are figures related to Faurecia ‚Äústand-alone‚Äù as reported in February 2022 Figures reported for 2022 include a major scope effect  i.e. the consolidation of HELLA since February 1  2022 (i.e. 11 months in 2022  representing 26% of total Group sales).KEY ACHIEVEMENTS SINCE THE START OF 2022 2022: FROM FAURECIA TO FORVIA  COMBINING FAURECIA‚ÄôS AND HELLA‚ÄôS STRENGTHS AND CREATING FORVIA  THE WORLD‚ÄôS 7th BIGGEST AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY SUPPLIER  WITH SALES OF C. ‚Ç¨30BN IN 2025 On January 31  2022  Faurecia closed the acquisition of a majority stake of 82% in HELLA. HELLA has been consolidated in Faurecia‚Äôs accounts since February 1  2022. The newly combined FORVIA Group‚Äôs mission is: ‚ÄúWE PIONEER TECHNOLOGY FOR MOBILITY EXPERIENCES THAT MATTER TO PEOPLE‚Äù. On November 3  2022  Faurecia and HELLA held their first joint Capital Markets Day in Paris  during which FORVIA unveiled its Power25 medium-term plan to drive profitable growth  enhance cash generation and accelerate Group deleveraging (all details available on www.forvia.com). FORVIA‚Äôs Power25 plan is focused on three key strategic priorities: Drive sales growth through innovation and sustainability Enhance profitability and lower breakeven Generate strong cash conversion and actively manage portfolio to accelerate Group deleveraging. These ambitions are translated into the following 2025 financial objectives (based on an assumption of worldwide automotive production of 88 million units in 2025 and after the estimated effect of the ‚Ç¨1bn disposal program by end-2023): 2025 sales of c. ‚Ç¨30 billion 2025 operating margin > 7% of sales 2025 net cash flow at 4% of sales Net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA < 1.5x at December 31  2025 In January 2023  FORVIA presented at CES 2023 in Las Vegas its combined portfolio of Faurecia and HELLA technologies addressing megatrends in electrification  automated driving  and personalized cockpits. The world's first Solid State Lighting High-Definition headlamp (SSL | HD) presented by the Group received a CES 2023 Innovation Award. As from 2023  Faurecia and HELLA‚Äôs fiscal years are aligned on the calendar year.Significant progress achieved in the integration process of HELLA: cost synergies upgraded to more than ‚Ç¨300 million 2025 EBITDA run-rate (vs. > ‚Ç¨250 million previously) and sales synergies upgraded to more than ‚Ç¨400 million in 2025 (vs. between ‚Ç¨300 million and ‚Ç¨400 million previously)  supported by strong 2022 joint order intake for ‚Ç¨1.8 billion Since the effective entry of HELLA into the Group‚Äôs consolidation scope  the two companies  under the leadership of their respective management teams  have accelerated collaboration and achieved significant progress in generating synergies. As regards cost synergies  over 200 individual synergy measures have been validated by Faurecia‚Äôs and HELLA‚Äôs teams. They can be broken down into more than 1 000 detailed actions  with robust tracking and governance. As a result  cost synergies and optimization have been upgraded to more than ‚Ç¨300 million 2025 EBITDA run-rate (vs. more than ‚Ç¨250 million previously). Concerning sales synergies  Faurecia‚Äôs and HELLA‚Äôs joined forces succeeded in generating a strong order intake of ‚Ç¨1.8 billion in 2022  demonstrating the potential for combined commercial offers and opportunities in the coming years  notably capitalizing on CES 2023 successes. The 2022 joint order intake of ‚Ç¨1.8 billion already represents more than ‚Ç¨300 million of 2025 sales synergies or more than ‚Ç¨400 million 2026 run-rate. Sales synergies are now upgraded to more than ‚Ç¨400 million by 2025 (vs. between ‚Ç¨300 million and ‚Ç¨400 million previously). SOLID ORDER INTAKE OF ‚Ç¨31BN IN FY 2022 SUPPORTS MEDIUM-TERM PROFITABLE GROWTH DRIVERS In 2022  FORVIA (Faurecia + HELLA) recorded a solid order intake of ‚Ç¨31 billion  with an average operating margin above 7%  already reaching the Power25 plan‚Äôs targeted profitability. New 2022 awards reflect FORVIA‚Äôs strategy to focus on key activities; they included: ‚Ç¨8.4 billion for Electronics  representing 27% of the Group‚Äôs total order intake and demonstrating the strong potential of Electronics representing 27% of the Group‚Äôs total order intake and demonstrating the strong potential of Electronics  ‚Ç¨13.3 billion for Electric Vehicles (BEVs and FCEVs)  representing 43% of the Group‚Äôs total order intake and demonstrating acceleration on the Zero Emissions strategy representing 43% of the Group‚Äôs total order intake and demonstrating acceleration on the Zero Emissions strategy  ‚Ç¨6.2 billion for China  representing 20% of the Group‚Äôs total order intake and reflecting the continued strong growth of this highly profitable market representing 20% of the Group‚Äôs total order intake and reflecting the continued strong growth of this highly profitable market  ‚Ç¨18.8 billion for Premium Vehicles and SUVs  representing 61% of the Group‚Äôs total order intake and reflecting the Group‚Äôs strong positioning on segments with the highest content per vehicle. REFINANCING OF THE ACQUISITION OF HELLA COMPLETED The acquisition of an 82% stake in HELLA represented a total investment of ‚Ç¨5.4 billion. The financing was fully secured through a committed bridge facility of ‚Ç¨5.5bn  signed in August 2021. This bridge facility included a bridge-to-equity component  whose deadline was mid-February 2023  and a bridge-to-loan  whose deadline was mid-August 2023. The refinancing has been entirely completed  although markets conditions have proven more difficult since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine and the start of a period of strong inflation. Out of the total investment of ‚Ç¨5.4 billion: ‚Ç¨0.5 billion was paid in shares through a Faurecia capital increase reserved to the Hueck/Roepke Family pool (now holding 9.22% of Faurecia‚Äôs share capital) ‚Ç¨0.7 billion was financed through a capital increase with preferential subscription rights issued in June 2022 (45 482 154 new shares at a subscription price of ‚Ç¨15.50). The rest was financed through debt issuances and use of cash for a total amount of ‚Ç¨4.2 billion. Total HELLA-related average cost of financing for this amount of ‚Ç¨4.2billion is estimated at c. 4.5% (estimation based on Euribor 1 month at 2.50%). ‚Ç¨1BN DISPOSAL PROGRAM OF NON-STRATEGIC ASSETS BY END-2023 FULFILLED THROUGH CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS ANNOUNCED TO DATE With yesterday‚Äôs announcement that the Motherson group has committed to acquire Faurecia‚Äôs SAS Cockpit Modules division  contemplated transactions announced to date fulfill FORVIA‚Äôs ‚Ç¨1 billion disposal program of non-strategic assets by end-2023  designed to accelerate deleveraging after the HELLA acquisition. In July 2022: HELLA announced the sale of its 33.33% stake in HBPO to its co-shareholder  Plastic Omnium  for a price of c. ‚Ç¨290 million and the transaction was closed  as expected  in December 2022. In December 2022: Faurecia announced the sale of its Interiors business in India to TAFE (Tractors and Farm Equipment Ltd) Faurecia  Michelin (its 50/50 partner in Symbio) and Stellantis announced they were in exclusive negotiations for Stellantis to acquire a substantial stake in Symbio  a leader in zero emission hydrogen mobility. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur in H1 2023 and is subject to customary closing conditions  including regulatory approvals. In February 2023: Faurecia and Cummins announced they are in exclusive negotiations for the potential sale to Cummins of Faurecia‚Äôs commercial vehicle exhaust aftertreatment business in Europe and the United States for an enterprise value of ‚Ç¨150 million.Faurecia announced yesterday that the Motherson group has committed to acquire its SAS Cockpit Modules division (assembly and logistics services)  reported as part of its Interiors Segment  for an enterprise value of ‚Ç¨540 million.

All regions contributed to the full-year organic growth: China and North America grew in strong double-digits  while Europe grew in high single-digits. North America was driven by Stellantis (as the Michigan program only got underway in H2 2021) and China was driven by very strong growth from Chinese OEMs (mostly BYD) and a US EV carmaker present in China. Operating income Operating income in H2 recovered to 3.2% of sales from 1.8% of sales in H1  resulting in full-year operating margin of 2.6% of sales  down 210bps year-on-year. The sequential improvement in H2 reflected continued reduction in extra costs related to the Michigan plant (‚Ç¨35 million in H2 2022 after ‚Ç¨45 million in H1 2022 and ‚Ç¨100 million in H2 2021).

EBITDA ratio between 2.0x and 2.4x at December 31  2023  including the effect of the disposal program of ‚Ç¨1bn by end-2023 Patrick KOLLER  CEO of Faurecia  declared: ‚Äú2022 has been a historic year for the Group as we closed the acquisition of a majority stake in HELLA to create FORVIA  the world‚Äôs 7th biggest automotive technology player  combining the complementary offers and strengths of the two companies. 2022  which was initially expected to be a year of recovery from the Covid crisis  turned out to be a year of continued semiconductor shortages and supply chain issues heightened by the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. The year was characterized by additional challenges  with high inflation  a surge in energy prices  rising interest rates and our disengagement from Russia. In this uncertain environment  FORVIA‚Äôs 2022 performance reflects the new size of the Group  with consolidated sales above 25 billion euros  a resilient operating margin that reached 5% of sales in the second half of the year and a strong generation of net cash flow at 471 million euros. We have fully refinanced the bridge-to-loan and bridge-to-equity to acquire HELLA. The disposals we have announced to date fulfill our 1 billion euro divestment program of non-strategic assets. The significant progress made in the integration of HELLA allows us to raise both the cost and sales synergy targets. With our assumption that 2023 volumes will be at a similar level to 2022  we target to improve our financial performance in 2023. I would like to thank all the Faurecia and HELLA teams for their commitment to the creation of FORVIA  succeeding in a tough environment to deliver resilient financial performance and to creating the conditions for future success and profitable growth  comforted by the solid order intake of 31 billion euros recorded last year.‚Äù The 2022 consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors  under the chairmanship of Michel de ROSEN  at its meeting held on February 17  2023.These financial statements have been audited.There is no full comparability between figures reported for 2021 and figures reported for 2022 as: Figures reported for 2021 are figures related to Faurecia ‚Äústand-alone‚Äù as reported in February 2022 Figures reported for 2022 include a major scope effect  i.e. the consolidation of HELLA since February 1  2022 (i.e. 11 months in 2022  representing 26% of total Group sales).KEY ACHIEVEMENTS SINCE THE START OF 2022 2022: FROM FAURECIA TO FORVIA  COMBINING FAURECIA‚ÄôS AND HELLA‚ÄôS STRENGTHS AND CREATING FORVIA  THE WORLD‚ÄôS 7th BIGGEST AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY SUPPLIER  WITH SALES OF C. ‚Ç¨30BN IN 2025 On January 31  2022  Faurecia closed the acquisition of a majority stake of 82% in HELLA. HELLA has been consolidated in Faurecia‚Äôs accounts since February 1  2022. The newly combined FORVIA Group‚Äôs mission is: ‚ÄúWE PIONEER TECHNOLOGY FOR MOBILITY EXPERIENCES THAT MATTER TO PEOPLE‚Äù. On November 3  2022  Faurecia and HELLA held their first joint Capital Markets Day in Paris  during which FORVIA unveiled its Power25 medium-term plan to drive profitable growth  enhance cash generation and accelerate Group deleveraging (all details available on www.forvia.com). FORVIA‚Äôs Power25 plan is focused on three key strategic priorities: Drive sales growth through innovation and sustainability Enhance profitability and lower breakeven Generate strong cash conversion and actively manage portfolio to accelerate Group deleveraging. These ambitions are translated into the following 2025 financial objectives (based on an assumption of worldwide automotive production of 88 million units in 2025 and after the estimated effect of the ‚Ç¨1bn disposal program by end-2023): 2025 sales of c. ‚Ç¨30 billion 2025 operating margin > 7% of sales 2025 net cash flow at 4% of sales Net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA < 1.5x at December 31  2025 In January 2023  FORVIA presented at CES 2023 in Las Vegas its combined portfolio of Faurecia and HELLA technologies addressing megatrends in electrification  automated driving  and personalized cockpits. The world's first Solid State Lighting High-Definition headlamp (SSL | HD) presented by the Group received a CES 2023 Innovation Award. As from 2023  Faurecia and HELLA‚Äôs fiscal years are aligned on the calendar year.Significant progress achieved in the integration process of HELLA: cost synergies upgraded to more than ‚Ç¨300 million 2025 EBITDA run-rate (vs. > ‚Ç¨250 million previously) and sales synergies upgraded to more than ‚Ç¨400 million in 2025 (vs. between ‚Ç¨300 million and ‚Ç¨400 million previously)  supported by strong 2022 joint order intake for ‚Ç¨1.8 billion Since the effective entry of HELLA into the Group‚Äôs consolidation scope  the two companies  under the leadership of their respective management teams  have accelerated collaboration and achieved significant progress in generating synergies. As regards cost synergies  over 200 individual synergy measures have been validated by Faurecia‚Äôs and HELLA‚Äôs teams. They can be broken down into more than 1 000 detailed actions  with robust tracking and governance. As a result  cost synergies and optimization have been upgraded to more than ‚Ç¨300 million 2025 EBITDA run-rate (vs. more than ‚Ç¨250 million previously). Concerning sales synergies  Faurecia‚Äôs and HELLA‚Äôs joined forces succeeded in generating a strong order intake of ‚Ç¨1.8 billion in 2022  demonstrating the potential for combined commercial offers and opportunities in the coming years  notably capitalizing on CES 2023 successes. The 2022 joint order intake of ‚Ç¨1.8 billion already represents more than ‚Ç¨300 million of 2025 sales synergies or more than ‚Ç¨400 million 2026 run-rate. Sales synergies are now upgraded to more than ‚Ç¨400 million by 2025 (vs. between ‚Ç¨300 million and ‚Ç¨400 million previously). SOLID ORDER INTAKE OF ‚Ç¨31BN IN FY 2022 SUPPORTS MEDIUM-TERM PROFITABLE GROWTH DRIVERS In 2022  FORVIA (Faurecia + HELLA) recorded a solid order intake of ‚Ç¨31 billion  with an average operating margin above 7%  already reaching the Power25 plan‚Äôs targeted profitability. New 2022 awards reflect FORVIA‚Äôs strategy to focus on key activities; they included: ‚Ç¨8.4 billion for Electronics  representing 27% of the Group‚Äôs total order intake and demonstrating the strong potential of Electronics representing 27% of the Group‚Äôs total order intake and demonstrating the strong potential of Electronics  ‚Ç¨13.3 billion for Electric Vehicles (BEVs and FCEVs)  representing 43% of the Group‚Äôs total order intake and demonstrating acceleration on the Zero Emissions strategy representing 43% of the Group‚Äôs total order intake and demonstrating acceleration on the Zero Emissions strategy  ‚Ç¨6.2 billion for China  representing 20% of the Group‚Äôs total order intake and reflecting the continued strong growth of this highly profitable market representing 20% of the Group‚Äôs total order intake and reflecting the continued strong growth of this highly profitable market  ‚Ç¨18.8 billion for Premium Vehicles and SUVs  representing 61% of the Group‚Äôs total order intake and reflecting the Group‚Äôs strong positioning on segments with the highest content per vehicle. REFINANCING OF THE ACQUISITION OF HELLA COMPLETED The acquisition of an 82% stake in HELLA represented a total investment of ‚Ç¨5.4 billion. The financing was fully secured through a committed bridge facility of ‚Ç¨5.5bn  signed in August 2021. This bridge facility included a bridge-to-equity component  whose deadline was mid-February 2023  and a bridge-to-loan  whose deadline was mid-August 2023. The refinancing has been entirely completed  although markets conditions have proven more difficult since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine and the start of a period of strong inflation. Out of the total investment of ‚Ç¨5.4 billion: ‚Ç¨0.5 billion was paid in shares through a Faurecia capital increase reserved to the Hueck/Roepke Family pool (now holding 9.22% of Faurecia‚Äôs share capital) ‚Ç¨0.7 billion was financed through a capital increase with preferential subscription rights issued in June 2022 (45 482 154 new shares at a subscription price of ‚Ç¨15.50). The rest was financed through debt issuances and use of cash for a total amount of ‚Ç¨4.2 billion. Total HELLA-related average cost of financing for this amount of ‚Ç¨4.2billion is estimated at c. 4.5% (estimation based on Euribor 1 month at 2.50%). ‚Ç¨1BN DISPOSAL PROGRAM OF NON-STRATEGIC ASSETS BY END-2023 FULFILLED THROUGH CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS ANNOUNCED TO DATE With yesterday‚Äôs announcement that the Motherson group has committed to acquire Faurecia‚Äôs SAS Cockpit Modules division  contemplated transactions announced to date fulfill FORVIA‚Äôs ‚Ç¨1 billion disposal program of non-strategic assets by end-2023  designed to accelerate deleveraging after the HELLA acquisition. In July 2022: HELLA announced the sale of its 33.33% stake in HBPO to its co-shareholder  Plastic Omnium  for a price of c. ‚Ç¨290 million and the transaction was closed  as expected  in December 2022.

All regions contributed to the full-year organic growth: China and North America grew in strong double-digits  while Europe grew in high single-digits. North America was driven by Stellantis (as the Michigan program only got underway in H2 2021) and China was driven by very strong growth from Chinese OEMs (mostly BYD) and a US EV carmaker present in China. Operating income Operating income in H2 recovered to 3.2% of sales from 1.8% of sales in H1  resulting in full-year operating margin of 2.6% of sales  down 210bps year-on-year. The sequential improvement in H2 reflected continued reduction in extra costs related to the Michigan plant (‚Ç¨35 million in H2 2022 after ‚Ç¨45 million in H1 2022 and ‚Ç¨100 million in H2 2021). Excluding these extra costs  operating margin in 2022 stood at 4.0% of sales in H2 and 3.6% of sales in FY.

Organic growth was mainly driven by Europe and North America and  to a lesser extent  South America. In the three regions  sales grew organically in double-digits. In Europe  organic growth was driven by Ford and sales related to commercial vehicles  while in North America it was also Ford and commercial vehicles  as well as GM. In South America  increase in sales to GM was the main driver for sustained organic growth. Operating income Operating income in H2 improved to 7.5% of sales after 6.6% of sales in H1  resulting in 7.1% of sales in FY  down 240bps vs. FY 2021. This year-on-year deterioration mainly reflected dilutive impact from inflation pass-through for c. 100bps  some operational extra costs for c. 40bps and the development of zero-emissions sales  which are not yet profitable  for another 60bps.ELECTRONICS (14% of Group consolidated sales) ELECTRONICS (in ‚Ç¨m) FY 2021 Currency Organic growth Scope effect FY 2022 Reported (Faurecia effect (Faurecia (HELLA FORVIA change stand-alone) stand-alone) 11 months) Worldwide auto. production (m units) 77 197 82 375 6 7% Sales 838 34 105 2 545 3 522 320 5% % of last year's sales 4 1% 12 5% 303 9% outperformance (bps) 580 Operating income -2 141 n/s % of sales -0 2% 4 0% n/s Sales Step change in size (sales multiplied by more than 4x between 2021 and 2022) as Electronics now aggregates the Electronics activity of Faurecia (‚Ç¨977 million vs. ‚Ç¨838 million in 2021) and the Electronics activity of HELLA (‚Ç¨2 545 million of scope effect for 11 months in 2022).

The review classification is Priority.VLA1553 has been assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) review goal date at the end of August 2023  which is the date by which the FDA intends to take action on the application. The FDA‚Äôs acknowledgement of filing does not mean that a license will be granted  nor does it represent any evaluation of the adequacy of the data submitted.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat. As of July 2022  there were more than 3 million reported cases in the Americas1 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after three to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. It is estimated that over three quarters of the world‚Äôs population live in areas at-risk of CHIKV transmission2. High risk areas of infection are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are currently endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 100 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15533. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20194  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union‚Äôs Horizon 2020 program.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 20225  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20226 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 20227.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva‚Äôs existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to commercialize three vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against the chikungunya virus and Lyme disease.Valneva Investor and Media ContactsLaetitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to the progress  timing  results and completion of research  development and clinical trials for product candidates  to regulatory approval of product candidates and review of existing products.
