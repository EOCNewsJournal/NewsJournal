Further  the Board of Directors proposes that § 11 of the Articles of Association is amended so that a General Meeting  in addition to being able to be held in Gothenburg  may also be held in Stockholm.Current wording § 4 Proposed wording § 4 The company's share capital shall be no less than SEK 75 000 000 and no more than SEK 300 000 000. The company's share capital shall be no less than SEK 150 000 000 and no more than SEK 600 000 000. Current wording § 5 Proposed wording § 5 The number of shares shall be no less than 150 000 000 and no more than 600 000 000. The number of shares shall be no less than 300 000 000 and no more than 1 200 000 000. Current wording § 11 Proposed wording § 11 An Annual General Meeting shall be held in Göteborg or Stockholm within six months of the expiry of each financial year. General Meetings shall be held in Gothenburg or Stockholm. An Annual General Meeting shall be held in Göteborg or Stockholm within six months of the expiry of each financial year.Item 17 – Resolution on the approval of the remuneration report.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' remuneration report.Item 18 – Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on an issue of new shares  either applying or disapplying shareholders' preferential rights.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on new share issues  on one or several occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and that shares corresponding to maximum ten per cent (10%) of the Company's share capital as of the date for the first exercise of the authorisation may be issued. Further  the proposal implies that an issue may be made against cash payment  by set-off or by contribution in kind. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  shares shall be issued on market terms. The purpose of the Board of Directors' proposal is to (i) enable the Company to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses by issuing new shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisition of real property  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions; and/or (ii) enable the Company to strengthen its financial position and/or create a larger liquidity buffer for financing commitments.Item 19 – Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on an issue of new shares  applying the shareholders' preferential rights.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on new share issues  on one or several occasions  with preferential rights for the shareholders  for the purpose of strengthening the Company's financial position. The total number of shares that may be issued by virtue of the authorisation shall amount to the number of shares that corresponds to issue proceeds of approximately SEK 10 billion. Other terms and conditions for the new share issue shall be determined by the Board of Directors.Item 20 – Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on acquisitions and transfers of the Company's own shares.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on acquisition on one or several occasions  of the Company's own shares provided that the Company after each acquisition will not hold more than ten per cent (10%) of all the shares in the Company  and to transfer all of the Company's own shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. The objective of the Board of Directors' proposal is to allow the Company to adapt its capital structure to its capital needs from time to time and thereby contribute to an increased shareholder value  and/or to transfer own shares as payment in order to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses or by using own shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisition of real property  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions. This objective does not allow the Company to trade with its own shares for the short-term purpose of making a profit.Item 21 – Resolution to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to reduce the Company's share capital by an amount of SEK 8 665 500 by way of cancellation of the 17 331 000 own shares held by the Company as of the date of this notice. The reduction amount shall be allocated to unrestricted equity.The resolution to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares is conditional upon the Board of Directors utilising the authorisation proposed to be resolved by the Annual General Meeting in accordance with item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting.The resolution to reduce the share capital may be carried out without obtaining an authorisation from the Swedish Companies Registration Office  since the resolution will not be executed unless the Company simultaneously carries out a rights issue by means of the Board of Directors' exercise of the authorisation proposed to be resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting as set out in item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting. This entails that the share capital  after the rights issue  will increase by an amount exceeding the amount that the share capital is being reduced with as set out above. Combined  these measures entail that neither the Company's restricted equity nor its share capital is reduced as a result of the cancellation of own shares.Resolutions proposed by the Nomination CommitteeThe Nomination Committee  consisting of Helen Fasth Gillstedt (Chair of the Nomination Committee) appointed by Handelsbanken Fonder  Ralf Spann appointed by Akelius Residential Property AB (publ)  Patrik Tillman appointed by M2 Asset Management AB and M2 Capital Management AB  Johannes Wingborg appointed by Länsförsäkringar Fondförvaltning AB (publ)  and Per Berggren  Chair of the Board of Directors  has made the following proposals:Item 1 – Election of the Chair of the meeting.The Nomination Committee proposes the attorney Wilhelm Lüning to preside as Chair of the Annual General Meeting.Item 12 – Determination of the number of members of the Board of Directors and auditors and deputy auditors.The Board of Directors is proposed to consist of seven Board members and the number of auditors is proposed to be one with no deputy auditor.Item 13 – Determination of the remuneration to be paid to the members of the Board of Directors and the auditor.Remuneration to the members of the Board of Directors is proposed to be the following (2022 remuneration within brackets).The Chair of the Board of Directors: SEK 1 110 000 (SEK 1 075 000).Each of the other members of the Board of Directors: SEK 450 000 (SEK 440 000).Chair of the People Committee: SEK 100 000 (SEK 100 000).Each of the other members of the People Committee: SEK 75 000 (SEK 75 000).Chair of the Audit Committee: SEK 220 000 (SEK 220 000).Each of the other members of the Audit Committee: SEK 105 000 (SEK 105 000).A member of the Board of Directors who is employed by the Company shall not receive remuneration.It is proposed that the auditor's fee shall be paid upon approval of its invoices.Item 14 – Election of members of the Board of Directors and Chair of the Board of Directors.The existing Board members Per Berggren  Anna-Karin Celsing  Henrik Käll  Joacim Sjöberg and Leiv Synnes are proposed to be re-elected as Board members.

The performance period is the financial years 2023-2025 with respect to each of the performance targets.f. Performance outcome of the established performance targets will be determined by the Board after the expiry of the three-year performance period in 2026. If the maximum performance level is reached or exceeded  the allocation will amount to (and will not exceed) the maximum number of Performance Shares following from items c) and d). If performance is below the maximum level but exceeds the minimum level  a proportionate allocation of shares will be made. No allocation will be made if performance amounts to or is below the minimum level. Information on the performance targets and the outcome will be provided no later than in connection with the allocation of Performance Shares in accordance with item g).g. If all conditions in the Share Program 2023 are met  allocation of Performance Shares will take place in the first half of 2026. Allocation will be free of charge except for tax liabilities.h. Certain deviations in or adjustments of the terms and conditions for the Share Program 2023 may be made based on local rules and regulations as well as applicable market practice or market conditions or where appropriate due to group re-organizations  including cash settlement instead of delivery of shares under certain circumstances.i. The Board of Directors  or a committee established by the Board for these purposes  shall be responsible for the preparation and management of the Share Program 2023  within the framework of the aforementioned terms and conditions.j. If material changes would occur within the Electrolux Group or on the market that  according to the Board's assessment  would lead to the conditions for allocation of Performance Shares no longer being reasonable  the Board will have the right to make also other adjustments of the Share Program 2023  including e.g. a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of shares.Costs for the Share Program 2023The total costs for the Share Program 2023 if the maximum number of Performance Shares are delivered  are estimated to a maximum of SEK 639m  which corresponds to approximately 3.1 per cent of total employment cost for 2022. The costs will be recognized over the years 2023-2025. The costs have been calculated as the sum of salary costs  including social costs  and administration costs for the program. Administration costs are estimated to be less than SEK 1m. If no allotment of shares is made  only administration costs will arise.The costs have been calculated based on the value  at the start of the program  of the Performance Shares that may be allotted at maximum performance  with a reduction of the present value of estimated dividend payments during a three-year period. The estimate on maximum costs assumes maximum performance and that the number of participants that will leave the Group during the performance period is the same as the historical average since the introduction of share programs in 2004. In the calculation  a maximum share price of SEK 247 per share has been applied.If repurchased own shares would be allocated under the program the number of outstanding shares is estimated to increase with not more than 3 965 000 shares of series B.5 Such maximum increase would have a dilutive effect on earnings per share of approximately 1.38 per cent. The total maximum increase in the number of outstanding shares of all outstanding share programs is estimated to not more than 7 874 000 shares of series B  corresponding to a dilutive effect on earnings per share of approximately 2.71 per cent. In this calculation  maximum allotment of shares has been assumed for Share Program 2023 and expected allotment has been assumed for the share programs for 2021 and 2022.Hedging measures for the Share Program 2023In order to implement Share Program 2023 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors has considered various methods for transfer of shares to the participants. The Board of Directors has found that the most cost-effective alternative is transfer of own shares  and thus proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on transfer of own shares in accordance with item 17 b) below.Should the majority required under item 17 b) below not be reached  Electrolux intends to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party.17 b) Resolution on transfers of own shares to the participants in Share Program 2023In order to secure the delivery of Performance Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the company shall transfer a maximum of 3 965 000 shares of series B in the company on the following terms and conditions:The right to receive shares shall be granted to such persons within the Electrolux Group covered by the terms and conditions pursuant to Share Program 2023. Furthermore  subsidiaries within the Electrolux Group shall have the right to acquire shares  free of consideration  and such subsidiaries shall be obligated to immediately transfer  free of consideration  shares to employees covered by the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023. The employee shall have the right to receive shares during the period when the employee is entitled to receive shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023  i.e. in 2026. Employees covered by the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023 shall receive shares of series B in the company free of consideration. The number of shares of series B in Electrolux that may be transferred under Share Program 2023 will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.Majority requirementsThe resolution of the Annual General Meeting to implement the program according to item 17 a) above requires that more than half of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting approve the proposal. The Annual General Meeting's resolution on transfer of own shares  according to item 17 b) above requires that shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the proposal.Preparation of the proposal for the Share Program 2023The proposal regarding the Share Program 2023 has been prepared by the People Committee and the Board of Directors.Previous incentive programs in ElectroluxFor a description of the company's other share related incentive programs  reference is made to the Annual Report for 2022  note 27  and the Group's website  www.electroluxgroup.com.

Further  the Board of Directors proposes that § 11 of the Articles of Association is amended so that a General Meeting  in addition to being able to be held in Gothenburg  may also be held in Stockholm.Current wording § 4 Proposed wording § 4 The company's share capital shall be no less than SEK 75 000 000 and no more than SEK 300 000 000.

The number of shares shall be no less than 300 000 000 and no more than 1 200 000 000. Current wording § 11 Proposed wording § 11 An Annual General Meeting shall be held in Göteborg or Stockholm within six months of the expiry of each financial year. General Meetings shall be held in Gothenburg or Stockholm. An Annual General Meeting shall be held in Göteborg or Stockholm within six months of the expiry of each financial year.Item 17 – Resolution on the approval of the remuneration report.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' remuneration report.Item 18 – Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on an issue of new shares  either applying or disapplying shareholders' preferential rights.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on new share issues  on one or several occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and that shares corresponding to maximum ten per cent (10%) of the Company's share capital as of the date for the first exercise of the authorisation may be issued. Further  the proposal implies that an issue may be made against cash payment  by set-off or by contribution in kind. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  shares shall be issued on market terms. The purpose of the Board of Directors' proposal is to (i) enable the Company to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses by issuing new shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisition of real property  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions; and/or (ii) enable the Company to strengthen its financial position and/or create a larger liquidity buffer for financing commitments.Item 19 – Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on an issue of new shares  applying the shareholders' preferential rights.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on new share issues  on one or several occasions  with preferential rights for the shareholders  for the purpose of strengthening the Company's financial position. The total number of shares that may be issued by virtue of the authorisation shall amount to the number of shares that corresponds to issue proceeds of approximately SEK 10 billion. Other terms and conditions for the new share issue shall be determined by the Board of Directors.Item 20 – Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on acquisitions and transfers of the Company's own shares.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on acquisition on one or several occasions  of the Company's own shares provided that the Company after each acquisition will not hold more than ten per cent (10%) of all the shares in the Company  and to transfer all of the Company's own shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. The objective of the Board of Directors' proposal is to allow the Company to adapt its capital structure to its capital needs from time to time and thereby contribute to an increased shareholder value  and/or to transfer own shares as payment in order to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses or by using own shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisition of real property  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions. This objective does not allow the Company to trade with its own shares for the short-term purpose of making a profit.Item 21 – Resolution to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to reduce the Company's share capital by an amount of SEK 8 665 500 by way of cancellation of the 17 331 000 own shares held by the Company as of the date of this notice. The reduction amount shall be allocated to unrestricted equity.The resolution to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares is conditional upon the Board of Directors utilising the authorisation proposed to be resolved by the Annual General Meeting in accordance with item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting.The resolution to reduce the share capital may be carried out without obtaining an authorisation from the Swedish Companies Registration Office  since the resolution will not be executed unless the Company simultaneously carries out a rights issue by means of the Board of Directors' exercise of the authorisation proposed to be resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting as set out in item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting. This entails that the share capital  after the rights issue  will increase by an amount exceeding the amount that the share capital is being reduced with as set out above. Combined  these measures entail that neither the Company's restricted equity nor its share capital is reduced as a result of the cancellation of own shares.Resolutions proposed by the Nomination CommitteeThe Nomination Committee  consisting of Helen Fasth Gillstedt (Chair of the Nomination Committee) appointed by Handelsbanken Fonder  Ralf Spann appointed by Akelius Residential Property AB (publ)  Patrik Tillman appointed by M2 Asset Management AB and M2 Capital Management AB  Johannes Wingborg appointed by Länsförsäkringar Fondförvaltning AB (publ)  and Per Berggren  Chair of the Board of Directors  has made the following proposals:Item 1 – Election of the Chair of the meeting.The Nomination Committee proposes the attorney Wilhelm Lüning to preside as Chair of the Annual General Meeting.Item 12 – Determination of the number of members of the Board of Directors and auditors and deputy auditors.The Board of Directors is proposed to consist of seven Board members and the number of auditors is proposed to be one with no deputy auditor.Item 13 – Determination of the remuneration to be paid to the members of the Board of Directors and the auditor.Remuneration to the members of the Board of Directors is proposed to be the following (2022 remuneration within brackets).The Chair of the Board of Directors: SEK 1 110 000 (SEK 1 075 000) ..

Current wording § 11 Proposed wording § 11 An Annual General Meeting shall be held in Göteborg or Stockholm within six months of the expiry of each financial year. General Meetings shall be held in Gothenburg or Stockholm. An Annual General Meeting shall be held in Göteborg or Stockholm within six months of the expiry of each financial year. Item 17 – Resolution on the approval of the remuneration report. The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' remuneration report. Item 18 – Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on an issue of new shares  either applying or disapplying shareholders' preferential rights. The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on new share issues  on one or several occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and that shares corresponding to maximum ten per cent (10%) of the Company's share capital as of the date for the first exercise of the authorisation may be issued. Further  the proposal implies that an issue may be made against cash payment  by set-off or by contribution in kind. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  shares shall be issued on market terms. The purpose of the Board of Directors' proposal is to (i) enable the Company to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses by issuing new shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisition of real property  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions; and/or (ii) enable the Company to strengthen its financial position and/or create a larger liquidity buffer for financing commitments. Item 19 – Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on an issue of new shares  applying the shareholders' preferential rights. The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on new share issues  on one or several occasions  with preferential rights for the shareholders  for the purpose of strengthening the Company's financial position. The total number of shares that may be issued by virtue of the authorisation shall amount to the number of shares that corresponds to issue proceeds of approximately SEK 10 billion. Other terms and conditions for the new share issue shall be determined by the Board of Directors. Item 20 – Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on acquisitions and transfers of the Company's own shares. The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on acquisition on one or several occasions  of the Company's own shares provided that the Company after each acquisition will not hold more than ten per cent (10%) of all the shares in the Company  and to transfer all of the Company's own shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. The objective of the Board of Directors' proposal is to allow the Company to adapt its capital structure to its capital needs from time to time and thereby contribute to an increased shareholder value  and/or to transfer own shares as payment in order to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses or by using own shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisition of real property  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions. This objective does not allow the Company to trade with its own shares for the short-term purpose of making a profit. Item 21 – Resolution to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares. The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to reduce the Company's share capital by an amount of SEK 8 665 500 by way of cancellation of the 17 331 000 own shares held by the Company as of the date of this notice. The reduction amount shall be allocated to unrestricted equity. The resolution to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares is conditional upon the Board of Directors utilising the authorisation proposed to be resolved by the Annual General Meeting in accordance with item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting. The resolution to reduce the share capital may be carried out without obtaining an authorisation from the Swedish Companies Registration Office  since the resolution will not be executed unless the Company simultaneously carries out a rights issue by means of the Board of Directors' exercise of the authorisation proposed to be resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting as set out in item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting. This entails that the share capital  after the rights issue  will increase by an amount exceeding the amount that the share capital is being reduced with as set out above. Combined  these measures entail that neither the Company's restricted equity nor its share capital is reduced as a result of the cancellation of own shares.

The Chairman of the Nomination Committee shall then contact the largest shareholder in terms of voting rights who has not previously been offered a seat.

Even though the Board of Directors currently has no intention to exercise an authorization to acquire additional own shares  the Board of Directors proposes the authorization is to be renewed as an authorization is valid until the following Annual General Meeting. The Board of Directors would then be able to decide to repurchase own shares  if the conditions are appropriate and the Board of Directors were to find it would be in the best interests of the company and the shareholders.In view of the above  the Board of Directors proposes as follows.16 a) Acquisition of own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes the Annual General Meeting to authorize the Board of Directors  for the period until the next Annual General Meeting on one or several occasions  to resolve on acquisitions of shares in the company as follows.The company may acquire as a maximum so many shares of series B that  following each acquisition  the company holds at a maximum 10 per cent of all shares issued by the company. The shares may be acquired on Nasdaq Stockholm. Acquisition of shares may only be made at a price per share within the prevailing price interval for the share from time to time. Payment for the shares shall be made in cash.The purpose of the proposal is to be able to use repurchased shares on account of potential company acquisitions  the company's share related incentive programs as well as to be able to adapt the company's capital structure  thereby contributing to increased shareholder value.The Board of Directors has issued a statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act.16 b) Transfer of own shares on account of company acquisitionsThe Board of Directors proposes the Annual General Meeting to authorize the Board of Directors  for the period until the next Annual General Meeting on one or several occasions  to resolve on transfers of the company's own shares in connection with or as a consequence of company acquisitions as follows.Own shares of series B held by the company at the time of the Board of Director's decision may be transferred. The shares may be transferred with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights.

The Board is convinced that the proposed program will be beneficial to the company's shareholders as it will contribute to the possibilities to recruit and retain competent employees  is expected to increase the commitment and the motivation of the program participants and will strengthen the participants' ties to the Electrolux Group and its shareholders.Proposals of the Board of DirectorsThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves a) to implement Share Program 2023  and b) to transfer own shares  free of consideration  to the participants in Share Program 2023.17 a) Implementation of Share Program 2023The Board of Directors proposes  in view of the above  that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement Share Program 2023 with the following principal terms and conditions:a. The program is proposed to include up to 900 senior managers and key employees of the Electrolux Group  who are divided into seven groups; the President and CEO (""Group 1"")  other members of Group Management (""Group 2"")  and five additional groups for other senior managers and key employees (""Group 3-7""). Invitation to participate in the program shall be provided by Electrolux no later than on May 16  2023.b. Participants are offered to be allocated Performance Shares  provided that the participant remains employed until January 1  2026. Exemptions to this requirement may be prescribed in specific cases  including a participant's death  disability  retirement or the divestiture through a sale  spin-off or otherwise of the participant's employing company from the Electrolux Group.c. The Performance Shares shall be based on maximum performance values for each participant category. The maximum performance value for the participants in Group 1 will be 100 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 2  90 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 3  80 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 4  60 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 5  50 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 6  40 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  and for participants in Group 7  20 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023. The total sum of the maximum values of the Performance Shares thus defined for all participants will not exceed SEK 583m excluding social costs.d. Each maximum value shall thereafter be converted into a maximum number of Performance Shares1   based on the average closing price paid for Electrolux shares of series B on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of ten trading days before the day the participants are invited to participate in the program  reduced by the present value of estimated dividend payments for the period until shares are allotted.e. The calculation of the number of Performance Shares shall be connected to performance targets for the Group  for the performance period  established by the Board for (i) cumulative earnings per share2 and (ii) CO 2 reduction3. The performance targets adopted by the Board will stipulate a minimum level and a maximum level  with the relative weight of the performance targets (i) and (ii) being 80 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. For the participants in Group 1 and 2 (Group Management)  the granted Performance Shares based on (i) and (ii) will be multiplied by 0.75-1.25 depending on the outcome of a relative total shareholder return target4. The performance period is the financial years 2023-2025 with respect to each of the performance targets.f. Performance outcome of the established performance targets will be determined by the Board after the expiry of the three-year performance period in 2026. If the maximum performance level is reached or exceeded  the allocation will amount to (and will not exceed) the maximum number of Performance Shares following from items c) and d). If performance is below the maximum level but exceeds the minimum level  a proportionate allocation of shares will be made. No allocation will be made if performance amounts to or is below the minimum level. Information on the performance targets and the outcome will be provided no later than in connection with the allocation of Performance Shares in accordance with item g).g. If all conditions in the Share Program 2023 are met  allocation of Performance Shares will take place in the first half of 2026. Allocation will be free of charge except for tax liabilities.h. Certain deviations in or adjustments of the terms and conditions for the Share Program 2023 may be made based on local rules and regulations as well as applicable market practice or market conditions or where appropriate due to group re-organizations  including cash settlement instead of delivery of shares under certain circumstances.i. The Board of Directors  or a committee established by the Board for these purposes  shall be responsible for the preparation and management of the Share Program 2023  within the framework of the aforementioned terms and conditions.j. If material changes would occur within the Electrolux Group or on the market that  according to the Board's assessment  would lead to the conditions for allocation of Performance Shares no longer being reasonable  the Board will have the right to make also other adjustments of the Share Program 2023  including e.g. a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of shares.Costs for the Share Program 2023The total costs for the Share Program 2023 if the maximum number of Performance Shares are delivered  are estimated to a maximum of SEK 639m  which corresponds to approximately 3.1 per cent of total employment cost for 2022. The costs will be recognized over the years 2023-2025. The costs have been calculated as the sum of salary costs  including social costs  and administration costs for the program. Administration costs are estimated to be less than SEK 1m. If no allotment of shares is made  only administration costs will arise.The costs have been calculated based on the value  at the start of the program  of the Performance Shares that may be allotted at maximum performance  with a reduction of the present value of estimated dividend payments during a three-year period. The estimate on maximum costs assumes maximum performance and that the number of participants that will leave the Group during the performance period is the same as the historical average since the introduction of share programs in 2004. In the calculation  a maximum share price of SEK 247 per share has been applied.If repurchased own shares would be allocated under the program the number of outstanding shares is estimated to increase with not more than 3 965 000 shares of series B.5 Such maximum increase would have a dilutive effect on earnings per share of approximately 1.38 per cent. The total maximum increase in the number of outstanding shares of all outstanding share programs is estimated to not more than 7 874 000 shares of series B  corresponding to a dilutive effect on earnings per share of approximately 2.71 per cent. In this calculation  maximum allotment of shares has been assumed for Share Program 2023 and expected allotment has been assumed for the share programs for 2021 and 2022.Hedging measures for the Share Program 2023In order to implement Share Program 2023 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors has considered various methods for transfer of shares to the participants. The Board of Directors has found that the most cost-effective alternative is transfer of own shares  and thus proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on transfer of own shares in accordance with item 17 b) below.Should the majority required under item 17 b) below not be reached  Electrolux intends to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party.17 b) Resolution on transfers of own shares to the participants in Share Program 2023In order to secure the delivery of Performance Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the company shall transfer a maximum of 3 965 000 shares of series B in the company on the following terms and conditions:The right to receive shares shall be granted to such persons within the Electrolux Group covered by the terms and conditions pursuant to Share Program 2023. Furthermore  subsidiaries within the Electrolux Group shall have the right to acquire shares  free of consideration  and such subsidiaries shall be obligated to immediately transfer  free of consideration  shares to employees covered by the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023. The employee shall have the right to receive shares during the period when the employee is entitled to receive shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023  i.e. in 2026. Employees covered by the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023 shall receive shares of series B in the company free of consideration. The number of shares of series B in Electrolux that may be transferred under Share Program 2023 will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.Majority requirementsThe resolution of the Annual General Meeting to implement the program according to item 17 a) above requires that more than half of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting approve the proposal. The Annual General Meeting's resolution on transfer of own shares  according to item 17 b) above requires that shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the proposal.Preparation of the proposal for the Share Program 2023The proposal regarding the Share Program 2023 has been prepared by the People Committee and the Board of Directors.Previous incentive programs in ElectroluxFor a description of the company's other share related incentive programs  reference is made to the Annual Report for 2022  note 27  and the Group's website  www.electroluxgroup.com.

Further  the Board of Directors proposes that § 11 of the Articles of Association is amended so that a General Meeting  in addition to being able to be held in Gothenburg  may also be held in Stockholm.Current wording § 4 Proposed wording § 4 The company's share capital shall be no less than SEK 75 000 000 and no more than SEK 300 000 000. The company's share capital shall be no less than SEK 150 000 000 and no more than SEK 600 000 000.

The number of shares shall be no less than 300 000 000 and no more than 1 200 000 000. Current wording § 11 Proposed wording § 11 An Annual General Meeting shall be held in Göteborg or Stockholm within six months of the expiry of each financial year. General Meetings shall be held in Gothenburg or Stockholm. An Annual General Meeting shall be held in Göteborg or Stockholm within six months of the expiry of each financial year.Item 17 – Resolution on the approval of the remuneration report.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' remuneration report.Item 18 – Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on an issue of new shares  either applying or disapplying shareholders' preferential rights.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on new share issues  on one or several occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and that shares corresponding to maximum ten per cent (10%) of the Company's share capital as of the date for the first exercise of the authorisation may be issued. Further  the proposal implies that an issue may be made against cash payment  by set-off or by contribution in kind. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  shares shall be issued on market terms. The purpose of the Board of Directors' proposal is to (i) enable the Company to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses by issuing new shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisition of real property  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions; and/or (ii) enable the Company to strengthen its financial position and/or create a larger liquidity buffer for financing commitments.Item 19 – Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on an issue of new shares  applying the shareholders' preferential rights.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on new share issues  on one or several occasions  with preferential rights for the shareholders  for the purpose of strengthening the Company's financial position. The total number of shares that may be issued by virtue of the authorisation shall amount to the number of shares that corresponds to issue proceeds of approximately SEK 10 billion. Other terms and conditions for the new share issue shall be determined by the Board of Directors.Item 20 – Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on acquisitions and transfers of the Company's own shares.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on acquisition on one or several occasions  of the Company's own shares provided that the Company after each acquisition will not hold more than ten per cent (10%) of all the shares in the Company  and to transfer all of the Company's own shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. The objective of the Board of Directors' proposal is to allow the Company to adapt its capital structure to its capital needs from time to time and thereby contribute to an increased shareholder value  and/or to transfer own shares as payment in order to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses or by using own shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisition of real property  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions. This objective does not allow the Company to trade with its own shares for the short-term purpose of making a profit.Item 21 – Resolution to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to reduce the Company's share capital by an amount of SEK 8 665 500 by way of cancellation of the 17 331 000 own shares held by the Company as of the date of this notice. The reduction amount shall be allocated to unrestricted equity.The resolution to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares is conditional upon the Board of Directors utilising the authorisation proposed to be resolved by the Annual General Meeting in accordance with item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting.The resolution to reduce the share capital may be carried out without obtaining an authorisation from the Swedish Companies Registration Office  since the resolution will not be executed unless the Company simultaneously carries out a rights issue by means of the Board of Directors' exercise of the authorisation proposed to be resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting as set out in item 19 of the notice convening the Annual General Meeting. This entails that the share capital  after the rights issue  will increase by an amount exceeding the amount that the share capital is being reduced with as set out above. Combined  these measures entail that neither the Company's restricted equity nor its share capital is reduced as a result of the cancellation of own shares.Resolutions proposed by the Nomination CommitteeThe Nomination Committee  consisting of Helen Fasth Gillstedt (Chair of the Nomination Committee) appointed by Handelsbanken Fonder  Ralf Spann appointed by Akelius Residential Property AB (publ)  Patrik Tillman appointed by M2 Asset Management AB and M2 Capital Management AB  Johannes Wingborg appointed by Länsförsäkringar Fondförvaltning AB (publ)  and Per Berggren  Chair of the Board of Directors  has made the following proposals:Item 1 – Election of the Chair of the meeting.The Nomination Committee proposes the attorney Wilhelm Lüning to preside as Chair of the Annual General Meeting.Item 12 – Determination of the number of members of the Board of Directors and auditors and deputy auditors.The Board of Directors is proposed to consist of seven Board members and the number of auditors is proposed to be one with no deputy auditor.Item 13 – Determination of the remuneration to be paid to the members of the Board of Directors and the auditor.Remuneration to the members of the Board of Directors is proposed to be the following (2022 remuneration within brackets).The Chair of the Board of Directors: SEK 1 110 000 (SEK 1 075 000) ..

Even though the Board of Directors currently has no intention to exercise an authorization to acquire additional own shares  the Board of Directors proposes the authorization is to be renewed as an authorization is valid until the following Annual General Meeting. The Board of Directors would then be able to decide to repurchase own shares  if the conditions are appropriate and the Board of Directors were to find it would be in the best interests of the company and the shareholders.In view of the above  the Board of Directors proposes as follows.16 a) Acquisition of own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes the Annual General Meeting to authorize the Board of Directors  for the period until the next Annual General Meeting on one or several occasions  to resolve on acquisitions of shares in the company as follows.The company may acquire as a maximum so many shares of series B that  following each acquisition  the company holds at a maximum 10 per cent of all shares issued by the company. The shares may be acquired on Nasdaq Stockholm. Acquisition of shares may only be made at a price per share within the prevailing price interval for the share from time to time. Payment for the shares shall be made in cash.The purpose of the proposal is to be able to use repurchased shares on account of potential company acquisitions  the company's share related incentive programs as well as to be able to adapt the company's capital structure  thereby contributing to increased shareholder value.The Board of Directors has issued a statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act.16 b) Transfer of own shares on account of company acquisitionsThe Board of Directors proposes the Annual General Meeting to authorize the Board of Directors  for the period until the next Annual General Meeting on one or several occasions  to resolve on transfers of the company's own shares in connection with or as a consequence of company acquisitions as follows.Own shares of series B held by the company at the time of the Board of Director's decision may be transferred. The shares may be transferred with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. Transfer of shares may be made at a minimum price per share corresponding to an amount in close connection with the price of the company's shares on Nasdaq Stockholm at the time of the decision on the transfer. Payment for the transferred shares may be made in cash  by contributions in kind or by a set-off of company debt.16 c) Transfer of own shares on account of the share program for 2021The Board of Directors proposes  on account of the share program for 2021  that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the company shall be entitled  for the period until the next Annual General Meeting on one or several occasions  to transfer a maximum of 1 544 925 shares of series B in the company for the purpose of covering costs  including social security charges  that may arise as a result of the aforementioned program. Such transfers may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the prevailing price interval from time to time.Majority requirementIn order for the resolutions by the General Meeting in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposals under items 16 a)  b)  and c) above to be valid  the resolutions must be accepted by shareholders holding no less than two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the General Meeting.Item 17 – Resolutions on a) implementation of a performance based  long-term share program for 2023  and b) transfer of own shares to the participants in the long-term share program for 2023BackgroundThe Board of Directors has decided to propose a long-term incentive program for 2023 (the ""Share Program 2023""). The Board is convinced that the proposed program will be beneficial to the company's shareholders as it will contribute to the possibilities to recruit and retain competent employees  is expected to increase the commitment and the motivation of the program participants and will strengthen the participants' ties to the Electrolux Group and its shareholders.Proposals of the Board of DirectorsThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves a) to implement Share Program 2023  and b) to transfer own shares  free of consideration  to the participants in Share Program 2023.17 a) Implementation of Share Program 2023The Board of Directors proposes  in view of the above  that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement Share Program 2023 with the following principal terms and conditions:a. The program is proposed to include up to 900 senior managers and key employees of the Electrolux Group  who are divided into seven groups; the President and CEO (""Group 1"")  other members of Group Management (""Group 2"")  and five additional groups for other senior managers and key employees (""Group 3-7""). Invitation to participate in the program shall be provided by Electrolux no later than on May 16  2023.b. Participants are offered to be allocated Performance Shares  provided that the participant remains employed until January 1  2026. Exemptions to this requirement may be prescribed in specific cases  including a participant's death  disability  retirement or the divestiture through a sale  spin-off or otherwise of the participant's employing company from the Electrolux Group.c. The Performance Shares shall be based on maximum performance values for each participant category. The maximum performance value for the participants in Group 1 will be 100 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 2  90 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 3  80 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 4  60 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 5  50 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  for participants in Group 6  40 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023  and for participants in Group 7  20 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2023. The total sum of the maximum values of the Performance Shares thus defined for all participants will not exceed SEK 583m excluding social costs.d. Each maximum value shall thereafter be converted into a maximum number of Performance Shares1   based on the average closing price paid for Electrolux shares of series B on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of ten trading days before the day the participants are invited to participate in the program  reduced by the present value of estimated dividend payments for the period until shares are allotted.e. The calculation of the number of Performance Shares shall be connected to performance targets for the Group  for the performance period  established by the Board for (i) cumulative earnings per share2 and (ii) CO 2 reduction3. The performance targets adopted by the Board will stipulate a minimum level and a maximum level  with the relative weight of the performance targets (i) and (ii) being 80 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. For the participants in Group 1 and 2 (Group Management)  the granted Performance Shares based on (i) and (ii) will be multiplied by 0.75-1.25 depending on the outcome of a relative total shareholder return target4. The performance period is the financial years 2023-2025 with respect to each of the performance targets.f. Performance outcome of the established performance targets will be determined by the Board after the expiry of the three-year performance period in 2026. If the maximum performance level is reached or exceeded  the allocation will amount to (and will not exceed) the maximum number of Performance Shares following from items c) and d). If performance is below the maximum level but exceeds the minimum level  a proportionate allocation of shares will be made. No allocation will be made if performance amounts to or is below the minimum level. Information on the performance targets and the outcome will be provided no later than in connection with the allocation of Performance Shares in accordance with item g).g. If all conditions in the Share Program 2023 are met  allocation of Performance Shares will take place in the first half of 2026. Allocation will be free of charge except for tax liabilities.h. Certain deviations in or adjustments of the terms and conditions for the Share Program 2023 may be made based on local rules and regulations as well as applicable market practice or market conditions or where appropriate due to group re-organizations  including cash settlement instead of delivery of shares under certain circumstances.i. The Board of Directors  or a committee established by the Board for these purposes  shall be responsible for the preparation and management of the Share Program 2023  within the framework of the aforementioned terms and conditions.j. If material changes would occur within the Electrolux Group or on the market that  according to the Board's assessment  would lead to the conditions for allocation of Performance Shares no longer being reasonable  the Board will have the right to make also other adjustments of the Share Program 2023  including e.g. a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of shares.Costs for the Share Program 2023The total costs for the Share Program 2023 if the maximum number of Performance Shares are delivered  are estimated to a maximum of SEK 639m  which corresponds to approximately 3.1 per cent of total employment cost for 2022. The costs will be recognized over the years 2023-2025. The costs have been calculated as the sum of salary costs  including social costs  and administration costs for the program. Administration costs are estimated to be less than SEK 1m. If no allotment of shares is made  only administration costs will arise.The costs have been calculated based on the value  at the start of the program  of the Performance Shares that may be allotted at maximum performance  with a reduction of the present value of estimated dividend payments during a three-year period. The estimate on maximum costs assumes maximum performance and that the number of participants that will leave the Group during the performance period is the same as the historical average since the introduction of share programs in 2004. In the calculation  a maximum share price of SEK 247 per share has been applied.If repurchased own shares would be allocated under the program the number of outstanding shares is estimated to increase with not more than 3 965 000 shares of series B.5 Such maximum increase would have a dilutive effect on earnings per share of approximately 1.38 per cent. The total maximum increase in the number of outstanding shares of all outstanding share programs is estimated to not more than 7 874 000 shares of series B  corresponding to a dilutive effect on earnings per share of approximately 2.71 per cent. In this calculation  maximum allotment of shares has been assumed for Share Program 2023 and expected allotment has been assumed for the share programs for 2021 and 2022.Hedging measures for the Share Program 2023In order to implement Share Program 2023 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors has considered various methods for transfer of shares to the participants. The Board of Directors has found that the most cost-effective alternative is transfer of own shares  and thus proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on transfer of own shares in accordance with item 17 b) below.Should the majority required under item 17 b) below not be reached  Electrolux intends to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party.17 b) Resolution on transfers of own shares to the participants in Share Program 2023In order to secure the delivery of Performance Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the company shall transfer a maximum of 3 965 000 shares of series B in the company on the following terms and conditions:The right to receive shares shall be granted to such persons within the Electrolux Group covered by the terms and conditions pursuant to Share Program 2023. Furthermore  subsidiaries within the Electrolux Group shall have the right to acquire shares  free of consideration  and such subsidiaries shall be obligated to immediately transfer  free of consideration  shares to employees covered by the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023. The employee shall have the right to receive shares during the period when the employee is entitled to receive shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023  i.e. in 2026. Employees covered by the terms and conditions of Share Program 2023 shall receive shares of series B in the company free of consideration. The number of shares of series B in Electrolux that may be transferred under Share Program 2023 will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.Majority requirementsThe resolution of the Annual General Meeting to implement the program according to item 17 a) above requires that more than half of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting approve the proposal. The Annual General Meeting's resolution on transfer of own shares  according to item 17 b) above requires that shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the proposal.Preparation of the proposal for the Share Program 2023The proposal regarding the Share Program 2023 has been prepared by the People Committee and the Board of Directors.Previous incentive programs in ElectroluxFor a description of the company's other share related incentive programs  reference is made to the Annual Report for 2022  note 27  and the Group's website  www.electroluxgroup.com.

The project will run until December 31  2025. The consortium of ten partners sees the project as a great opportunity to establish new innovative business models in mechanical and plant engineering in Germany. In particular  the results of ""Sunrise"" should enable small and medium-sized companies to establish subscription models for the first time.UMT AG has already been contributing to this forward-looking project  which now enjoys research funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)  with its expertise in the field of payments since 2019 and has now been appointed as an official project partner. In the project  UMT will exclusively implement the verification  authentication and processing of payment transactions automatically triggered by the production machines. In addition  UMT's agenda also includes the realization of cross-media communication from production via the corporate management level to global communication networks. In this context  UMT AG also draws on MEXS' experience in the areas of messaging and IoT.“Industry 4.0” with the technology of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) enables real-time planning  control and monitoring of industrial manufacturing processes. The global volume of this very technology-driven market is estimated at over $300 billion and has annual growth rates of over 20 percent.""Sunrise"" goes beyond the technology aspect and picks up on the current trend of replacing capital-binding investments in relevant economic assets with subscription models. The IT industry  in particular  is providing numerous pioneering examples in this area: Software as a Service (SaaS) replaces the purchase of software licenses  cloud computing eliminates the need to purchase one's own servers  and copiers and printers are not purchased but charged for on a per-copy basis.The advantages for the user are clear: usage-oriented  variable costs take the place of fixed costs and allow the entrepreneur more financial flexibility and security. Not having to use their own production equipment frees up capacity to concentrate on their core business.This is precisely where the ""Sunrise"" research project comes in and  in addition to providers and customers  also includes suppliers as well as enablers of the business model such as financial intermediaries and IoT service providers and will implement value creation networks on a pilot basis  taking into account technical as well as business management issues.""We are very much looking forward to the cooperation with the top-class consortium partners and expect important impulses for our future business development  especially in the SME sector  which is also the focus of MEXS. Participation in the research project confirms to us that our commitments in the areas of payment  messaging and IoT were the right decisions for the future "" says Dr. Jürgen Schulz  Spokesman of the Board of Management at UMT AG.Thomas Teufel  MEXS Managing Director and Member of the Board of UMT AG  adds: ""The combination of IoT and messaging is an important feature of the MEXS platform  which we are already using in medium-sized manufacturing companies - even worldwide. Combined with UMT's payment expertise  this fits perfectly into the digital future of industry. In the future  we can expect further sales revenues in this area. I am particularly pleased that know-how can be passed on to UMT via this MEXS research project.""By participating in this BMBF-funded research project  the UMT Group is making a significant contribution to the fourth industrial revolution ""Industry 4.0"" and thus sees its future strategy for the digitalization of conventional business models further confirmed.Further information on the ""Sunrise"" research project will be available in the future on the following website: www.sunrise-projekt.de.About UMT AG:UMT United Mobility Technology AG stands as a ""TechnologyHouse"" for the development and implementation of customized solutions for the digitalization of business processes. With Mobile Payment  Smart Rental and MEXS  UMT has technological platforms for payment  digital rental and now also for communication. The software-oriented technology portfolio now extends far beyond payment and also includes commerce  IoT and  with MEXS  communication  and forms the basis for forward-looking  integrated products. UMT is now much more than a FinTech company and serves the retail and rental sectors as well as industry.The IT and consulting expertise built up over a decade in the field of e-commerce and payment is the basis for value-creating investments in companies that contribute to the digital transformation of the co-testing environment and thus provides the answers to the most pressing questions of companies. The focus of the investment activities is on medium-sized companies with future-oriented and stable business models. The aim is to participate in the digital transformation with a forward-looking buy-and-build strategy and thus to achieve significant revenue and earnings growth in the UMT Group with sustainable profitability and steady cash flow.The UMT United Mobility Technology AG share (GSIN: A2YN70  ISIN: DE000A2YN702) is traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and is listed on the Basic Board of Deutsche Boerse AG.Contact:UMT AGInvestor RelationsTelephone: +49 89 20 500 680Fax: +49 89 20 500 555GSIN: A2YN70ISIN: DE000A2YN702investor.relations@umt.agwww.umt.agHeadquarters: Munich  GermanyRegister Court: Munich  GermanyBoard of Directors: Dr. Juergen Schulz (Spokesman) Thomas TeufelChairman of the Supervisory Board: Walter Raizner",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.89,0.1,0.0,True,English,"['UMT United Mobility Technology AG', 'exclusive payment expert', 'Research consortium', 'UMT United Mobility Technology AG', 'Machine Tool Laboratory WZL', 'Dr. Jürgen Schulz', 'International Performance Research Institute', 'new innovative business models', 'Corporate News Research consortium', 'software-oriented technology portfolio', 'Key word(s', 'RWTH Aachen University', 'German Federal Ministry', 'annual growth rates', 'relevant economic assets', 'numerous pioneering examples', 'value creation networks', 'corporate management level', 'fourth industrial revolution', 'Industrie 4.0 business models', 'conventional business models', 'usage-oriented, variable costs', 'official project partner', 'industrial manufacturing processes', 'business management issues', 'medium-sized manufacturing companies', 'BMBF-funded research project', 'top-class consortium partners', 'exclusive payment expert', 'MEXS Managing Director', 'global communication networks', 'Sunrise"" research project', 'MEXS research project', 'future business development', 'technology aspect', 'IoT service providers', 'business processes', 'UMT AG', 'medium-sized companies', 'subscription models', 'core business', 'research funding', 'Industrial Internet', 'ten partners', 'global volume', 'fixed costs', 'consortium leader', 'looking project', 'UMT Group', 'kick-off event', 'great opportunity', 'plant engineering', 'first time', 'real-time planning', 'technology-driven market', 'current trend', 'capital-binding investments', 'cloud computing', 'financial flexibility', 'financial intermediaries', 'important impulses', 'SME sector', 'right decisions', 'Thomas Teufel', 'important feature', 'sales revenues', 'significant contribution', 'Further information', 'following website', 'customized solutions', 'Smart Rental', 'technological platforms', 'digital rental', 'payment transactions', 'Mobile Payment', ""MEXS' experience"", 'MEXS platform', 'cross-media communication', 'production machines', 'copy basis', 'production equipment', 'pilot basis', 'digital future', 'future strategy', 'IIoT market', 'software licenses', 'payment expertise', 'IT industry', 'MEXS.', 'EQS-News', 'Miscellaneous', 'CET', 'CEST', 'issuer', 'content', 'announcement', 'Munich', 'February', 'federally', 'IPRI', 'Stuttgart', 'December', 'mechanical', 'Germany', 'results', 'small', 'forward', 'Education', 'field', 'payments', 'verification', 'authentication', 'processing', 'addition', 'agenda', 'realization', 'context', 'areas', 'messaging', 'Things', 'control', 'monitoring', '20 percent', 'SaaS', 'purchase', 'need', 'servers', 'copiers', 'printers', 'advantages', 'user', 'place', 'security', 'capacity', 'customers', 'suppliers', 'enablers', 'account', 'technical', 'cooperation', 'focus', 'Participation', 'commitments', 'Spokesman', 'Board', 'Member', 'combination', 'digitalization', 'sunrise-projekt', 'TechnologyHouse', 'implementation', 'commerce', '09']",2023-02-20,2023-02-21,marketscreener.com

18831,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/20/sanctions-war-russia-ukraine-year-on-vladimir-putin,The sanctions war against Russia: a year of playing cat and mouse,Early claims Moscow would buckle quickly proved hubristic  yet Putin has also made miscalculations“The Russian economy is on track to be cut in half ” Joe Biden said in March last year  as he heralded sanctions brought against Russia after its full-scale inva…,“The Russian economy is on track to be cut in half ” Joe Biden said in March last year  as he heralded sanctions brought against Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Annalena Baerbock  the German foreign minister  vowed that sanctions were “hitting the Putin system … at its core of power”. Liz Truss  her counterpart in the UK at the time  forecast that Vladimir Putin’s oligarchs would have nowhere to hide. EU sanctions  the European Commission president  Ursula von der Leyen  said  “are working to cripple Putin’s ability to finance his war machine”.The language before the invasion had been no less assertive. At a briefing in January 2022  US state department officials said Washington was prepared to implement sanctions “with massive consequences that were not considered in 2014 [when Russia annexed Crimea]. That means the gradualism of the past is out  and this time we’ll start at the top of the escalation ladder and stay there.”The Institute for International Finance (IIF) predicted a 15% fall in Russian GDP in 2022. JP Morgan envisaged a 12% contraction. Russia’s own technocrats privately warned Putin of a possible 30% fall.Vladimir Putin attending a virtual cabinet meeting at Novo-Ogaryovo  a Russian government residence outside Moscow. Photograph: Mikhail Metzel/APThe reality was somewhat different  reflecting what analysts say was a hubristic over-confidence in the west about the speed with which sanctions that were agreed with unprecedented coordination by the G7 could damage Russia.The Russian economy contracted by only 2.2% last year. Unemployment  according to admittedly dubious official figures  now stands at 3.7 %. The construction sector has been able to grow significantly even if the car and electronics industries have suffered. A bumper harvest has driven growth in the agricultural sector.Russia is now forecast by the International Monetary Fund to grow faster in 2023 and 2024 than the UK. It is hardly financial apocalypse now.As the war approaches its one-year anniversary on 24 February  the debate about whether sanctions are effective has intensified.Defenders of sanctions say the ruble and headline gross domestic product are dreadful indicators  partly because Russian statistics are either classified or manipulated as part of the war effort. “Please do not ask me about GDP figures. They do not matter ” said Elina Ribakova  the deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance  a global industry body.Vladimir Milov  a former Russian deputy energy minister and author of a Martens Centre report on sanctions  said it may be more instructive to track a dozen or so “soft indicators” such as alcohol sales  divorce rates  shoplifting  spending on food  opinion polls  bank customer sentiment or tax revenues.“Don’t look at the watch every five minutes to see if sanctions are working. Exercise strategic patience ” said Milov  who is also an ally of the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei NavalnyAgathe Demarais  the author of Backfire  a study of US sanctions  said: “This is a marathon rather than a sprint  but financing the war is getting more difficult.”Economists at the Kyiv School of Economics go further  arguing that a decisive turning point may already have been reached as a growing Russian fiscal deficit – spurred by extra defence spending and collapsing hydrocarbon revenues – forces Russia’s central bank to eat up its reserves.Initial financial blitzkrieg“It is understandable that the west got carried away at the beginning  leading to false expectations of a palace coup ” said Charles Lichfield  a deputy director of the Atlantic Council  a US thinktank.After all  Russians started to rush for the cash machines  fearing a run on the banks. The rouble tanked  falling from from about 70-75 against the dollar to nearly 140.People stand in line to withdraw money from a cash machine at a bank in Moscow on 27 February 2022. Photograph: Victor Berzkin/APThe gates to the oligarchs’ European playgrounds were padlocked  their ostentatious toys put into dry dock. The loss of mobility and respectability was a heavy blow  particularly in London where the Conservative government suddenly turned on the Russian rich after decades of laxity and reputation laundering. Within about four months  Russian assets worth about €13.8bn (£12.3bn) had been frozen.Even the smallest transactions were at risk of getting stuck in correspondent bank accounts for weeks if not months  as international banks became wary of facilitating transfers by Russian clients. In total the EU put sanctions on 1 386 individuals and 171 entities.Hundreds of the larger western firms from McDonalds to BP to IT multinationals “self-sanctioned” themselves by suspending or winding down their Russian operations  even if some did not actually leave. The German chemical firm BASF suffered a $7.9bn (£6.5bn) writedown in the process  even if it hopes to pass it on to the taxpayer.A worker removes McDonald’s logo from a restaurant in Moscow in June 2022. Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty ImagesBut in the key opening exchange of the sanctions battle  the Russian central bank  ironically largely staffed by liberal pragmatists opposed to the invasion of Ukraine  got the better of the west. On 28 February  the west tried to ambush Russia by simply freezing what was reported by the country’s central bank to be roughly $300bn or (40%) of its total foreign exchange reserves held overseas. The remainder was not held in western currencies. “The aim was to make it harder to defend the currency  increase the cost of financing the war and fuel inflation ” said Demarais.Elvira Nabiullina  the governor of the Russian central bank. Photograph: Shamil Zhumatov/ReutersBut the Russian central bank’s governor  Elvira Nabiullina  responded decisively  raising the key interest rate to 20% on 28 February  effectively shutting down mortgages and corporate lending but making deposits extremely attractive. It deterred citizens from panicking and withdrawing all their money from their accounts. On 7 March  for the first time in the modern Russian history  the central bank completely banned the sale and withdrawal of dollars and euros deposited before 24 February. Russia also negotiated for some its banks – notably Gazprombank – to remain in the global financial messaging system Swift because they handled payments related to oil and gas exports on which the EU were heavily reliant. After a short period of stress in March 2022  structural liquidity returned more or less to pre-sanctions levels. By June the rouble had stabilised.Once its initial financial blitzkrieg – prepared in secret in the US Treasury in the months before war – had been repelled  the west had to revise its strategy  accepting implicitly it had not quite started at the top of the sanctions ladder and there were further rungs to climb. The second phase was going to be more a war of attrition  constant adjustment and consensus-building across the EU.The European Commission went on to a sanctions war footing  according to a study by the Danish Institute for International Studies. “Formal processes that would traditionally take several weeks were concluded within a day ” it found.But flaws in the process appeared. Since EU sanction packages require unanimity  ideological outliers like Hungary held massive leverage. Viktor Orbán’s personal connection with specific Russian oligarchs became apparent. For instance  in September last year the Hungarian prime minister asked  probably in return for favours by Putin  for three Russian oligarchs to be removed from the EU sanctions list. Before the 15 March renewal deadline  Orbán has lobbied to remove the same trio plus an other six. At successive European Council meetings  his ministers have threatened use of the veto  delaying key sanctions decisions. Most recently  Orbán breezily insulted Ukraine as “a no man’s land akin to Afghanistan”.Vladimir Putin presents Alisher Usmanov  the founder of USM Holdings group  the decoration For Beneficence during a ceremony at the Kremlin in Moscow in January 2017. Photograph: Kremlin Pool/AlamySome EU states found they did not have the laws  compliance departments or procedures to implement the sanctions agreed in Brussels. Only now is the European Commission working with member states for instance to establish a single contact point for enforcement and implementation issues with cross-border dimensions.Differences in the vigour with which sanctions were enforced became striking. EU figures show Greece had frozen only €222 000 in Russian assets and Malta only €200 000. The same two countries in April had tried to block a ban on Russian flagged ships entering EU ports. Austrian companies have hardly rushed to leave Russia. One estimate says 43 Austrian firms have stayed and only two left completely. Belgium has lobbied to keep the 500-year-old diamond industry in Antwerp open to Russia’s Alrosa mining company.Among Nato members  Turkey’s refusal to join the sanctions coalition has become a major problem.By the third quarter of 2022  Russian imports from Turkey had surged to over $1bn a month  roughly double the figure for the same period the previous year.Turkey became a route for Russia to import vital western-produced goods such as manufacturing parts. Some economists for instance have noticed a mini boomlet in trade between Italy and Turkey  suggesting enterprising Italian traders regard Istanbul as a useful access point into forbidden Russian markets.US Treasury sources say they have now elevated Turkey’s approach to trade with Russia to an issue of prime importance in the bilateral relationship.The US is also looking askance at another ally  the United Arab Emirates. Research by a team of Berlin-based data analysts examining more than 500 000 bank transactions after the war started found that  in terms of value  66% of withdrawals by non-resident customers of Russian banks went to beneficiaries located in the UAE. This represents a 40% rise on the previous year.Vladimir Putin  left  walks with Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan during an official welcome ceremony in Abu Dhabi  UAE  in 2019. Photograph: Alexander Zemlianichenko/APPutin’s throw’s energy poker game lead with dud cardThe surprising resilience of the Russian economy is not primarily due to the technical professionalism of central bank officials or murky sanctions busting  but instead a blindingly obvious structural flaw in the sanctions: Europe’s reliance on Russian oil and gas exports  the source of 40% of Russian budget revenue.“Not imposing a Russian export embargo early on led to record high trade and fiscal surpluses that gave Putin’s regime a huge financial cushion  enough to sustain many months of the war ” said Oleg Itskhoki  a Russian-American economist. “Only Putin’s imports were boycotted  while his exports continued. As a result the Russian car and electrical industry collapsed  but not the export of oil and gas.”Various groups of western economists  including Rüdiger Bachmann  Moritz Schularick  Ben Moll and Christian Bayer  tried through March and April to persuade German politicians that cutting off the supply of Russian energy would not lead the German economy to crash.Moll recalled: “Soon after the war started  statements were being made by German politicians that an energy embargo would have dramatic economic consequences. For instance  the economics minister said there would be mass unemployment and poverty.“We just thought it was important to look at the data and think this through systematically so we put together a team of energy economists as well as micro- and macroeconomists and concluded it might lead to a recession between 0.5 and 3 % but not economic Armageddon. Not all of us agreed with an energy embargo. But the unions and industry lobby denounced our analysis and the chancellor called us ‘irresponsible’ on national TV  a reflection of the large influence of corporate Germany.”Moll believes in retrospect his analysis of the system’s flexibility and adaptability has been proven right.But the EU could decouple itself from Russian energy only at the speed Germany  the major economy most vulnerable to Putin’s energy blackmail  was prepared to tolerate.Vladimir Putin with the former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder and the then Gazprom CEO  at the inauguration of the Nord Stream pipeline in September 2011. Photograph: Alexey Nikolsky/RIA Novosti/AFP/Getty ImagesIt took until June  after private lobbying by the US and evidence of war crimes in Ukraine  for the EU in its sixth sanctions package to agree to an EU-wide ban on Russian oil exports. But the ban was only to come into force in two delayed phases. The ban on the purchase  import or transfer of Russian seaborne crude oil was not to apply until 5 December and the ban on other refined oil products such as diesel came in on 5 February.The price of Europe’s caution is well known. With the exception of 2020 and 2018  oil and gas had provided 60% of Russian goods exports in every year since 2002. But the early summer of 2022 was a total bonanza for the Russian treasury  as it benefited from the record surge in energy prices. In March  Russia was making €1bn a day from energy exports. Oil and gas increased to 60% of Russian fiscal revenues  up from 40%. Germany alone has bought €24bn of Russian fossil fuels since the invasion.Europe funded the Russian war machine that it denounced. The surplus on Russia’s current account for the year was $227.4bn – a 86% increase on the previous year and more than double the previous record. That helped strengthen the rouble  making imports cheaper. This in turn helped to gradually bring down inflation  taking some pressure off the real incomes of the ordinary Russian population.By the summer Russian treasury coffers were so bloated that Putin felt confident enough to launch a counterattack by slowing gas supplies to Europe. With 40 % of Europe’s gas coming from Russia  he demanded in April that any country refusing to pay for its gas in roubles would be cut off. Europe huffed but complied. By June he started tampering with the gas flow through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia into Germany. He first cut deliveries through the pipeline by 75%  from 170m cubic metres a day to roughly 40m. In July  the pipeline was shut for 10 days  citing the need for essential maintenance work. On reopening  the flow was reduced to 20m cubic metres a day.Then on 26 September an as yet unidentified intelligence service blew up the pipeline and the neighbouring Nord Stream 2 pipeline – which had yet to go into service - leaving a mangled wreck and an unsolved crime scene at the bottom of the Baltic.Equinor’s liquefied natural gas facility in Melkøya  Norway  in January 2023. Photograph: Ole Berg-Rusten/NTB/AFP/Getty Images“Putin shot himself in the foot because by turning off the gas tap  he completely changed the calculus in the European Union and gave the impetus to Europe to diversify away from Russian gas ” Demarais said. “He made the decision for Europe a lot easier.”Through a mixture of planning and good fortune  Europe has  in the space of six months  largely weaned itself off Russian gas. Renewables have been boosted  the lives of nuclear power stations extended and liquid natural gas terminals built at lightening speed. The European Commission sent out search parties for alternative sources of energy ranging from Morocco  Qatar  Angola  Venezuela  Norway and Nigeria. It was a form of Putin-inspired “shock therapy”.In another blow to Putin  “General Winter”  once assumed to be Russia’s greatest ally  failed to report for duty. Temperatures averaged well above the norm with record highs for winter broken in the Netherlands  Liechtenstein  Lithuania  Latvia  Czech Republic  Poland  Denmark and Belarus. That lowered demand for energy  as did the self-restraint of European consumers rocked by record bills. Gas storage levels in Germany in January were at 90%  the highest level ever for the month.Russian gas exports to Europe tumbled by more than 75% compared with the prewar period. The daily price of natural gas on the stock exchange Amsterdam Euronext which had peaked at more than €300 a megawatt hour after the invasion  has now fallen well below 100 again  to under €60  still high by the standards of 2020 . Inflation is slowly descending across Europe  and Germany looks to have avoided the widely predicted recession.Technicians inspect the East-Route pipeline at a gas-distributing station in Qinhuangdao  China. Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesPutin had played his best economic warfare card – cutting gas exports to Europe – and it was a dud  and will remain so next winter if the EU controls demand. In the space of a year  Putin destroyed Russia’s gas bridge to Europe  the centrepiece of Russian postwar economy.Where do we go from here?The question now is how quickly he can construct a different bridge to the east  and so keep the Russian finances afloat.Russia exports natural gas from eastern fields to China through the 2 500-mile Power of Siberia 1 pipeline  but the western fields  which had served the European markets  are not connected to this export route and cannot be easily redirected to China. Eventually a Power of Siberia 2 pipeline will connect the two fields  but the estimated completion date is 2030. China is also not such a profitable market. Russia was estimated to be charging $3 a metric million British thermal unit (MMBtu) for deliveries to China via the Power of Siberia pipeline  while the estimated charge for deliveries to Europe had been sold at $10-$25/MMBtu.Putin is also in danger of being screwed to the floor over oil  his crown jewel. After persistent US Treasury lobbying  the west supplemented the EU ban on Russian crude oil exports by introducing an unprecedented market intervention that seeks to set a world wide price cap of $60 a barrel for Russian seaborne oil. From 5 December  the same date as the EU import ban  any firm providing payments  insurance  financial services  or brokering  bunkering  piloting services to a ship carrying Russian oil could not receive insurance cover if the oil was being purchased for more than $60 a barrel. If the US or EU catches any company misrepresenting the price or submitting a fraudulent attestation  the G7 can impose sanctions on that company. The UK proposes fines of $1.2m.Putin blustered  saying he would not supply oil to any country for five months that complied with this price regime from 1 February. But this may be a bluff. For China and India do not need to endorse the cap explicitly  but they can take advantage of its existence and their purchasing power to negotiate heavy price discounts in comparison with Brent crude.The price cap is in its infancy  and since the price of seaborne Urals crude averaged $49.48 in January  below the $60 cap  EU tankers – mainly Greek – can legitimately carry on transporting oil to China and India. Reports suggest crude oil loading from Russian ports have reached a multi-month high. At best the cap has had the effect of institutionalising price discounts. At worst it is proving toothless. Ukraine and its expert team advisers on sanctions led by the former US envoy Michael McFaul say the cap needs to be halved especially if its purpose is to blow a hole in Russia’s budget.But the US Treasury  in setting the cap  was balancing different objectives: reducing Russia’s income and keeping enough supplies on the seas to avoid another spike in oil prices. That requires a perilous assessment of the price at which Putin decides it is not profitable to extract or export oil. The US is trying to postpone a review of the cap level until March to allow more evidence to be collated.The Kyiv School of Economics insists the numbers on the Russian dashboard are flashing red. Russia’s monthly fiscal deficit reached a record 3.9tn roubles (£43.3bn) in December and its total budget deficit for 2022 was 3.3tn roubles – or 2.3% of GDP – set against a projected an annual surplus of 1.3tn. Overall spending in 2022 was 7.3tn roubles higher than forecast  presumably due to vast defence spending.Putin plans to spend 6.3 % of GDP on defence and national security in the 2023 federal budget alone  doubling defence spending to more than 10tn roubles. The question then becomes how long this level of spending can be sustained if energy revenues are falling so fast.Demarais said the first signs of serious strain would be unplanned debt issuance and the sale of some of its 310bn yuan (£37.5bn)  the only currency in Russia’s reserves that can be used for interventions in the foreign exchange market.Various estimates exist  but some say Russia’s planned spending is probably sustainable on an assumed Urals crude oil pice of $70 a barrel. Russia won’t burn through its stock of yuan assets this year unless the Urals price halves and averages $25 a barrel  according to Bloomberg Economics.The US bank Citigroup estimates it would only take an average price of $35 to deplete the available yuan resources already in 2023.The NS Power tanker is moored at a petroleum depot in Vladivostok  Russia in December. Photograph: Tatiana Meel/ReutersBut as the past year has shown  Russia is not sitting idle in the face of a price cap. Learning from its growing ally  Iran  it has assembled an ageing dark fleet of smaller  older ships carrying crude oil mainly to China and India. Evasion will be attempted through multiple means: flags of convenience; the blending of crude; Russian insurance schemes; or the simple manipulation of documents. New crude oil transfer hubs are already emerging. It will depend on whether this covert market grows into a viable alternative to the G7 cap  and the price at which the oil is bought by China.In the end an international sanctions war is a game of cat and mouse in which both sides look for clues amid the disinformation to try to pre-empt the other’s moves.Ultimately it is not as decisive as the battlefield  but if the west can stay the course  Putin may yet find his options narrowing. If he survives it will be a huge blow to the power of the dollar  and one that will not go unnoticed in Beijing.,negative,0.0,0.03,0.97,negative,0.01,0.07,0.93,True,English,"['sanctions war', 'Russia', 'year', 'cat', 'mouse', 'former Russian deputy energy minister', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'US state department officials', 'growing Russian fiscal deficit', 'German foreign minister', 'deputy chief economist', 'European Commission president', 'virtual cabinet meeting', 'gross domestic product', 'global industry body', 'Martens Centre report', 'decisive turning point', 'larger western firms', 'German chemical firm', 'AFP/Getty Images B', 'dubious official figures', 'Russian opposition leader', 'Initial financial blitzkrieg', 'International Monetary Fund', 'bank customer sentiment', 'correspondent bank accounts', 'Russian government residence', 'extra defence spending', 'oligarchs’ European playgrounds', 'deputy director', 'US thinktank', 'Russian economy', 'Russian GDP', 'financial apocalypse', 'Russian statistics', 'GDP figures', 'Conservative government', 'Russian assets', 'Russian clients', 'Russian operations', 'International Finance', 'central bank', 'Joe Biden', 'Annalena Baerbock', 'Liz Truss', 'massive consequences', 'escalation ladder', 'JP Morgan', 'Mikhail Metzel/AP', 'unprecedented coordination', 'construction sector', 'electronics industries', 'bumper harvest', 'agricultural sector', 'one-year anniversary', 'dreadful indicators', 'Elina Ribakova', 'soft indicators', 'alcohol sales', 'divorce rates', 'opinion polls', 'tax revenues', 'strategic patience', 'Alexei Navalny', 'Agathe Demarais', 'Kyiv School', 'hydrocarbon revenues', 'false expectations', 'palace coup', 'Charles Lichfield', 'Atlantic Council', 'cash machines', 'Victor Berzkin/AP', 'ostentatious toys', 'dry dock', 'heavy blow', 'reputation laundering', 'smallest transactions', 'IT multinationals', 'Alexander Nemenov', 'US sanctions', 'international banks', 'Putin system', 'Vladimir Putin', 'full-scale invasion', 'war machine', 'The Institute', 'possible 30% fall', 'war effort', 'Vladimir Milov', 'four months', 'EU sanctions', '15% fall', 'track', 'half', 'March', 'Ukraine', 'core', 'power', 'counterpart', 'ability', 'language', 'briefing', 'January', 'Washington', 'Crimea', 'gradualism', 'past', 'top', 'IIF', '12% contraction', 'technocrats', 'Novo-Ogaryovo', 'Moscow', 'Photograph', 'reality', 'analysts', 'confidence', 'speed', 'G7', 'Unemployment', 'growth', '24 February', 'debate', 'Defenders', 'ruble', 'headline', 'author', 'dozen', 'shoplifting', 'food', 'watch', 'ally', 'Backfire', 'study', 'marathon', 'sprint', 'Economists', 'Economics', 'collapsing', 'reserves', 'beginning', 'Russians', 'run', 'dollar', 'People', 'money', '27 February', 'gates', 'loss', 'mobility', 'London', 'decades', 'laxity', 'risk', 'weeks', 'transfers', '1,386 individuals', '171 entities', 'Hundreds', 'McDonalds', 'BP', 'BASF', '$7.9bn', 'writedown', 'process', 'taxpayer', 'worker', 'logo', 'restaurant', 'June', '3.7 %.']",2023-02-20,2023-02-21,theguardian.com

ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESERESTRICTIONS MAY CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWSAs stated in all the recent shareholder communications  DCAC has continued to explore possibleBusiness Combination targets.We now inform shareholders that DCAC has today in principle agreed to combine DCAC with thetarget business in the energy infrastructure sector  Advanced Cables  following the receipt of supportfrom the UK government’s Department of International Trade (“DIT”) for the company’s plans  andwith the support of Advanced Cables’ shareholders and other interested parties.There is no guarantee that the Advanced Cables purchase agreement will be consummated  not least itis subject to further regulatory and governmental approvals or  at the least  ‘non-objection’. However shareholders contemplating submitting tenders under either the Repurchase Offer or the Stub TenderOffer should bear this progress in mind when making their decisions.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Warrant holders are strongly recommended to read theentirety of this document. Should they be in any doubt  then they should seek advice from a qualifiedprofessional.Advanced CablesThe shareholders of Advanced Cables have confirmed their intent to enter into a business combinationwith DCAC (the “Advanced Cables Business Combination”) by granting DCAC first refusal toacquire all their shares for between 375 million and 400 million Swiss Francs1  subject to theconditions below. DCAC has completed its due diligence on Advanced Cables and the proposedtransaction has been approved by the boards of both DCAC and of Advanced Cables  including thepositive agreement of the independent directors of both companies. Once important governmentaland regulatory approvals have been satisfied  DCAC will issue further information to its shareholders.Whilst DIT has demonstrated its support  there is no guarantee that regulatory and/or furthergovernmental approvals  permits and authorisations  or at the least ‘non-objections’  will beforthcoming.Story continuesObjectivesThe purpose of the potential listing is to diversify Advanced Cables’ shareholder base  raise its profileand to have the opportunity to use listed shares to merge with complementary businesses in its largemarket segment. Advanced Cables and DCAC are exploring several opportunities to acquire thedivisions of large companies in its own and adjacent asset-rich spheres of operations  although thiscannot be guaranteed. Whilst no further capital is likely to be required to put into effect the BusinessCombination  in due course  a Further Primary Capital raise is anticipated (as noted below)  whichAdvanced Cables believes will be best achieved via the capital markets.Advanced Cables aims first to supply the burgeoning demand for HVDC cables to connect renewablepower generation to the onshore grids; and then to foster the interconnection of national grids acrossborders. This ESG goal-enhancing sector requires many billions in capital investment to expand anddeliver on the transition to NetZero; to facilitate the renewal and transformation of legacyinfrastructure; and to rise to the challenge of fighting climate change. Advanced Cables is developingworld-class cable manufacturing operations to serve these sectors  whose development is beinghampered by a severe shortage of high-quality cable. This under-invested sector has historicallydelivered strong returns on capital; and high operational margins offer the prospect of resilient longtermflows of cash earnings and thus the potential for strong dividend flows to DCAC shareholders.To date  capital constrained cable manufacturers have been unable to grasp the opportunity that theirproduction of the key component for their customers affords  in terms of taking stakes in the projectsthat their customers are developing. Nor have they teamed up with those customers to mutualadvantage. Advanced Cables has been engaged in close discussions with international grid operatorsand project developers  with whom it expects to co-invest. Capital growth may potentially come fromthe deployment of capital and expertise into building out into under-served markets; harnessing capitaland strategic stakebuilding to vertically integrate and capture and expand existing internationalopportunities; and to transform legacy business models  with the efficiencies of bringing proventechnology and expertise to bear in large scale.It is DCAC’s contention that governments and regulators prefer to see a publicly listed operation having the benefit of being subject to transparency and governance requirements. The DCAC boardand special advisers bring to Advanced Cables a strong pedigree of successfully implementing a ‘buybuild-transform’ investment philosophy within a framework of strong governance  spanning theprivate  publicly listed and state-owned entities. A highly experienced independent leading sectorexpert will be appointed to chair the DCAC board  in the event that the proposed BusinessCombination proceeds.The board of DCAC wish to share the benefits of its Euronext Amsterdam listing with all those DCACOrdinary Shareholders and DCAC Warrant holders who have supported the recent reconstruction  notleast by capturing a premium to the current net asset value to reflect the value of the listing. Theestimated Net Asset Value as at 15th Feb 2023 was £10.27 per DCAC Ordinary Share  being the netcash after the payment of liabilities as set out in the Shareholder Circular.However  given the smaller size of the Advanced Cables proposal than the targets originallyenvisaged  including Saxo Bank at some €2.0 to €2.2 billion  the DCAC board and Sponsors believeit is appropriate to reduce the dilution from the Sponsor’s ‘promote’  being the package of SponsorShares and Sponsor Warrants.Acquisition TermsThe terms of the agreements agreed in principle for the proposed Advanced Cables BusinessCombination would initially comprise a sale of Advanced Cables to DCAC in exchange for the issueof DCAC Shares at a price of GBP 11.50 per DCAC Share.The DCAC Shares would come from a combination of the issue of new DCAC Shares and Shares held intreasury. DCAC will be the ongoing Euronext Amsterdam listed entity  subject to the admission of thenew Shares to listing.Conditions Precedent applying to DCACThe proposed agreement with Advanced Cables is predicated upon  inter alia  that:(i) DCAC shareholders approve the Advanced Cables Business Combination (by shareholder voteas retained in the Amended Articles).(ii) Changes are made to reduce the Sponsor promote arrangements (as below) and  potentially to reward the Advanced Cables management rather than the Sponsors by the transfer ofSponsor Warrants to the Advanced Cables management incentive plan.(iii) The DCAC Shares and Warrants continue to be listed on Euronext Amsterdam and that DCACmaintains sufficient external shareholders to satisfy any ‘free float’ requirements of EuronextAmsterdam. As Advanced Cables would have ±89% of the enlarged share capital  and theSponsor Group over 5%  this is estimated to amount to at least 1 750 000 shares being inpublic hands  post such Advanced Cables Business Combination.(iv) The Amended Articles contain an obligation on the Company that  in case the Company intendsto consummate a Business Combination with a target or business that is affiliated with a holderof Sponsor Shares or a director  the remaining non-affiliated director(s) either (i) obtains anopinion from an independent investment banking firm and/or (ii) procures that persons that arenot affiliated to  managed by or advised by a holder of Sponsor Shares or any Insider (or anyof its affiliates) subscribe for new shares or interests (a) in the target or business the subject ofa Business Combination at the same time and price and on the same terms as the Company or(b) in the Company at the same time and price and on the same terms the Company is proposingto issue such shares or interests to the vendors of and/or persons connected to the target orbusiness the subject of a Business Combination.As related parties hold shares in both DCAC and Advanced Cables  it is intended to addressthese conflicts of interests as follows:a. The non-affiliated directors of both Advanced Cables and DCAC have today approvedentering into substantive discussionsb. An independent investment banking firm is being appointed to provide a fairnessopinion.c. The valuation will also be subject to an independent review by the auditors.d. Certain independent Advanced Cables shareholders intend to acquire additional AdvancedCables shares shortly before Business Combinatione. Independent investors have indicated that they intend to acquire additional DCACshares on Business Combination.Changes to Sponsor Shares and Sponsor WarrantsThe Advanced Cables board and shareholders have demanded as a pre-condition of the agreement and the DCAC Board and Sponsor group have agreed in principle  the following changes to theSponsor promote arrangements:(i) The Sponsor Group will place all the DCAC Sponsor Warrants into an Advanced CablesManagement MIP. The DCAC Board believes that this will benefit all DCAC and formerAdvanced Cables shareholders not least to ensure an alignment of interest with AdvancedCables management.(ii) These ex-Sponsor Warrants and the Over-Subscription Warrants held by the Sponsor bechanged to remove the cashless exercise option  and so make them capable of cash exerciseonly.(iii) The second tranche of Founder Shares  representing approximately 10% of the total number ofOrdinary Shares .. only [granted] if the closing price of the Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds GBP13.00 per Ordinary Share  be cancelled and so no longer dilute other DCAC and formerAdvanced Cables shareholders.First Tranche of Sponsor SharesThe Advanced Cables Business Combination Agreement does not propose to change the shareholdingposition from the Prospectus for the first tranche of Sponsor Shares  so potentially giving DCACSponsors 1.5625 million Shares if the conditions are met:Post-Business Combination Completion Date  a triggering event occurs for the issuance of the first tranche ofSponsor Shares representing approximately 10% of the total number of Ordinary Shares issued to the OrdinaryShareholders [at IPO]  only if the closing price of the Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds GBP 10.00 per OrdinaryShare  for any 20 Trading Days within a 30 Trading Day period.Shareholder ConsentDCAC will distribute a shareholder circular to seek shareholder consent to the Advanced CablesBusiness Combination from its shareholders  only once the governmental and regulatoryconfirmations have been received.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will be able to vote only on such DCAC Ordinary Shares as they retainat the record date of such future EGM to consider the Advanced Cables Business Combination.No Secondary PlacingIf the proposals are approved  the Advanced Cables shareholders  who include related parties includingRTE International  will enter into customary lock up arrangements.Primary Capital Raisings envisaged post Advanced CablesSecondary ListingDCAC further intends within the next three months to seek a secondary listing on NASDAQ OMX as well as benefitting from the Euronext network of exchanges across EuropeImpact of Cash exercise of WarrantsCashless conversion does not apply to Public Warrants. Therefore  the cash exercise of Warrants when combined with the changes to ex-Sponsor Warrants and the Over-Subscription Warrants held bythe Sponsor  to make them capable of cash exercise only  could result in up to £98.68 million of freshcash coming into DCAC.DCAC intends to offer improvements in the warrant terms to reward early exercise in conjunctionwith a ‘rights issue’ and open offer.Possible Rights Issue and Open OfferNo primary capital is expected to be required in the near term  as long as DCAC maintains sufficientexternal shareholders to satisfy any ‘free float’ requirements of Euronext Amsterdam. This isestimated  post-Advanced Cables to amount to at least 1 750 000 shares in public hands  subject toconfirmation by Euronext Amsterdam.However  to enhance liquidity and to provide capital for further expansion and growth  in particularto secure both its manufacturing and the offtakers for its key outputs for several years to come Advanced Cables is in the process of and currently intends by the end of May 2023 to raise GBP 318million in the form of debt and equity.Major strategic operators have indicated their intentions to subscribe equity to an operationalsubsidiary of Advanced Cables; and a leading commercial bank that it will lend up to GBP 180 millionto the cable manufacturing operation  albeit on the condition that the bank enjoys the support of UKgovernment entities. DIT has been instrumental in assisting with these discussions. Were suchindications to be consummated  then the fundraising at the DCAC level would be of the order of GBP50 to 70 million. Strategic customers have indicated their willingness to contract with AdvancedCables and to invest via DCAC to secure their supply chain and so assure the delivery of their majorprojects.To the extent that further funding is required  notably after the possible early exercise of DCACWarrants  then it is currently intended that new DCAC Ordinary Shares and/or Convertible Loans willbe issued. The intended offer price is in the range of GBP 13.00 to 16.00 per DCAC Ordinary Share.The terms of any possible Convertible Loan have yet to be determined.To reward early exercise  it is intended that DCAC Warrant holders who exercise their warrants forcash at the time of the proposed Offer will be given a discount on the exercise price to reflect the timevalue of their warrant. The terms of any such discount have yet to be determined.The stated intentions of DCAC are that it will grant pre-emption rights to subscribe for new shares inthe Company to provide any funding requirement  before DCAC goes out to the wider market.Therefore  DCAC intends that first refusal will be given to current DCAC shareholders and to formerAdvanced Cables shareholders  including the Truell Conservation Foundation2 and Long TermAssets3  to subscribe at GBP 12.50 per new Ordinary Share.Status of the Repurchase OfferCopies of the Repurchase Tender Document and the Stub Tender Offer Circular are available onDCAC's website: www.disruptivecapitalac.com.Under the Repurchase Offer (as defined and undertaken pursuant to the Repurchase Tender Documentissued by the Company on 25 January 2023)  shareholders have been eligible to submit tenders aheadof the final date for tenders to be submitted  being the 22nd February 2023.DCAC Shareholders contemplating submitting tenders under the Repurchase Offer should bear theCompany’s progress in mind when making their decisions.Under the Advanced Cables Business Combination arrangements  if so approved  it is intended thatDCAC Ordinary Shares are to be issued at GBP 11.50 per Share.As of today 20th February 2023  GBP 69 446 789 of tenders have been or are in the process of beingsettled  all at a price of GBP 10.789 per share.The repurchased DCAC Ordinary Shares will be held as Treasury Shares  pending prospective reissueunder the Advanced Cables Business Combination. The Company confirms that  once these repurchaseshave been settled  the Company will have 64% of its share capital outstanding in public hands.Stub Tender OfferShareholders contemplating submitting tenders under the Stub Tender Offer should bear the Company’sprogress in mind when making their decisions.The maximum price on offer under the Stub Tender Offer is £2.20 per DCAC Ordinary Share  whichcompares to the last trading price of £10.00 per DCAC Ordinary Share  the Repurchase Offer price of£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary Share; and now the in principle agreement to issue DCAC Ordinary Sharesat £11.50 per DCAC Ordinary Shares.The estimated Net Asset Value as at 15th Feb 2023 was £10.27 per DCAC Ordinary Share.Accompanying Stub WarrantsShareholders contemplating submitting tenders of the accompanying Warrants under the Stub TenderOffer should bear the Company’s progress in mind when making their decisions.As under the Advanced Cables Business Combination arrangements  if so approved  it is intended thatDCAC Ordinary Shares be issued at GBP 11.50 per Share  being equivalent to the Warrant exercise price it is likely that the Warrants will trade at a level reflecting an ‘at the money’ option with 5 years maturity.Whilst it is difficult to predict this trading level with any certainty  it may be a multiple of the value beingoffered under the Stub Tender Offer.AdvisersDCAC has invited JP Morgan to act as adviser to the proposals. This invitation is being examinedand may or may not be accepted.Advanced Cables already has in place a full suite of advisers  including Afry  Red Penguin  and Aecom.Possible fallback Business CombinationIn the light of the experience with Saxo Bank and the inevitable uncertainties around closing theAdvanced Cables transaction  DCAC continues to be in discussions on undertaking a BusinessCombination with a target business operating in the financial services sector. Both targets haveheadquarters and principal operations in Western and/or Northern Europe.We recommend that shareholders take careful heed of the positive impact these proposals may bringto the Company; and DCAC looks forward to being in contact with further information.Edmund TruellCEO  DCACAbout DCACDCAC is a special purpose acquisition company incorporated on 29 April 2021 under the CompaniesLaw as a non-cellular company limited by shares.

This would make only the institution liable while shielding its employees including top executives  a move the Treasury believes could speed up the listing process.Story continuesThe bill also proposes restricting the liability of listing companies to cases of serious misconduct that damage investor interests due to information included in the IPO documents.In addition  the scheme reinforces the possibility of bypassing the formal IPO process through a so-called self-placement  which sees a company sell shares directly  saving the money required to line up underwriters as middlemen.As part of a drive to boost funding sources other than bank credit  a measure being discussed would allow companies to issue bonds for an amount exceeding the current limit of twice the share capital  provided that these notes were bought by professional investors.($1 = 0.9362 euros)(Reporting by Giuseppe Fonte in Rome  additional reporting by Elisa Anzolin in Milan; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",positive,0.71,0.29,0.0,mixed,0.16,0.1,0.74,True,English,"['Milan bourse', 'Italy', 'measures', 'allure', 'Treasury junior minister Federico Freni', 'Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni', '200-year-old Borsa Italiana', 'European Union peers', 'initial public offerings', 'adequate risk disclosure', 'other expansion strategies', 'formal IPO process', 'current rules companies', 'other bourses', 'IPO documents', 'current limit', 'listing process', 'Giuseppe Fonte', 'capital markets', 'infrastructure group', 'Agnelli family', 'six newcomers', 'tight grip', 'family-run businesses', 'M&A', 'previous administration', 'Mario Draghi', 'wide range', 'medium-sized enterprises', 'SME qualification', 'market watchdog', 'top executives', 'serious misconduct', 'investor interests', 'funding sources', 'bank credit', 'share capital', 'additional reporting', 'Elisa Anzolin', 'Emelia Sithole-Matarise', '680 billion euros', '500 million euros', '1 billion euros', 'government officials', 'overall capitalisation', 'holding company', 'EASING SELF-PLACEMENT', 'professional investors', 'listing companies', 'Euronext Milan', 'draft bill', '0.9362 euros', '15 companies', 'ROME', 'Reuters', 'Italy', 'measures', 'issues', 'country', 'role', 'Monday', 'value', 'Atlantia', 'Exor', 'exits', 'Amsterdam', 'regulations', 'shareholders', 'challenge', 'control', 'cash', 'parliament', 'April', 'ability', 'proposals', 'details', 'IPOs', 'firms', 'simplifications', 'incentives', 'small', 'SMEs', 'threshold', 'provision', 'savers', 'staff', 'regulators', 'Consob', 'damages', 'institution', 'employees', 'move', 'Story', 'cases', 'information', 'scheme', 'possibility', 'shares', 'money', 'underwriters', 'middlemen', 'part', 'drive', 'bonds', 'amount', 'notes', 'Editing']",2023-02-20,2023-02-21,finance.yahoo.com

18839,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4579926-verallia-glass-container-producer-available-at-10-percent-fcf-yield,Verallia: Europe's Largest Glass Container Producer Available At A 10% FCF Yield (OTCMKTS:VRLAF),Verallia is the third largest producer of glass bottles and jars. Almost half of its bottles are sold to the wine and sparkling wine industry. Read more here.,RobsonPL/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionVerallia (OTCPK:VRLAF) is a French company and a major producer of glass bottles with production in South America and Europe. The company produces approximately 17 billion bottles and jars in its 63 furnaces in 12 countries. The largest portion of the produced bottles are used for wine and sparkling wine while an additional 26% is used for beer and spirits. Verallia is the world’s third largest producer of glass bottles and jars and is the number 1 in Europe  which accounts for in excess of 85% of its revenue.Verallia Investor RelationsVerallia’s primary listing is on Euronext Paris where it is trading with VRLA as its ticker symbol. There are currently approximately 117M shares outstanding (after deducting the treasury shares) for a total market capitalization of 4.5B EUR. The average daily volume in France is just over 140 000 shares  making it the most liquid listing of Verallia.Yahoo FinanceA surprisingly strong 2022 bodes well for the futureVerallia posted an excellent result in 2022. Its plants were running at full capacity to keep up with demand and thanks to a smart energy hedging policy it was able to keep the impact of the higher natural gas prices throughout the year pretty limited. This  in combination with a strong demand for glass containers (this wasn’t Verallia-specific as for instance O-I Glass (OI) also reported very strong demand for its products) allowed Verallia to exceed expectations.The total revenue increased by in excess of 20% to 3.35B EUR while the COGS increased by just around 25% despite the pressure on the cost of raw materials. Although the COGS increased at a faster pace than the revenue  the small increase in the SG&A expenses helped to boost the operating profit by approximately 40% to in excess of 550M EUR.Verallia Investor RelationsThe net finance expenses also increased but this didn’t have a major impact: the pre-tax income came in at 478M EUR resulting in a net income of 355.6M EUR of which 13.6M EUR was attributable to non-controlling interests. This means the net income attributable to the common shareholders of Verallia was 342M EUR which works out to 2.92 EUR per share. That’s an increase of in excess of 40% compared to FY 2021.One of the main reasons why I initiated a long position in Verallia in 2022 is the company’s excellent ability to convert its net income and EBITDA into free cash flow. This wasn’t any different in 2022.The reported operating cash flow was 699M EUR but this includes about 93.5M EUR in working capital contributions while we should also deduct an additional 17M EUR in taxes based on the total taxes owed rather than the amount of taxes paid. We should also deduct the 28M EUR in interest expenses to end up with an adjusted operating cash flow of 590M EUR.Verallia Investor RelationsThe total capex was 367M EUR  resulting in a pro forma free cash flow result of 223M EUR and about 210M EUR if we would deduct the net income attributable to the non-controlling interests. Keep in mind Verallia has been investing in growth as it tries to increase its production capacity at a low single digit percentage per year. The corporate presentation (below) confirms the sustaining capex is much lower than 367M EUR. Only 270M EUR was classified as sustaining (recurring) capex. That’s higher than anticipated but that’s entirely caused by the recent inflation. Verallia budgets about 8% of its annual revenue for sustaining capex  so 270M EUR is not surprising.Verallia Investor RelationsIt does mean the underlying sustaining free cash flow came in at 307M EUR or 2.6 EUR per share  and that obviously is a good result. It allowed Verallia to hike its dividend by 33% as the company is proposing to pay a dividend of 1.40 EUR per share.Aiming for 1B EUR in EBITDA in 2023The cash flow statement also shows Verallia spent almost 250M EUR on an acquisition. This is related to the acquisition of Allied Glass  a UK based producer of glass bottles in the premium segment. The company has an annual revenue of 150M GBP but nor the EBITDA nor the net income were disclosed. But assuming the company has a 20-25% EBITDA margin (Verallia’s own EBITDA margin exceeds 25%)  it looks like Verallia acquired Allied at about 8 times EBITDA which isn’t expensive at all.The EBITDA contribution from Allied Glass also helped to boost the full-year 2023 guidance as Verallia is now guiding for a full-year EBITDA of 1B EUR.Verallia Investor RelationsAssuming the depreciation and amortization expenses increase to 325M EUR (295M EUR in FY 2022) and assuming the interest expenses increase from 28M EUR to 35M EUR  a 1B EUR EBITDA implies a pre-tax profit of 640M EUR  and a net income of in excess of 400M EUR. The free cash flow result should be slightly higher than that  and will likely exceed 3.50 EUR per share.Verallia is lucky to have locked in the interest rate on about 1B EUR of its debt. Additionally  the floating rate debt was hedged and about 92% of the total debt is either fixed or hedged. This means Verallia will be shielded from the recent interest rate increases although we will see an impact from Q4 2024 on when the 500M EUR loan will have to be refinanced. But by that time  the free cash flow machine will be nicely humming again and thanks to Verallia’s pricing power  I’m not really expecting a massive impact from increasing interest rates until 2028. And even if you would assume the 2028 loan will see a 300 basis point increase in the cost of debt  the after tax free cash flow per share would be impacted by just 10 cents per share.Verallia Investor RelationsInvestment thesisIn the ESCI portfolio  a long position was established in 2022 at an average price of 22.31 EUR with the most recent purchase being a top-up at 22.76 EUR per share in June. Ever since adding Verallia to the portfolio  I was aiming for an exit point around 40 EUR per share. As the situation got a bit trickier and as the natural gas prices remained at elevated levels until pretty recently  I didn’t want to expect too much from a heavy user of natural gas and I wrote a call option against the position which would result in an average exit price of just under 35 EUR per share for a capital gain of in excess of 50% and a total return of close to 60% in about a year time.Seeing how strong the fourth quarter was  and seeing the FY 2023 guidance  it looks like I pulled the trigger too early. While I’m definitely happy with a 60% return in about a year  I am (pleasantly) surprised by Verallia’s guidance while the decreasing natural gas price in Europe will obviously also play a big role in protecting Verallia’s margins.I will keep an eye on Verallia and perhaps I will re-enter the stock on any weakness. As based on the prospects for 2023  Verallia is still cheap. If I would have known what I now know  I would not have sold Verallia.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The review classification is Priority.VLA1553 has been assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) review goal date at the end of August 2023  which is the date by which the FDA intends to take action on the application. The FDA’s acknowledgement of filing does not mean that a license will be granted  nor does it represent any evaluation of the adequacy of the data submitted.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat. As of July 2022  there were more than 3 million reported cases in the Americas1 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after three to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. It is estimated that over three quarters of the world’s population live in areas at-risk of CHIKV transmission2. High risk areas of infection are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are currently endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 100 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15533. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20194  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 20225  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20226 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 20227.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to commercialize three vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against the chikungunya virus and Lyme disease.Valneva Investor and Media ContactsLaetitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to the progress  timing  results and completion of research  development and clinical trials for product candidates  to regulatory approval of product candidates and review of existing products.

ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESERESTRICTIONS MAY CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWSAs stated in all the recent shareholder communications  DCAC has continued to explore possibleBusiness Combination targets.We now inform shareholders that DCAC has today in principle agreed to combine DCAC with thetarget business in the energy infrastructure sector  Advanced Cables  following the receipt of supportfrom the UK government’s Department of International Trade (“DIT”) for the company’s plans  andwith the support of Advanced Cables’ shareholders and other interested parties.There is no guarantee that the Advanced Cables purchase agreement will be consummated  not least itis subject to further regulatory and governmental approvals or  at the least  ‘non-objection’. However shareholders contemplating submitting tenders under either the Repurchase Offer or the Stub TenderOffer should bear this progress in mind when making their decisions.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders and DCAC Warrant holders are strongly recommended to read theentirety of this document. Should they be in any doubt  then they should seek advice from a qualifiedprofessional.Advanced CablesThe shareholders of Advanced Cables have confirmed their intent to enter into a business combinationwith DCAC (the “Advanced Cables Business Combination”) by granting DCAC first refusal toacquire all their shares for between 375 million and 400 million Swiss Francs1  subject to theconditions below. DCAC has completed its due diligence on Advanced Cables and the proposedtransaction has been approved by the boards of both DCAC and of Advanced Cables  including thepositive agreement of the independent directors of both companies. Once important governmentaland regulatory approvals have been satisfied  DCAC will issue further information to its shareholders.Whilst DIT has demonstrated its support  there is no guarantee that regulatory and/or furthergovernmental approvals  permits and authorisations  or at the least ‘non-objections’  will beforthcoming.ObjectivesThe purpose of the potential listing is to diversify Advanced Cables’ shareholder base  raise its profileand to have the opportunity to use listed shares to merge with complementary businesses in its largemarket segment. Advanced Cables and DCAC are exploring several opportunities to acquire thedivisions of large companies in its own and adjacent asset-rich spheres of operations  although thiscannot be guaranteed. Whilst no further capital is likely to be required to put into effect the BusinessCombination  in due course  a Further Primary Capital raise is anticipated (as noted below)  whichAdvanced Cables believes will be best achieved via the capital markets.Advanced Cables aims first to supply the burgeoning demand for HVDC cables to connect renewablepower generation to the onshore grids; and then to foster the interconnection of national grids acrossborders. This ESG goal-enhancing sector requires many billions in capital investment to expand anddeliver on the transition to NetZero; to facilitate the renewal and transformation of legacyinfrastructure; and to rise to the challenge of fighting climate change. Advanced Cables is developingworld-class cable manufacturing operations to serve these sectors  whose development is beinghampered by a severe shortage of high-quality cable. This under-invested sector has historicallydelivered strong returns on capital; and high operational margins offer the prospect of resilient longtermflows of cash earnings and thus the potential for strong dividend flows to DCAC shareholders.To date  capital constrained cable manufacturers have been unable to grasp the opportunity that theirproduction of the key component for their customers affords  in terms of taking stakes in the projectsthat their customers are developing. Nor have they teamed up with those customers to mutualadvantage. Advanced Cables has been engaged in close discussions with international grid operatorsand project developers  with whom it expects to co-invest. Capital growth may potentially come fromthe deployment of capital and expertise into building out into under-served markets; harnessing capitaland strategic stakebuilding to vertically integrate and capture and expand existing internationalopportunities; and to transform legacy business models  with the efficiencies of bringing proventechnology and expertise to bear in large scale.It is DCAC’s contention that governments and regulators prefer to see a publicly listed operation having the benefit of being subject to transparency and governance requirements. The DCAC boardand special advisers bring to Advanced Cables a strong pedigree of successfully implementing a ‘buybuild-transform’ investment philosophy within a framework of strong governance  spanning theprivate  publicly listed and state-owned entities. A highly experienced independent leading sectorexpert will be appointed to chair the DCAC board  in the event that the proposed BusinessCombination proceeds.The board of DCAC wish to share the benefits of its Euronext Amsterdam listing with all those DCACOrdinary Shareholders and DCAC Warrant holders who have supported the recent reconstruction  notleast by capturing a premium to the current net asset value to reflect the value of the listing. Theestimated Net Asset Value as at 15th Feb 2023 was £10.27 per DCAC Ordinary Share  being the netcash after the payment of liabilities as set out in the Shareholder Circular.However  given the smaller size of the Advanced Cables proposal than the targets originallyenvisaged  including Saxo Bank at some €2.0 to €2.2 billion  the DCAC board and Sponsors believeit is appropriate to reduce the dilution from the Sponsor’s ‘promote’  being the package of SponsorShares and Sponsor Warrants.Acquisition TermsThe terms of the agreements agreed in principle for the proposed Advanced Cables BusinessCombination would initially comprise a sale of Advanced Cables to DCAC in exchange for the issueof DCAC Shares at a price of GBP 11.50 per DCAC Share.The DCAC Shares would come from a combination of the issue of new DCAC Shares and Shares held intreasury. DCAC will be the ongoing Euronext Amsterdam listed entity  subject to the admission of thenew Shares to listing.Conditions Precedent applying to DCACThe proposed agreement with Advanced Cables is predicated upon  inter alia  that:(i) DCAC shareholders approve the Advanced Cables Business Combination (by shareholder voteas retained in the Amended Articles).(ii) Changes are made to reduce the Sponsor promote arrangements (as below) and  potentially to reward the Advanced Cables management rather than the Sponsors by the transfer ofSponsor Warrants to the Advanced Cables management incentive plan.(iii) The DCAC Shares and Warrants continue to be listed on Euronext Amsterdam and that DCACmaintains sufficient external shareholders to satisfy any ‘free float’ requirements of EuronextAmsterdam. As Advanced Cables would have ±89% of the enlarged share capital  and theSponsor Group over 5%  this is estimated to amount to at least 1 750 000 shares being inpublic hands  post such Advanced Cables Business Combination.(iv) The Amended Articles contain an obligation on the Company that  in case the Company intendsto consummate a Business Combination with a target or business that is affiliated with a holderof Sponsor Shares or a director  the remaining non-affiliated director(s) either (i) obtains anopinion from an independent investment banking firm and/or (ii) procures that persons that arenot affiliated to  managed by or advised by a holder of Sponsor Shares or any Insider (or anyof its affiliates) subscribe for new shares or interests (a) in the target or business the subject ofa Business Combination at the same time and price and on the same terms as the Company or(b) in the Company at the same time and price and on the same terms the Company is proposingto issue such shares or interests to the vendors of and/or persons connected to the target orbusiness the subject of a Business Combination.As related parties hold shares in both DCAC and Advanced Cables  it is intended to addressthese conflicts of interests as follows:a. The non-affiliated directors of both Advanced Cables and DCAC have today approvedentering into substantive discussionsb. An independent investment banking firm is being appointed to provide a fairnessopinion.c. The valuation will also be subject to an independent review by the auditors.d. Certain independent Advanced Cables shareholders intend to acquire additional AdvancedCables shares shortly before Business Combinatione. Independent investors have indicated that they intend to acquire additional DCACshares on Business Combination.Changes to Sponsor Shares and Sponsor WarrantsThe Advanced Cables board and shareholders have demanded as a pre-condition of the agreement and the DCAC Board and Sponsor group have agreed in principle  the following changes to theSponsor promote arrangements:(i) The Sponsor Group will place all the DCAC Sponsor Warrants into an Advanced CablesManagement MIP. The DCAC Board believes that this will benefit all DCAC and formerAdvanced Cables shareholders not least to ensure an alignment of interest with AdvancedCables management.(ii) These ex-Sponsor Warrants and the Over-Subscription Warrants held by the Sponsor bechanged to remove the cashless exercise option  and so make them capable of cash exerciseonly.(iii) The second tranche of Founder Shares  representing approximately 10% of the total number ofOrdinary Shares .. only [granted] if the closing price of the Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds GBP13.00 per Ordinary Share  be cancelled and so no longer dilute other DCAC and formerAdvanced Cables shareholders.First Tranche of Sponsor SharesThe Advanced Cables Business Combination Agreement does not propose to change the shareholdingposition from the Prospectus for the first tranche of Sponsor Shares  so potentially giving DCACSponsors 1.5625 million Shares if the conditions are met:Post-Business Combination Completion Date  a triggering event occurs for the issuance of the first tranche ofSponsor Shares representing approximately 10% of the total number of Ordinary Shares issued to the OrdinaryShareholders [at IPO]  only if the closing price of the Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds GBP 10.00 per OrdinaryShare  for any 20 Trading Days within a 30 Trading Day period.Shareholder ConsentDCAC will distribute a shareholder circular to seek shareholder consent to the Advanced CablesBusiness Combination from its shareholders  only once the governmental and regulatoryconfirmations have been received.DCAC Ordinary Shareholders will be able to vote only on such DCAC Ordinary Shares as they retainat the record date of such future EGM to consider the Advanced Cables Business Combination.No Secondary PlacingIf the proposals are approved  the Advanced Cables shareholders  who include related parties includingRTE International  will enter into customary lock up arrangements.Primary Capital Raisings envisaged post Advanced CablesSecondary ListingDCAC further intends within the next three months to seek a secondary listing on NASDAQ OMX as well as benefitting from the Euronext network of exchanges across EuropeImpact of Cash exercise of WarrantsCashless conversion does not apply to Public Warrants. Therefore  the cash exercise of Warrants when combined with the changes to ex-Sponsor Warrants and the Over-Subscription Warrants held bythe Sponsor  to make them capable of cash exercise only  could result in up to £98.68 million of freshcash coming into DCAC.DCAC intends to offer improvements in the warrant terms to reward early exercise in conjunctionwith a ‘rights issue’ and open offer.Possible Rights Issue and Open OfferNo primary capital is expected to be required in the near term  as long as DCAC maintains sufficientexternal shareholders to satisfy any ‘free float’ requirements of Euronext Amsterdam. This isestimated  post-Advanced Cables to amount to at least 1 750 000 shares in public hands  subject toconfirmation by Euronext Amsterdam.However  to enhance liquidity and to provide capital for further expansion and growth  in particularto secure both its manufacturing and the offtakers for its key outputs for several years to come Advanced Cables is in the process of and currently intends by the end of May 2023 to raise GBP 318million in the form of debt and equity.Major strategic operators have indicated their intentions to subscribe equity to an operationalsubsidiary of Advanced Cables; and a leading commercial bank that it will lend up to GBP 180 millionto the cable manufacturing operation  albeit on the condition that the bank enjoys the support of UKgovernment entities. DIT has been instrumental in assisting with these discussions. Were suchindications to be consummated  then the fundraising at the DCAC level would be of the order of GBP50 to 70 million. Strategic customers have indicated their willingness to contract with AdvancedCables and to invest via DCAC to secure their supply chain and so assure the delivery of their majorprojects.To the extent that further funding is required  notably after the possible early exercise of DCACWarrants  then it is currently intended that new DCAC Ordinary Shares and/or Convertible Loans willbe issued. The intended offer price is in the range of GBP 13.00 to 16.00 per DCAC Ordinary Share.The terms of any possible Convertible Loan have yet to be determined.To reward early exercise  it is intended that DCAC Warrant holders who exercise their warrants forcash at the time of the proposed Offer will be given a discount on the exercise price to reflect the timevalue of their warrant. The terms of any such discount have yet to be determined.The stated intentions of DCAC are that it will grant pre-emption rights to subscribe for new shares inthe Company to provide any funding requirement  before DCAC goes out to the wider market.Therefore  DCAC intends that first refusal will be given to current DCAC shareholders and to formerAdvanced Cables shareholders  including the Truell Conservation Foundation2 and Long TermAssets3  to subscribe at GBP 12.50 per new Ordinary Share.Status of the Repurchase OfferCopies of the Repurchase Tender Document and the Stub Tender Offer Circular are available onDCAC's website: www.disruptivecapitalac.com.Under the Repurchase Offer (as defined and undertaken pursuant to the Repurchase Tender Documentissued by the Company on 25 January 2023)  shareholders have been eligible to submit tenders aheadof the final date for tenders to be submitted  being the 22nd February 2023.DCAC Shareholders contemplating submitting tenders under the Repurchase Offer should bear theCompany’s progress in mind when making their decisions.Under the Advanced Cables Business Combination arrangements  if so approved  it is intended thatDCAC Ordinary Shares are to be issued at GBP 11.50 per Share.As of today 20th February 2023  GBP 69 446 789 of tenders have been or are in the process of beingsettled  all at a price of GBP 10.789 per share.The repurchased DCAC Ordinary Shares will be held as Treasury Shares  pending prospective reissueunder the Advanced Cables Business Combination. The Company confirms that  once these repurchaseshave been settled  the Company will have 64% of its share capital outstanding in public hands.Stub Tender OfferShareholders contemplating submitting tenders under the Stub Tender Offer should bear the Company’sprogress in mind when making their decisions.The maximum price on offer under the Stub Tender Offer is £2.20 per DCAC Ordinary Share  whichcompares to the last trading price of £10.00 per DCAC Ordinary Share  the Repurchase Offer price of£10.789 per DCAC Ordinary Share; and now the in principle agreement to issue DCAC Ordinary Sharesat £11.50 per DCAC Ordinary Shares.The estimated Net Asset Value as at 15th Feb 2023 was £10.27 per DCAC Ordinary Share.Accompanying Stub WarrantsShareholders contemplating submitting tenders of the accompanying Warrants under the Stub TenderOffer should bear the Company’s progress in mind when making their decisions.As under the Advanced Cables Business Combination arrangements  if so approved  it is intended thatDCAC Ordinary Shares be issued at GBP 11.50 per Share  being equivalent to the Warrant exercise price it is likely that the Warrants will trade at a level reflecting an ‘at the money’ option with 5 years maturity.Whilst it is difficult to predict this trading level with any certainty  it may be a multiple of the value beingoffered under the Stub Tender Offer.AdvisersDCAC has invited JP Morgan to act as adviser to the proposals. This invitation is being examinedand may or may not be accepted.Advanced Cables already has in place a full suite of advisers  including Afry  Red Penguin  and Aecom.Possible fallback Business CombinationIn the light of the experience with Saxo Bank and the inevitable uncertainties around closing theAdvanced Cables transaction  DCAC continues to be in discussions on undertaking a BusinessCombination with a target business operating in the financial services sector. Both targets haveheadquarters and principal operations in Western and/or Northern Europe.We recommend that shareholders take careful heed of the positive impact these proposals may bringto the Company; and DCAC looks forward to being in contact with further information.Edmund TruellCEO  DCACAbout DCACDCAC is a special purpose acquisition company incorporated on 29 April 2021 under the CompaniesLaw as a non-cellular company limited by shares.

The Board's proposal concerning Item 10 on the agenda The Board proposes that a dividend of SEK 16.00 per share be paid. The Board proposes that the dividend date of record be Thursday  30 March 2023. Provided the Annual General Meeting resolves in favour of the proposal  the dividend should be distributed by Euroclear Sweden on Tuesday  4 April 2023. The Board's proposal concerning Item 17 on the agenda The Board proposes that the following guidelines be adopted for determining the salary and other remuneration of the CEO and senior executives  i.e. the business area managers and heads of Group staffs reporting directly to the CEO. The guidelines replace the guidelines decided by the annual general meeting in 2020 and must be applied to compensation agreed upon after the guidelines are adopted by the annual general meeting in 2023. The guidelines do not cover compensation decided by the general meeting. The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategi  long-term interests and sustainability Holmen's strategy is to own and add value to the forest. Holmen's forest holdings form the basis of the business in which the raw material grows and is refined into everything from wood products for climate-smart building to renewable packaging  magazines and books  using energy that largely comes from its own hydro and wind power. Successful implementation of the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability requires the company to be able to attract the right employees. This guideline is intended to provide Holmen with the conditions to recruit and retain skilled employees and ensure that remuneration and other terms are consistent. The forms of compensation In the company  long-term share-related incentive programs are established from time to time. These are decided by the general meeting and are therefore not covered by these guidelines. For more information on these please refer to www.holmen.com Remuneration to senior executives must be market-based and competitive in the market in which the executive operates and be related to the executive's responsibilities  authority  and performance. Remuneration may consist of fixed salary  variable remuneration  other benefits  and pension. Variable remuneration shall aim to motivate and reward value-creating efforts that support the company's business strategy  sustainability  and long-term interests. The variable compensation must be calculated on outcomes in relation to measurable goals and not exceed 50% of the fixed annual salary. Fulfilment of criteria for the payment of variable remuneration must under normal circumstances be possible to measure annually. Other benefits may include  healthcare insurance  housing benefit and car benefit. Such benefits shall  where they occur  constitute a maximum of 10% of the fixed salary. The retirement age shall normally be 65 years. The pension benefit paid shall be premium-based and normally amount to 30% of the fixed salary. Notice and severance pay The period of notice shall be six months  whether at the initiative of the company or the employee. In the event of notice being given by the company  severance pay can amount to no more than 18 months' salary. Consideration of salary and employment terms for other employees In formulating its proposals for these remuneration guidelines  the Board has taken into account salaries and employment terms of the company's other employees  by including information about employees' total remuneration  the components of such remuneration and the increase in remuneration and the rate of increase over time  which have constituted part of the basis for decisions in evaluating the reasonableness of these guidelines. Decision-making process for establishing  reviewing and implementing the guidelines The Board has established a remuneration committee. The committee's duties include preparing the Board's decision on proposed remuneration guidelines for senior management. Under Chapter 8  § 51 of the Swedish Companies Act  the Board must propose new guidelines at least every four years and put such proposal to the Annual General Meeting. The remuneration committee shall also monitor and evaluate the application of the guideline and applicable remuneration structures and levels in the company. Members of the remuneration committee must be independent in relation to the company and its senior management. The CEO and other members of senior management do not attend the Board's discussion of and decisions on remuneration-related matters if such matters relate to them. Deviation from the guidelines The Board may decide to temporarily deviate from the guidelines in full or in part if  in an individual case  there are particular reasons for doing so and the deviation is necessary in the long-term interests of the company  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability. Significant amendments to the guidelines 2023 In the 2023 review of these guidelines  forms and limitations for variable compensation have been regulated  otherwise no significant changes have been implemented. Shareholders have not submitted comments on the previous version of the guidelines. Board proposal concerning Item 18 on the agenda The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting approve the authorisation of the Board to take decisions on the acquisition of the company's own shares as follows. Acquisitions may take place over the period until the next Annual General Meeting  on one or more occasions. Class B shares may only be acquired to the extent that the company's own shareholding does not exceed 10 per cent of all shares in the company at any time. The share purchases shall be transacted via Nasdaq Stockholm within the prevailing applicable range of prices (spread). The Board further proposes that it be mandated by the Annual General Meeting to make decisions between now and the next Annual General Meeting to use the company's holding of its own shares as payment in connection with the acquisition of companies or lines of business or to finance such acquisitions  in which case the shares may also be sold via Nasdaq Stockholm. In other respects  the following conditions shall apply. Such mandate may be used on one or more occasions before the 2021 Annual General Meeting. All company class B shares held by the company at the point of the Board's decision may be transferred. The mandate includes the right to decide to depart from shareholders' preferential rights. The transfer of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm shall take place within the prevailing applicable range of prices (spread). For share transfers outside Nasdaq Stockholm  payment will be possible in cash  with payment in kind or through offset  and the price shall correspond to an assessed market value at the time of such transfer. The purpose of the mandates for repurchases and transfers of own shares  and the reason for deviation from shareholders' preferential rights  is to give the company the opportunity to use treasury shares to finance or pay for  without delay and in a flexible  cost-effective manner  acquisitions of companies or business operations. The purpose of the mandate to repurchase shares in the company is also to enable the Board to adjust the capital structure  thereby generating a higher value for shareholders. Approval of the proposal requires shareholders representing a minimum of two-thirds of both votes cast and shares represented at the Annual General Meeting to support the resolution. Information at the meeting If a shareholder so requests  and the Board deems that it can meet the request without causing material damage to the Company  the Board and the CEO shall provide information about any circumstances that might affect the assessment of an item on the agenda and any circumstances that might affect the assessment of the Company's or its subsidiaries' financial position  or the Company's relationship with another Group company.

18903,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-accepts-valneva-chikungunya-vaccine-060000272.html,FDA Accepts Valneva’s Chikungunya Vaccine License Application for Priority Review,Saint-Herblain (France)  February 20  2023 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today announced that the U.S. Food ...,VALNEVASaint-Herblain (France)  February 20  2023 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has completed a filing review of its Biologics License Application for Valneva’s single-shot chikungunya vaccine candidate VLA1553 and has determined that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. The review classification is Priority.VLA1553 has been assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) review goal date at the end of August 2023  which is the date by which the FDA intends to take action on the application. The FDA’s acknowledgement of filing does not mean that a license will be granted  nor does it represent any evaluation of the adequacy of the data submitted.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat. As of July 2022  there were more than 3 million reported cases in the Americas1 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after three to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. It is estimated that over three quarters of the world’s population live in areas at-risk of CHIKV transmission2. High risk areas of infection are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are currently endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 100 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15533. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20194  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 20225  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20226 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 20227.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to commercialize three vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against the chikungunya virus and Lyme disease.Valneva Investor and Media ContactsLaetitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to the progress  timing  results and completion of research  development and clinical trials for product candidates  to regulatory approval of product candidates and review of existing products.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM)/(Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that the first patient has been enrolled in its Phase III clinical trial (NCT05438407) evaluating the investigational drug leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor  in children with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS). There is currently no approved treatment for this complex and progressive disease caused by genetic variants.Pharming Group N.V. LogoAt sites in the United States  Europe  and Japan  the single-arm  open-label  multinational clinical trial will evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of leniolisib in approximately 15 children aged 4 to 11 years who have a confirmed APDS diagnosis. The study's primary efficacy endpoints are a reduction in index lymph node size and an increased proportion of naïve B cells out of total B cells from baseline at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints include an assessment of the ability of leniolisib to modify health-related quality of life based on measures of physical  social  emotional  and school functioning using a validated patient questionnaire.Pharming plans to initiate a similar clinical trial in the third quarter of 2023 that will include children aged 1 to 6 years  with APDS  to evaluate a new pediatric formulation of leniolisib. Eligible patients enrolled in either of the pediatric trials will continue to receive leniolisib for a year after the initial 12-week treatment period through an open-label extension trial.Manish Butte  MD  PhD  E. Richard Stiehm Endowed Chair  Professor with tenure in the Department of Pediatrics  and Division Chief of Immunology  Allergy  and Rheumatology at UCLA  commented:""In treating APDS  the current standard of care is to use an array of supportive therapies. While these therapies can treat some of the manifestations of APDS  they do not target the underlying cause of the disease. Pharming's studies of leniolisib in children with APDS are important for evaluating the possibility of minimizing symptoms earlier in the disease progression.""Story continuesPharming's program for the clinical development of leniolisib in pediatric APDS is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III clinical trial that investigated the drug as a treatment for patients with the disease aged 12 years and older. As announced on February 2  2022  and recently detailed in Blood1  the international medical journal of the American Society of Hematology  the trial met both its co-primary endpoints  with patients who took leniolisib versus placebo achieving significant reductions in lymphoproliferation as measured by index lymph node size and increases in immunophenotype corrections as measured by the percentage of naïve B cells in peripheral blood.During the first half of 2022  positive opinions were received from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on the Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in children. The PIP(s) included the plans for both pediatric clinical trials.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""I am pleased we have initiated the first trial in our Phase III pediatric clinical program evaluating leniolisib in children with APDS  and I look forward to our second pediatric trial getting underway. Building on the encouraging findings from our successful Phase II/III study in patients aged 12 years and older with APDS  we are committed to bringing leniolisib to even younger patients with the goal of intervening before they develop immune-related symptoms likely to progress throughout their lives. While continuing to focus on patients of all ages with APDS  we are dedicated to collaborating with regulatory authorities with the goal of generating regulatory filings to gain approval that could support the treatment of children under 12 years of age who are living with this disease.""Based on the Phase II/III trial results and long-term open-label extension data  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is conducting a priority review of Pharming's New Drug Application for leniolisib as a treatment for adolescents and adults with APDS and has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 29  2023. In addition  Pharming's Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib in the same patient population is under evaluation by the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Pharming expects that the CHMP will issue its opinion on the leniolisib MAA in 2H 2023.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.2 3 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.2 4 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.5 6 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.7 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.5-8 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3Kδ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterd…","The multinational Phase III study is evaluating leniolisib tablets in children aged 4 to 11 years with APDS  a rare primary immunodeficiencyLEIDEN  Netherlands  Feb. 21  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM)/(Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that the first patient has been enrolled in its Phase III clinical trial (NCT05438407) evaluating the investigational drug leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor  in children with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS). There is currently no approved treatment for this complex and progressive disease caused by genetic variants.At sites in the United States  Europe  and Japan  the single-arm  open-label  multinational clinical trial will evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of leniolisib in approximately 15 children aged 4 to 11 years who have a confirmed APDS diagnosis. The study's primary efficacy endpoints are a reduction in index lymph node size and an increased proportion of naïve B cells out of total B cells from baseline at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints include an assessment of the ability of leniolisib to modify health-related quality of life based on measures of physical  social  emotional  and school functioning using a validated patient questionnaire.Pharming plans to initiate a similar clinical trial in the third quarter of 2023 that will include children aged 1 to 6 years  with APDS  to evaluate a new pediatric formulation of leniolisib. Eligible patients enrolled in either of the pediatric trials will continue to receive leniolisib for a year after the initial 12-week treatment period through an open-label extension trial.Manish Butte  MD  PhD  E. Richard Stiehm Endowed Chair  Professor with tenure in the Department of Pediatrics  and Division Chief of Immunology  Allergy  and Rheumatology at UCLA  commented:""In treating APDS  the current standard of care is to use an array of supportive therapies. While these therapies can treat some of the manifestations of APDS  they do not target the underlying cause of the disease. Pharming's studies of leniolisib in children with APDS are important for evaluating the possibility of minimizing symptoms earlier in the disease progression.""Pharming's program for the clinical development of leniolisib in pediatric APDS is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III clinical trial that investigated the drug as a treatment for patients with the disease aged 12 years and older. As announced on February 2  2022  and recently detailed in Blood1  the international medical journal of the American Society of Hematology  the trial met both its co-primary endpoints  with patients who took leniolisib versus placebo achieving significant reductions in lymphoproliferation as measured by index lymph node size and increases in immunophenotype corrections as measured by the percentage of naïve B cells in peripheral blood.During the first half of 2022  positive opinions were received from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on the Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in children. The PIP(s) included the plans for both pediatric clinical trials.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""I am pleased we have initiated the first trial in our Phase III pediatric clinical program evaluating leniolisib in children with APDS  and I look forward to our second pediatric trial getting underway. Building on the encouraging findings from our successful Phase II/III study in patients aged 12 years and older with APDS  we are committed to bringing leniolisib to even younger patients with the goal of intervening before they develop immune-related symptoms likely to progress throughout their lives. While continuing to focus on patients of all ages with APDS  we are dedicated to collaborating with regulatory authorities with the goal of generating regulatory filings to gain approval that could support the treatment of children under 12 years of age who are living with this disease.""Based on the Phase II/III trial results and long-term open-label extension data  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is conducting a priority review of Pharming's New Drug Application for leniolisib as a treatment for adolescents and adults with APDS and has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 29  2023. In addition  Pharming's Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib in the same patient population is under evaluation by the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Pharming expects that the CHMP will issue its opinion on the leniolisib MAA in 2H 2023.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.2 3 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.2 4 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.5 6 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.7 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.5-8 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3Kδ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

The subscription to this issue  which is part of the Sustainable Financing Framework  began on 10 February 2023  and very…,"Tuesday  February 21  2023The 8th of February was the first opportunity to subscribe to a green retail bond. The subscription to this issue  which is part of the Sustainable Financing Framework  began on 10 February 2023  and very quickly proved to be a success with investors. The targeted 250 million euros was raised in barely a day and the funds will be used in the years ahead to finance numerous existing and new sustainable projects of the group. Today marks a final milestone in the effective issue and the bonds are listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels for the first time. This was symbolically highlighted with the ringing of the bell on Euronext this morning.In recent years  the retail bond market has been less attractive because of the low to negative interest environment. Stefaan Vandamme  CFO Colruyt Group  explains: ""It was obvious to us that once the choice for a retail bond had been made  it would be linked to our sustainability strategy. The net proceeds of this green retail bond are used to finance green projects  such as the investment in clean transport  circular water management  renewable energy  sustainable renovation of buildings  etc. In this way  we want to continue to deliver on our long-term commitment to invest in a sustainable future."" Belfius Bank  BNP Paribas Fortis and KBC Bank acted as joint lead managers in the issue of the green retail bond.This issue is part of the Sustainable Financing Framework  which is the result of a unique collaboration between different teams within Colruyt Group  ranging from Sustainability and the businesses involved  to the Finance department and KBC as Sustainable Structuring Agent. This Sustainable Financing Frameworklays down the terms and conditions which according to the retail group should be met for a project to qualify for a sustainable label.Colruyt Group is always close to the customer. The idea of having the general public participate in green projects is not new to the retail group. Previous initiatives in this field include the establishment of Eoly Cooperation  which enables people to participate in the construction as well as the proceeds of onshore wind turbines and the public participation in offshore wind energy via NorthSeaWind a few years later. Since November 2022  customers have been able to save points by purchasing food products with Eco-score A and B ​ through their Xtra app and use them to help promote biodiversity.Through this green retail bond  Colruyt Group wanted to take this one step further and let the general public participate in the sustainability projects  receiving a fixed compensation in return. The low entry fee of EUR 1 000 made this accessible to many investors.A maximum of 60% of the raised funds will be used on green projects that were realised the past and current year. Stefaan Vandamme explains: ​ ""As described in theProspectus  this mainly concerns a refinancing of existing debts and it's a logical step in the further diversification of Colruyt Group's financial resources."" The remaining funds will be allocated to green projects that are in the pipeline in the coming years. These could include  for example  the further sustainability of Colruyt Group's buildings  sustainable water management  renewable energy  energy efficiency and the further development of initiatives such as the Eco-score.Increased transport sustainability is also part of the scope. By 2035  Colruyt Group wants all its freight transport to be zero-emission. It plans to do this through complementary technologies  both battery-electric vehicles and hydrogen-electric vehicles will be needed for the transition. The retail group actively engages in dialogue about this with the ecosystem of (transport) partners and suppliers it works closely with.Jef Colruyt  CEO Colruyt Group  adds: ""Such green retail bond is a great way for our stakeholders to co-invest - other than through shares - in our green projects and should be seen in the context of previous  recent and long-term investments. Its success gives us great pleasure and we'd like to thank all investors for their trust - it's a confirmation of our deliberate choice to follow a sustainable course. Together we're contributing to a greener future  which is something we very much believe in as a group."" Today marks a final milestone in the effective issue in that the settlement of the bonds has been finalised and the bond will be listed on Euronext for the first time. This was symbolically highlighted with the ringing of the bell on Euronext this morning.This initiative doesn't change anything to Colruyt Group's existing investment programme. In addition to the investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency  the group will continue to invest  among other things  in new stores  the expansion of the logistics capacity in Belgium and France (such as the new distribution centre in Ollignies for the non-food range in food stores and the new distribution centre near Dôle in France) and the expansion of production capacity in Belgium with a focus on vertical integration. Innovative change programmes and digital transition also remain a priority. Stefaan Vandamme  CFO Colruyt Group: ""We're going through some challenging times  but we remain true to our long-term vision and continue to invest in things that support this long-term strategy.""",neutral,0.48,0.51,0.0,mixed,0.66,0.09,0.25,True,English,"['Green retail bond fund raising', 'Colruyt Group', 'sustainable course', 'success', 'Confirmation', 'negative interest environment', 'circular water management', 'BNP Paribas Fortis', 'joint lead managers', 'onshore wind turbines', 'new distribution centre', 'Sustainable Financing Framework', 'Sustainable Structuring Agent', 'sustainable water management', 'low entry fee', 'offshore wind energy', 'green retail bond', 'retail bond market', 'new sustainable projects', 'existing investment programme', 'CFO Colruyt Group', 'CEO Colruyt Group', 'Increased transport sustainability', 'new stores', 'green projects', 'sustainable renovation', 'sustainable future', 'sustainable label', 'sustainable course', 'retail group', 'regulated market', 'low to', 'numerous existing', 'existing debts', 'clean transport', 'freight transport', 'transport) partners', 'Jef Colruyt', 'renewable energy', 'energy efficiency', 'first opportunity', '250 million euros', 'final milestone', 'first time', 'Stefaan Vandamme', 'long-term commitment', 'Belfius Bank', 'unique collaboration', 'different teams', 'Finance department', 'general public', 'Eoly Cooperation', 'public participation', 'food products', 'Xtra app', 'fixed compensation', 'current year', 'logical step', 'financial resources', 'complementary technologies', 'battery-electric vehicles', 'hydrogen-electric vehicles', 'previous, recent', 'great pleasure', 'greener future', 'other things', 'logistics capacity', 'non-food range', 'food stores', 'Dôle', 'production capacity', 'vertical integration', 'sustainability projects', 'sustainability strategy', 'recent years', 'coming years', 'net proceeds', 'KBC Bank', 'Previous initiatives', 'Eco-score A', 'great way', 'long-term investments', 'deliberate choice', 'effective issue', 'many investors', 'remaining funds', 'Euronext Brussels', 'Tuesday', 'February', 'subscription', 'success', 'bonds', 'ringing', 'bell', 'buildings', 'result', 'businesses', 'terms', 'conditions', 'customer', 'idea', 'field', 'establishment', 'people', 'construction', 'NorthSeaWind', 'November', 'points', 'biodiversity', 'return', 'maximum', 'past', 'refinancing', 'diversification', 'pipeline', 'example', 'development', 'scope', 'zero-emission', 'transition', 'dialogue', 'ecosystem', 'suppliers', 'stakeholders', 'shares', 'context', 'trust', 'confirmation', 'something', 'settlement', 'addition', 'expansion', 'Belgium', 'France', 'Ollignies', 'focus', 'Innova']",2023-02-21,2023-02-21,marketscreener.com

The Company recalls that this dilutive financing transaction is not the first it has put in place. »DOLFINES wishes  however  to recall the terms of its press release of February 16 in which it was stated: ""The financing of this operation will be covered by the ongoing financing of Negma which could consider a minority stake in DOLFINES  thus confirming its project to support the industrial development of the company over time.""The main features of this €2 million tranche of OCABSA are as follows:DOLFINES recalls having signed  on June 15  2021  a bond loan for a maximum amount of €36 million  in the form of OCABSA with a nominal value of €2 500 each  allowing immediate fundraising in increments of up to €2 000 000  by issuing 800 OCABSA for the benefit of NEGMA GROUP LTD.The bond issue will consist of a maximum of eighteen (18) tranches capped at €2 000 000 each  consisting of bonds convertible into shares (""OCAs"") to which warrants are attached. The Company will decide on the issuance of tranches at any time  it being specified that a period of forty-four (44) trading days must elapse between two tranches.The OCAs with a nominal value of 2 500 euros each will be subscribed at par and will have a maturity of twelve (12) months. At maturity  the OCAs will be converted by their holder into shares of the Company on the basis of a conversion ratio corresponding to 92% of the lowest VWAP (volume-weighted average share price) of the fifteen (15) trading days preceding the conversion date.The OCAs are not the subject of an application for admission to trading on the Euronext Growth market and consequently will not be listed.The number of warrants to be issued during each tranche draw will be equal to the number of OCAs issued divided by the exercise price of the BSA corresponding to 115% of the VWAP of the fifteen (15) trading days preceding the request for issue of the tranche concerned. The warrants are not transferable without the prior agreement of the Company. They shall not be the subject of an application for admission to trading on a regulated market. They may be exercised at any time from the date of issue and within 60 months of their issue.In 2022  DOLFINES drew 2 454 OCAs under this financing agreement  all converted into shares.On February 20  2023  DOLFINES again implemented this financing agreement and 800 OCAs were issued  accompanied by the issuance of warrants. The funds raised during the drawdown of this tranche of OCABSA will help finance the acquisition of an international expertise company on the EHS (Environment  Health and Safety) market  for which a Letter of Intent (LOI) and entry into exclusivity period whose purpose is the proposed acquisition of 100% of the capital and voting rights of this company was validated by the Board of Directors of DOLFINES on February 15  2023.This issue does not give rise to the issuance of a prospectus subject to the approval of the Autorité des marchés financiers.The table for tracking bond draws and conversions can be found on the DOLFINES www.dolfines.com website.About Dolfines: www.dolfines.comFounded in 2000  DOLFINES is an independent specialist in engineering and services in the renewable and conventional energy industry.

This year-on-year increase includes a favorable 3.6% currency effect and a 0.0% scope effect. On a like-for-like basis  total revenue was up 21.2%.In the fourth quarter  total revenue climbed 29.6% as reported and 26.3% like-for-like  marking a further acceleration compared with the first nine months of the year. Currency and scope effects were positive in the quarter  respectively adding 2.5% and 0.8% to total revenue.Operating revenue: €1 944 millionOperating revenue increased by 22.8% as reported to €1 944 million in 2022. This rise takes into account a favorable 3.7% currency effect and a 0.0% scope effect. On a like-for-like basis  operating revenue grew by 19.2% versus 2021.Fourth-quarter operating revenue totaled €569 million  up 25.8% as reported and up 22.3% like-for-like. These figures mark a further acceleration in business  reflecting Edenred’s ability to scale its platform advantage to step up market penetration and win new clients  particularly in the SME segment. Growth was notably driven by a solid performance from end-of-year gift card campaigns despite a high basis of comparison  and by the continued success of Beyond Fuel solutions.Operating revenue by business line(in € millions) 2022 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Employee Benefits 1 152 961 +19.9% +17.8% Fleet & Mobility Solutions 539 414 +30.2% +23.5% Complementary Solutions 253 208 +21.6% +16.9% Total 1 944 1 583 +22.8% +19.2%(in € millions) Fourth-quarter 2022 Fourth-quarter 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Employee Benefits 349 279 +25.4% +23.1% Fleet & Mobility Solutions 144 114 +26.2% +22.4% Complementary Solutions 77 61 +26.5% +18.1% Total 569 454 +25.8% +22.3%The Employee Benefits business line generated €1 152 million in operating revenue in 2022  representing an increase of 19.9% as reported (+17.8% like-for-like) and accounting for 59% of Group operating revenue.This strong growth reflects the good business momentum and the continued success of the digital Ticket Restaurant® offering among both large corporate accounts and SMEs  a segment that remains largely untapped with a penetration rate three to five times lower on average than that of large corporates. It also reflects the impact of companies’ starting to use the higher maximum face values set by law  enabling them to protect their employees’ purchasing power.In addition to meal vouchers  Edenred also benefited from the draw of its Beyond Food solutions. These solutions are particularly suited to companies seeking to boost employee engagement  especially amid today’s reduced purchasing power and war for talent. In September 2022 in France  for example  Edenred partnered with Betterway  a pioneer in corporate sustainable mobility  in order to harness the potential offered by this market. This strategic partnership  consolidated in late 2022 by Edenred’s contributions to the company’s capital increase  will enable the two partners to jointly offer the Mobility Pass  a solution that covers all employer subsidies for employee commutes (sustainable mobility  public transportation and fuel allowances).In the fourth quarter  operating revenue for Employee Benefits amounted to €349 million  up 25.4% as reported (+23.1% like-for-like) compared with the same period in 2021. This performance mainly reflects an excellent end-of-year gift card campaign despite a high basis of comparison  along with the enhanced attractiveness of Edenred’s solutions in the current macroeconomic context.In the Fleet & Mobility Solutions business line  which accounted for 28% of the Group’s business  operating revenue came to €539 million in 2022  up 30.2% as reported over the period (+23.5% like-for-like).This performance reflects the success of the Beyond Fuel strategy in both Europe and Latin America  notably driven by the attractiveness of maintenance and toll solutions. In February 2022 as part of this strategy  Edenred acquired Greenpass  an issuer of electronic toll solutions in Brazil  with the aim of accelerating its development in a fast-growing market with significant cross-selling potential. The business line also benefited from strong commercial momentum in the underpenetrated SME segment  reporting a 21% increase in the number of new contracts signed over the year  driven by the relevance of the Group’s digital  multi-product offering.During the year Edenred also expanded its solutions for fleet managers  joining forces with ChargePoint  a leading electric vehicle charging network provider in Europe and the United States. Thanks to this partnership  UTA Edenred can support fleet managers in the transition to electric vehicle usage by giving them access to over 400 000 public electric charge points across 33 European countries through an all-in-one solution.In the fourth quarter  Fleet & Mobility Solutions operating revenue came to €144 million  up 26.2% as reported (+22.4% like-for-like) compared with 2021.Complementary Solutions  which includes Corporate Payment Services  Incentive & Rewards and Public Social Programs  generated operating revenue of €253 million in 2022  representing 13% of the Group total. This business line grew by 21.6% year-on-year as reported (+16.9% like-for-like).This performance reflects good commercial dynamism in Corporate Payment Services in North America operated through Edenred CSI  spurred by new contract wins in segments into which the company has recently expanded  such as property management. In addition  Edenred CSI rounded out its corporate payment offering in the United States in October 2022 with the acquisition of IPS  a leader in invoice automation.Complementary Solutions’ performance also reflects the continued success of the Group’s innovative programs  such as Benefit Xpress in Taiwan and the new value-added services accessible via the C3Pay mobile app in the United Arab Emirates.In the fourth quarter  Complementary Solutions delivered operating revenue of €77 million  a rise of 26.5% as reported (+18.1% like-for-like) versus 2021 despite a high basis of comparison.Operating revenue by region(in € millions) 2022 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Europe 1 189 1 010 +17.7% +17.7% Latin America 603 452 +33.6% +18.7% Rest of the World 152 121 +25.2% +32.7% Total 1 944 1 583 +22.8% +19.2%(in € millions) Fourth-quarter 2022 Fourth-quarter 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Europe 355 294 +20.7% +21.1% Latin America 172 128 +34.3% +20.5% Rest of the World 42 31 +38.1% +40.5% Total 569 454 +25.8% +22.3%In Europe   operating revenue amounted to €1 189 million in 2022  an increase of 17.7% both as reported and like-for-like. Europe represented 61% of Group operating revenue. In the fourth quarter  operating revenue was up 20.7% as reported and 21.1% like-for-like.In France  operating revenue amounted to €315 million in 2022  an increase of 10.2% as reported and like-for-like  including growth of 9.8% in the fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter growth was driven by an acceleration in Employee Benefits solutions  as the digital Ticket Restaurant® benefit continued to attract many clients among large corporate accounts and SMEs. Performance was also fueled by the success of Beyond Food solutions and particularly the employee engagement platform ProwebCE  the leading solution for works councils in France  with 13 000 clients and nearly 7 million employees able to access deals from 2 000 partners. This strong momentum was further enhanced by the acquisition of Enjoy Mon CSE in September 2022.Operating revenue in Europe excluding France totaled €874 million in 2022  up 20.7% as reported and like-for-like. Fourth-quarter operating revenue for the region rose by 25.3% as reported (+25.7% like-for-like)  lifted in particular by a very good performance in Employee Benefits. This is the result of the strong traction enjoyed by the digital Ticket Restaurant® offering. It also reflects the enhanced attractiveness of Beyond Food solutions  illustrated by the success of the multi-benefit  single-card offering developed in several countries (including Belgium  Portugal and Finland) and the end-of-year gift card campaign.The region’s performance also reflects robust growth in Edenred’s Fleet & Mobility Solutions thanks to the continued deployment of its Beyond Fuel strategy  as well as its agility in adapting to the changing needs of its clients  as illustrated by the new partnership with Chargepoint in April 2022.Operating revenue amounted to €603 million in Latin America in 2022  up 33.6% as reported (+18.7% like-for-like). The region accounted for 31% of consolidated operating revenue in 2022. In the fourth quarter  operating revenue increased by 34.3% as reported (+20.5% like-for-like).In Brazil  operating revenue rose by 16.7% like-for-like in 2022 versus 2021. Fourth-quarter operating revenue climbed 16.5% like-for-like. This robust growth reflects a very good performance in Employee Benefits spurred by the success of the Ticket Superflex multi-benefit offering and the growing contribution of the Itaú partnership in the SME segment. Performance was also driven by Fleet & Mobility Solutions  thanks to strong business momentum in the SME segment and the ongoing success of the Beyond Fuel strategy  with maintenance and toll solutions continuing to prove extremely popular with fleet managers.In Hispanic Latin America  operating revenue climbed 23.0% like-for-like in 2022. Fourth-quarter operating revenue advanced 29.0% like-for-like  reflecting both accelerating growth in Employee Benefits solutions and another good performance from Fleet & Mobility Solutions.In the Rest of the World   operating revenue amounted to €152 million  up 25.2% as reported and up 32.7% like-for-like over the period. This very good performance was notably driven by robust business momentum for Edenred CSI’s Corporate Payment Services  illustrated by the 38% year-on-year increase in virtual cards issued in 2022. Fourth-quarter operating revenue rose by 38.1% as reported (+40.5% like-for-like).Other revenue: €87 millionOther revenue represented €87 million in 2022  a rise of 96.1% as reported (+95.5% like-for-like). In the fourth quarter  other revenue totaled €33 million  up 172.0% as reported (+174.9% like-for-like). This significant increase reflects the impact of business growth on the float4  as well as favorable changes in interest rates in all regions where the Group operates  with a gradual acceleration quarter after quarter. This results from the steady rise in interest rates observed for several quarters now in Latin America and Europe (outside the euro zone)  and from the more recent increase in the euro zone.Record EBITDA: €836 millionEBITDA came in at an all-time high of €836 million in 2022  [at the top end of the range announced in October 20225]  delivering record growth of 24.9% as reported and of 23.3% like-for-like.The EBITDA margin was 0.7 percentage point higher like-for-like  at 41.2%. Edenred kept a tight rein on operating expenses while accelerating spending on innovation and technology to fuel its future growth  illustrating its operating leverage. Edenred also benefited from the contribution of other revenue.Net profit: €386 millionNet profit  Group share came in at €386 million  up 23.3% in line with the growth in EBITDA.Net profit takes into account other income and expenses for a net expense of €30 million (versus a net expense of €33 million in 2021)  a net financial expense of €54 million (versus €19 million in 2021)6  a net income tax expense of €188 million (versus €151 million in 2021)  and €(31) million attributable to non-controlling interests (versus €(30) million in 2021).Strong cash flow generationEdenred leveraged its strongly cash generative business model to deliver record-high funds from operations before other income and expenses (FFO) of €673 million in 2022  up 21% as reported.In 2022  Edenred continued to invest in its platform to fuel the Group’s sustainable and profitable growth and lengthen its technology lead. Capital expenditure in 2022 amounted to €151 million  or 7.4% of Group total revenue  in line with the 7%-8% expected under the Beyond 22-25 plan.In all  free cash flow was a record €881 million in 2022  lifted by the increase in the float – notably due to the good fourth-quarter performance – and by the positive impact of regulatory changes affecting the Ticket City product in Germany  for which the related cash was considered as restricted until January 1  2022. Excluding the one-off impact of this change in regulations  free cash flow would have amounted to €711 million for 2022  compared with €518 million for 2021  with a free cash flowithEBITDA conversion rate of 85% versus 77% in the previous year.Even stronger financial positionAt December 31  2022  Edenred had net debt of €307 million  versus €816 million at December 31  2021. This sharp year-on-year decrease in net debt notably reflects free cash flow generation of €881 million over 2022  €240 million returned to shareholders  and a €43 million negative impact from currency effects and non-recurring items.The Group’s net debt/EBITDA ratio therefore stood at 0.4x in 2022  versus 1.2x in 2021.Edenred enjoys a robust financial position with a high level of liquidity and a solid balance sheet. In April 2022  Standard & Poor’s affirmed the Group’s BBB+ Strong Investment Grade rating and upgraded its outlook from stable to positive.The cost of the Group’s debt was 2.2% in 2022 versus 0.7% in the prior year  a rise of 1.5 percentage points notably due to higher interest rates in the euro zone.Commitment to ESG and extra-financial performanceThroughout 2022  Edenred continued to implement its corporate social responsibility policy  “Ideal”  which is aimed at improving quality of life (People)  protecting the environment (Planet) and creating value ethically and responsibly (Progress). The Group exceeded its extra-financial objectives for 2022. Under the People component  for example  33% of executive positions are now held by women (2 points above target). Regarding its Planet goals  greenhouse gas emissions intensity has been reduced by 51% since 2013 (compared with the 36% target). Lastly  regarding the Progress pillar  58% of users and merchants have now been made aware of balanced nutrition and food waste (against a target of 52%).Moreover  the Group is increasingly recognized for its commitment to environmental  social and governance (ESG) practices. In September 2022  for example  Edenred joined the Paris stock exchange’s Euronext CAC 40 ESG index  taking its place alongside other companies demonstrating ESG best practices.Over the long term  Edenred confirms that it will step up its ESG commitments  as announced at its Capital Markets Day in October 2022. At this event  the Group placed ESG at the heart of its Beyond 22-25 plan  committing to net zero carbon by 2050 in line with SBTi targets7 and stepping up the objectives of its “Ideal” CSR policy  with the aim of cementing its status as an employer of choice and a trustworthy Tech for Good company through its solutions that encourage more virtuous and responsible behaviors.€1.00 dividend proposed for 2022Edenred is proposing a dividend of €1.00 per share for 2022  representing an 11% increase compared with the prior year  in line with the Group’s policy of progressive dividend growth. This dividend will be submitted to shareholders for approval at Edenred’s Combined General Meeting on May 11  2023. Payment of the dividend will be made solely in cash.Dividend payment schedule:June 7  2023: Ex-date.June 8  2023: Record date.June 9  2023: Dividend payment date.OUTLOOKOn the strength of its record-breaking 2022 performance  the Group is confident as it moves into 2023  and expects to see continued strong business growth in all regions and all business lines.2023 will continue to be shaped by structural trends such as changes in the working world and the start of a new era of mobility coupled with global ecosystem digitization. Against this backdrop  the Group will push ahead with scaling its unique platform advantage  deploying its Beyond 22-25 strategic plan with three priorities:Scale the Core: grow further in its existing markets  which are still largely underpenetrated  notably by capitalizing on a segmented go-to-market strategy  and cross-selling and up-selling in its client portfolio;Extend Beyond: accelerate the Beyond Food  Beyond Fuel and Beyond Payment strategies by launching and deploying more value-added services for its clients  partner merchants and users;Expand in New Businesses: expand into promising new geographies.While the economic environment remains relatively uncertain  Edenred continues to benefit from the increased attractiveness of its solutions amid reduced purchasing power  a talent war  and the need for better control of fleet expenses.Boasting low leverage and high cash flow generation  Edenred will continue to invest in order to strengthen its technology leadership and fuel its innovation strategy. Edenred also plans to seize external growth opportunities to support the three development priorities of its Beyond 22 - 25 plan in each of its business lines  boosted by more than €2 billion in M&A fire power.Lastly  Edenred confirms the targets set out in its new Beyond 22-25 strategic plan for 2023  namely:Like-for-like EBITDA growth >+12%Free cash flowithEBITDA conversion rate >70%8SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTEREdenred expands its Corporate Payment invoice automation capabilities in the US  with the acquisition of IPSEdenred announced the acquisition of IPS  a leading invoice automation vendor  through its corporate payment subsidiary Edenred CSI. This acquisition enhances Edenred CSI’s value proposition by expanding along the procure-to-pay value chain and integrating a turnkey invoice automation solution into its digital platform.By combining suppliers’ invoice processing and payment automation  Edenred CSI clients will have access to an end-to-end integrated solution that further simplifies and streamlines the management of the entire accounts payable process.Edenred presents Beyond 22-25   its new strategic plan through 2025  to coincide with its Capital Markets Day on October 25  2022In an environment shaped by accelerating new structural trends such as changes in the working world  a new era of mobility and global ecosystem digitization  Edenred aims to become the global platform of choice at work in larger markets.Edenred operates in markets that are still largely underpenetrated and that therefore harbor considerable growth opportunities  reinforced by widespread adoption of new behaviors. Against this backdrop  the Group intends to leverage to the full its unique global platform advantage by developing a common approach in each of its business lines based on three priorities: Scale the Core  Extend Beyond and Expand in New Businesses.The Beyond 22-25 strategic plan will drive sustainable and profitable growth and generate high levels of free cash flow over the 2022-2025 period. Edenred has also placed ESG at the heart of its Beyond 22-25 plan  announcing an acceleration in its extra-financial commitments  including a commitment to net zero carbon by 2050 in line with SBTi targets.Edenred acquires a stake in Betterway to accelerate the development of sustainable corporate mobilityEdenred announced that it had acquired a €4 million stake in Betterway  a pioneer in corporate mobility passes.

Our particularly strong revenue growth and commercial momentum clearly demonstrate the full benefit of Ingenico combination  despite us being only half-way through our four-year integration plan. It also highlights improvement of our profitability rate and solid free cash flow generation  despite the inflationary environment.In parallel to this strong operational performance  we executed our strategic roadmap with the disposal of TSS  simplifying our group structure and significantly deleveraging our balance sheet. We also continued to actively participate to the European market consolidation and to expand our Merchant Services business in attractive geographies. In line with our product strategy  we further enriched the Worldline value proposition through targeted acquisitions of technological companies on the marketplaces vertical and the micro-merchant segment.Last  but not least  supported by our Trust 2025 program  we continued to make significant progress towards our 2025 targets in all CSR dimensions as is also reflected by tier-one external recognitions and ratings.Story continuesBased on this strong 2022 year  the Group reaffirms its 2024 ambition as well as its strategic project to establish itself as a premium global Paytech and the leading consolidator of the European payment industry.”2022 key figuresWorldline’s FY 2022 revenue reached € 4 364 million  representing a strong +10.7% revenue organic growth  above the objective to reach 8% to 10% revenue organic growth in 2022. This achievement was reached by a solid growth in Merchant Services reflecting the widespread and rapid shift towards digital payments as well as the Group’s strong positioning following the acquisition of Ingenico. The Global Business Unit represented 70% of the total Group revenue in 2022. Mobility & e-Transactional Services (8% of 2022 Group revenue) also contributed to growth  delivering a strong +7.3% organic growth over the year thanks to several major projects and the recovery of the public transport sector. Financial Services (22% of 2022 Group revenue) were up by +2.5% in 2022 with solid revenue flows partly compensating the temporary impact from the price decrease conceded by the Group for the renewals of historical large contracts of Equens end of 2021.Reaching € 1 133 million in 2022  the Group’s Operating Margin before Depreciation and Amortization (OMDA) was up by +15.7% at constant scope and exchange rates in 2022. It represented 26.0% of revenue  an organic improvement by +110 basis points  in line with the objective of the year.In € million FY 2022 FY 2021* Change Revenue* 4 364 3 942 +10.7% OMDA* 1 133 979 +15.7% % of revenue 26.0% 24.8% +110 bps Net income Group share 299 -751 Net income Group share from continued operations 211 191 +10.3% % of statutory revenue from continued operations 4.8% 5.2% -40 bps Normalized net income Group share from continued operations 545 440 +23.8% % of statutory revenue from continued operations 12.5% 11.9% +60 bps Normalized basic EPS Group share from continued operations 1.94 1.57 +23.4% Normalized diluted EPS Group share from continued operations 1.88 1.53 +22.9% Free cash flow 520 414 +25.5% OMDA to FCF conversion rate** 45.9% 44.3% +150 bps Closing net debt 2 202 3 126* at constant scope and exchange rates** FY 2021 conversion rate calculated on FY 2021 statutory OMDA from continued operationsNet income Group share from continued operations amounted to € 211 million  increasing by +10.3%.

On a dilutive basis  it was up +22.9% to € 1.88.Free cash flow reached € 520 million in 2022  up by +25.5% compared to 2021  representing a 45.9% cash conversion of OMDA (free cash flow divided by OMDA)  above the objective of the year to reach circa 45%.Group Net debt amounted to € 2 202 million at the end of the year  representing a Group leverage ratio at 1.9x OMDA. Decrease of Group net debt in 2022 resulted from the free cash flow generated over the year  the cash-in of c. € 1.1 billion net proceeds of the TSS disposal as well as the cash-out for the acquisitions closed in 2022.Including the additional € 297 million net proceeds of the TSS disposal received on January 1st  2023 as announced  the proforma net debt end of 2022 would be € 1 905 million  representing a Group leverage ratio at 1.7x OMDA.Q4 2022 revenue by Global Business LineIn € million Q4 2022 Q4 2021* Organic change Merchant Services 835 757 +10.3% Financial Services 260 252 +2.9% Mobility & e-Transactional Services 92 86 +7.0% Worldline 1 186 1 095 +8.3%* at constant scope and exchange ratesWorldline’s Q4 2022 revenue reached € 1 186 million  representing a +8.3% organic growth. This achievement was notably reached thanks to the strong commercial dynamics in Merchant Services which posted a +10.3% revenue organic growth  fueled by market share gains and volumes growth. Mobility & e-Transactional Services also contributed to growth with a positive underlying trend reflected in a +7.0% organic growth rate. Financial Services showed  as expected  a sequential improvement compared to Q3 2022 with +2.9% organic growth.Merchant ServicesMerchant Services’ revenue in Q4 2022 reached € 835 million  representing a solid organic growth of +10.3%  led by a strong commercial momentum and a steady growth in acquiring transaction volumes  up +13% year-on-year (+28% vs. Q4 2019). By division  the growth was mainly led by:Commercial Acquiring showed a high-teens organic growth with almost all geographies and customer segments contributing  in particular SMBs and international brands;Payment Acceptance grew at a low single digit rate  led by Global Sales & Vertical and digital customers with the recovery from the Travel vertical partly compensating for the stop of the Russian online corridor. Excluding this effect  Payment Acceptance activities would have been up low teens organically in Q4 2022; and Digital Services delivered a low single digit organic growth rate with a strong performance at PAYONE compensating for delay in the roll-out of digital products in the digital healthcare market in Germany.During the fourth quarter of the year  commercial activity in Merchant Services has been strong with numerous wins for both Commercial Acquiring and Payment Acceptance  in-store and online with new client wins and upsells with clients such as  among others  Wizz  Voidu  Rebtel  WEAT  Système U  Joom  Club Med  or Olimpia Parking.Financial ServicesQ4 2022 was still partially impacted by the price decrease on the large contracts with former Equens’ shareholders. Nevertheless  Financial Services performance was in line with the trajectory expected for the full year and showed sequential improvement versus Q3 2022. The continued improving trend of volumes and new commercial developments led to a +2.9% organic growth with € 260 million revenue.All divisions contributed to the organic growth:Card-based payment processing activities (Issuing Processing and Acquiring Processing altogether) organic growth benefited from a reduced effect of the price decrease on large contracts and was driven by good dynamics and improved transaction volumes in Belgium  the Netherlands and in the DACH area  which more than offset the performance in Germany impacted by a high comparable basis;Account Payments organic growth came from volume increase in Germany as well as good level of activities in the Netherlands compensating for volumes stabilization and less project on large contracts now in run phase;Digital Banking positive trend was driven by solid volumes and project activity in Belgium as well as in the DACH region. The situation in France was more contrasted as the increase of authentications volumes related to e-commerce transactions was less pronounced than for previous quarters.In Q4 2022  the commercial activity in Financial Services was marked in particular by the renewal and extension of a partnership with the Dutch international bank ING. Following the signature of this a multi-year deal  Worldline handles debit and credit card issuing and processing for ING in the Netherlands  Belgium and Germany. Relying on its technology and know-how  Worldline helps ING focus on its core expertise  ultimately supporting the bank’s growth ambitions. By partnering with Worldline  ING can rely on top-quality cards issuing services backed by state-of-the-art technology  lower operation costs and best-in-class capabilities. This allows ING to provide its customers an enhanced range of issuing solutions that are fully compliant with all regulations  on a local and global level.Mobility & e-Transactional ServicesRevenue in Mobility & e-Transactional Services reached € 92 million in Q4 2022  up +7.0% organically  with positive underlying growth on a high comparison basis  led by high project activity with existing and new customers and increasing transactional revenue. The performance by division was as follow:Trusted Digitization: High single digit growth driven by new projects signed and increased volumes in France in particular and in Germany to a lesser extent;e-Ticketing: Double digit growth fueled by increased volumes in transportation coupled with several development projects  notably for the new smart ticketing solution in the UK  and in France;e-Consumer & Mobility: Low growth with increasing project such as the supply of a call center solution for the CNAF (Caisse Nationale des Allocations Familiales) and volumes increase with clients such as EDF or France Televisions offsetting the effect of the re-insourcing of a Contact contract with a large telco operator.Commercial activity in Mobility & e-Transactional Services was particularly strong in Q4 2022 with numerous wins such as with the West of England Combined Authority which appointed Worldline to develop and operate the region’s customer focused Mobility as a Service (MaaS) solution  while Compañía Española de Petróleos and Worldline have reached an agreement to renew their contractual relationship until 2024 for the maintenance of the Payment Means Applications.2022 performance per Global Business LineRevenue OMDA OMDA % In € million FY 2022 FY 2021* Organic change FY 2022 FY 2021* Organic change FY 2022 FY 2021* Organic change Merchant Services 3 041 2 667 +14.0% 869 672 +29.4% 28.6% 25.2% +340 bps Financial Services 958 935 +2.5% 272 296 -8.0% 28.4% 31.6% -320 bps Mobility & e-Transactional Services 365 340 +7.3% 53 51 +4.9% 14.5% 14.9% -30 bps Corporate costs -61 -39 +57.9% -1.4% -1.0% -40 bps Worldline 4 364 3 942 +10.7% 1 133 979 +15.7% 26.0% 24.8% +110 bps* at constant scope and exchange ratesMerchant ServicesBenefiting of the steady growth of acquiring MSV acceleration and new merchants gained  Merchant Services’ revenue in 2022 reached € 3 041 million  representing an organic growth by +14.0%. Commercial Acquiring showed a strong double-digit growth in almost all geographies and customer segments with strong dynamics and a good cash-to-card conversion trend. Despite the impact of the stop of the Russian online corridor  Payment Acceptance also contributed to the growth of Merchant Services with a mid-single digit organic growth with strong volumes for SMBs and large retailers in all geographies and more particular in Germany with PAYONE  as well as strong volumes related to the recovery of the travel industry benefiting to Digital Commerce. Finally  Digital Services mid to high single digit growth was led by a strong recovery in Germany compensating as anticipated some limited delays in POS supply.Merchant Services performance reflects a very strong development of market positions all along the year  notably in commercial acquiring  as illustrated by the following business KPI:In 2022  Worldline’s acquiring merchant base experienced a steady growth with c. 85 000 new merchants onboarded on its platform over the year  led by a strong dynamic in both instore (c. +9%) and online merchants count (c. +15%). Reaching 1.25 million merchants as of end of 2022 (excluding recent acquisitions)  it represents an increase of 200k net merchants compared to the end of December 2020.Worldline’s acquiring MSV in 2022 reached c. € 320 billion1  up +22% versus 2021 and up +29% versus 2019. This performance has been fueled by market share gains in both instore (MSV c. +21% vs. 2021) and online (c. +27% vs. 2021).Merchant Services’ OMDA in 2022 amounted to € 869 million  28.6% of revenue  representing an improvement by +340 basis points. It was positively supported by the strong revenue performance and by the synergies from Ingenico integration program which is materializing as per plan.Financial ServicesFinancial Services revenue reached € 958 million in 2022 with a +2.5% organic growth over the year with solid revenue flows partly compensating the temporary impact from the price decrease conceded by the Group for the renewals of historical large contracts of Equens in Q4 2021. Card-based payment processing activities (Issuing Processing and Acquiring Processing altogether) delivered a soft organic growth with improved volume trends and level of project activities compensating the impact of price concessions of renewed large contracts. Digital Banking posted a low to mid-single digit growth while Accounts Payments delivered a solid high single digit driven by the significant level of project activity and continuous and increasing run volumes recorded in Germany as well as in the Netherlands.Financial Services OMDA reached € 272 million in 2022  representing 28.4% of revenue. The overall profitability of Financial Services remained high despite the renewal of Equens contracts at a lower price and the cost inflation not yet compensated by the full impact of already launched measures in terms of cost base monitoring and workforce management.Mobility & e-Transactional ServicesRevenue in Mobility & e-Transactional Services reached € 365 million  up organically by +7.3% over the year thanks to several major projects and the recovery of the public transport sector. e-Ticketing grew at a double-digit rate thanks to higher fare collection coupled with the robust pick-up in the transportation sector in Europe as well as several development projects in the UK and in France. Trusted Digitization also grew at a double-digit rate driven by new projects and improving volumes in France  higher volumes in Tax collection and digital healthcare  and a good momentum both on support and project activity in e-Health and e-Archiving solutions in Germany. Finally  e-Consumer & Mobility was stable year-on-year with increasing projects and volumes just offsetting the effect of the re-insourcing of a Contact contract with a large telco operator.Mobility & e-Transactional Services’ OMDA reached € 53 million  representing 14.5% of revenue. The Business Line has been able to improve its profitability by € 2 million thanks to the positive business trends and cost optimization plans addressing both fixed and variable costs helping to offset the overall cost inflation.Corporate costsCorporate costs amounted to € 61 million in 2022  representing 1.4% of total Group revenue compared to 1.0% in 2021 at constant scope and exchange rates. This increase reflects the implementation of a new centralized operating model following recent acquisitions.Full execution of the strategic roadmapSuccessful completion of the sale of TSS activities to Apollo FundsAs announced on October 3  2022  Worldline completed the sale of its Terminals  Solutions & Services (“TSS”) business line to Apollo Funds  in line with the contemplated timeline. The proceeds from this disposal allows Worldline to further accelerate its development and anchors the Group’s leadership in payments services. This transaction generated a cash-in of € 1.1 billion  significantly contributing to the deleveraging of the Group. In addition  Worldline remains exposed to the future value creation of Ingenico through the preferred shares for an amount of up to € 0.9 billion.Expansion of Merchant Services in attractive geographies through market consolidationIn 2022  Worldline continued to actively participate to the European market consolidation and expanded the footprint of its Merchant Services Business Line in attractive geographies through the completion of several acquisitions:80% of Axepta Italy and set-up of a strategic partnership with BNL in Italy to expand Worldline’s Merchant Services in one of the most attractive payment market in Europe with significant growth and synergies opportunities.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterd…","The multinational Phase III study is evaluating leniolisib tablets in children aged 4 to 11 years with APDS  a rare primary immunodeficiencyLEIDEN  Netherlands  Feb. 21  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM)/(Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that the first patient has been enrolled in its Phase III clinical trial (NCT05438407) evaluating the investigational drug leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor  in children with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS). There is currently no approved treatment for this complex and progressive disease caused by genetic variants.At sites in the United States  Europe  and Japan  the single-arm  open-label  multinational clinical trial will evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of leniolisib in approximately 15 children aged 4 to 11 years who have a confirmed APDS diagnosis. The study's primary efficacy endpoints are a reduction in index lymph node size and an increased proportion of naïve B cells out of total B cells from baseline at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints include an assessment of the ability of leniolisib to modify health-related quality of life based on measures of physical  social  emotional  and school functioning using a validated patient questionnaire.Pharming plans to initiate a similar clinical trial in the third quarter of 2023 that will include children aged 1 to 6 years  with APDS  to evaluate a new pediatric formulation of leniolisib. Eligible patients enrolled in either of the pediatric trials will continue to receive leniolisib for a year after the initial 12-week treatment period through an open-label extension trial.Manish Butte  MD  PhD  E. Richard Stiehm Endowed Chair  Professor with tenure in the Department of Pediatrics  and Division Chief of Immunology  Allergy  and Rheumatology at UCLA  commented:""In treating APDS  the current standard of care is to use an array of supportive therapies. While these therapies can treat some of the manifestations of APDS  they do not target the underlying cause of the disease. Pharming's studies of leniolisib in children with APDS are important for evaluating the possibility of minimizing symptoms earlier in the disease progression.""Pharming's program for the clinical development of leniolisib in pediatric APDS is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III clinical trial that investigated the drug as a treatment for patients with the disease aged 12 years and older. As announced on February 2  2022  and recently detailed in Blood1  the international medical journal of the American Society of Hematology  the trial met both its co-primary endpoints  with patients who took leniolisib versus placebo achieving significant reductions in lymphoproliferation as measured by index lymph node size and increases in immunophenotype corrections as measured by the percentage of naïve B cells in peripheral blood.During the first half of 2022  positive opinions were received from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on the Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in children. The PIP(s) included the plans for both pediatric clinical trials.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""I am pleased we have initiated the first trial in our Phase III pediatric clinical program evaluating leniolisib in children with APDS  and I look forward to our second pediatric trial getting underway. Building on the encouraging findings from our successful Phase II/III study in patients aged 12 years and older with APDS  we are committed to bringing leniolisib to even younger patients with the goal of intervening before they develop immune-related symptoms likely to progress throughout their lives. While continuing to focus on patients of all ages with APDS  we are dedicated to collaborating with regulatory authorities with the goal of generating regulatory filings to gain approval that could support the treatment of children under 12 years of age who are living with this disease.""Based on the Phase II/III trial results and long-term open-label extension data  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is conducting a priority review of Pharming's New Drug Application for leniolisib as a treatment for adolescents and adults with APDS and has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 29  2023. In addition  Pharming's Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib in the same patient population is under evaluation by the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Pharming expects that the CHMP will issue its opinion on the leniolisib MAA in 2H 2023.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.2 3 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.2 4 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.5 6 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.7 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.5-8 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3Kδ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterd…","The multinational Phase III study is evaluating leniolisib tablets in children aged 4 to 11 years with APDS  a rare primary immunodeficiencyLEIDEN  Netherlands  Feb. 21  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM)/(Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that the first patient has been enrolled in its Phase III clinical trial (NCT05438407) evaluating the investigational drug leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor  in children with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS). There is currently no approved treatment for this complex and progressive disease caused by genetic variants.At sites in the United States  Europe  and Japan  the single-arm  open-label  multinational clinical trial will evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of leniolisib in approximately 15 children aged 4 to 11 years who have a confirmed APDS diagnosis. The study's primary efficacy endpoints are a reduction in index lymph node size and an increased proportion of naïve B cells out of total B cells from baseline at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints include an assessment of the ability of leniolisib to modify health-related quality of life based on measures of physical  social  emotional  and school functioning using a validated patient questionnaire.Pharming plans to initiate a similar clinical trial in the third quarter of 2023 that will include children aged 1 to 6 years  with APDS  to evaluate a new pediatric formulation of leniolisib. Eligible patients enrolled in either of the pediatric trials will continue to receive leniolisib for a year after the initial 12-week treatment period through an open-label extension trial.Manish Butte  MD  PhD  E. Richard Stiehm Endowed Chair  Professor with tenure in the Department of Pediatrics  and Division Chief of Immunology  Allergy  and Rheumatology at UCLA  commented:""In treating APDS  the current standard of care is to use an array of supportive therapies. While these therapies can treat some of the manifestations of APDS  they do not target the underlying cause of the disease. Pharming's studies of leniolisib in children with APDS are important for evaluating the possibility of minimizing symptoms earlier in the disease progression.""Pharming's program for the clinical development of leniolisib in pediatric APDS is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III clinical trial that investigated the drug as a treatment for patients with the disease aged 12 years and older. As announced on February 2  2022  and recently detailed in Blood1  the international medical journal of the American Society of Hematology  the trial met both its co-primary endpoints  with patients who took leniolisib versus placebo achieving significant reductions in lymphoproliferation as measured by index lymph node size and increases in immunophenotype corrections as measured by the percentage of naïve B cells in peripheral blood.During the first half of 2022  positive opinions were received from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on the Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in children. The PIP(s) included the plans for both pediatric clinical trials.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""I am pleased we have initiated the first trial in our Phase III pediatric clinical program evaluating leniolisib in children with APDS  and I look forward to our second pediatric trial getting underway. Building on the encouraging findings from our successful Phase II/III study in patients aged 12 years and older with APDS  we are committed to bringing leniolisib to even younger patients with the goal of intervening before they develop immune-related symptoms likely to progress throughout their lives. While continuing to focus on patients of all ages with APDS  we are dedicated to collaborating with regulatory authorities with the goal of generating regulatory filings to gain approval that could support the treatment of children under 12 years of age who are living with this disease.""Based on the Phase II/III trial results and long-term open-label extension data  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is conducting a priority review of Pharming's New Drug Application for leniolisib as a treatment for adolescents and adults with APDS and has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 29  2023. In addition  Pharming's Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib in the same patient population is under evaluation by the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Pharming expects that the CHMP will issue its opinion on the leniolisib MAA in 2H 2023.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.2 3 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function.

The CRA regulations have since undergone a range of proposed changes by federal regulators to better reflect major technological and operational changes in banking in recent years.In addition  2023 will mark the release of a final rule by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in accordance with a requirement contained in the Dodd Frank Act. Section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) to require financial institutions to compile  maintain  and submit to the Bureau certain data on applications for credit for women-owned  minority-owned  and small businesses. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is expected to issue a final rule by no later than March 31 that will impose a new set of data collection requirements for commercial loans.“I think we’re going to continue to see a reinvigoration of the CFPB ” Burniston said. “We’ll see that the CFPB’s actions will drive a lot of regulatory change  and when the CFPB does something  we’ll watch to see whether the prudential regulators will similarly respond.”Burniston anticipates the possible confluence of both major rules coming into play during 2023  which makes advance planning and preparation for implementing the new rules all the more critical to financial institutions’ ultimate success.“We could see modernized CRA regulations be released in close proximity to the Section 1071 regulations ” he said. “That would present a difficult challenge for the industry to manage the implementation of both of those  which are synced together. To some extent regulators will be using some of the [Section 1071] small-business lending data for CRA purposes as well.”For more than two decades  Wolters Kluwer has offered its CRA Wiz® software to help lenders monitor  track and report to regulators on their lending activities in compliance with the CRA regulations.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (Euronext: WKL) is a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services for the healthcare; tax and accounting; governance  risk and compliance; and legal and regulatory sectors.

This press release contains ...,WEST SACRAMENTO  Calif. & AMSTERDAM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Origin Materials  Inc. (“Origin” and “Origin Materials”) (NASDAQ: ORGN  ORGNW)  the world’s leading carbon negative materials company with a mission to enable the world’s transition to sustainable materials  and Avantium N.V. (“Avantium”)  (Euronext: AVTX) a leading technology company in renewable chemistry  today announced a partnership to accelerate the mass production of FDCA and PEF for use in advanced chemicals and plastics.The partnership aims to bring together the strengths of Origin’s patented carbon-negative technology platform  which turns the carbon found in sustainable wood residues into useful materials including chloromethylfurfural (“CMF”)  with Avantium’s YXY® Technology  which can be used to convert derivatives of Origin’s CMF into FDCA  the chemical building block for the polymer PEF  at attractive unit economics.The partnership represents a potential breakthrough in the commercialization of cost-competitive and low-carbon PEF  a polymer with an attractive combination of sustainability and performance characteristics for packaging including enhanced barrier properties. The produced PEF is expected to be 100% plant-based  fully recyclable  have attractive unit economics  and to offer a significantly reduced carbon footprint  with superior strength  thermal properties  and barrier properties compared to today’s widely used petroleum-based materials.“We are excited to partner with Avantium  a leading innovator and developer of sustainable chemistry  on a project with far-reaching impact ” said John Bissell  Origin Co-Founder and Co-Chief Executive Officer. “Together we aim to bring the value of FDCA and one of its main applications  PEF  to the industry at large and to drive decarbonization throughout the supply chain. By combining Origin’s revolutionary platform  which can produce key FDCA precursors like CMF from sustainable wood residues  with Avantium’s YXY® process technology  we aim to transform the polymers and materials industry. This partnership accelerates our efforts to bring economical non-food based FDCA and PEF to market.”“We are excited to enter into this strategic partnership with Origin Materials  a leading sustainable materials company and like-minded partner committed to revolutionizing the chemical and plastics industry ” said Tom van Aken  CEO of Avantium. “The technologies of both companies are highly complementary and will also enable the use of non-edible  renewable feedstocks for the production of FDCA and PEF  meeting the expectations of brand owners and consumers worldwide. This supplements the feedstock options for our technology. We look forward to working together on our shared ambition to transition the world to large-scale sustainable materials made from non-fossil resources.”The partnership includes a licensing agreement providing Origin with access to relevant parts of Avantium’s process technology for producing FDCA from Origin’s CMF derivatives at a 100 metric kilotons per annum scale facility and a conditional offtake agreement under which Avantium will supply Origin Materials with FDCA and PEF from its plants to accelerate market development. Under the terms of the transaction  Avantium received an upfront payment of €5 million in 2022 and  as a result of signing the licensing agreement  will receive an additional payment of €7.5 million  and may receive additional payments depending on the achievement of certain development milestones. Origin expects to incorporate Avantium's process technology into the supply chain for product from future plants.About Origin MaterialsHeadquartered in West Sacramento  Origin Materials is the world's leading carbon negative materials company. Origin’s mission is to enable the world’s transition to sustainable materials. For over a decade  Origin has developed a platform for turning the carbon found in inexpensive  plentiful  non-food biomass such as sustainable wood residues into useful materials while capturing carbon in the process. Origin’s patented technology platform can help revolutionize the production of a wide range of end products  including clothing  textiles  plastics  packaging  car parts  tires  carpeting  toys  and more with a ~$1 trillion addressable market. In addition  Origin’s technology platform is expected to provide stable pricing largely decoupled from the petroleum supply chain  which is exposed to more volatility than supply chains based on sustainable wood residues.
