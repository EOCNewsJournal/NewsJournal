Senior executives include the CEO and other members of the Group Leadership Team. The guidelines are forward-looking  i.e. they are applicable to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the guidelines by the Meeting. These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided by the General Meeting  including any long-term share related incentive plans.The guidelines' promotion of the Company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityA prerequisite for the successful implementation of the Company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability agenda  is that the Company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. To this end  it is necessary that the Company offers competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable the Company to offer the senior executives a competitive total remuneration.Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at promoting the Company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability agenda. This is accomplished through the financial and non-financial targets that determines the outcome of the variable cash remuneration and are clearly linked to the Company's business strategy and sustainability agenda. The variable cash remuneration is further described in the section ""Variable cash remuneration"" below.The Company's objectives for having a variable cash remuneration program and a long-term share related incentive plan are to (i) drive behaviors that will support the Company's long and short-term business success and create shareholder value  (ii) make the Company attractive as an employer for top talents  (iii) retain key individuals within the Company  and (iv) increase employees' interest and involvement in the Company's business and development.For information regarding the Company's business strategy  see the Company's website: www.group.skanska.com/about-us/how-we-work/strategy/.Total remunerationThe combined remuneration for each senior executive shall be market-related and competitive in the labor market in which the senior executive is placed  and distinguished performance should be reflected in the total remuneration. The remuneration may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  variable cash remuneration  pension and other benefits. Additionally  the General Meeting may ‚Äì irrespective of these guidelines ‚Äì resolve on  among other things  share-related or share price-related remuneration. Fixed salary and variable remuneration shall be related to the senior executive's responsibility and authority.Variable cash remunerationThe satisfaction of criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration shall be measured over a period of one or several years. The variable cash remuneration shall be capped and related to the fixed salary  and may amount to not more than 100 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.The variable cash remuneration shall take into account both financial and non-financial performance. The outcome in relation to predetermined and measurable financial targets shall determine the total (financial) bonus potential  i.e. the financial targets shall be the basis of the total bonus potential. This outcome may be reduced depending on the outcomes of the non-financial targets. The variable cash remuneration must be based on results in relation to established targets and be designed to increase the alignment between the shareholders and senior executives of the Company.The financial targets for the variable cash remuneration may be related to the Group's earnings before taxes  to relevant business unit's earnings before interest and taxes  etc.The non-financial targets shall be set to support the Company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability agenda  by for example being clearly linked to the Company's business strategy or sustainability agenda. The non-financial targets should together represent 50 percent of the total bonus which means that the total bonus outcome may be reduced with up to 50 percent if the non-financial targets are not met.To which extent the criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration has been satisfied shall be evaluated/determined when the measurement period has ended. The Board is responsible for the evaluation so far as it concerns variable cash remuneration to the CEO. For variable cash remuneration to other senior executives  the Compensation Committee is responsible for the evaluation. For financial objectives  the evaluation shall be based on the latest financial information made public by the Company.The terms for variable cash remuneration shall be structured so that the Board  if exceptional economic conditions prevail  has the possibility to limit or refrain from paying variable remuneration  if such payment is considered unreasonable and incompatible with the Company's responsibility in general to the shareholders  employees and other stakeholders. There shall also be a possibility to limit or refrain from paying variable remuneration if the Board considers that this is appropriate for other reasons. Further  the Board shall have the possibility to reclaim paid out variable cash remuneration if it is discovered after the payment that the senior executive has violated Skanska's Code of Conduct or other Skanska values  policies  standards or procedures.Further variable cash remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and only made on an individual basis  either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining senior executives  or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual's ordinary tasks. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount corresponding to 100 percent of the fixed annual cash salary and may not be paid more than once each year per individual. Any resolution on such remuneration for the CEO shall be made by the Board based on a proposal from the Compensation Committee. Any resolution on such remuneration for other senior executives shall be made by the Compensation Committee based on a proposal from the CEO.PensionPension benefits shall be defined contribution schemes except where law or collective agreement require a defined benefit pension. Variable cash remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits  except when it follows under law or collective agreement. The pension premiums for defined-contribution pension shall amount to not more than 40 percent of the fixed annual cash salary unless a higher percentage results from the application of law or collective agreement.Other benefitsOther benefits may include  for example  medical insurance (Sw: sjukv√•rdsf√∂rs√§kring)  health insurance (Sw. sjukf√∂rs√§kring)  double accommodation  home travel  tax compensation  parking and company cars. Such benefits may amount to not more than 20 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.For employments governed by rules other than Swedish rules  pension benefits and other benefits may be duly adjusted for compliance with mandatory rules or established local practice  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines.Senior executives who are expatriates  i.e. based in another country than their home country  may receive additional remuneration and other benefits to the extent reasonable in light of the special circumstances associated with the expat arrangement  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines. Such benefits may not in total exceed 50 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.Long-term share saving programsLong-term share saving programs  Skanska Employee Ownership Programs (""Seop 5"" and ""Seop 6"") have been implemented in the Company. Such plans have been resolved by the General Meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. New plans may also be resolved by the General Meeting. Seop 5 and Seop 6 give present and future employees the opportunity of becoming shareholders of Skanska and include permanent employees in the Skanska Group. The performance criteria used to assess the outcome of the plans are clearly linked to the business strategy and thereby to the Company's long-term value creation  including its sustainability agenda. The performance criteria consist of financial targets at Group  Business Unit and/or Business Unit Cluster level and as of Seop 6  also a non-financial target at Group level  related to the Group's reduction of carbon emissions. At present  the financial target applicable at Group level is growth in earning per share (EPS). The financial targets applicable at Business Unit and/or Business Unit level vary depending on which business stream the relevant Business Unit or Business Unit Cluster belongs to  as set out in the table below.Construction Residential Development Commercial Development Investment Properties EBIT[1] EBIT1 EBIT1 EBIT1 - ROCE[2] Leasing SQM[3] -Seop 5 and Seop 6 are further conditional upon the participant's own investment and three-year holding and employment period. For more information on Seop 5 and Seop 6  including the criteria which the outcome depends on  please see the Company's website:www.group.skanska.com/corporate-governance/remuneration/incentive-programs/.Termination of employmentIn the event of employment termination by the Company  the normal period of notice is six months  combined with severance pay corresponding to a maximum of 18 months fixed cash salary  or  alternatively  a period of notice of maximum 12 months  combined with severance pay corresponding to a maximum of 12 months fixed cash salary. Fixed cash salary during the notice period and severance pay may not together exceed an amount corresponding to the fixed cash salary for two years. When termination is made by the senior executive  the notice period may not exceed 12 months  without any right to severance pay.Remuneration to board members in addition to board feesTo the extent that a non-employed board member elected by the General Meeting performs work for the Company  besides the board membership  consultant fee and other remuneration may be granted for such work. Decisions on consultant fees and other remuneration to non-employed board members elected by the General Meeting are made by the Compensation Committee.Salary and employment conditions for employeesIn the preparation of the Board's proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for employees of the Company have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the Compensation Committee's and the Board's basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable.The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board has established a Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee's tasks include preparing the Board's decision to propose guidelines for salary and other remuneration to senior executives. The Board shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the General Meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the General Meeting. The Compensation Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the senior executives  the application of the guidelines for salary and other remuneration to senior executives as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the Company. The members of the Compensation Committee are independent of the Company and its senior executives. The CEO and other members of the senior executives do not participate in the Board's processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.Derogation from the guidelinesThe Board may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the Company's long-term interests  including its sustainability agenda  or to ensure the Company's financial viability. As set out above  the Compensation Committee's tasks include preparing the Board's resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.Description of significant changes compared to the previous guidelinesPension premiums have previously been restricted to 35 percent of the fixed annual cash salary for the CEO and to 30 percent of the fixed annual cash salary together with up to 30 percent on variable cash remuneration for other senior executives. These guidelines have been changed to a single restriction of 40 percent of the fixed annual cash salary which applies to all senior executives in order to align the cap for pension premiums with prevailing Swedish market practice.The cap for other benefits has been increased from 15 percent to 20 percent of the fixed annual cash salary. This change has been made to ensure that any senior executives that require for example double accommodation and home travels can be granted such benefits within the limits of these guidelines.The only further changes are editorial changes primarily following from the implementation of Seop 6.The shareholders have not expressed any specific views on the guidelines adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2020.Item 18 - Decision to authorize the Board to resolve on acquisitions of own Class B shares to secure delivery of own Class B shares to participants in the long-term employee ownership program for the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025 (Seop 6)BackgroundThe Annual General Meeting 2022  resolved in accordance with the Board's proposal on a long-term employee ownership program for the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025  respectively (each an ""Annual Program"") for permanent employees in the Skanska Group (Skanska Employee Ownership Program  ""Seop 6""); that a maximum of 12 000 000 own Class B shares may be transferred free of charge to participants in Seop 6 at the time and on the other terms that participants in Seop 6 are entitled to acquire shares; that each Annual Program may comprise no more than 4 000 000 Class B shares; and that transfers may be made of Class B shares (i) which have previously been acquired to secure Skanska's obligations under earlier Skanska Employee Ownership Programs but which are no longer required for such purpose  (ii) which have been acquired in accordance with the authorization given by the Annual General Meeting 2022  and (iii) which are acquired under future authorizations to acquire Class B shares.Information on Seop 6  including the conditions which the outcome depends on  is available on the Company's website www.group.skanska.com/ under the heading ""Corporate Governance/Remuneration/Incentive programs"".

The Nomination Committee proposes that Advokat Eva H√§gg be elected Chair of the AGM.Item 2 Preparation and approval of the voting listThe voting list proposed for approval is the voting list drawn up by Euroclear Sweden AB on behalf of the Company  based on the AGM's register of shareholders  shareholders having given notice of participation and being present at the meeting venue and postal votes received.Item 8.4 Dividend and record datesThe Board of Directors proposes a dividend to the shareholders of SEK 2.70 per share. The dividend is proposed to be paid in two equal installments  SEK 1.35 per share with the record date March 31  2023  and SEK 1.35 per share with the record date September 29  2023. Assuming these dates will be the record dates  Euroclear Sweden AB is expected to disburse SEK 1.35 per share on April 5  2023  and SEK 1.35 per share on October 4  2023.Item 9 Number of Board members and deputies to be elected by the AGMAccording to the articles of association  the Board of Directors shall consist of no less than five and no more than twelve Board members  with no more than six deputies. The Nomination Committee proposes that the number of Board members elected by the AGM shall be ten (previously eleven) and that no deputies be elected.Item 10 Fees payable to members of the Board of Directors elected by the AGM and to members of the Committees of the Board of Directors elected by the AGMThe Nomination Committee proposes that fees to non-employee Board members elected by the AGM and non-employee members of the Committees of the Board of Directors elected by the AGM be paid as follows:SEK 4 500 000 to the Chair of the Board of Directors ( previously SEK 4 375 000 );SEK 1 140 000 to each of the other Board members ( previously SEK 1 100 000 ) ;SEK 495 000 to the Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee ( previously SEK 475 000 );SEK 285 000 to each of the other members of the Audit and Compliance Committee ( previously SEK 275 000 );SEK 210 000 to each Chair of the Finance  the Remuneration and the Technology and Science Committee (previously SEK 205 000) ; andSEK 185 000 to each of the other members of the Finance  the Remuneration and the Technology and Science Committee (previously SEK 180 000).The Nomination Committee considered the Board fees with the objective of ensuring that they allow for the recruitment and retention of high quality individuals while also being appropriate in comparison to other technology companies operating globally and with similar size and complexity. As such  the Nomination Committee has concluded that an increase of the fees to all members of the Board and Board Committees  including their Chairs  in accordance with the above is reasonable  well-justified and in the best interests of the Company. The proposal of the Nomination Committee provides for an increase of the fees of approximately 3.3%[1] compared with the total fees to the corresponding number of Board and Committee members for Board and Committee work resolved by the Annual General Meeting 2022.Fees in the form of synthetic sharesBackgroundThe Nomination Committee believes that it is appropriate that Board members elected by the shareholders hold shares in Ericsson  in order to strengthen the Board members' and the shareholders' mutual interests in the Company. The Nomination Committee recommends that Board members elected by the shareholders  over a five year period  build a holding of shares or synthetic shares in Ericsson equal to at least the value of the annual Board fee (excluding fees for Committee work)  and that such holding be kept during the time the Board member remain Board member in Ericsson.To enable Board members to create an economic interest in the Company and considering that it is in many cases difficult for Board members to trade in the Company's share due to applicable insider rules  the Nomination Committee proposes that the Board members should  as previously  be offered the option of receiving part of the Board fees in the form of synthetic shares. A synthetic share constitutes a right to receive payment of an amount which corresponds to the market value of a share of series B in the Company on Nasdaq Stockholm at the time of payment.ProposalThe Nomination Committee therefore proposes that the AGM 2023 resolve that part of the fees to the Board member  in respect of their Board assignment (however  not in respect of Committee work)  may be paid in the form of synthetic shares  on the following terms and conditions.A nominated Board member shall be able to choose to receive the fee in respect of his or her Board assignment  according to the following four alternatives:The number of synthetic shares to be allocated shall be valued at the average of the market price of shares of series B in the Company on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of five trading days immediately following the publication of Ericsson's interim report for the first quarter of 2023. The synthetic shares are vested during the term of office  with 25 percent per quarter of the year.The synthetic shares give a right to  following the publication of Ericsson's year-end financial statement in 2028  receive payment of a cash amount per synthetic share corresponding to the market price of shares of series B in the Company in close connection with the time of payment.An amount corresponding to dividend in respect of shares of series B in the Company  resolved by the AGM during the holding period  shall be disbursed at the same time as the cash amount.Should the Board member's assignment to the Board of Directors come to an end no later than during the third calendar year after the year in which the AGM resolved on allocation of the synthetic shares  payment may take place the year after the assignment came to an end.The number of synthetic shares may be subject to recalculation in the event of bonus issues  splits  rights issues and similar measures  under the terms and conditions for the synthetic shares.The complete terms and conditions for the synthetic shares are described in Exhibit 1 to the Nomination Committee's proposal.The financial difference for the Company  should all Board members receive part of their fees in the form of synthetic shares compared with the fees being paid in cash only  is assessed to be limited.Item 11 Election of Board members and deputies of the Board of DirectorsProposalsThe Nomination Committee proposes that the following persons be re-elected Board members:Jon Fredrik Baksaas; Jan Carlson; Carolina Dybeck Happe; B√∂rje Ekholm; Eric A. Elzvik; Kristin S. Rinne; Helena Stjernholm; and Jacob Wallenberg.The Nomination Committee proposes that the following two persons be elected as new Board members:Jonas Synnergren; and Christy Wyatt.Item 12 Election of the Chair of the Board of DirectorsThe Nomination Committee proposes that Jan Carlson be elected Chair of the Board of Directors (new election).Information regarding proposed Board members and Chair (Item 11 and 12)Information regarding the proposed Board members and Chair is presented in Exhibit 2 to the Nomination Committee's proposal.ConsiderationsThe Nomination Committee primarily searches for potential Board member candidates for the upcoming mandate period  but also considers future competence needs. It is a long journey to identify the right candidates and long-term planning is essential. In assessing the appropriate composition of the Board of Directors  the Nomination Committee considers  among other things  experience and competence needed on the Board and its Committees  and the value of diversity in age  gender and cultural/geographic background as well as the need for renewal. The Nomination Committee believes that diversity on the Board will support Ericsson's sustainable development and therefore continually focuses on identifying Board member candidates with different backgrounds. While acknowledging increased expectations on transparency relating to diversity on the Board  applicable privacy regulations prevent Ericsson and the Nomination Committee from processing certain sensitive personal data about its Board members  such as information relating to demographic background. The Nomination Committee has applied the Swedish Corporate Governance Code  Section 4.1  as diversity policy. Focusing on improving the gender balance over time  the Nomination Committee particularly works to identify women candidates matching the current and future needs of the Board. The Nomination Committee also assesses the appropriateness of the number of Board members and whether the Board members can devote the necessary time required to fulfill their tasks as Board members in Ericsson.In its appraisal of qualifications and performance of the individual Board members  the Nomination Committee takes into account the competence and experience of each individual member along with the individual member's contribution to the Board work as a whole and to the Committee work. The Committee has familiarized itself with the results of the Board work evaluation that was led by the Chair of the Board of Directors. The Nomination Committee's objective is to propose and support the election of a Board that is comprised of individuals of the highest competency and integrity  while also holistically comprising a strong mix of needed skills and experience to effectively oversee and lead Ericsson.The Nomination Committee is of the opinion that the current Board of Directors and Board work is well functioning. Further  it is the Nomination Committee's view that the Board fulfills expectations in terms of composition and that the Board of Directors as well as the individual Board members fulfill expectations in terms of expertise. Competencies and experiences represented on the Board include broad international industry experience  experience from the telecom  IT and ICT sectors  technological and technical competencies and experiences (e.g. related to software and digitalization)  financial expertise and experience from private equity  M&A and new business. The Nomination Committee further believes that competencies and experiences within the Environmental  Social and Governance areas considered most relevant for Ericsson and the sector in which the Company operates are well represented on the Board  including for example related to the technologies the Company develops and delivers as well as relating to ethics and compliance. While the Board is well functioning and has a strong composition  the Nomination Committee believes that the Board would benefit from additional expertise within the software  technology and enterprise area.Ronnie Leten  Kurt Jofs and Nora Denzel have informed the Nomination Committee that they will not stand for re-election at the AGM 2023. The Nomination Committee proposes re-election of current Board members Jon Fredrik Baksaas  Jan Carlson  Carolina Dybeck Happe  B√∂rje Ekholm  Eric A. Elzvik  Kristin S. Rinne  Helena Stjernholm and Jacob Wallenberg  and new election of Jonas Synnergren and Christy Wyatt as members of the Board. Jonas Synnergren has long-term international business experience as a Board member of Tieto Oyj and Veoneer Inc. and is currently a Board member of Nordea Oyj. In addition  Jonas Synnergren is Senior Partner in Cevian Capital AB  one of Ericsson's shareholders. Christy Wyatt has long-term international business experience from senior management roles within Motorola  Good Technology and DTEX Systems and is currently the President and CEO of Absolute Software.It is the Nomination Committee's assessment that the proposed new Chair of the Board of Directors  Jan Carlson  with his long career both as CEO and Chairman  good knowledge of Ericsson after serving many years on the Board  international experience  technology background and personal qualities will be an excellent successor as Chair of the Board. Further  it is the Nomination Committee's assessment that each of the proposed Board members  with their respective experiences  adds valuable expertise and experience to the Board  and that Jonas Synnergren's and Christy Wyatt's extensive international business experiences and deep software  enterprise and technology expertise will be of additional value to Ericsson and will further strengthen the Board.Out of the proposed Board members to be elected by the AGM of shareholders (excluding the President and CEO) 44% are women. Gender balance continues to be a key priority for the Nomination Committee  and the Committee works to improve the gender balance on the Board of Directors over time.Independence of Board membersThe Nomination Committee has made the following assessments in terms of applicable independence requirements:1. The Nomination Committee considers that the following Board members are independent of the Company and its senior management:a. Jon Fredrik Baksaasb. Jan Carlsonc. Carolina Dybeck Happed. Eric A. Elzvike. Kristin S. Rinnef. Helena Stjernholmg. Jonas Synnergrenh. Jacob Wallenbergi. Christy Wyatt2. From among the Board members reported in (i) above  the Nomination Committee considers that at least the following are independent of the Company's major shareholders:a. Jon Fredrik Baksaasb. Jan Carlsonc. Carolina Dybeck Happed. Eric A. Elzvike. Kristin S. Rinnef. Jonas Synnergreng. Christy WyattMoreover  the Nomination Committee considers that at least the following Board members are independent in respect of all applicable independence requirements:a. Jon Fredrik Baksaasb. Jan Carlsonc. Carolina Dybeck Happed. Eric A. Elzvike. Kristin S. Rinnef. Jonas Synnergreng. Christy WyattThe Nomination Committee concludes that the proposed composition of the Board of Directors meets the independence requirements applicable to Ericsson.Item 13 Number of auditorsAccording to the articles of association  the Company shall have no less than one and no more than three registered public accounting firms as auditor. The Nomination Committee proposes that the Company should have one registered public accounting firm as auditor.Item 14 Fees payable to the auditorThe Nomination Committee proposes  like previous years  that the auditor fees be paid against approved account.Item 15 Election of auditorIn accordance with the recommendation by the Audit and Compliance Committee  the Nomination Committee proposes that Deloitte AB be appointed auditor for the period from the end of the AGM 2023 until the end of the AGM 2024 (re-election).Item 16 Implementation of LTV I 2023 including transfer of treasury stock  directed share issue and authorization for the Board of Directors to decide on an acquisition offer of shares of series CBackgroundThe Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors evaluate the long-term variable compensation (""LTV"") programs to the Executive Team (""ET"") on an ongoing basis. The evaluation considers the LTV programs for effectiveness in serving their purpose to support achieving the Ericsson Group's strategic business objectives and sustainable long-term interests as well as their facility to increase the long-term focus of the members of the ET and align their interests with the long-term expectations and the interests of the shareholders.Upon evaluation of the currently ongoing LTV programs for 2020  2021 and 2022  the Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors concluded that these ongoing LTV programs  which are all in essence the same in terms of plan structure  performance criteria and performance periods  enabled the Company to achieve its long-term objectives. The ongoing LTV programs further enabled the Company to remain committed to the targets for 2023 as well as the long-term target of 15-18% adjusted earnings (loss) before interest  taxes  amortization and write-downs of acquired intangible assets (""EBITA"")  in turn creating increased shareholder value. In order to further strengthen both Ericsson's and the ET's commitment to long-term sustainability and responsible business  the Board of Directors  upon recommendation from the Remuneration Committee  has concluded to propose to the AGM 2023 an LTV I 2023 for the ET.LTV I 2023 is an integral part of the Company's remuneration strategy and the Board of Directors in particular expects the members of the ET to build significant equity holdings to align the interests and expectations of the LTV program participants with those of shareholders.Proposals16.1 Implementation of the LTV I 2023The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolve on the LTV I 2023 for ET members comprising a maximum of 4.1 million shares of series B in the Company as set out below.Objectives of the LTV programThe LTV program is designed to provide long-term incentives for members of the ET (""Participants"")  thereby creating long-term value for the shareholders. The aim is to attract  retain and motivate executives in a competitive market through performance-based share related incentives  to encourage the build-up of significant equity holdings to align the interests of the Participants with those of shareholders and to further strengthen the ET's commitment to long-term sustainability and responsible business.The LTV Program in briefThe LTV Program is proposed to include all members (current and future) of the ET  currently comprising of 17 employees  including the President and CEO. Awards under LTV I 2023 (""Performance Share Awards"") will be granted free of charge entitling the Participant  provided that i.e. certain performance criteria set out below are met  to receive a number of shares  free of charge  following expiration of a three-year vesting period (""Vesting Period""). Allotment of shares pursuant to Performance Share Awards will be subject to the achievement of performance criteria  as set out below  and will generally require that the Participant retains his or her employment over the Vesting Period. All major decisions relating to LTV I 2023 will be taken by the Remuneration Committee  with approval by the full Board of Directors as required.Granting of Performance Share AwardsGranting of Performance Share Awards to the Participants will generally take place as soon as practicably possible following the AGM 2023. For 2023  the value of the underlying shares in respect of the Performance Share Awards made to the President and CEO will not exceed 190% of the Annual Base Salary at the time of grant  and for other Participants  the value will not exceed 70% of the Participants' respective Annual Base Salary at the time of grant  unless the Participant is employed in the USA where the value will not exceed 100% of Participants' Annual Base Salary.The share price used to calculate the number of shares to which the Performance Share Awards entitle will be the volume-weighted average of the market price of shares of series B in Ericsson on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five trading days immediately following the publication of the Company's interim report for the fourth quarter 2022.Performance criteriaThe vesting of the Performance Share Awards will be subject to the satisfaction of performance criteria related to 2023 Group EBITA (earnings (loss) before interest  taxes  amortizations and write-downs of acquired intangible) (operating income) performance criterion  along with three-year total shareholder return (""TSR"" [2])  and Group Environmental Social Governance (""ESG"") performance criteria  which will determine what portion (if any) of the Performance Share Awards will vest at the end of the Vesting Period.The 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion relates to 45% of the Performance Share Awards and the maximum vesting level is 200%.The performance criteria based on TSR are absolute TSR development and relative TSR development for the Ericsson series B share over the period January 1  2023 ‚Äì December 31  2025 (""Performance Period"" [3]). The absolute and relative TSR performance criteria relate to 25% and 20%  respectively  of the Performance Share Awards and the maximum vesting level for both TSR performance criteria is 200%.The Group ESG performance criterion measured over the Performance Period will relate to 10% of the Performance Share Awards  and the maximum vesting level is 200%.The following conditions will apply to the performance criteria:2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion45% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion for the 2023 financial year. The 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion established by the Board of Directors will stipulate a minimum level and a maximum level. The 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) target is not disclosed due to stock market and competition considerations. The vesting level of Performance Share Awards related to 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion will be determined by the Board of Directors when the audited result for the financial year 2023 is available.If the maximum performance level is reached or exceeded  the vesting will amount to (and will not exceed) the maximum level of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to the 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion. If performance is below the maximum level but exceeds the minimum level  a linear pro-rata vesting of shares will occur. No vesting will occur if performance amounts to or is below the minimum level. The allotment of the shares will not occur until the end of the Vesting Period in 2026.TSR performance criteriaAbsolute TSR performance criterion25% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfillment of an absolute TSR performance criterion over the Performance Period. If the absolute TSR development reaches or exceeds 14% per annum compounded  the maximum vesting of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to absolute TSR performance criterion will occur. If the absolute TSR development is below or reaches only 6% per annum compounded  no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to the absolute TSR performance criterion. A linear pro-rata vesting from 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to absolute TSR performance criterion will apply if the Company's absolute TSR performance is between 6% and 14% per annum compounded.Relative TSR performance criterion20% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a relative TSR performance criterion over the Performance Period  compared to a peer group consisting of 11 peer companies (""Peer Group""[4]). The vesting of the relative TSR related Performance Share Awards varies depending on the Company's TSR performance ranking versus the other companies in the Peer Group. If the Company's relative TSR performance is below the TSR development of the company ranked 6th in the Peer Group  no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to relative TSR performance criterion. Vesting of the Performance Share Awards related to relative TSR performance criterion will occur at the following percentage levels  based on which ranking position in the Peer Group the Company's TSR performance corresponds to:Position within the Peer Group Associated vesting percentage level6 or lower 0%5 50%4 100%3 150%2 or higher 200%If the Company's TSR performance is between two of the ranked companies  a linear pro-rata vesting will apply between the vesting percentage levels for the relevant ranked positions.Group ESG performance criterion10% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a Group ESG performance criterion comprised of two equally weighted subcomponents covering environmental and social aspects of ESG measured over the Performance Period.Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions5% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfillment of a subcomponent of reducing greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions [5] from service fleet vehicles  energy consumption at facilities and from business travel [6].Subcomponent target- and corresponding achievement levels are defined in the schedule below and broken down for each of the three years [7] covered by the Performance Period. Vesting is determined at the end of each year  with each year corresponding to one third (1/3) of the total subcomponent Performance Share Awards. A linear pro-rata vesting of one third (1/3) of 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to reducing emissions in the subcomponent will apply if reported emissions in scope are between the minimum and maximum vesting levels for each of the years covered by the Performance Period. An illustrative example is included below.These target levels are aligned to the emissions reduction trajectory set for achieving Net Zero emissions from the Ericsson Group's own activities by 2030.Achievement GHG emissions target levels for emission in scope by fiscal year (ktonne CO2e)(%) 2023 2024 20250 142 132 122100 135 126 116200 121 113 104Illustrative example: first  if reported emissions in scope for the year 2023 are 121 ktonne  the maximum vesting of one third of 200% (1/3 x 200% = 66.67%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent and year will occur. Next  if reported emissions for the year 2024 are 126 ktonne  vesting of one third of 100% (1/3 x 100% = 33.33%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent and fiscal year will occur. Last  if reported emissions in scope for the year 2025 are 122 ktonne  no vesting (1/3 x 0% = 0.00%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent will occur. Consequently  in this example total vesting of the Performance Share Award related to this subcomponent over the Performance Period will be (66.67% + 33.33% + 0.00%) 100%.Increasing the representation of women leaders in Ericsson5% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a subcomponent of increasing the representation of women leaders (i.e. women holding roles with people management responsibility) in the Ericsson Group to 24% by the end of the Performance Period  which is in line with achieving the target trajectory for increasing the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group to 30% by 2030.If the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group amounts to 25% or above by the end of the Performance Pe riod  the maximum vesting of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent will occur. If the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group amounts to 23% or below by the end of the Performance Period  no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent. A linear pro-rata vesting from 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to increasing the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group subcomponent will apply if the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group exceeds 23% but is below 25% by the end of the Performance Period.The vesting level of Performance Share Awards related to the Group ESG performance criterion will be determined by the Board of Directors when the audited results for both subcomponents at the end of the financial year 2025 are available.Information about the outcome of the performance criteria will be provided no later than in the annual report for the financial year 2025.Allotment of sharesProvided that the performance criteria above have been met and that the Participant has retained his or her employment (unless special circumstances are at hand) during the Vesting Period  allotment of vested shares will take place as soon as practicably possible following the expiration of the Vesting Period.When determining the final vesting level of Performance Share Awards  the Board of Directors shall examine whether the vesting level is reasonable considering the Company's financial results and position  conditions on the stock market and other circumstances  such as environmental  social  ethics and compliance factors  and if not  as determined by the Board of Directors  reduce the vesting level to the lower level deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors.In the event delivery of shares to Participants cannot take place under applicable law or at a reasonable cost and employing reasonable administrative measures  the Board of Directors will be entitled to decide that Participants may  instead  be offered a cash settlement.The Company has the right to  before delivering vested shares to the Participants  retain and sell the number of shares required to cover the cost for withholding and paying tax and social security liabilities on behalf of the Participants in relation to the Performance Share Awards for remittance to revenue authorities. In such an event  net amount of vested shares will thus be delivered to the Participants after the vested Performance Share Awards are reduced by the number of shares retained by the Company for such purposes.FinancingThe Board of Directors has considered different financing methods for transfer of shares under the LTV I 2023 such as transfer of treasury stock and an equity swap agreement with a third party. The Board of Directors considers that a directed issue of shares of series C in the Company  followed by buy-back and transfer of treasury stock is the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer shares under the LTV I 2023.The Company's current holding of treasury stock is not sufficient for the implementation of the LTV I 2023. Therefore  the Board of Directors proposes a directed share issue and buy back of shares as further set out below under item 16.2. Under the proposed transactions  shares are issued at the share's quota value and repurchased as soon as the shares have been subscribed for and registered. The purchase price paid by the Company to the subscriber equals the subscription price. As compensation to the subscriber for its assistance in the issuance and buy-back of shares under items 16  17  18 and 19 the Company will pay to the subscriber an amount totaling SEK 100 000.The procedure of issuance and buy-back of shares for the Company's LTV programs has previously been decided by the AGMs in 2001  2003  2008  2009  2012  2016  and 2017.Since the costs for the Company in connection with an equity swap agreement will be significantly higher than the costs in connection with transfer of treasury stock  the main alternative is that the financial exposure is secured by transfer of treasury stock and that an equity swap agreement with a third party is an alternative in the event that the required majority for approval is not reached.CostsThe total effect on the income statement of the LTV I 2023  including financing costs and social security fees  is estimated to range between SEK 100 million and SEK 230 million distributed over the years 2023-2026. The costs will depend on the future development of the price of Ericsson series B share.The administration cost for transfer of shares by way of an equity swap agreement is currently estimated to approximately SEK 30 million  compared to the cost of approximately SEK 100 000 for using newly issued and acquired shares in treasury (SEK 100 000 is the total cost paid to the subscriber in relation to items 16  17  18 and 19  regardless of the number of share issuances).DilutionThe Company has approximately 3.3 billion registered shares. As per December 31  2022  the Company held approximately 4 million shares in treasury. The number of shares that may be required for ongoing LTV programs (2019  2020  2021 and 2022) as per December 31  2022  is estimated to approximately 4.9 million shares  corresponding to approximately 0.15 percent of the number of registered shares of the Company. In order to implement the LTV I 2023  a total of up to 4.1 million shares are required  which corresponds to approximately 0.12 percent of the total number of registered shares of the Company  hence an issue of new shares is proposed for the implementation of LTV I 2023. The effect on important key figures is only marginal.16.2 Transfer of treasury stock to employees and on an exchange  directed share issue and acquisition offer for the LTV I 2023a. Transfer of treasury stock under the LTV I 2023Transfer of no more than 3.4 million shares of series B in the Company less any shares retained by the Company as per item 16.2 c) may occur on the following terms and conditions:b. Transfer of treasury stock on an exchange to cover expensesThe Company may  prior to the AGM in 2024  transfer no more than 700 000 shares of series B in the Company  in order to cover certain expenses  mainly social security payments. Transfer of the shares shall be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the  at each time  prevailing price interval for the share as disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm.c. Authorization to decide on transfer of treasury stock on an exchange to cover costs for tax and social security liabilities for the ParticipantsAuthorization for the Board of Directors to decide to  in conjunction with the delivery of vested shares under LTV I 2023  prior to the AGM in 2024  retain and sell no more than 60% of the vested shares of series B in the Company in order to cover for the costs for withholding and paying tax and social security liabilities on behalf of the Participants in relation to the Performance Share Awards for remittance to revenue authorities. Transfer of the shares shall be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the  at each time  prevailing price interval for the share as disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm. These shares form a part of the final number of vested shares to the employees under LTV I 2023 and do not incur additional costs to the LTV I 2023 for the Company.d. Directed issue of shares of series C in the CompanyIncrease of the share capital in the Company with SEK 20 500 000.01 by an issue of 4.1 million shares of series C in the Company  each share with a quota value of approximately SEK 5. The terms and conditions of the share issue are the following:The new shares shall ‚Äì with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights ‚Äì be subscribed for only by Investor AB or its subsidiaries.The new shares shall be subscribed for during the period as from Thursday  April 27  2023  up to and including Tuesday  May 2  2023. Over-subscription may not occur.The amount that shall be paid for each new share shall be the quota value (approximately SEK 5).Payment for the subscribed shares shall be made at the time of subscription.The Board of Directors shall be entitled to extend the period for subscription and payment.The new shares shall not entitle the holders to dividend payment.It is noted that the new shares are subject to restrictions pursuant to Chapter 4  Section 6 (conversion clause) and Chapter 20  Section 31 (redemption clause) of the Swedish Companies Act.The Board of Directors proposes that the President and CEO shall be authorized to make the minor adjustments to the above resolutions that may prove to be necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Reasons for deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and principles on which the subscription price is basedThe Board of Directors considers that a directed issue of shares of series C in the Company  followed by buy-back and transfer of treasury stock is the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer shares under the LTV I 2023. Shares are issued at the share's quota value and repurchased as soon as the shares have been subscribed for and registered. The purchase price paid by the Company to the subscriber equals the subscription price.e. Authorization for the Board of Directors to decide on a directed acquisition offerAuthorization for the Board of Directors to decide that 4.1 million shares of series C in Ericsson be acquired according to the following:16.3 Equity Swap Agreement with third party in relation to the LTV I 2023In the event that the required majority for approval is not reached under item 16.2 above  the financial exposure of the LTV I 2023 shall be hedged by the Company entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party  under which the third party shall  in its own name  acquire and transfer shares of series B in the Company to employees covered by the LTV I 2023.Majority rulesThe resolution of the AGM on implementation of the LTV I 2023 according to item 16.1 requires that more than half of the votes cast at the AGM approve the proposal. The resolution of the AGM on transfer of treasury stock to employees and on an exchange  directed share issue and acquisition offer for the LTV I 2023 according to item 16.2 requires that shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the AGM approve the proposal. The resolution of the AGM on an Equity Swap Agreement with third party according to item 16.3 requires that more than half of the votes cast at the AGM approve the proposal.Item 17 Implementation of LTV II 2023 including transfer of treasury stock  directed share issue and authorization for the Board of Directors to decide on an acquisition offerBackgroundIn addition to the LTV programs for the President and CEO and members of the ET  Ericsson has since 2017 operated a performance-based long-term variable compensation program for employees classified as Executives (approximately 180 employees) (the Ericsson Executive Performance Plan (""EPP"")). The EPP is identical to the LTV I  with the exception that the EPP is cash settled. The Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors have evaluated whether to implement an additional long-term variable compensation program  LTV II 2023  for Executives with delivery of shares of series B in Ericsson instead of cash settlement to further strengthen both Ericsson's and the Executives' commitment to long-term sustainability and responsible business. The Board of Directors  upon recommendation from the Remuneration Committee  has concluded to propose to the AGM 2023 the LTV II 2023 for Executives.LTV II 2023 is an integral part of the Company's remuneration strategy  and the Board of Directors in particular expects the Executives to build significant equity holdings to align the interests and expectations of the LTV program participants with those of shareholders.The criteria and vesting period for LTV II 2023 are the same as for LTV I 2023. Should the AGM 2023 not vote in favor of the proposal of implementing LTV II 2023 the EPP 2023 will be implemented.Proposals17.1 Implementation of the LTV II 2023The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolve on the LTV II 2023 for Executives  comprising a maximum of 5.9 million shares of series B in the Company as set out below.Objectives of the LTV programThe LTV program is designed to provide long-term incentives for Executives (""Participants"")  thereby creating long-term value for the shareholders. The aim is to attract  retain and motivate Executives in a competitive market through performance-based share related incentives  to encourage the build-up of significant equity holdings to align the interests of the Participants with those of shareholders and to further strengthen Ericsson's and the Executives' commitment to long-term sustainability and responsible business.The LTV program in briefThe LTV program is proposed to include all Executives (current and future)  currently comprising of 180 employees  excluding the President and CEO and ET. Awards under LTV II 2023 (""Performance Share Awards"") will be granted free of charge entitling the Participant  provided that i.e. certain performance criteria set out below are met  to receive a number of shares  free of charge  following expiration of a three-year vesting period (""Vesting Period""). Allotment of shares pursuant to Performance Share Awards will be subject to the achievement of performance criteria  as set out below  and will generally require that the Participant retains his or her employment over the Vesting Period. All major decisions relating to LTV II 2023 will be taken by the Remuneration Committee  with approval by the full Board of Directors as required.Granting of Performance Share AwardsGranting of Performance Share Awards to the Participants will generally take place as soon as practicably possible following the AGM 2023. For 2023  the value of the underlying shares in respect of the Performance Share Awards made to the Participants  will not exceed 70% of the Participants' respective Annual Base Salary at the time of grant  unless the Participant is employed in the USA where the value will not exceed 100% of Participant's Annual Base Salary.The share price used to calculate the number of shares to which the Performance Share Awards entitle will be the volume-weighted average of the market price of shares of series B in the Company on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five trading days immediately following the publication of the Company's interim report for the fourth quarter 2022.Performance criteriaThe vesting of the Performance Share Awards will be subject to the satisfaction of performance criteria related to 2023 Group EBITA (earnings (loss) before interest  taxes  amortizations and write-downs of acquired intangible) (operating income) performance criterion  along with three-year total shareholder return (""TSR"" [8])  and Group ESG performance criteria  which will determine what portion (if any) of the Performance Share Awards will vest at the end of the Vesting Period.The 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion relates to 45% of the Performance Share Awards and the maximum vesting level is 200%.The performance criteria based on TSR are absolute TSR development and relative TSR development for the shares of series B in Ericsson over the period January 1  2023 ‚Äì December 31  2025 (""Performance Period"" [9]). The absolute and relative TSR performance criteria relate to 25% and 20%  respectively  of the Performance Share Awards and the maximum vesting level for both TSR performance criteria is 200%.The Group ESG performance criterion measured over the Performance Period will relate to 10% of the Performance Share Awards  and the maximum vesting level is 200%.The following conditions will apply to the performance criteria:2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion45% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion for the 2023 financial year. The 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion established by the Board of Directors will stipulate a minimum level and a maximum level. The 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) target is not disclosed due to stock market and competition considerations. The vesting level of Performance Share Awards related to 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion will be determined by the Board of Directors when the audited result for the financial year 2023 is available.If the maximum performance level is reached or exceeded  the vesting will amount to (and will not exceed) the maximum level of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to the 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion. If performance is below the maximum level but exceeds the minimum level  a linear pro-rata vesting of shares will occur. No vesting will occur if performance amounts to or is below the minimum level. The allotment of the shares will not occur until the end of the Vesting Period in 2026.TSR performance criteriaAbsolute TSR performance criterion25% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of an absolute TSR performance criterion over the Performance Period. If the absolute TSR development reaches or exceeds 14% per annum compounded  the maximum vesting of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to absolute TSR performance criterion will occur. If the absolute TSR development is below or reaches only 6% per annum compounded  no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to the absolute TSR performance criterion. A linear pro-rata vesting from 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to absolute TSR performance criterion will apply if the Company's absolute TSR performance is between 6% and 14% per annum compounded.Relative TSR performance criterion20% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a relative TSR performance criterion over the Performance Period  compared to a peer group consisting of 11 peer companies (""Peer Group""[10]). The vesting of the relative TSR related Performance Share Awards varies depending on the Company's TSR performance ranking versus the other companies in the Peer Group. If the Company's relative TSR performance is below the TSR development of the company ranked 6th in the Peer Group  no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to relative TSR performance criterion. Vesting of the Performance Share Awards related to relative TSR performance criterion will occur at the following percentage levels  based on which ranking position in the Peer Group the Company's TSR performance corresponds to:Position within the Peer Group Associated vesting percentage level6 or lower 0%5 50%4 100%3 150%2 or higher 200%If the Company's TSR performance is between two of the ranked companies  a linear pro-rata vesting will apply between the vesting percentage levels for the relevant ranked positions.Group ESG performance criterion10% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a Group ESG performance criterion comprised of two equally weighted subcomponents covering environmental and social aspects of ESG measured over the Performance Period.Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions5% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfillment of a subcomponent of reducing greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions [11] from service fleet vehicles  energy consumption at facilities and from business travel [12].Subcomponent target and corresponding achievement levels are defined in the schedule below and broken down for each of the three years [13] covered by the Performance Period. Vesting is determined at the end of each year  with each year corresponding to one third (1/3) of the total subcomponent Performance Share Awards. A linear pro-rata vesting of one third (1/3) of 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to reducing emissions in the subcomponent will apply if reported emissions in scope are between the minimum and maximum vesting levels for each of the years covered by the Performance Period. An illustrative example is included below.These target levels are aligned to the emissions reduction trajectory set for achieving Net Zero emissions from the Ericsson Group's own activities by 2030.Achievement GHG emissions target levels for emission in scope by fiscal year (ktonne CO2e)(%) 2023 2024 20250 142 132 122100 135 126 116200 121 113 104Illustrative example: first  if reported emissions in scope for the year 2023 are 121 ktonne  the maximum vesting of one third of 200% (1/3 x 200% = 66.67%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent and year will occur. Next  if reported emissions for the year 2024 are 126 ktonne  vesting of one third of 100% (1/3 x 100% = 33.33%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent and fiscal year will occur. Last  if reported emissions in scope for the year 2025 are 122 ktonne  no vesting (1/3 x 0% = 0.00%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent will occur. Consequently  in this example total vesting of the Performance Share Award related to this subcomponent over the Performance Period will be (66.67% + 33.33% + 0.00%) 100%.Increasing the representation of women leaders in Ericsson5% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a subcomponent of increasing the representation of women leaders (i.e. women holding roles with people management responsibility) in the Ericsson Group to 24% by the end of the Performance Period  which is in line with achieving the target trajectory for increasing the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group to 30% by 2030.If the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group amounts to 25% or above by the end of the Performance Period  the maximum vesting of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent will occur. If the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group amounts to 23% or below by the end of the Performance Period  no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent. A linear pro-rata vesting from 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to increasing the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group subcomponent will apply if the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group exceeds 23% but is below 25% by the end of the Performance Period.The vesting level of Performance Share Awards related to the Group ESG performance criterion will be determined by the Board of Directors when the audited results for both subcomponents at the end of the financial year 2025 are available.Information about the outcome of the performance criteria will be provided no later than in the annual report for the financial year 2025.Allotment of sharesProvided that the performance criteria above have been met and that the Participant has retained his or her employment (unless special circumstances are at hand) during the Vesting Period  allotment of vested shares will take place as soon as practicably possible following the expiration of the Vesting Period.When determining the final vesting level of Performance Share Awards  the Board of Directors shall examine whether the vesting level is reasonable considering the Company's financial results and position  conditions on the stock market and other circumstances  such as environmental  social  ethics and compliance factors  and if not  as determined by the Board of Directors  reduce the vesting level to the lower level deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors.In the event delivery of shares to Participants cannot take place under applicable law or at a reasonable cost and employing reasonable administrative measures  the Board of Directors will be entitled to decide that Participants may  instead  be offered a cash settlement.The Company has the right to  before delivering vested shares to the Participants  retain and sell the number of shares required to cover the cost for withholding and paying tax and social security liabilities on behalf of the Participants in relation to the Performance Share Awards for remittance to revenue authorities. In such an event  net amount of vested shares will thus be delivered to the Participants after the vested Performance Share Awards are reduced by the number of shares retained by the Company for such purposes.FinancingThe Board of Directors has considered different financing methods for transfer of shares under the LTV II 2023 such as transfer of treasury stock and an equity swap agreement with a third party. The Board of Directors considers that a directed issue of shares of series C in the Company  followed by buy-back and transfer of treasury stock is the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer shares under the LTV II 2023.The Company's current holding of treasury stock is not sufficient for the implementation of the LTV II 2023. Therefore  the Board of Directors proposes a directed share issue and buy back of shares as further set out below under item 17.2. Under the proposed transactions  shares are issued at the share's quota value and repurchased as soon as the shares have been subscribed for and registered. The purchase price paid by the Company to the subscriber equals the subscription price. As compensation to the subscriber for its assistance in the issuance and buy-back of shares under items 16  17  18 and 19  the Company will pay to the subscriber an amount totaling SEK 100 000.Since the costs for the Company in connection with an equity swap agreement will be significantly higher than the costs in connection with transfer of treasury stock  the main alternative is that the financial exposure is secured by transfer of treasury stock and that an equity swap agreement with a third party is an alternative in the event that the required majority for approval is not reached.CostsThe total effect on the income statement of the LTV II 2023  including financing costs and social security fees  is estimated to range between SEK 146 million and SEK 333 million distributed over the years 2023-2026. The costs will depend on the future development of the price of shares of series B in Ericsson.The administration cost for transfer of shares by way of an equity swap agreement is currently estimated to approximately SEK 30 million  compared to the cost of approximately SEK 100 000 for using newly issued and acquired shares in treasury (SEK 100 000 is the total cost paid to the subscriber in relation to items 16  17  18 and 19  regardless of the number of share issuances).DilutionThe Company has approximately 3.3 billion registered shares. As per December 31  2022  the Company held approximately 4 million shares in treasury. The number of shares that may be required for ongoing LTV programs (2019  2020  2021 and 2022) as per December 31  2022  is estimated to approximately 4.9 million shares  corresponding to approximately 0.15 percent of the number of registered shares of the Company. In order to implement the LTV II 2023  a total of up to 5.9 million shares are required  which corresponds to approximately 0.18 percent of the total number of registered shares of the Company. Hence an issue of new shares is proposed for the implementation of LTV II 2023. The effect on important key figures is only marginal.17.2 Transfer of treasury stock to employees and on an exchange  directed share issue and acquisition offer for the LTV II 2023a. Transfer of treasury stock under the LTV II 2023Transfer of no more than 4.9 million shares of series B in the Company less any shares retained by the Company as per item 17.2 c) may occur on the following terms and conditions:The right to acquire shares shall be granted to such persons within the Ericsson Group covered by the terms and conditions pursuant to the LTV II 2023. Furthermore  subsidiaries within the Ericsson Group shall have the right to acquire shares  free of consideration  and such subsidiaries shall be obligated to immediately transfer  free of consideration  shares to employees covered by the terms and conditions of the LTV II 2023.The employee shall have the right to receive shares during the period when the employee is entitled to receive shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of the LTV II 2023  i.e. in 2026.Employees covered by the terms and conditions of the LTV II 2023 shall receive shares of series B in the Company free of consideration.The number of shares of series B in the Company that may be transferred under the LTV II 2023 may be subject to recalculation in the event of bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or similar measures  under the terms and conditions of the LTV II 2023.b. Transfer of treasury stock on an exchange to cover expensesThe Company may  prior to the AGM in 2024  transfer no more than 1.0 million shares of series B in the Company  in order to cover certain expenses  mainly social security payments. Transfer of the shares shall be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the  at each time  prevailing price interval for the share as disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm.c. Authorization to decide on transfer of treasury stock on an exchange to cover costs for tax and social security liabilities for the ParticipantsAuthorization for the Board of Directors to decide to  in conjunction with the delivery of vested shares under LTV II 2023  prior to the AGM in 2024  retain and sell no more than 60% of the vested shares of series B in the Company in order to cover for the costs for withholding and paying tax and social security liabilities on behalf of the Participants in relation to the Performance Share Awards for remittance to revenue authorities. Transfer of the shares shall be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the  at each time  prevailing price interval for the share as disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm. These shares form a part of the final number of vested shares to the employees under LTV II 2023 and do not incur additional costs to the LTV II 2023 for the Company.d.

These programs are an integral part of the Company's remuneration strategy as well as a part of the Company's talent management strategy. The Company has decided to implement two other share-related compensation programs for 2023: The Executive Performance Plan 2023 (""EPP 2023"") and the Key Contribution Plan 2023 (""KC Plan 2023""). Ericsson has also implemented an all-employee share purchase plan in 2021.The Executive Performance Plan 2023  implemented only in case the AGM 2023 would not resolve in favor of item 17The EPP 2023 is designed to attract  retain and motivate Executives in a competitive market through performance based long-term cash incentive supporting the achievement of the Company's long-term strategies and business objectives. Approximately 180 Executives will be eligible for the EPP 2023. Participants are assigned a potential award defined as a percentage of the participants' annual gross salary  which is converted into a number of synthetic shares based on the same market price of shares of series B in Ericsson used for the LTV I 2023 at the time of grant. Award levels are assigned to Executives in range of 0-45% of annual base pay.The vesting level of the awards  occurring after a three-year vesting period  is subject to the achievement of the same performance criteria as for the LTV I 2023  and generally requires that the participant retains his or her employment over the three-year vesting period. At the end of the vesting period  the allotted synthetic shares are converted into a cash amount  based on the market price of the shares of series B in Ericsson at Nasdaq Stockholm at the vesting date  and this final amount is paid to the Participant in cash gross before tax. It is estimated that approximately 2.5 million synthetic shares will be awarded under the EPP 2023. The maximum total cost effect of the EPP 2023 on the income statement  including social security fees  is estimated to be approximately SEK 700 million distributed over the years 2023-2026. The costs will depend on the future development of the market price of the shares of series B in Ericsson.The Key Contribution Plan 2023The KC Plan 2023 is designed to recognize the best talent  individual performance  potential and critical skills as well as encourage the retention of key employees. Approximately 10% to 14% of Ericsson employees will be eligible for the KC Plan 2023. The award levels are assigned to employees mainly within in a range of 10 ‚Äì 50% of Annual Base Salary to bring greater alignment with the local market conditions.Participants are assigned a potential award  which is converted into a number of synthetic shares based on the same market price of the shares of series B in Ericsson used for the LTV I 2023 at the time of grant. The plan has a three-year total service period (""Service Period"") during which the awards are paid on an annual rolling bases following the below payment schedule:25% of the award at the end of the first year 25% of the award at the end of the second year  and50% of the award at the end of the full Service Period.The value of each synthetic share is driven by the absolute share price performance of shares of series B in Ericsson shares during the Service Period. At the date of vesting for each instalment of the above-described annual rolling payment schedule  the synthetic shares are converted into a cash amount  based on the market price of the Ericsson series B share on Nasdaq Stockholm at the respective vesting date  and this final amount is paid to the Participant in cash gross before tax. It is estimated that approximately 31 million synthetic shares will be awarded under the KC Plan 2023. The maximum total cost effect of the KC Plan 2023 on the income statement  including social security fees  is estimated to be approximately SEK 5 billion distributed over the years 2023-2026. The costs will depend on the future development of the market price of the Ericsson series B share.The Ericsson share purchase plan (""ESPP"")Ericsson is committed to helping employees thrive and to recognizing them for the impact they create by providing opportunities to enrich their working experience. In order to encourage employees to play an active role in achieving the Company's purpose  further create sense of belonging and ownership  the ESPP was launched in November 2021 (in 58 countries to approximately 58 900 eligible employees)  with continued deployment in 2022 to 20 additional countries and 30 100 eligible employees. In total the ESPP is now live in 78 countries for 89 000 eligible employees of which 16 319 were actually saving at year-end 2022.The ESPP is an all-employee share purchase plan that enables employees to purchase shares of series B in Ericsson up to a maximum value of SEK 50 000 per year via monthly payroll deduction.

Under the ESPP participants will acquire shares of series B in Ericsson at market price on Nasdaq Stockholm and the ESPP does therefore not have any dilutive effect.The Company's ongoing variable compensation programs are described in further detail in the Annual Report 2022 in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements  Note G3: Share-based compensation and on the Company's website.Item 18 Resolution on transfer of treasury stock to employees and on an exchange  directed share issue and acquisition offer in relation to the earlier resolution on the LTV 2022BackgroundThe AGM in 2022 resolved to implement LTV 2022 and to secure the Company's undertakings under LTV 2022 through an equity swap agreement with a third party.

In comparison with the guidelines decided by the AGM 2020  the guidelines have been updated in order to:Adapt the guidelines to ensure the Company's business strategies and ways of working can be supported through the lifecycle of the guidelines;Clarify the mandate for the Board of Directors and Remuneration Committee to define meaningful short-term variable compensation (""STV"") targets linked to the business plan. This enables STV targets to be defined and weighed differently for different parts of the business given the phase in the business lifecycle they are in as required by the business strategy. Therefore  detailed requirements for mandatory weighting and definition of STV targets has been removed;Enable for the Board of Directors to potentially include STV in the remuneration package of the President and CEO. Any inclusion of STV for the future or current President and CEO will take into account the aggregated target opportunity of long-term variable compensation programs and STV; andBroaden the pension guidelines for Swedish members of the group management by removal of specific wordings related to the Swedish collective pension plan ITP1  to accommodate for potential future changes in collective pension plans and to allow for supplementary pension contributions or supplementary cash pension allowance  in excess of any caps of pension contributions allowed under collective pension plans.IntroductionThese Guidelines for Remuneration to Group Management (the ""Guidelines"") apply to the Executive Team of Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (the ""Company"" or ""Ericsson"")  including the President and Chief Executive Officer (the ""President and CEO"") (""Group Management""). These Guidelines apply to remuneration agreed and changes to previously agreed remuneration after the date of approval of the Guidelines and are intended to remain in place for four years until the Annual General Meeting of shareholders 2027. For employments outside of Sweden  due adaptations may be made to comply with mandatory local rules or established local practices. In such cases  the overall purpose of these Guidelines shall be accommodated to the largest extent possible. These Guidelines do not cover remuneration resolved by the general meeting of shareholders  such as long-term variable compensation programs (""LTV"").ObjectiveThese Guidelines aim to ensure alignment with the current remuneration philosophy and practices applicable for the Company's employees based on the principles of competitiveness  fairness  transparency  and performance. In particular to:attract and retain highly competent  performing  and motivated people that have the ability  experience  and skill to deliver on the Ericsson strategy;encourage behavior consistent with Ericsson's culture and core values;ensure fairness in reward by delivering total remuneration that is appropriate but not excessive  and clearly explained;have a total compensation mix of fixed pay  variable pay and benefits that is competitive where Ericsson competes for talent; andencourage variable remuneration which aligns employees with clear and relevant targets  reinforces their performance and enables flexible remuneration costs for Ericsson.The Guidelines and the Company's strategy and sustainable long-term interestA successful implementation of the Company's strategy and sustainable long-term interests requires that the Company can attract  retain  and motivate the right talent and can offer competitive remuneration. These Guidelines aim to allow the Company to offer the members of the Group Management attractive and competitive total remuneration. Variable compensation covered by these guidelines shall be awarded against specific pre-defined and measurable business targets derived from the short and long-term business plan approved by the Board of Directors. Targets will include financial targets at Group  Business Area and/or Market Area level. In addition  strategic targets  operational targets  employee engagement targets  customer satisfaction targets  sustainability and corporate responsibility targets or other lead indicator targets will be applied as deemed appropriate by the Remuneration Committee.The Company operates long-term variable compensation programs for the Group Management as approved by the Annual General Meeting (""AGM""). Such decisions are not covered by these Guidelines. Details of Ericsson's current remuneration policy and how we deliver on our policy and guidelines and information on previously decided long-term variable compensation programs that have not yet become due for payment  including applicable performance criteria  can be found in the Remuneration Report and in Note G2  ""Information regarding members of the Board of Directors  the Group management"" and Note G3  ""Share-based compensation"" in the annual report.Governance of remuneration to Group ManagementThe Board has established a Remuneration Committee (the ""Committee"") to handle compensation policies and principles and matters concerning remuneration to Group Management. The Board has authorized the Committee to determine and handle certain issues in specific areas. The Board may also on occasion provide extended authorization for the Committee to determine specific matters.The Committee is authorized to review and prepare for resolution by the Board salary and other remuneration for the President and CEO. Further  the Committee shall prepare for resolution by the Board proposals to the AGM on Guidelines for Remuneration to Group Management at least every fourth year and on Long-term Variable compensation programs and similar equity arrangements.The Committee has the mandate to resolve salary and other remuneration for the other members of Group Management except for the President and CEO  including targets for short-term variable compensation (""STV"")  and payout of STV based on achievements and performance.To conduct its responsibilities  the Committee considers trends in remuneration  legislative changes  disclosure rules and the general global executive remuneration environment. Before preparing salary adjustment recommendations for the President and CEO for resolution by the Board and approving any salary adjustments for the other members of Group Management the Committee reviews salary survey data  Company results and individual performance. No employee is present at the Committee's meetings when issues relating to their own remuneration are being discussed. Similarly  the President and CEO is not present at Board meetings when issues relating to the President and CEO's own remuneration are being discussed.

The dividend is proposed to be paid in two equal installments  SEK 1.35 per share with the record date March 31  2023  and SEK 1.35 per share with the record date September 29  2023. Assuming these dates will be the record dates  Euroclear Sweden AB is expected to disburse SEK 1.35 per share on April 5  2023  and SEK 1.35 per share on October 4  2023.Item 9 Number of Board members and deputies to be elected by the AGMAccording to the articles of association  the Board of Directors shall consist of no less than five and no more than twelve Board members  with no more than six deputies. The Nomination Committee proposes that the number of Board members elected by the AGM shall be ten (previously eleven) and that no deputies be elected.Item 10 Fees payable to members of the Board of Directors elected by the AGM and to members of the Committees of the Board of Directors elected by the AGMThe Nomination Committee proposes that fees to non-employee Board members elected by the AGM and non-employee members of the Committees of the Board of Directors elected by the AGM be paid as follows:SEK 4 500 000 to the Chair of the Board of Directors ( previously SEK 4 375 000 );to the Chair of the Board of Directors ( ); SEK 1 140 000 to each of the other Board members ( previously SEK 1 100 000 ) ;to each of the other Board members ( ) SEK 495 000 to the Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee ( previously SEK 475 000 );to the Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee ( ); SEK 285 000 to each of the other members of the Audit and Compliance Committee ( previously SEK 275 000 );to each of the other members of the Audit and Compliance Committee ( ); SEK 210 000 to each Chair of the Finance  the Remuneration and the Technology and Science Committee (previously SEK 205 000 ) ; andto each Chair of the Finance  the Remuneration and the Technology and Science Committee ; and SEK 185 000 to each of the other members of the Finance  the Remuneration and the Technology and Science Committee (previously SEK 180 000 ).The Nomination Committee considered the Board fees with the objective of ensuring that they allow for the recruitment and retention of high quality individuals while also being appropriate in comparison to other technology companies operating globally and with similar size and complexity. As such  the Nomination Committee has concluded that an increase of the fees to all members of the Board and Board Committees  including their Chairs  in accordance with the above is reasonable  well-justified and in the best interests of the Company. The proposal of the Nomination Committee provides for an increase of the fees of approximately 3.3%[1] compared with the total fees to the corresponding number of Board and Committee members for Board and Committee work resolved by the Annual General Meeting 2022.Fees in the form of synthetic sharesBackgroundThe Nomination Committee believes that it is appropriate that Board members elected by the shareholders hold shares in Ericsson  in order to strengthen the Board members' and the shareholders' mutual interests in the Company. The Nomination Committee recommends that Board members elected by the shareholders  over a five year period  build a holding of shares or synthetic shares in Ericsson equal to at least the value of the annual Board fee (excluding fees for Committee work)  and that such holding be kept during the time the Board member remain Board member in Ericsson.To enable Board members to create an economic interest in the Company and considering that it is in many cases difficult for Board members to trade in the Company's share due to applicable insider rules  the Nomination Committee proposes that the Board members should  as previously  be offered the option of receiving part of the Board fees in the form of synthetic shares. A synthetic share constitutes a right to receive payment of an amount which corresponds to the market value of a share of series B in the Company on Nasdaq Stockholm at the time of payment.ProposalThe Nomination Committee therefore proposes that the AGM 2023 resolve that part of the fees to the Board member  in respect of their Board assignment (however  not in respect of Committee work)  may be paid in the form of synthetic shares  on the following terms and conditions.A nominated Board member shall be able to choose to receive the fee in respect of his or her Board assignment  according to the following four alternatives:25 percent in cash ‚Äì 75 percent in synthetic shares50 percent in cash ‚Äì 50 percent in synthetic shares75 percent in cash ‚Äì 25 percent in synthetic shares100 percent in cash.The number of synthetic shares to be allocated shall be valued at the average of the market price of shares of series B in the Company on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of five trading days immediately following the publication of Ericsson's interim report for the first quarter of 2023. The synthetic shares are vested during the term of office  with 25 percent per quarter of the year.The synthetic shares give a right to  following the publication of Ericsson's year-end financial statement in 2028  receive payment of a cash amount per synthetic share corresponding to the market price of shares of series B in the Company in close connection with the time of payment.An amount corresponding to dividend in respect of shares of series B in the Company  resolved by the AGM during the holding period  shall be disbursed at the same time as the cash amount.Should the Board member's assignment to the Board of Directors come to an end no later than during the third calendar year after the year in which the AGM resolved on allocation of the synthetic shares  payment may take place the year after the assignment came to an end.The number of synthetic shares may be subject to recalculation in the event of bonus issues  splits  rights issues and similar measures  under the terms and conditions for the synthetic shares.The complete terms and conditions for the synthetic shares are described in Exhibit 1 to the Nomination Committee's proposal.The financial difference for the Company  should all Board members receive part of their fees in the form of synthetic shares compared with the fees being paid in cash only  is assessed to be limited.Item 11 Election of Board members and deputies of the Board of DirectorsProposalsThe Nomination Committee proposes that the following persons be re-elected Board members:Jon Fredrik Baksaas; Jan Carlson ; Carolina Dybeck Happe ; B√∂rje Ekholm; Eric A. Elzvik; Kristin S. Rinne ; Helena Stjernholm ; and Jacob Wallenberg .The Nomination Committee proposes that the following two persons be elected as new Board members:Jonas Synnergren; and Christy Wyatt .Item 12 Election of the Chair of the Board of DirectorsThe Nomination Committee proposes that Jan Carlson be elected Chair of the Board of Directors (new election).Information regarding proposed Board members and Chair (Item 11 and 12)Information regarding the proposed Board members and Chair is presented in Exhibit 2 to the Nomination Committee's proposal.ConsiderationsThe Nomination Committee primarily searches for potential Board member candidates for the upcoming mandate period  but also considers future competence needs. It is a long journey to identify the right candidates and long-term planning is essential. In assessing the appropriate composition of the Board of Directors  the Nomination Committee considers  among other things  experience and competence needed on the Board and its Committees  and the value of diversity in age  gender and cultural/geographic background as well as the need for renewal. The Nomination Committee believes that diversity on the Board will support Ericsson's sustainable development and therefore continually focuses on identifying Board member candidates with different backgrounds. While acknowledging increased expectations on transparency relating to diversity on the Board  applicable privacy regulations prevent Ericsson and the Nomination Committee from processing certain sensitive personal data about its Board members  such as information relating to demographic background. The Nomination Committee has applied the Swedish Corporate Governance Code  Section 4.1  as diversity policy. Focusing on improving the gender balance over time  the Nomination Committee particularly works to identify women candidates matching the current and future needs of the Board. The Nomination Committee also assesses the appropriateness of the number of Board members and whether the Board members can devote the necessary time required to fulfill their tasks as Board members in Ericsson.In its appraisal of qualifications and performance of the individual Board members  the Nomination Committee takes into account the competence and experience of each individual member along with the individual member's contribution to the Board work as a whole and to the Committee work. The Committee has familiarized itself with the results of the Board work evaluation that was led by the Chair of the Board of Directors. The Nomination Committee's objective is to propose and support the election of a Board that is comprised of individuals of the highest competency and integrity  while also holistically comprising a strong mix of needed skills and experience to effectively oversee and lead Ericsson.The Nomination Committee is of the opinion that the current Board of Directors and Board work is well functioning. Further  it is the Nomination Committee's view that the Board fulfills expectations in terms of composition and that the Board of Directors as well as the individual Board members fulfill expectations in terms of expertise. Competencies and experiences represented on the Board include broad international industry experience  experience from the telecom  IT and ICT sectors  technological and technical competencies and experiences (e.g. related to software and digitalization)  financial expertise and experience from private equity  M&A and new business. The Nomination Committee further believes that competencies and experiences within the Environmental  Social and Governance areas considered most relevant for Ericsson and the sector in which the Company operates are well represented on the Board  including for example related to the technologies the Company develops and delivers as well as relating to ethics and compliance. While the Board is well functioning and has a strong composition  the Nomination Committee believes that the Board would benefit from additional expertise within the software  technology and enterprise area.Ronnie Leten  Kurt Jofs and Nora Denzel have informed the Nomination Committee that they will not stand for re-election at the AGM 2023. The Nomination Committee proposes re-election of current Board members Jon Fredrik Baksaas  Jan Carlson  Carolina Dybeck Happe  B√∂rje Ekholm  Eric A. Elzvik  Kristin S. Rinne  Helena Stjernholm and Jacob Wallenberg  and new election of Jonas Synnergren and Christy Wyatt as members of the Board. Jonas Synnergren has long-term international business experience as a Board member of Tieto Oyj and Veoneer Inc. and is currently a Board member of Nordea Oyj. In addition  Jonas Synnergren is Senior Partner in Cevian Capital AB  one of Ericsson's shareholders. Christy Wyatt has long-term international business experience from senior management roles within Motorola  Good Technology and DTEX Systems and is currently the President and CEO of Absolute Software.It is the Nomination Committee's assessment that the proposed new Chair of the Board of Directors  Jan Carlson  with his long career both as CEO and Chairman  good knowledge of Ericsson after serving many years on the Board  international experience  technology background and personal qualities will be an excellent successor as Chair of the Board. Further  it is the Nomination Committee's assessment that each of the proposed Board members  with their respective experiences  adds valuable expertise and experience to the Board  and that Jonas Synnergren's and Christy Wyatt's extensive international business experiences and deep software  enterprise and technology expertise will be of additional value to Ericsson and will further strengthen the Board.Out of the proposed Board members to be elected by the AGM of shareholders (excluding the President and CEO) 44% are women. Gender balance continues to be a key priority for the Nomination Committee  and the Committee works to improve the gender balance on the Board of Directors over time.Independence of Board membersThe Nomination Committee has made the following assessments in terms of applicable independence requirements:1. The Nomination Committee considers that the following Board members are independent of the Company and its senior management:a. Jon Fredrik Baksaasb. Jan Carlsonc. Carolina Dybeck Happed. Eric A. Elzvike. Kristin S. Rinnef. Helena Stjernholmg. Jonas Synnergrenh. Jacob Wallenbergi. Christy Wyatt2. From among the Board members reported in (i) above  the Nomination Committee considers that at least the following are independent of the Company's major shareholders:a. Jon Fredrik Baksaasb. Jan Carlsonc. Carolina Dybeck Happed. Eric A. Elzvike. Kristin S. Rinnef. Jonas Synnergreng. Christy WyattMoreover  the Nomination Committee considers that at least the following Board members are independent in respect of all applicable independence requirements:a. Jon Fredrik Baksaasb. Jan Carlsonc. Carolina Dybeck Happed. Eric A. Elzvike. Kristin S. Rinnef. Jonas Synnergreng. Christy WyattThe Nomination Committee concludes that the proposed composition of the Board of Directors meets the independence requirements applicable to Ericsson.Item 13 Number of auditorsAccording to the articles of association  the Company shall have no less than one and no more than three registered public accounting firms as auditor. The Nomination Committee proposes that the Company should have one registered public accounting firm as auditor.Item 14 Fees payable to the auditorThe Nomination Committee proposes  like previous years  that the auditor fees be paid against approved account.Item 15 Election of auditorIn accordance with the recommendation by the Audit and Compliance Committee  the Nomination Committee proposes that Deloitte AB be appointed auditor for the period from the end of the AGM 2023 until the end of the AGM 2024 (re-election).Item 16 Implementation of LTV I 2023 including transfer of treasury stock  directed share issue and authorization for the Board of Directors to decide on an acquisition offer of shares of series CBackgroundThe Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors evaluate the long-term variable compensation (""LTV"") programs to the Executive Team (""ET"") on an ongoing basis. The evaluation considers the LTV programs for effectiveness in serving their purpose to support achieving the Ericsson Group's strategic business objectives and sustainable long-term interests as well as their facility to increase the long-term focus of the members of the ET and align their interests with the long-term expectations and the interests of the shareholders.Upon evaluation of the currently ongoing LTV programs for 2020  2021 and 2022  the Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors concluded that these ongoing LTV programs  which are all in essence the same in terms of plan structure  performance criteria and performance periods  enabled the Company to achieve its long-term objectives. The ongoing LTV programs further enabled the Company to remain committed to the targets for 2023 as well as the long-term target of 15-18% adjusted earnings (loss) before interest  taxes  amortization and write-downs of acquired intangible assets (""EBITA"")  in turn creating increased shareholder value. In order to further strengthen both Ericsson's and the ET's commitment to long-term sustainability and responsible business  the Board of Directors  upon recommendation from the Remuneration Committee  has concluded to propose to the AGM 2023 an LTV I 2023 for the ET.LTV I 2023 is an integral part of the Company's remuneration strategy and the Board of Directors in particular expects the members of the ET to build significant equity holdings to align the interests and expectations of the LTV program participants with those of shareholders.Proposals16.1 Implementation of the LTV I 2023The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolve on the LTV I 2023 for ET members comprising a maximum of 4.1 million shares of series B in the Company as set out below.Objectives of the LTV programThe LTV program is designed to provide long-term incentives for members of the ET (""Participants"")  thereby creating long-term value for the shareholders. The aim is to attract  retain and motivate executives in a competitive market through performance-based share related incentives  to encourage the build-up of significant equity holdings to align the interests of the Participants with those of shareholders and to further strengthen the ET's commitment to long-term sustainability and responsible business.The LTV Program in briefThe LTV Program is proposed to include all members (current and future) of the ET  currently comprising of 17 employees  including the President and CEO. Awards under LTV I 2023 (""Performance Share Awards"") will be granted free of charge entitling the Participant  provided that i.e. certain performance criteria set out below are met  to receive a number of shares  free of charge  following expiration of a three-year vesting period (""Vesting Period""). Allotment of shares pursuant to Performance Share Awards will be subject to the achievement of performance criteria  as set out below  and will generally require that the Participant retains his or her employment over the Vesting Period. All major decisions relating to LTV I 2023 will be taken by the Remuneration Committee  with approval by the full Board of Directors as required.Granting of Performance Share AwardsGranting of Performance Share Awards to the Participants will generally take place as soon as practicably possible following the AGM 2023. For 2023  the value of the underlying shares in respect of the Performance Share Awards made to the President and CEO will not exceed 190% of the Annual Base Salary at the time of grant  and for other Participants  the value will not exceed 70% of the Participants' respective Annual Base Salary at the time of grant  unless the Participant is employed in the USA where the value will not exceed 100% of Participants' Annual Base Salary.The share price used to calculate the number of shares to which the Performance Share Awards entitle will be the volume-weighted average of the market price of shares of series B in Ericsson on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five trading days immediately following the publication of the Company's interim report for the fourth quarter 2022.Performance criteriaThe vesting of the Performance Share Awards will be subject to the satisfaction of performance criteria related to 2023 Group EBITA (earnings (loss) before interest  taxes  amortizations and write-downs of acquired intangible) (operating income) performance criterion  along with three-year total shareholder return (""TSR"" [2])  and Group Environmental Social Governance (""ESG"") performance criteria  which will determine what portion (if any) of the Performance Share Awards will vest at the end of the Vesting Period.The 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion relates to 45% of the Performance Share Awards and the maximum vesting level is 200%.The performance criteria based on TSR are absolute TSR development and relative TSR development for the Ericsson series B share over the period January 1  2023 ‚Äì December 31  2025 (""Performance Period"" [3]). The absolute and relative TSR performance criteria relate to 25% and 20%  respectively  of the Performance Share Awards and the maximum vesting level for both TSR performance criteria is 200%.The Group ESG performance criterion measured over the Performance Period will relate to 10% of the Performance Share Awards  and the maximum vesting level is 200%.The following conditions will apply to the performance criteria:2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion45% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion for the 2023 financial year. The 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion established by the Board of Directors will stipulate a minimum level and a maximum level. The 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) target is not disclosed due to stock market and competition considerations. The vesting level of Performance Share Awards related to 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion will be determined by the Board of Directors when the audited result for the financial year 2023 is available.If the maximum performance level is reached or exceeded  the vesting will amount to (and will not exceed) the maximum level of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to the 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion. If performance is below the maximum level but exceeds the minimum level  a linear pro-rata vesting of shares will occur. No vesting will occur if performance amounts to or is below the minimum level. The allotment of the shares will not occur until the end of the Vesting Period in 2026.TSR performance criteriaAbsolute TSR performance criterion25% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfillment of an absolute TSR performance criterion over the Performance Period. If the absolute TSR development reaches or exceeds 14% per annum compounded  the maximum vesting of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to absolute TSR performance criterion will occur. If the absolute TSR development is below or reaches only 6% per annum compounded  no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to the absolute TSR performance criterion. A linear pro-rata vesting from 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to absolute TSR performance criterion will apply if the Company's absolute TSR performance is between 6% and 14% per annum compounded.Relative TSR performance criterion20% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a relative TSR performance criterion over the Performance Period  compared to a peer group consisting of 11 peer companies (""Peer Group""[4]). The vesting of the relative TSR related Performance Share Awards varies depending on the Company's TSR performance ranking versus the other companies in the Peer Group. If the Company's relative TSR performance is below the TSR development of the company ranked 6th in the Peer Group  no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to relative TSR performance criterion. Vesting of the Performance Share Awards related to relative TSR performance criterion will occur at the following percentage levels  based on which ranking position in the Peer Group the Company's TSR performance corresponds to:Position within the Peer Group Associated vesting percentage level6 or lower 0%5 50%4 100%3 150%2 or higher 200%If the Company's TSR performance is between two of the ranked companies  a linear pro-rata vesting will apply between the vesting percentage levels for the relevant ranked positions.Group ESG performance criterion10% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a Group ESG performance criterion comprised of two equally weighted subcomponents covering environmental and social aspects of ESG measured over the Performance Period.Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions5% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfillment of a subcomponent of reducing greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions [5] from service fleet vehicles  energy consumption at facilities and from business travel [6].Subcomponent target- and corresponding achievement levels are defined in the schedule below and broken down for each of the three years [7] covered by the Performance Period. Vesting is determined at the end of each year  with each year corresponding to one third (1/3) of the total subcomponent Performance Share Awards. A linear pro-rata vesting of one third (1/3) of 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to reducing emissions in the subcomponent will apply if reported emissions in scope are between the minimum and maximum vesting levels for each of the years covered by the Performance Period. An illustrative example is included below.These target levels are aligned to the emissions reduction trajectory set for achieving Net Zero emissions from the Ericsson Group's own activities by 2030.Achievement GHG emissions target levels for emission in scope by fiscal year (ktonne CO2e)(%) 2023 2024 20250 142 132 122100 135 126 116200 121 113 104Illustrative example: first  if reported emissions in scope for the year 2023 are 121 ktonne  the maximum vesting of one third of 200% (1/3 x 200% = 66.67%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent and year will occur. Next  if reported emissions for the year 2024 are 126 ktonne  vesting of one third of 100% (1/3 x 100% = 33.33%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent and fiscal year will occur. Last  if reported emissions in scope for the year 2025 are 122 ktonne  no vesting (1/3 x 0% = 0.00%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent will occur. Consequently  in this example total vesting of the Performance Share Award related to this subcomponent over the Performance Period will be (66.67% + 33.33% + 0.00%) 100%.Increasing the representation of women leaders in Ericsson5% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a subcomponent of increasing the representation of women leaders (i.e. women holding roles with people management responsibility) in the Ericsson Group to 24% by the end of the Performance Period  which is in line with achieving the target trajectory for increasing the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group to 30% by 2030.If the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group amounts to 25% or above by the end of the Performance Pe riod  the maximum vesting of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent will occur. If the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group amounts to 23% or below by the end of the Performance Period  no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent. A linear pro-rata vesting from 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to increasing the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group subcomponent will apply if the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group exceeds 23% but is below 25% by the end of the Performance Period.The vesting level of Performance Share Awards related to the Group ESG performance criterion will be determined by the Board of Directors when the audited results for both subcomponents at the end of the financial year 2025 are available.Information about the outcome of the performance criteria will be provided no later than in the annual report for the financial year 2025.Allotment of sharesProvided that the performance criteria above have been met and that the Participant has retained his or her employment (unless special circumstances are at hand) during the Vesting Period  allotment of vested shares will take place as soon as practicably possible following the expiration of the Vesting Period.When determining the final vesting level of Performance Share Awards  the Board of Directors shall examine whether the vesting level is reasonable considering the Company's financial results and position  conditions on the stock market and other circumstances  such as environmental  social  ethics and compliance factors  and if not  as determined by the Board of Directors  reduce the vesting level to the lower level deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors.In the event delivery of shares to Participants cannot take place under applicable law or at a reasonable cost and employing reasonable administrative measures  the Board of Directors will be entitled to decide that Participants may  instead  be offered a cash settlement.The Company has the right to  before delivering vested shares to the Participants  retain and sell the number of shares required to cover the cost for withholding and paying tax and social security liabilities on behalf of the Participants in relation to the Performance Share Awards for remittance to revenue authorities. In such an event  net amount of vested shares will thus be delivered to the Participants after the vested Performance Share Awards are reduced by the number of shares retained by the Company for such purposes.FinancingThe Board of Directors has considered different financing methods for transfer of shares under the LTV I 2023 such as transfer of treasury stock and an equity swap agreement with a third party. The Board of Directors considers that a directed issue of shares of series C in the Company  followed by buy-back and transfer of treasury stock is the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer shares under the LTV I 2023.The Company's current holding of treasury stock is not sufficient for the implementation of the LTV I 2023. Therefore  the Board of Directors proposes a directed share issue and buy back of shares as further set out below under item 16.2. Under the proposed transactions  shares are issued at the share's quota value and repurchased as soon as the shares have been subscribed for and registered. The purchase price paid by the Company to the subscriber equals the subscription price. As compensation to the subscriber for its assistance in the issuance and buy-back of shares under items 16  17  18 and 19 the Company will pay to the subscriber an amount totaling SEK 100 000.The procedure of issuance and buy-back of shares for the Company's LTV programs has previously been decided by the AGMs in 2001  2003  2008  2009  2012  2016  and 2017.Since the costs for the Company in connection with an equity swap agreement will be significantly higher than the costs in connection with transfer of treasury stock  the main alternative is that the financial exposure is secured by transfer of treasury stock and that an equity swap agreement with a third party is an alternative in the event that the required majority for approval is not reached.CostsThe total effect on the income statement of the LTV I 2023  including financing costs and social security fees  is estimated to range between SEK 100 million and SEK 230 million distributed over the years 2023-2026. The costs will depend on the future development of the price of Ericsson series B share.The administration cost for transfer of shares by way of an equity swap agreement is currently estimated to approximately SEK 30 million  compared to the cost of approximately SEK 100 000 for using newly issued and acquired shares in treasury (SEK 100 000 is the total cost paid to the subscriber in relation to items 16  17  18 and 19  regardless of the number of share issuances).DilutionThe Company has approximately 3.3 billion registered shares. As per December 31  2022  the Company held approximately 4 million shares in treasury. The number of shares that may be required for ongoing LTV programs (2019  2020  2021 and 2022) as per December 31  2022  is estimated to approximately 4.9 million shares  corresponding to approximately 0.15 percent of the number of registered shares of the Company. In order to implement the LTV I 2023  a total of up to 4.1 million shares are required  which corresponds to approximately 0.12 percent of the total number of registered shares of the Company  hence an issue of new shares is proposed for the implementation of LTV I 2023. The effect on important key figures is only marginal.16.2 Transfer of treasury stock to employees and on an exchange  directed share issue and acquisition offer for the LTV I 2023a. Transfer of treasury stock under the LTV I 2023Transfer of no more than 3.4 million shares of series B in the Company less any shares retained by the Company as per item 16.2 c) may occur on the following terms and conditions:The right to acquire shares shall be granted to such persons within the Ericsson Group covered by the terms and conditions pursuant to the LTV I 2023.

Transfer of treasury stock on an exchange to cover expensesThe Company may  prior to the AGM in 2024  transfer no more than 700 000 shares of series B in the Company  in order to cover certain expenses  mainly social security payments. Transfer of the shares shall be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the  at each time  prevailing price interval for the share as disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm.c. Authorization to decide on transfer of treasury stock on an exchange to cover costs for tax and social security liabilities for the ParticipantsAuthorization for the Board of Directors to decide to  in conjunction with the delivery of vested shares under LTV I 2023  prior to the AGM in 2024  retain and sell no more than 60% of the vested shares of series B in the Company in order to cover for the costs for withholding and paying tax and social security liabilities on behalf of the Participants in relation to the Performance Share Awards for remittance to revenue authorities. Transfer of the shares shall be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the  at each time  prevailing price interval for the share as disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm. These shares form a part of the final number of vested shares to the employees under LTV I 2023 and do not incur additional costs to the LTV I 2023 for the Company.d. Directed issue of shares of series C in the CompanyIncrease of the share capital in the Company with SEK 20 500 000.01 by an issue of 4.1 million shares of series C in the Company  each share with a quota value of approximately SEK 5. The terms and conditions of the share issue are the following:The new shares shall ‚Äì with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights ‚Äì be subscribed for only by Investor AB or its subsidiaries.The new shares shall be subscribed for during the period as from Thursday  April 27  2023   up to and including Tuesday  May 2  2023 . Over-subscription may not occur.  up to and including . Over-subscription may not occur. The amount that shall be paid for each new share shall be the quota value (approximately SEK 5 ).). Payment for the subscribed shares shall be made at the time of subscription.The Board of Directors shall be entitled to extend the period for subscription and payment.The new shares shall not entitle the holders to dividend payment.It is noted that the new shares are subject to restrictions pursuant to Chapter 4  Section 6 (conversion clause) and Chapter 20  Section 31 (redemption clause) of the Swedish Companies Act.The Board of Directors proposes that the President and CEO shall be authorized to make the minor adjustments to the above resolutions that may prove to be necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Reasons for deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and principles on which the subscription price is basedThe Board of Directors considers that a directed issue of shares of series C in the Company  followed by buy-back and transfer of treasury stock is the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer shares under the LTV I 2023. Shares are issued at the share's quota value and repurchased as soon as the shares have been subscribed for and registered. The purchase price paid by the Company to the subscriber equals the subscription price.e. Authorization for the Board of Directors to decide on a directed acquisition offerAuthorization for the Board of Directors to decide that 4.1 million shares of series C in Ericsson be acquired according to the following:Acquisition may occur by an offer to acquire shares directed to all holders of shares of series C in Ericsson.The authorization may be exercised until the AGM in 2024.The acquisition shall be made at a price corresponding to the quota value of the share (approximately SEK 5 per share).per share).Payment for acquired shares shall be made in cash.16.3 Equity Swap Agreement with third party in relation to the LTV I 2023In the event that the required majority for approval is not reached under item 16.2 above  the financial exposure of the LTV I 2023 shall be hedged by the Company entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party  under which the third party shall  in its own name  acquire and transfer shares of series B in the Company to employees covered by the LTV I 2023.Majority rulesThe resolution of the AGM on implementation of the LTV I 2023 according to item 16.1 requires that more than half of the votes cast at the AGM approve the proposal. The resolution of the AGM on transfer of treasury stock to employees and on an exchange  directed share issue and acquisition offer for the LTV I 2023 according to item 16.2 requires that shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the AGM approve the proposal. The resolution of the AGM on an Equity Swap Agreement with third party according to item 16.3 requires that more than half of the votes cast at the AGM approve the proposal.Item 17 Implementation of LTV II 2023 including transfer of treasury stock  directed share issue and authorization for the Board of Directors to decide on an acquisition offerBackgroundIn addition to the LTV programs for the President and CEO and members of the ET  Ericsson has since 2017 operated a performance-based long-term variable compensation program for employees classified as Executives (approximately 180 employees) (the Ericsson Executive Performance Plan (""EPP"")). The EPP is identical to the LTV I  with the exception that the EPP is cash settled. The Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors have evaluated whether to implement an additional long-term variable compensation program  LTV II 2023  for Executives with delivery of shares of series B in Ericsson instead of cash settlement to further strengthen both Ericsson's and the Executives' commitment to long-term sustainability and responsible business. The Board of Directors  upon recommendation from the Remuneration Committee  has concluded to propose to the AGM 2023 the LTV II 2023 for Executives.LTV II 2023 is an integral part of the Company's remuneration strategy  and the Board of Directors in particular expects the Executives to build significant equity holdings to align the interests and expectations of the LTV program participants with those of shareholders.The criteria and vesting period for LTV II 2023 are the same as for LTV I 2023. Should the AGM 2023 not vote in favor of the proposal of implementing LTV II 2023 the EPP 2023 will be implemented.Proposals17.1 Implementation of the LTV II 2023The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolve on the LTV II 2023 for Executives  comprising a maximum of 5.9 million shares of series B in the Company as set out below.Objectives of the LTV programThe LTV program is designed to provide long-term incentives for Executives (""Participants"")  thereby creating long-term value for the shareholders. The aim is to attract  retain and motivate Executives in a competitive market through performance-based share related incentives  to encourage the build-up of significant equity holdings to align the interests of the Participants with those of shareholders and to further strengthen Ericsson's and the Executives' commitment to long-term sustainability and responsible business.The LTV program in briefThe LTV program is proposed to include all Executives (current and future)  currently comprising of 180 employees  excluding the President and CEO and ET. Awards under LTV II 2023 (""Performance Share Awards"") will be granted free of charge entitling the Participant  provided that i.e. certain performance criteria set out below are met  to receive a number of shares  free of charge  following expiration of a three-year vesting period (""Vesting Period""). Allotment of shares pursuant to Performance Share Awards will be subject to the achievement of performance criteria  as set out below  and will generally require that the Participant retains his or her employment over the Vesting Period. All major decisions relating to LTV II 2023 will be taken by the Remuneration Committee  with approval by the full Board of Directors as required.Granting of Performance Share AwardsGranting of Performance Share Awards to the Participants will generally take place as soon as practicably possible following the AGM 2023. For 2023  the value of the underlying shares in respect of the Performance Share Awards made to the Participants  will not exceed 70% of the Participants' respective Annual Base Salary at the time of grant  unless the Participant is employed in the USA where the value will not exceed 100% of Participant's Annual Base Salary.The share price used to calculate the number of shares to which the Performance Share Awards entitle will be the volume-weighted average of the market price of shares of series B in the Company on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five trading days immediately following the publication of the Company's interim report for the fourth quarter 2022.Performance criteriaThe vesting of the Performance Share Awards will be subject to the satisfaction of performance criteria related to 2023 Group EBITA (earnings (loss) before interest  taxes  amortizations and write-downs of acquired intangible) (operating income) performance criterion  along with three-year total shareholder return (""TSR"" [8])  and Group ESG performance criteria  which will determine what portion (if any) of the Performance Share Awards will vest at the end of the Vesting Period.The 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion relates to 45% of the Performance Share Awards and the maximum vesting level is 200%.The performance criteria based on TSR are absolute TSR development and relative TSR development for the shares of series B in Ericsson over the period January 1  2023 ‚Äì December 31  2025 (""Performance Period"" [9]). The absolute and relative TSR performance criteria relate to 25% and 20%  respectively  of the Performance Share Awards and the maximum vesting level for both TSR performance criteria is 200%.The Group ESG performance criterion measured over the Performance Period will relate to 10% of the Performance Share Awards  and the maximum vesting level is 200%.The following conditions will apply to the performance criteria:2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion45% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion for the 2023 financial year. The 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion established by the Board of Directors will stipulate a minimum level and a maximum level. The 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) target is not disclosed due to stock market and competition considerations. The vesting level of Performance Share Awards related to 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion will be determined by the Board of Directors when the audited result for the financial year 2023 is available.If the maximum performance level is reached or exceeded  the vesting will amount to (and will not exceed) the maximum level of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to the 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion. If performance is below the maximum level but exceeds the minimum level  a linear pro-rata vesting of shares will occur. No vesting will occur if performance amounts to or is below the minimum level. The allotment of the shares will not occur until the end of the Vesting Period in 2026.TSR performance criteriaAbsolute TSR performance criterion25% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of an absolute TSR performance criterion over the Performance Period. If the absolute TSR development reaches or exceeds 14% per annum compounded  the maximum vesting of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to absolute TSR performance criterion will occur. If the absolute TSR development is below or reaches only 6% per annum compounded  no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to the absolute TSR performance criterion. A linear pro-rata vesting from 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to absolute TSR performance criterion will apply if the Company's absolute TSR performance is between 6% and 14% per annum compounded.Relative TSR performance criterion20% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a relative TSR performance criterion over the Performance Period  compared to a peer group consisting of 11 peer companies (""Peer Group""[10]). The vesting of the relative TSR related Performance Share Awards varies depending on the Company's TSR performance ranking versus the other companies in the Peer Group. If the Company's relative TSR performance is below the TSR development of the company ranked 6th in the Peer Group  no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to relative TSR performance criterion. Vesting of the Performance Share Awards related to relative TSR performance criterion will occur at the following percentage levels  based on which ranking position in the Peer Group the Company's TSR performance corresponds to:Position within the Peer Group Associated vesting percentage level6 or lower 0%5 50%4 100%3 150%2 or higher 200%If the Company's TSR performance is between two of the ranked companies  a linear pro-rata vesting will apply between the vesting percentage levels for the relevant ranked positions.Group ESG performance criterion10% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a Group ESG performance criterion comprised of two equally weighted subcomponents covering environmental and social aspects of ESG measured over the Performance Period.Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions5% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfillment of a subcomponent of reducing greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions [11] from service fleet vehicles  energy consumption at facilities and from business travel [12].Subcomponent target and corresponding achievement levels are defined in the schedule below and broken down for each of the three years [13] covered by the Performance Period. Vesting is determined at the end of each year  with each year corresponding to one third (1/3) of the total subcomponent Performance Share Awards. A linear pro-rata vesting of one third (1/3) of 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to reducing emissions in the subcomponent will apply if reported emissions in scope are between the minimum and maximum vesting levels for each of the years covered by the Performance Period. An illustrative example is included below.These target levels are aligned to the emissions reduction trajectory set for achieving Net Zero emissions from the Ericsson Group's own activities by 2030.Achievement GHG emissions target levels for emission in scope by fiscal year (ktonne CO2e)(%) 2023 2024 20250 142 132 122100 135 126 116200 121 113 104Illustrative example: first  if reported emissions in scope for the year 2023 are 121 ktonne  the maximum vesting of one third of 200% (1/3 x 200% = 66.67%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent and year will occur. Next  if reported emissions for the year 2024 are 126 ktonne  vesting of one third of 100% (1/3 x 100% = 33.33%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent and fiscal year will occur. Last  if reported emissions in scope for the year 2025 are 122 ktonne  no vesting (1/3 x 0% = 0.00%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent will occur. Consequently  in this example total vesting of the Performance Share Award related to this subcomponent over the Performance Period will be (66.67% + 33.33% + 0.00%) 100%.Increasing the representation of women leaders in Ericsson5% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a subcomponent of increasing the representation of women leaders (i.e. women holding roles with people management responsibility) in the Ericsson Group to 24% by the end of the Performance Period  which is in line with achieving the target trajectory for increasing the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group to 30% by 2030.If the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group amounts to 25% or above by the end of the Performance Period  the maximum vesting of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent will occur. If the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group amounts to 23% or below by the end of the Performance Period  no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent. A linear pro-rata vesting from 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to increasing the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group subcomponent will apply if the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group exceeds 23% but is below 25% by the end of the Performance Period.The vesting level of Performance Share Awards related to the Group ESG performance criterion will be determined by the Board of Directors when the audited results for both subcomponents at the end of the financial year 2025 are available.Information about the outcome of the performance criteria will be provided no later than in the annual report for the financial year 2025.Allotment of sharesProvided that the performance criteria above have been met and that the Participant has retained his or her employment (unless special circumstances are at hand) during the Vesting Period  allotment of vested shares will take place as soon as practicably possible following the expiration of the Vesting Period.When determining the final vesting level of Performance Share Awards  the Board of Directors shall examine whether the vesting level is reasonable considering the Company's financial results and position  conditions on the stock market and other circumstances  such as environmental  social  ethics and compliance factors  and if not  as determined by the Board of Directors  reduce the vesting level to the lower level deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors.In the event delivery of shares to Participants cannot take place under applicable law or at a reasonable cost and employing reasonable administrative measures  the Board of Directors will be entitled to decide that Participants may  instead  be offered a cash settlement.The Company has the right to  before delivering vested shares to the Participants  retain and sell the number of shares required to cover the cost for withholding and paying tax and social security liabilities on behalf of the Participants in relation to the Performance Share Awards for remittance to revenue authorities. In such an event  net amount of vested shares will thus be delivered to the Participants after the vested Performance Share Awards are reduced by the number of shares retained by the Company for such purposes.FinancingThe Board of Directors has considered different financing methods for transfer of shares under the LTV II 2023 such as transfer of treasury stock and an equity swap agreement with a third party. The Board of Directors considers that a directed issue of shares of series C in the Company  followed by buy-back and transfer of treasury stock is the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer shares under the LTV II 2023.The Company's current holding of treasury stock is not sufficient for the implementation of the LTV II 2023. Therefore  the Board of Directors proposes a directed share issue and buy back of shares as further set out below under item 17.2. Under the proposed transactions  shares are issued at the share's quota value and repurchased as soon as the shares have been subscribed for and registered. The purchase price paid by the Company to the subscriber equals the subscription price. As compensation to the subscriber for its assistance in the issuance and buy-back of shares under items 16  17  18 and 19  the Company will pay to the subscriber an amount totaling SEK 100 000.Since the costs for the Company in connection with an equity swap agreement will be significantly higher than the costs in connection with transfer of treasury stock  the main alternative is that the financial exposure is secured by transfer of treasury stock and that an equity swap agreement with a third party is an alternative in the event that the required majority for approval is not reached.CostsThe total effect on the income statement of the LTV II 2023  including financing costs and social security fees  is estimated to range between SEK 146 million and SEK 333 million distributed over the years 2023-2026. The costs will depend on the future development of the price of shares of series B in Ericsson.The administration cost for transfer of shares by way of an equity swap agreement is currently estimated to approximately SEK 30 million  compared to the cost of approximately SEK 100 000 for using newly issued and acquired shares in treasury (SEK 100 000 is the total cost paid to the subscriber in relation to items 16  17  18 and 19  regardless of the number of share issuances).DilutionThe Company has approximately 3.3 billion registered shares. As per December 31  2022  the Company held approximately 4 million shares in treasury. The number of shares that may be required for ongoing LTV programs (2019  2020  2021 and 2022) as per December 31  2022  is estimated to approximately 4.9 million shares  corresponding to approximately 0.15 percent of the number of registered shares of the Company. In order to implement the LTV II 2023  a total of up to 5.9 million shares are required  which corresponds to approximately 0.18 percent of the total number of registered shares of the Company. Hence an issue of new shares is proposed for the implementation of LTV II 2023. The effect on important key figures is only marginal.17.2 Transfer of treasury stock to employees and on an exchange  directed share issue and acquisition offer for the LTV II 2023a. Transfer of treasury stock under the LTV II 2023Transfer of no more than 4.9 million shares of series B in the Company less any shares retained by the Company as per item 17.2 c) may occur on the following terms and conditions:The right to acquire shares shall be granted to such persons within the Ericsson Group covered by the terms and conditions pursuant to the LTV II 2023.

Transfer of treasury stock on an exchange to cover expensesThe Company may  prior to the AGM in 2024  transfer no more than 1.0 million shares of series B in the Company  in order to cover certain expenses  mainly social security payments. Transfer of the shares shall be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the  at each time  prevailing price interval for the share as disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm.c.

Transfer of the shares shall be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the  at each time  prevailing price interval for the share as disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm. These shares form a part of the final number of vested shares to the employees under LTV II 2023 and do not incur additional costs to the LTV II 2023 for the Company.d.

These programs are an integral part of the Company's remuneration strategy as well as a part of the Company's talent management strategy. The Company has decided to implement two other share-related compensation programs for 2023: The Executive Performance Plan 2023 (""EPP 2023"") and the Key Contribution Plan 2023 (""KC Plan 2023""). Ericsson has also implemented an all-employee share purchase plan in 2021.The Executive Performance Plan 2023  implemented only in case the AGM 2023 would not resolve in favor of item 17The EPP 2023 is designed to attract  retain and motivate Executives in a competitive market through performance based long-term cash incentive supporting the achievement of the Company's long-term strategies and business objectives. Approximately 180 Executives will be eligible for the EPP 2023. Participants are assigned a potential award defined as a percentage of the participants' annual gross salary  which is converted into a number of synthetic shares based on the same market price of shares of series B in Ericsson used for the LTV I 2023 at the time of grant. Award levels are assigned to Executives in range of 0-45% of annual base pay.The vesting level of the awards  occurring after a three-year vesting period  is subject to the achievement of the same performance criteria as for the LTV I 2023  and generally requires that the participant retains his or her employment over the three-year vesting period. At the end of the vesting period  the allotted synthetic shares are converted into a cash amount  based on the market price of the shares of series B in Ericsson at Nasdaq Stockholm at the vesting date  and this final amount is paid to the Participant in cash gross before tax. It is estimated that approximately 2.5 million synthetic shares will be awarded under the EPP 2023. The maximum total cost effect of the EPP 2023 on the income statement  including social security fees  is estimated to be approximately SEK 700 million distributed over the years 2023-2026. The costs will depend on the future development of the market price of the shares of series B in Ericsson.The Key Contribution Plan 2023The KC Plan 2023 is designed to recognize the best talent  individual performance  potential and critical skills as well as encourage the retention of key employees. Approximately 10% to 14% of Ericsson employees will be eligible for the KC Plan 2023.

The plan has a three-year total service period (""Service Period"") during which the awards are paid on an annual rolling bases following the below payment schedule:25% of the award at the end of the first year 25% of the award at the end of the second year  and50% of the award at the end of the full Service Period.The value of each synthetic share is driven by the absolute share price performance of shares of series B in Ericsson shares during the Service Period. At the date of vesting for each instalment of the above-described annual rolling payment schedule  the synthetic shares are converted into a cash amount  based on the market price of the Ericsson series B share on Nasdaq Stockholm at the respective vesting date  and this final amount is paid to the Participant in cash gross before tax. It is estimated that approximately 31 million synthetic shares will be awarded under the KC Plan 2023. The maximum total cost effect of the KC Plan 2023 on the income statement  including social security fees  is estimated to be approximately SEK 5 billion distributed over the years 2023-2026. The costs will depend on the future development of the market price of the Ericsson series B share.The Ericsson share purchase plan (""ESPP"")Ericsson is committed to helping employees thrive and to recognizing them for the impact they create by providing opportunities to enrich their working experience. In order to encourage employees to play an active role in achieving the Company's purpose  further create sense of belonging and ownership  the ESPP was launched in November 2021 (in 58 countries to approximately 58 900 eligible employees)  with continued deployment in 2022 to 20 additional countries and 30 100 eligible employees.

Therefore  detailed requirements for mandatory weighting and definition of STV targets has been removed;Enable for the Board of Directors to potentially include STV in the remuneration package of the President and CEO.

These Guidelines apply to remuneration agreed and changes to previously agreed remuneration after the date of approval of the Guidelines and are intended to remain in place for four years until the Annual General Meeting of shareholders 2027. For employments outside of Sweden  due adaptations may be made to comply with mandatory local rules or established local practices. In such cases  the overall purpose of these Guidelines shall be accommodated to the largest extent possible. These Guidelines do not cover remuneration resolved by the general meeting of shareholders  such as long-term variable compensation programs (""LTV"").ObjectiveThese Guidelines aim to ensure alignment with the current remuneration philosophy and practices applicable for the Company's employees based on the principles of competitiveness  fairness  transparency  and performance.

Senior executives include the CEO and other members of the Group Leadership Team. The guidelines are forward-looking  i.e. they are applicable to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the guidelines by the Meeting. These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided by the General Meeting  including any long-term share related incentive plans.The guidelines' promotion of the Company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityA prerequisite for the successful implementation of the Company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability agenda  is that the Company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. To this end  it is necessary that the Company offers competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable the Company to offer the senior executives a competitive total remuneration.Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at promoting the Company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability agenda. This is accomplished through the financial and non-financial targets that determines the outcome of the variable cash remuneration and are clearly linked to the Company's business strategy and sustainability agenda. The variable cash remuneration is further described in the section ""Variable cash remuneration"" below.The Company's objectives for having a variable cash remuneration program and a long-term share related incentive plan are to (i) drive behaviors that will support the Company's long and short-term business success and create shareholder value  (ii) make the Company attractive as an employer for top talents  (iii) retain key individuals within the Company  and (iv) increase employees' interest and involvement in the Company's business and development.For information regarding the Company's business strategy  see the Company's website: www.group.skanska.com/about-us/how-we-work/strategy/.Total remunerationThe combined remuneration for each senior executive shall be market-related and competitive in the labor market in which the senior executive is placed  and distinguished performance should be reflected in the total remuneration. The remuneration may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  variable cash remuneration  pension and other benefits. Additionally  the General Meeting may ‚Äì irrespective of these guidelines ‚Äì resolve on  among other things  share-related or share price-related remuneration. Fixed salary and variable remuneration shall be related to the senior executive's responsibility and authority.Variable cash remunerationThe satisfaction of criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration shall be measured over a period of one or several years. The variable cash remuneration shall be capped and related to the fixed salary  and may amount to not more than 100 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.The variable cash remuneration shall take into account both financial and non-financial performance. The outcome in relation to predetermined and measurable financial targets shall determine the total (financial) bonus potential  i.e. the financial targets shall be the basis of the total bonus potential. This outcome may be reduced depending on the outcomes of the non-financial targets. The variable cash remuneration must be based on results in relation to established targets and be designed to increase the alignment between the shareholders and senior executives of the Company.The financial targets for the variable cash remuneration may be related to the Group's earnings before taxes  to relevant business unit's earnings before interest and taxes  etc.The non-financial targets shall be set to support the Company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability agenda  by for example being clearly linked to the Company's business strategy or sustainability agenda. The non-financial targets should together represent 50 percent of the total bonus which means that the total bonus outcome may be reduced with up to 50 percent if the non-financial targets are not met.To which extent the criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration has been satisfied shall be evaluated/determined when the measurement period has ended. The Board is responsible for the evaluation so far as it concerns variable cash remuneration to the CEO. For variable cash remuneration to other senior executives  the Compensation Committee is responsible for the evaluation. For financial objectives  the evaluation shall be based on the latest financial information made public by the Company.The terms for variable cash remuneration shall be structured so that the Board  if exceptional economic conditions prevail  has the possibility to limit or refrain from paying variable remuneration  if such payment is considered unreasonable and incompatible with the Company's responsibility in general to the shareholders  employees and other stakeholders. There shall also be a possibility to limit or refrain from paying variable remuneration if the Board considers that this is appropriate for other reasons. Further  the Board shall have the possibility to reclaim paid out variable cash remuneration if it is discovered after the payment that the senior executive has violated Skanska's Code of Conduct or other Skanska values  policies  standards or procedures.Further variable cash remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and only made on an individual basis  either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining senior executives  or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual's ordinary tasks. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount corresponding to 100 percent of the fixed annual cash salary and may not be paid more than once each year per individual. Any resolution on such remuneration for the CEO shall be made by the Board based on a proposal from the Compensation Committee. Any resolution on such remuneration for other senior executives shall be made by the Compensation Committee based on a proposal from the CEO.PensionPension benefits shall be defined contribution schemes except where law or collective agreement require a defined benefit pension. Variable cash remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits  except when it follows under law or collective agreement. The pension premiums for defined-contribution pension shall amount to not more than 40 percent of the fixed annual cash salary unless a higher percentage results from the application of law or collective agreement.Other benefitsOther benefits may include  for example  medical insurance (Sw: sjukv√•rdsf√∂rs√§kring)  health insurance (Sw. sjukf√∂rs√§kring)  double accommodation  home travel  tax compensation  parking and company cars. Such benefits may amount to not more than 20 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.For employments governed by rules other than Swedish rules  pension benefits and other benefits may be duly adjusted for compliance with mandatory rules or established local practice  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines.Senior executives who are expatriates  i.e. based in another country than their home country  may receive additional remuneration and other benefits to the extent reasonable in light of the special circumstances associated with the expat arrangement  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines. Such benefits may not in total exceed 50 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.Long-term share saving programsLong-term share saving programs  Skanska Employee Ownership Programs (""Seop 5"" and ""Seop 6"") have been implemented in the Company. Such plans have been resolved by the General Meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. New plans may also be resolved by the General Meeting. Seop 5 and Seop 6 give present and future employees the opportunity of becoming shareholders of Skanska and include permanent employees in the Skanska Group. The performance criteria used to assess the outcome of the plans are clearly linked to the business strategy and thereby to the Company's long-term value creation  including its sustainability agenda. The performance criteria consist of financial targets at Group  Business Unit and/or Business Unit Cluster level and as of Seop 6  also a non-financial target at Group level  related to the Group's reduction of carbon emissions. At present  the financial target applicable at Group level is growth in earning per share (EPS). The financial targets applicable at Business Unit and/or Business Unit level vary depending on which business stream the relevant Business Unit or Business Unit Cluster belongs to  as set out in the table below.Construction Residential Development Commercial Development Investment Properties EBIT[1] EBIT1 EBIT1 EBIT1 - ROCE[2] Leasing SQM[3] -Seop 5 and Seop 6 are further conditional upon the participant's own investment and three-year holding and employment period. For more information on Seop 5 and Seop 6  including the criteria which the outcome depends on  please see the Company's website:www.group.skanska.com/corporate-governance/remuneration/incentive-programs/.Termination of employmentIn the event of employment termination by the Company  the normal period of notice is six months  combined with severance pay corresponding to a maximum of 18 months fixed cash salary  or  alternatively  a period of notice of maximum 12 months  combined with severance pay corresponding to a maximum of 12 months fixed cash salary. Fixed cash salary during the notice period and severance pay may not together exceed an amount corresponding to the fixed cash salary for two years. When termination is made by the senior executive  the notice period may not exceed 12 months  without any right to severance pay.Remuneration to board members in addition to board feesTo the extent that a non-employed board member elected by the General Meeting performs work for the Company  besides the board membership  consultant fee and other remuneration may be granted for such work. Decisions on consultant fees and other remuneration to non-employed board members elected by the General Meeting are made by the Compensation Committee.Salary and employment conditions for employeesIn the preparation of the Board's proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for employees of the Company have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the Compensation Committee's and the Board's basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable.The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board has established a Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee's tasks include preparing the Board's decision to propose guidelines for salary and other remuneration to senior executives. The Board shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the General Meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the General Meeting. The Compensation Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the senior executives  the application of the guidelines for salary and other remuneration to senior executives as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the Company. The members of the Compensation Committee are independent of the Company and its senior executives. The CEO and other members of the senior executives do not participate in the Board's processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.Derogation from the guidelinesThe Board may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the Company's long-term interests  including its sustainability agenda  or to ensure the Company's financial viability. As set out above  the Compensation Committee's tasks include preparing the Board's resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.Description of significant changes compared to the previous guidelinesPension premiums have previously been restricted to 35 percent of the fixed annual cash salary for the CEO and to 30 percent of the fixed annual cash salary together with up to 30 percent on variable cash remuneration for other senior executives. These guidelines have been changed to a single restriction of 40 percent of the fixed annual cash salary which applies to all senior executives in order to align the cap for pension premiums with prevailing Swedish market practice.The cap for other benefits has been increased from 15 percent to 20 percent of the fixed annual cash salary. This change has been made to ensure that any senior executives that require for example double accommodation and home travels can be granted such benefits within the limits of these guidelines.The only further changes are editorial changes primarily following from the implementation of Seop 6.The shareholders have not expressed any specific views on the guidelines adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2020.Item 18 - Decision to authorize the Board to resolve on acquisitions of own Class B shares to secure delivery of own Class B shares to participants in the long-term employee ownership program for the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025 (Seop 6)BackgroundThe Annual General Meeting 2022  resolved in accordance with the Board's proposal on a long-term employee ownership program for the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025  respectively (each an ""Annual Program"") for permanent employees in the Skanska Group (Skanska Employee Ownership Program  ""Seop 6""); that a maximum of 12 000 000 own Class B shares may be transferred free of charge to participants in Seop 6 at the time and on the other terms that participants in Seop 6 are entitled to acquire shares; that each Annual Program may comprise no more than 4 000 000 Class B shares; and that transfers may be made of Class B shares (i) which have previously been acquired to secure Skanska's obligations under earlier Skanska Employee Ownership Programs but which are no longer required for such purpose  (ii) which have been acquired in accordance with the authorization given by the Annual General Meeting 2022  and (iii) which are acquired under future authorizations to acquire Class B shares.Information on Seop 6  including the conditions which the outcome depends on  is available on the Company's website www.group.skanska.com/ under the heading ""Corporate Governance/Remuneration/Incentive programs"".

The Nomination Committee proposes that Advokat Eva H√§gg be elected Chair of the AGM.Item 2 Preparation and approval of the voting listThe voting list proposed for approval is the voting list drawn up by Euroclear Sweden AB on behalf of the Company  based on the AGM's register of shareholders  shareholders having given notice of participation and being present at the meeting venue and postal votes received.Item 8.4 Dividend and record datesThe Board of Directors proposes a dividend to the shareholders of SEK 2.70 per share. The dividend is proposed to be paid in two equal installments  SEK 1.35 per share with the record date March 31  2023  and SEK 1.35 per share with the record date September 29  2023. Assuming these dates will be the record dates  Euroclear Sweden AB is expected to disburse SEK 1.35 per share on April 5  2023  and SEK 1.35 per share on October 4  2023.Item 9 Number of Board members and deputies to be elected by the AGMAccording to the articles of association  the Board of Directors shall consist of no less than five and no more than twelve Board members  with no more than six deputies. The Nomination Committee proposes that the number of Board members elected by the AGM shall be ten (previously eleven) and that no deputies be elected.Item 10 Fees payable to members of the Board of Directors elected by the AGM and to members of the Committees of the Board of Directors elected by the AGMThe Nomination Committee proposes that fees to non-employee Board members elected by the AGM and non-employee members of the Committees of the Board of Directors elected by the AGM be paid as follows:SEK 4 500 000 to the Chair of the Board of Directors ( previously SEK 4 375 000 );to the Chair of the Board of Directors ( ); SEK 1 140 000 to each of the other Board members ( previously SEK 1 100 000 ) ;to each of the other Board members ( ) SEK 495 000 to the Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee ( previously SEK 475 000 );to the Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee ( ); SEK 285 000 to each of the other members of the Audit and Compliance Committee ( previously SEK 275 000 );to each of the other members of the Audit and Compliance Committee ( ); SEK 210 000 to each Chair of the Finance  the Remuneration and the Technology and Science Committee (previously SEK 205 000 ) ; andto each Chair of the Finance  the Remuneration and the Technology and Science Committee ; and SEK 185 000 to each of the other members of the Finance  the Remuneration and the Technology and Science Committee (previously SEK 180 000 ).The Nomination Committee considered the Board fees with the objective of ensuring that they allow for the recruitment and retention of high quality individuals while also being appropriate in comparison to other technology companies operating globally and with similar size and complexity. As such  the Nomination Committee has concluded that an increase of the fees to all members of the Board and Board Committees  including their Chairs  in accordance with the above is reasonable  well-justified and in the best interests of the Company. The proposal of the Nomination Committee provides for an increase of the fees of approximately 3.3%[1] compared with the total fees to the corresponding number of Board and Committee members for Board and Committee work resolved by the Annual General Meeting 2022.Fees in the form of synthetic sharesBackgroundThe Nomination Committee believes that it is appropriate that Board members elected by the shareholders hold shares in Ericsson  in order to strengthen the Board members' and the shareholders' mutual interests in the Company. The Nomination Committee recommends that Board members elected by the shareholders  over a five year period  build a holding of shares or synthetic shares in Ericsson equal to at least the value of the annual Board fee (excluding fees for Committee work)  and that such holding be kept during the time the Board member remain Board member in Ericsson.To enable Board members to create an economic interest in the Company and considering that it is in many cases difficult for Board members to trade in the Company's share due to applicable insider rules  the Nomination Committee proposes that the Board members should  as previously  be offered the option of receiving part of the Board fees in the form of synthetic shares. A synthetic share constitutes a right to receive payment of an amount which corresponds to the market value of a share of series B in the Company on Nasdaq Stockholm at the time of payment.ProposalThe Nomination Committee therefore proposes that the AGM 2023 resolve that part of the fees to the Board member  in respect of their Board assignment (however  not in respect of Committee work)  may be paid in the form of synthetic shares  on the following terms and conditions.A nominated Board member shall be able to choose to receive the fee in respect of his or her Board assignment  according to the following four alternatives:25 percent in cash ‚Äì 75 percent in synthetic shares50 percent in cash ‚Äì 50 percent in synthetic shares75 percent in cash ‚Äì 25 percent in synthetic shares100 percent in cash.The number of synthetic shares to be allocated shall be valued at the average of the market price of shares of series B in the Company on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of five trading days immediately following the publication of Ericsson's interim report for the first quarter of 2023. The synthetic shares are vested during the term of office  with 25 percent per quarter of the year.The synthetic shares give a right to  following the publication of Ericsson's year-end financial statement in 2028  receive payment of a cash amount per synthetic share corresponding to the market price of shares of series B in the Company in close connection with the time of payment.An amount corresponding to dividend in respect of shares of series B in the Company  resolved by the AGM during the holding period  shall be disbursed at the same time as the cash amount.Should the Board member's assignment to the Board of Directors come to an end no later than during the third calendar year after the year in which the AGM resolved on allocation of the synthetic shares  payment may take place the year after the assignment came to an end.The number of synthetic shares may be subject to recalculation in the event of bonus issues  splits  rights issues and similar measures  under the terms and conditions for the synthetic shares.The complete terms and conditions for the synthetic shares are described in Exhibit 1 to the Nomination Committee's proposal.The financial difference for the Company  should all Board members receive part of their fees in the form of synthetic shares compared with the fees being paid in cash only  is assessed to be limited.Item 11 Election of Board members and deputies of the Board of DirectorsProposalsThe Nomination Committee proposes that the following persons be re-elected Board members:Jon Fredrik Baksaas; Jan Carlson ; Carolina Dybeck Happe ; B√∂rje Ekholm; Eric A. Elzvik; Kristin S. Rinne ; Helena Stjernholm ; and Jacob Wallenberg .The Nomination Committee proposes that the following two persons be elected as new Board members:Jonas Synnergren; and Christy Wyatt .Item 12 Election of the Chair of the Board of DirectorsThe Nomination Committee proposes that Jan Carlson be elected Chair of the Board of Directors (new election).Information regarding proposed Board members and Chair (Item 11 and 12)Information regarding the proposed Board members and Chair is presented in Exhibit 2 to the Nomination Committee's proposal.ConsiderationsThe Nomination Committee primarily searches for potential Board member candidates for the upcoming mandate period  but also considers future competence needs. It is a long journey to identify the right candidates and long-term planning is essential. In assessing the appropriate composition of the Board of Directors  the Nomination Committee considers  among other things  experience and competence needed on the Board and its Committees  and the value of diversity in age  gender and cultural/geographic background as well as the need for renewal. The Nomination Committee believes that diversity on the Board will support Ericsson's sustainable development and therefore continually focuses on identifying Board member candidates with different backgrounds. While acknowledging increased expectations on transparency relating to diversity on the Board  applicable privacy regulations prevent Ericsson and the Nomination Committee from processing certain sensitive personal data about its Board members  such as information relating to demographic background. The Nomination Committee has applied the Swedish Corporate Governance Code  Section 4.1  as diversity policy. Focusing on improving the gender balance over time  the Nomination Committee particularly works to identify women candidates matching the current and future needs of the Board. The Nomination Committee also assesses the appropriateness of the number of Board members and whether the Board members can devote the necessary time required to fulfill their tasks as Board members in Ericsson.In its appraisal of qualifications and performance of the individual Board members  the Nomination Committee takes into account the competence and experience of each individual member along with the individual member's contribution to the Board work as a whole and to the Committee work. The Committee has familiarized itself with the results of the Board work evaluation that was led by the Chair of the Board of Directors. The Nomination Committee's objective is to propose and support the election of a Board that is comprised of individuals of the highest competency and integrity  while also holistically comprising a strong mix of needed skills and experience to effectively oversee and lead Ericsson.The Nomination Committee is of the opinion that the current Board of Directors and Board work is well functioning. Further  it is the Nomination Committee's view that the Board fulfills expectations in terms of composition and that the Board of Directors as well as the individual Board members fulfill expectations in terms of expertise. Competencies and experiences represented on the Board include broad international industry experience  experience from the telecom  IT and ICT sectors  technological and technical competencies and experiences (e.g. related to software and digitalization)  financial expertise and experience from private equity  M&A and new business. The Nomination Committee further believes that competencies and experiences within the Environmental  Social and Governance areas considered most relevant for Ericsson and the sector in which the Company operates are well represented on the Board  including for example related to the technologies the Company develops and delivers as well as relating to ethics and compliance. While the Board is well functioning and has a strong composition  the Nomination Committee believes that the Board would benefit from additional expertise within the software  technology and enterprise area.Ronnie Leten  Kurt Jofs and Nora Denzel have informed the Nomination Committee that they will not stand for re-election at the AGM 2023. The Nomination Committee proposes re-election of current Board members Jon Fredrik Baksaas  Jan Carlson  Carolina Dybeck Happe  B√∂rje Ekholm  Eric A. Elzvik  Kristin S. Rinne  Helena Stjernholm and Jacob Wallenberg  and new election of Jonas Synnergren and Christy Wyatt as members of the Board. Jonas Synnergren has long-term international business experience as a Board member of Tieto Oyj and Veoneer Inc. and is currently a Board member of Nordea Oyj. In addition  Jonas Synnergren is Senior Partner in Cevian Capital AB  one of Ericsson's shareholders. Christy Wyatt has long-term international business experience from senior management roles within Motorola  Good Technology and DTEX Systems and is currently the President and CEO of Absolute Software.It is the Nomination Committee's assessment that the proposed new Chair of the Board of Directors  Jan Carlson  with his long career both as CEO and Chairman  good knowledge of Ericsson after serving many years on the Board  international experience  technology background and personal qualities will be an excellent successor as Chair of the Board. Further  it is the Nomination Committee's assessment that each of the proposed Board members  with their respective experiences  adds valuable expertise and experience to the Board  and that Jonas Synnergren's and Christy Wyatt's extensive international business experiences and deep software  enterprise and technology expertise will be of additional value to Ericsson and will further strengthen the Board.Out of the proposed Board members to be elected by the AGM of shareholders (excluding the President and CEO) 44% are women. Gender balance continues to be a key priority for the Nomination Committee  and the Committee works to improve the gender balance on the Board of Directors over time.Independence of Board membersThe Nomination Committee has made the following assessments in terms of applicable independence requirements:1. The Nomination Committee considers that the following Board members are independent of the Company and its senior management:a. Jon Fredrik Baksaasb. Jan Carlsonc. Carolina Dybeck Happed. Eric A. Elzvike. Kristin S. Rinnef. Helena Stjernholmg. Jonas Synnergrenh. Jacob Wallenbergi. Christy Wyatt2. From among the Board members reported in (i) above  the Nomination Committee considers that at least the following are independent of the Company's major shareholders:a. Jon Fredrik Baksaasb. Jan Carlsonc. Carolina Dybeck Happed. Eric A. Elzvike. Kristin S. Rinnef. Jonas Synnergreng. Christy WyattMoreover  the Nomination Committee considers that at least the following Board members are independent in respect of all applicable independence requirements:a. Jon Fredrik Baksaasb. Jan Carlsonc. Carolina Dybeck Happed. Eric A. Elzvike. Kristin S. Rinnef. Jonas Synnergreng. Christy WyattThe Nomination Committee concludes that the proposed composition of the Board of Directors meets the independence requirements applicable to Ericsson.Item 13 Number of auditorsAccording to the articles of association  the Company shall have no less than one and no more than three registered public accounting firms as auditor. The Nomination Committee proposes that the Company should have one registered public accounting firm as auditor.Item 14 Fees payable to the auditorThe Nomination Committee proposes  like previous years  that the auditor fees be paid against approved account.Item 15 Election of auditorIn accordance with the recommendation by the Audit and Compliance Committee  the Nomination Committee proposes that Deloitte AB be appointed auditor for the period from the end of the AGM 2023 until the end of the AGM 2024 (re-election).Item 16 Implementation of LTV I 2023 including transfer of treasury stock  directed share issue and authorization for the Board of Directors to decide on an acquisition offer of shares of series CBackgroundThe Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors evaluate the long-term variable compensation (""LTV"") programs to the Executive Team (""ET"") on an ongoing basis. The evaluation considers the LTV programs for effectiveness in serving their purpose to support achieving the Ericsson Group's strategic business objectives and sustainable long-term interests as well as their facility to increase the long-term focus of the members of the ET and align their interests with the long-term expectations and the interests of the shareholders.Upon evaluation of the currently ongoing LTV programs for 2020  2021 and 2022  the Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors concluded that these ongoing LTV programs  which are all in essence the same in terms of plan structure  performance criteria and performance periods  enabled the Company to achieve its long-term objectives. The ongoing LTV programs further enabled the Company to remain committed to the targets for 2023 as well as the long-term target of 15-18% adjusted earnings (loss) before interest  taxes  amortization and write-downs of acquired intangible assets (""EBITA"")  in turn creating increased shareholder value. In order to further strengthen both Ericsson's and the ET's commitment to long-term sustainability and responsible business  the Board of Directors  upon recommendation from the Remuneration Committee  has concluded to propose to the AGM 2023 an LTV I 2023 for the ET.LTV I 2023 is an integral part of the Company's remuneration strategy and the Board of Directors in particular expects the members of the ET to build significant equity holdings to align the interests and expectations of the LTV program participants with those of shareholders.Proposals16.1 Implementation of the LTV I 2023The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolve on the LTV I 2023 for ET members comprising a maximum of 4.1 million shares of series B in the Company as set out below.Objectives of the LTV programThe LTV program is designed to provide long-term incentives for members of the ET (""Participants"")  thereby creating long-term value for the shareholders. The aim is to attract  retain and motivate executives in a competitive market through performance-based share related incentives  to encourage the build-up of significant equity holdings to align the interests of the Participants with those of shareholders and to further strengthen the ET's commitment to long-term sustainability and responsible business.The LTV Program in briefThe LTV Program is proposed to include all members (current and future) of the ET  currently comprising of 17 employees  including the President and CEO. Awards under LTV I 2023 (""Performance Share Awards"") will be granted free of charge entitling the Participant  provided that i.e. certain performance criteria set out below are met  to receive a number of shares  free of charge  following expiration of a three-year vesting period (""Vesting Period""). Allotment of shares pursuant to Performance Share Awards will be subject to the achievement of performance criteria  as set out below  and will generally require that the Participant retains his or her employment over the Vesting Period. All major decisions relating to LTV I 2023 will be taken by the Remuneration Committee  with approval by the full Board of Directors as required.Granting of Performance Share AwardsGranting of Performance Share Awards to the Participants will generally take place as soon as practicably possible following the AGM 2023. For 2023  the value of the underlying shares in respect of the Performance Share Awards made to the President and CEO will not exceed 190% of the Annual Base Salary at the time of grant  and for other Participants  the value will not exceed 70% of the Participants' respective Annual Base Salary at the time of grant  unless the Participant is employed in the USA where the value will not exceed 100% of Participants' Annual Base Salary.The share price used to calculate the number of shares to which the Performance Share Awards entitle will be the volume-weighted average of the market price of shares of series B in Ericsson on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five trading days immediately following the publication of the Company's interim report for the fourth quarter 2022.Performance criteriaThe vesting of the Performance Share Awards will be subject to the satisfaction of performance criteria related to 2023 Group EBITA (earnings (loss) before interest  taxes  amortizations and write-downs of acquired intangible) (operating income) performance criterion  along with three-year total shareholder return (""TSR"" [2])  and Group Environmental Social Governance (""ESG"") performance criteria  which will determine what portion (if any) of the Performance Share Awards will vest at the end of the Vesting Period.The 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion relates to 45% of the Performance Share Awards and the maximum vesting level is 200%.The performance criteria based on TSR are absolute TSR development and relative TSR development for the Ericsson series B share over the period January 1  2023 ‚Äì December 31  2025 (""Performance Period"" [3]). The absolute and relative TSR performance criteria relate to 25% and 20%  respectively  of the Performance Share Awards and the maximum vesting level for both TSR performance criteria is 200%.The Group ESG performance criterion measured over the Performance Period will relate to 10% of the Performance Share Awards  and the maximum vesting level is 200%.The following conditions will apply to the performance criteria:2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion45% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion for the 2023 financial year. The 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion established by the Board of Directors will stipulate a minimum level and a maximum level. The 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) target is not disclosed due to stock market and competition considerations. The vesting level of Performance Share Awards related to 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion will be determined by the Board of Directors when the audited result for the financial year 2023 is available.If the maximum performance level is reached or exceeded  the vesting will amount to (and will not exceed) the maximum level of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to the 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion. If performance is below the maximum level but exceeds the minimum level  a linear pro-rata vesting of shares will occur. No vesting will occur if performance amounts to or is below the minimum level. The allotment of the shares will not occur until the end of the Vesting Period in 2026.TSR performance criteriaAbsolute TSR performance criterion25% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfillment of an absolute TSR performance criterion over the Performance Period. If the absolute TSR development reaches or exceeds 14% per annum compounded  the maximum vesting of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to absolute TSR performance criterion will occur. If the absolute TSR development is below or reaches only 6% per annum compounded  no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to the absolute TSR performance criterion. A linear pro-rata vesting from 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to absolute TSR performance criterion will apply if the Company's absolute TSR performance is between 6% and 14% per annum compounded.Relative TSR performance criterion20% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a relative TSR performance criterion over the Performance Period  compared to a peer group consisting of 11 peer companies (""Peer Group""[4]). The vesting of the relative TSR related Performance Share Awards varies depending on the Company's TSR performance ranking versus the other companies in the Peer Group. If the Company's relative TSR performance is below the TSR development of the company ranked 6th in the Peer Group  no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to relative TSR performance criterion. Vesting of the Performance Share Awards related to relative TSR performance criterion will occur at the following percentage levels  based on which ranking position in the Peer Group the Company's TSR performance corresponds to:Position within the Peer Group Associated vesting percentage level6 or lower 0%5 50%4 100%3 150%2 or higher 200%If the Company's TSR performance is between two of the ranked companies  a linear pro-rata vesting will apply between the vesting percentage levels for the relevant ranked positions.Group ESG performance criterion10% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a Group ESG performance criterion comprised of two equally weighted subcomponents covering environmental and social aspects of ESG measured over the Performance Period.Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions5% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfillment of a subcomponent of reducing greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions [5] from service fleet vehicles  energy consumption at facilities and from business travel [6].Subcomponent target- and corresponding achievement levels are defined in the schedule below and broken down for each of the three years [7] covered by the Performance Period. Vesting is determined at the end of each year  with each year corresponding to one third (1/3) of the total subcomponent Performance Share Awards. A linear pro-rata vesting of one third (1/3) of 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to reducing emissions in the subcomponent will apply if reported emissions in scope are between the minimum and maximum vesting levels for each of the years covered by the Performance Period. An illustrative example is included below.These target levels are aligned to the emissions reduction trajectory set for achieving Net Zero emissions from the Ericsson Group's own activities by 2030.Achievement GHG emissions target levels for emission in scope by fiscal year (ktonne CO2e)(%) 2023 2024 20250 142 132 122100 135 126 116200 121 113 104Illustrative example: first  if reported emissions in scope for the year 2023 are 121 ktonne  the maximum vesting of one third of 200% (1/3 x 200% = 66.67%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent and year will occur. Next  if reported emissions for the year 2024 are 126 ktonne  vesting of one third of 100% (1/3 x 100% = 33.33%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent and fiscal year will occur. Last  if reported emissions in scope for the year 2025 are 122 ktonne  no vesting (1/3 x 0% = 0.00%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent will occur. Consequently  in this example total vesting of the Performance Share Award related to this subcomponent over the Performance Period will be (66.67% + 33.33% + 0.00%) 100%.Increasing the representation of women leaders in Ericsson5% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a subcomponent of increasing the representation of women leaders (i.e. women holding roles with people management responsibility) in the Ericsson Group to 24% by the end of the Performance Period  which is in line with achieving the target trajectory for increasing the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group to 30% by 2030.If the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group amounts to 25% or above by the end of the Performance Pe riod  the maximum vesting of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent will occur. If the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group amounts to 23% or below by the end of the Performance Period  no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent. A linear pro-rata vesting from 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to increasing the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group subcomponent will apply if the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group exceeds 23% but is below 25% by the end of the Performance Period.The vesting level of Performance Share Awards related to the Group ESG performance criterion will be determined by the Board of Directors when the audited results for both subcomponents at the end of the financial year 2025 are available.Information about the outcome of the performance criteria will be provided no later than in the annual report for the financial year 2025.Allotment of sharesProvided that the performance criteria above have been met and that the Participant has retained his or her employment (unless special circumstances are at hand) during the Vesting Period  allotment of vested shares will take place as soon as practicably possible following the expiration of the Vesting Period.When determining the final vesting level of Performance Share Awards  the Board of Directors shall examine whether the vesting level is reasonable considering the Company's financial results and position  conditions on the stock market and other circumstances  such as environmental  social  ethics and compliance factors  and if not  as determined by the Board of Directors  reduce the vesting level to the lower level deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors.In the event delivery of shares to Participants cannot take place under applicable law or at a reasonable cost and employing reasonable administrative measures  the Board of Directors will be entitled to decide that Participants may  instead  be offered a cash settlement.The Company has the right to  before delivering vested shares to the Participants  retain and sell the number of shares required to cover the cost for withholding and paying tax and social security liabilities on behalf of the Participants in relation to the Performance Share Awards for remittance to revenue authorities. In such an event  net amount of vested shares will thus be delivered to the Participants after the vested Performance Share Awards are reduced by the number of shares retained by the Company for such purposes.FinancingThe Board of Directors has considered different financing methods for transfer of shares under the LTV I 2023 such as transfer of treasury stock and an equity swap agreement with a third party. The Board of Directors considers that a directed issue of shares of series C in the Company  followed by buy-back and transfer of treasury stock is the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer shares under the LTV I 2023.The Company's current holding of treasury stock is not sufficient for the implementation of the LTV I 2023. Therefore  the Board of Directors proposes a directed share issue and buy back of shares as further set out below under item 16.2. Under the proposed transactions  shares are issued at the share's quota value and repurchased as soon as the shares have been subscribed for and registered. The purchase price paid by the Company to the subscriber equals the subscription price. As compensation to the subscriber for its assistance in the issuance and buy-back of shares under items 16  17  18 and 19 the Company will pay to the subscriber an amount totaling SEK 100 000.The procedure of issuance and buy-back of shares for the Company's LTV programs has previously been decided by the AGMs in 2001  2003  2008  2009  2012  2016  and 2017.Since the costs for the Company in connection with an equity swap agreement will be significantly higher than the costs in connection with transfer of treasury stock  the main alternative is that the financial exposure is secured by transfer of treasury stock and that an equity swap agreement with a third party is an alternative in the event that the required majority for approval is not reached.CostsThe total effect on the income statement of the LTV I 2023  including financing costs and social security fees  is estimated to range between SEK 100 million and SEK 230 million distributed over the years 2023-2026. The costs will depend on the future development of the price of Ericsson series B share.The administration cost for transfer of shares by way of an equity swap agreement is currently estimated to approximately SEK 30 million  compared to the cost of approximately SEK 100 000 for using newly issued and acquired shares in treasury (SEK 100 000 is the total cost paid to the subscriber in relation to items 16  17  18 and 19  regardless of the number of share issuances).DilutionThe Company has approximately 3.3 billion registered shares. As per December 31  2022  the Company held approximately 4 million shares in treasury. The number of shares that may be required for ongoing LTV programs (2019  2020  2021 and 2022) as per December 31  2022  is estimated to approximately 4.9 million shares  corresponding to approximately 0.15 percent of the number of registered shares of the Company. In order to implement the LTV I 2023  a total of up to 4.1 million shares are required  which corresponds to approximately 0.12 percent of the total number of registered shares of the Company  hence an issue of new shares is proposed for the implementation of LTV I 2023. The effect on important key figures is only marginal.16.2 Transfer of treasury stock to employees and on an exchange  directed share issue and acquisition offer for the LTV I 2023a. Transfer of treasury stock under the LTV I 2023Transfer of no more than 3.4 million shares of series B in the Company less any shares retained by the Company as per item 16.2 c) may occur on the following terms and conditions:The right to acquire shares shall be granted to such persons within the Ericsson Group covered by the terms and conditions pursuant to the LTV I 2023.

Transfer of treasury stock on an exchange to cover expensesThe Company may  prior to the AGM in 2024  transfer no more than 700 000 shares of series B in the Company  in order to cover certain expenses  mainly social security payments. Transfer of the shares shall be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the  at each time  prevailing price interval for the share as disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm.c. Authorization to decide on transfer of treasury stock on an exchange to cover costs for tax and social security liabilities for the ParticipantsAuthorization for the Board of Directors to decide to  in conjunction with the delivery of vested shares under LTV I 2023  prior to the AGM in 2024  retain and sell no more than 60% of the vested shares of series B in the Company in order to cover for the costs for withholding and paying tax and social security liabilities on behalf of the Participants in relation to the Performance Share Awards for remittance to revenue authorities. Transfer of the shares shall be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the  at each time  prevailing price interval for the share as disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm. These shares form a part of the final number of vested shares to the employees under LTV I 2023 and do not incur additional costs to the LTV I 2023 for the Company.d. Directed issue of shares of series C in the CompanyIncrease of the share capital in the Company with SEK 20 500 000.01 by an issue of 4.1 million shares of series C in the Company  each share with a quota value of approximately SEK 5. The terms and conditions of the share issue are the following:The new shares shall ‚Äì with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights ‚Äì be subscribed for only by Investor AB or its subsidiaries.The new shares shall be subscribed for during the period as from Thursday  April 27  2023   up to and including Tuesday  May 2  2023 .

Payment for the subscribed shares shall be made at the time of subscription.The Board of Directors shall be entitled to extend the period for subscription and payment.The new shares shall not entitle the holders to dividend payment.It is noted that the new shares are subject to restrictions pursuant to Chapter 4  Section 6 (conversion clause) and Chapter 20  Section 31 (redemption clause) of the Swedish Companies Act.The Board of Directors proposes that the President and CEO shall be authorized to make the minor adjustments to the above resolutions that may prove to be necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Reasons for deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and principles on which the subscription price is basedThe Board of Directors considers that a directed issue of shares of series C in the Company  followed by buy-back and transfer of treasury stock is the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer shares under the LTV I 2023. Shares are issued at the share's quota value and repurchased as soon as the shares have been subscribed for and registered. The purchase price paid by the Company to the subscriber equals the subscription price.e. Authorization for the Board of Directors to decide on a directed acquisition offerAuthorization for the Board of Directors to decide that 4.1 million shares of series C in Ericsson be acquired according to the following:Acquisition may occur by an offer to acquire shares directed to all holders of shares of series C in Ericsson.The authorization may be exercised until the AGM in 2024.The acquisition shall be made at a price corresponding to the quota value of the share (approximately SEK 5 per share).per share).Payment for acquired shares shall be made in cash.16.3 Equity Swap Agreement with third party in relation to the LTV I 2023In the event that the required majority for approval is not reached under item 16.2 above  the financial exposure of the LTV I 2023 shall be hedged by the Company entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party  under which the third party shall  in its own name  acquire and transfer shares of series B in the Company to employees covered by the LTV I 2023.Majority rulesThe resolution of the AGM on implementation of the LTV I 2023 according to item 16.1 requires that more than half of the votes cast at the AGM approve the proposal. The resolution of the AGM on transfer of treasury stock to employees and on an exchange  directed share issue and acquisition offer for the LTV I 2023 according to item 16.2 requires that shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the AGM approve the proposal. The resolution of the AGM on an Equity Swap Agreement with third party according to item 16.3 requires that more than half of the votes cast at the AGM approve the proposal.Item 17 Implementation of LTV II 2023 including transfer of treasury stock  directed share issue and authorization for the Board of Directors to decide on an acquisition offerBackgroundIn addition to the LTV programs for the President and CEO and members of the ET  Ericsson has since 2017 operated a performance-based long-term variable compensation program for employees classified as Executives (approximately 180 employees) (the Ericsson Executive Performance Plan (""EPP"")). The EPP is identical to the LTV I  with the exception that the EPP is cash settled. The Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors have evaluated whether to implement an additional long-term variable compensation program  LTV II 2023  for Executives with delivery of shares of series B in Ericsson instead of cash settlement to further strengthen both Ericsson's and the Executives' commitment to long-term sustainability and responsible business. The Board of Directors  upon recommendation from the Remuneration Committee  has concluded to propose to the AGM 2023 the LTV II 2023 for Executives.LTV II 2023 is an integral part of the Company's remuneration strategy  and the Board of Directors in particular expects the Executives to build significant equity holdings to align the interests and expectations of the LTV program participants with those of shareholders.The criteria and vesting period for LTV II 2023 are the same as for LTV I 2023. Should the AGM 2023 not vote in favor of the proposal of implementing LTV II 2023 the EPP 2023 will be implemented.Proposals17.1 Implementation of the LTV II 2023The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolve on the LTV II 2023 for Executives  comprising a maximum of 5.9 million shares of series B in the Company as set out below.Objectives of the LTV programThe LTV program is designed to provide long-term incentives for Executives (""Participants"")  thereby creating long-term value for the shareholders. The aim is to attract  retain and motivate Executives in a competitive market through performance-based share related incentives  to encourage the build-up of significant equity holdings to align the interests of the Participants with those of shareholders and to further strengthen Ericsson's and the Executives' commitment to long-term sustainability and responsible business.The LTV program in briefThe LTV program is proposed to include all Executives (current and future)  currently comprising of 180 employees  excluding the President and CEO and ET. Awards under LTV II 2023 (""Performance Share Awards"") will be granted free of charge entitling the Participant  provided that i.e. certain performance criteria set out below are met  to receive a number of shares  free of charge  following expiration of a three-year vesting period (""Vesting Period""). Allotment of shares pursuant to Performance Share Awards will be subject to the achievement of performance criteria  as set out below  and will generally require that the Participant retains his or her employment over the Vesting Period. All major decisions relating to LTV II 2023 will be taken by the Remuneration Committee  with approval by the full Board of Directors as required.Granting of Performance Share AwardsGranting of Performance Share Awards to the Participants will generally take place as soon as practicably possible following the AGM 2023. For 2023  the value of the underlying shares in respect of the Performance Share Awards made to the Participants  will not exceed 70% of the Participants' respective Annual Base Salary at the time of grant  unless the Participant is employed in the USA where the value will not exceed 100% of Participant's Annual Base Salary.The share price used to calculate the number of shares to which the Performance Share Awards entitle will be the volume-weighted average of the market price of shares of series B in the Company on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five trading days immediately following the publication of the Company's interim report for the fourth quarter 2022.Performance criteriaThe vesting of the Performance Share Awards will be subject to the satisfaction of performance criteria related to 2023 Group EBITA (earnings (loss) before interest  taxes  amortizations and write-downs of acquired intangible) (operating income) performance criterion  along with three-year total shareholder return (""TSR"" [8])  and Group ESG performance criteria  which will determine what portion (if any) of the Performance Share Awards will vest at the end of the Vesting Period.The 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion relates to 45% of the Performance Share Awards and the maximum vesting level is 200%.The performance criteria based on TSR are absolute TSR development and relative TSR development for the shares of series B in Ericsson over the period January 1  2023 ‚Äì December 31  2025 (""Performance Period"" [9]). The absolute and relative TSR performance criteria relate to 25% and 20%  respectively  of the Performance Share Awards and the maximum vesting level for both TSR performance criteria is 200%.The Group ESG performance criterion measured over the Performance Period will relate to 10% of the Performance Share Awards  and the maximum vesting level is 200%.The following conditions will apply to the performance criteria:2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion45% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion for the 2023 financial year. The 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion established by the Board of Directors will stipulate a minimum level and a maximum level. The 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) target is not disclosed due to stock market and competition considerations. The vesting level of Performance Share Awards related to 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion will be determined by the Board of Directors when the audited result for the financial year 2023 is available.If the maximum performance level is reached or exceeded  the vesting will amount to (and will not exceed) the maximum level of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to the 2023 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion. If performance is below the maximum level but exceeds the minimum level  a linear pro-rata vesting of shares will occur. No vesting will occur if performance amounts to or is below the minimum level. The allotment of the shares will not occur until the end of the Vesting Period in 2026.TSR performance criteriaAbsolute TSR performance criterion25% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of an absolute TSR performance criterion over the Performance Period. If the absolute TSR development reaches or exceeds 14% per annum compounded  the maximum vesting of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to absolute TSR performance criterion will occur. If the absolute TSR development is below or reaches only 6% per annum compounded  no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to the absolute TSR performance criterion. A linear pro-rata vesting from 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to absolute TSR performance criterion will apply if the Company's absolute TSR performance is between 6% and 14% per annum compounded.Relative TSR performance criterion20% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a relative TSR performance criterion over the Performance Period  compared to a peer group consisting of 11 peer companies (""Peer Group""[10]). The vesting of the relative TSR related Performance Share Awards varies depending on the Company's TSR performance ranking versus the other companies in the Peer Group. If the Company's relative TSR performance is below the TSR development of the company ranked 6th in the Peer Group  no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to relative TSR performance criterion. Vesting of the Performance Share Awards related to relative TSR performance criterion will occur at the following percentage levels  based on which ranking position in the Peer Group the Company's TSR performance corresponds to:Position within the Peer Group Associated vesting percentage level6 or lower 0%5 50%4 100%3 150%2 or higher 200%If the Company's TSR performance is between two of the ranked companies  a linear pro-rata vesting will apply between the vesting percentage levels for the relevant ranked positions.Group ESG performance criterion10% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a Group ESG performance criterion comprised of two equally weighted subcomponents covering environmental and social aspects of ESG measured over the Performance Period.Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions5% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfillment of a subcomponent of reducing greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions [11] from service fleet vehicles  energy consumption at facilities and from business travel [12].Subcomponent target and corresponding achievement levels are defined in the schedule below and broken down for each of the three years [13] covered by the Performance Period. Vesting is determined at the end of each year  with each year corresponding to one third (1/3) of the total subcomponent Performance Share Awards. A linear pro-rata vesting of one third (1/3) of 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to reducing emissions in the subcomponent will apply if reported emissions in scope are between the minimum and maximum vesting levels for each of the years covered by the Performance Period. An illustrative example is included below.These target levels are aligned to the emissions reduction trajectory set for achieving Net Zero emissions from the Ericsson Group's own activities by 2030.Achievement GHG emissions target levels for emission in scope by fiscal year (ktonne CO2e)(%) 2023 2024 20250 142 132 122100 135 126 116200 121 113 104Illustrative example: first  if reported emissions in scope for the year 2023 are 121 ktonne  the maximum vesting of one third of 200% (1/3 x 200% = 66.67%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent and year will occur. Next  if reported emissions for the year 2024 are 126 ktonne  vesting of one third of 100% (1/3 x 100% = 33.33%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent and fiscal year will occur. Last  if reported emissions in scope for the year 2025 are 122 ktonne  no vesting (1/3 x 0% = 0.00%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent will occur. Consequently  in this example total vesting of the Performance Share Award related to this subcomponent over the Performance Period will be (66.67% + 33.33% + 0.00%) 100%.Increasing the representation of women leaders in Ericsson5% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a subcomponent of increasing the representation of women leaders (i.e. women holding roles with people management responsibility) in the Ericsson Group to 24% by the end of the Performance Period  which is in line with achieving the target trajectory for increasing the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group to 30% by 2030.If the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group amounts to 25% or above by the end of the Performance Period  the maximum vesting of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent will occur. If the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group amounts to 23% or below by the end of the Performance Period  no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent. A linear pro-rata vesting from 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to increasing the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group subcomponent will apply if the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group exceeds 23% but is below 25% by the end of the Performance Period.The vesting level of Performance Share Awards related to the Group ESG performance criterion will be determined by the Board of Directors when the audited results for both subcomponents at the end of the financial year 2025 are available.Information about the outcome of the performance criteria will be provided no later than in the annual report for the financial year 2025.Allotment of sharesProvided that the performance criteria above have been met and that the Participant has retained his or her employment (unless special circumstances are at hand) during the Vesting Period  allotment of vested shares will take place as soon as practicably possible following the expiration of the Vesting Period.When determining the final vesting level of Performance Share Awards  the Board of Directors shall examine whether the vesting level is reasonable considering the Company's financial results and position  conditions on the stock market and other circumstances  such as environmental  social  ethics and compliance factors  and if not  as determined by the Board of Directors  reduce the vesting level to the lower level deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors.In the event delivery of shares to Participants cannot take place under applicable law or at a reasonable cost and employing reasonable administrative measures  the Board of Directors will be entitled to decide that Participants may  instead  be offered a cash settlement.The Company has the right to  before delivering vested shares to the Participants  retain and sell the number of shares required to cover the cost for withholding and paying tax and social security liabilities on behalf of the Participants in relation to the Performance Share Awards for remittance to revenue authorities. In such an event  net amount of vested shares will thus be delivered to the Participants after the vested Performance Share Awards are reduced by the number of shares retained by the Company for such purposes.FinancingThe Board of Directors has considered different financing methods for transfer of shares under the LTV II 2023 such as transfer of treasury stock and an equity swap agreement with a third party. The Board of Directors considers that a directed issue of shares of series C in the Company  followed by buy-back and transfer of treasury stock is the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer shares under the LTV II 2023.The Company's current holding of treasury stock is not sufficient for the implementation of the LTV II 2023. Therefore  the Board of Directors proposes a directed share issue and buy back of shares as further set out below under item 17.2. Under the proposed transactions  shares are issued at the share's quota value and repurchased as soon as the shares have been subscribed for and registered. The purchase price paid by the Company to the subscriber equals the subscription price. As compensation to the subscriber for its assistance in the issuance and buy-back of shares under items 16  17  18 and 19  the Company will pay to the subscriber an amount totaling SEK 100 000.Since the costs for the Company in connection with an equity swap agreement will be significantly higher than the costs in connection with transfer of treasury stock  the main alternative is that the financial exposure is secured by transfer of treasury stock and that an equity swap agreement with a third party is an alternative in the event that the required majority for approval is not reached.CostsThe total effect on the income statement of the LTV II 2023  including financing costs and social security fees  is estimated to range between SEK 146 million and SEK 333 million distributed over the years 2023-2026. The costs will depend on the future development of the price of shares of series B in Ericsson.The administration cost for transfer of shares by way of an equity swap agreement is currently estimated to approximately SEK 30 million  compared to the cost of approximately SEK 100 000 for using newly issued and acquired shares in treasury (SEK 100 000 is the total cost paid to the subscriber in relation to items 16  17  18 and 19  regardless of the number of share issuances).DilutionThe Company has approximately 3.3 billion registered shares. As per December 31  2022  the Company held approximately 4 million shares in treasury. The number of shares that may be required for ongoing LTV programs (2019  2020  2021 and 2022) as per December 31  2022  is estimated to approximately 4.9 million shares  corresponding to approximately 0.15 percent of the number of registered shares of the Company. In order to implement the LTV II 2023  a total of up to 5.9 million shares are required  which corresponds to approximately 0.18 percent of the total number of registered shares of the Company. Hence an issue of new shares is proposed for the implementation of LTV II 2023. The effect on important key figures is only marginal.17.2 Transfer of treasury stock to employees and on an exchange  directed share issue and acquisition offer for the LTV II 2023a. Transfer of treasury stock under the LTV II 2023Transfer of no more than 4.9 million shares of series B in the Company less any shares retained by the Company as per item 17.2 c) may occur on the following terms and conditions:The right to acquire shares shall be granted to such persons within the Ericsson Group covered by the terms and conditions pursuant to the LTV II 2023. Furthermore  subsidiaries within the Ericsson Group shall have the right to acquire shares  free of consideration  and such subsidiaries shall be obligated to immediately transfer  free of consideration  shares to employees covered by the terms and conditions of the LTV II 2023.The employee shall have the right to receive shares during the period when the employee is entitled to receive shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of the LTV II 2023  i.e. in 2026.Employees covered by the terms and conditions of the LTV II 2023 shall receive shares of series B in the Company free of consideration.The number of shares of series B in the Company that may be transferred under the LTV II 2023 may be subject to recalculation in the event of bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or similar measures  under the terms and conditions of the LTV II 2023.b. Transfer of treasury stock on an exchange to cover expensesThe Company may  prior to the AGM in 2024  transfer no more than 1.0 million shares of series B in the Company  in order to cover certain expenses  mainly social security payments. Transfer of the shares shall be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the  at each time  prevailing price interval for the share as disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm.c. Authorization to decide on transfer of treasury stock on an exchange to cover costs for tax and social security liabilities for the ParticipantsAuthorization for the Board of Directors to decide to  in conjunction with the delivery of vested shares under LTV II 2023  prior to the AGM in 2024  retain and sell no more than 60% of the vested shares of series B in the Company in order to cover for the costs for withholding and paying tax and social security liabilities on behalf of the Participants in relation to the Performance Share Awards for remittance to revenue authorities. Transfer of the shares shall be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the  at each time  prevailing price interval for the share as disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm. These shares form a part of the final number of vested shares to the employees under LTV II 2023 and do not incur additional costs to the LTV II 2023 for the Company.d. Directed issue of shares of series C in the CompanyIncrease of the share capital in the Company with SEK 29 500 000.01 by an issue of 5.9 million shares of series C in the Company  each share with a quota value of approximately SEK 5. The terms and conditions of the share issue are the following:The new shares shall ‚Äì with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights ‚Äì be subscribed for only by Investor AB or its subsidiaries.The new shares shall be subscribed for during the period as from Thursday  April 27  2023   up to and including Tuesday  May 2  2023 . Over-subscription may not occur.  up to and including . Over-subscription may not occur. The amount that shall be paid for each new share shall be the quota value (approximately SEK 5 ).). Payment for the subscribed shares shall be made at the time of subscription.The Board of Directors shall be entitled to extend the period for subscription and payment.The new shares shall not entitle the holders to dividend payment.It is noted that the new shares are subject to restrictions pursuant to Chapter 4  Section 6 (conversion clause) and Chapter 20  Section 31 (redemption clause) of the Swedish Companies Act.The Board of Directors proposes that the President and CEO shall be authorized to make the minor adjustments to the above resolutions that may prove to be necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Reasons for deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and principles on which the subscription price is basedThe Board of Directors considers that a directed shares of series C in the Company  followed by buy-back and transfer of treasury stock is the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer shares under the LTV II 2023. Shares are issued at the share's quota value and repurchased as soon as the shares have been subscribed for and registered. The purchase price paid by the Company to the subscriber equals the subscription price.e. Authorization for the Board of Directors to decide on a directed acquisition offerAuthorization for the Board of Directors to decide that 5.9 million shares of series C in Ericsson be acquired according to the following:Acquisition may occur by an offer to acquire shares directed to all holders of shares of series C in Ericsson.The authorization may be exercised until the AGM in 2024.The acquisition shall be made at a price corresponding to the quota value of the share (approximately SEK 5 per share).per share). Payment for acquired shares shall be made in cash.17.3 Equity Swap Agreement with third party in relation to the LTV II 2023In the event that the required majority for approval is not reached under item 17.2 above  the financial exposure of the LTV II 2023 shall be hedged by the Company entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party  under which the third party shall  in its own name  acquire and transfer shares of series B in the Company to employees covered by the LTV II 2023.Majority rulesThe resolution of the AGM on implementation of the LTV II 2023 according to item 17.1 requires that more than half of the votes cast at the AGM approve the proposal. The resolution of the AGM on transfer of treasury stock to employees and on an exchange  directed share issue and acquisition offer for the LTV II 2023 according to item 17.2 requires that shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the AGM approve the proposal. The resolution of the AGM on an Equity Swap Agreement with third party according to item 17.3 requires that more than half of the votes cast at the AGM approve the proposal.Description of other ongoing long-term variable compensation programsIn addition to the LTV programs  which are directed at the President and CEO and the members of the ET  the Company has other ongoing long-term variable compensation programs directed at other employees within the Group (""Executives""). These programs are an integral part of the Company's remuneration strategy as well as a part of the Company's talent management strategy. The Company has decided to implement two other share-related compensation programs for 2023: The Executive Performance Plan 2023 (""EPP 2023"") and the Key Contribution Plan 2023 (""KC Plan 2023""). Ericsson has also implemented an all-employee share purchase plan in 2021.The Executive Performance Plan 2023  implemented only in case the AGM 2023 would not resolve in favor of item 17The EPP 2023 is designed to attract  retain and motivate Executives in a competitive market through performance based long-term cash incentive supporting the achievement of the Company's long-term strategies and business objectives. Approximately 180 Executives will be eligible for the EPP 2023. Participants are assigned a potential award defined as a percentage of the participants' annual gross salary  which is converted into a number of synthetic shares based on the same market price of shares of series B in Ericsson used for the LTV I 2023 at the time of grant. Award levels are assigned to Executives in range of 0-45% of annual base pay.The vesting level of the awards  occurring after a three-year vesting period  is subject to the achievement of the same performance criteria as for the LTV I 2023  and generally requires that the participant retains his or her employment over the three-year vesting period. At the end of the vesting period  the allotted synthetic shares are converted into a cash amount  based on the market price of the shares of series B in Ericsson at Nasdaq Stockholm at the vesting date  and this final amount is paid to the Participant in cash gross before tax. It is estimated that approximately 2.5 million synthetic shares will be awarded under the EPP 2023. The maximum total cost effect of the EPP 2023 on the income statement  including social security fees  is estimated to be approximately SEK 700 million distributed over the years 2023-2026. The costs will depend on the future development of the market price of the shares of series B in Ericsson.The Key Contribution Plan 2023The KC Plan 2023 is designed to recognize the best talent  individual performance  potential and critical skills as well as encourage the retention of key employees. Approximately 10% to 14% of Ericsson employees will be eligible for the KC Plan 2023. The award levels are assigned to employees mainly within in a range of 10 ‚Äì 50% of Annual Base Salary to bring greater alignment with the local market conditions.Participants are assigned a potential award  which is converted into a number of synthetic shares based on the same market price of the shares of series B in Ericsson used for the LTV I 2023 at the time of grant. The plan has a three-year total service period (""Service Period"") during which the awards are paid on an annual rolling bases following the below payment schedule:25% of the award at the end of the first year 25% of the award at the end of the second year  and50% of the award at the end of the full Service Period.The value of each synthetic share is driven by the absolute share price performance of shares of series B in Ericsson shares during the Service Period. At the date of vesting for each instalment of the above-described annual rolling payment schedule  the synthetic shares are converted into a cash amount  based on the market price of the Ericsson series B share on Nasdaq Stockholm at the respective vesting date  and this final amount is paid to the Participant in cash gross before tax. It is estimated that approximately 31 million synthetic shares will be awarded under the KC Plan 2023.

In comparison with the guidelines decided by the AGM 2020  the guidelines have been updated in order to:Adapt the guidelines to ensure the Company's business strategies and ways of working can be supported through the lifecycle of the guidelines;Clarify the mandate for the Board of Directors and Remuneration Committee to define meaningful short-term variable compensation (""STV"") targets linked to the business plan. This enables STV targets to be defined and weighed differently for different parts of the business given the phase in the business lifecycle they are in as required by the business strategy. Therefore  detailed requirements for mandatory weighting and definition of STV targets has been removed;Enable for the Board of Directors to potentially include STV in the remuneration package of the President and CEO. Any inclusion of STV for the future or current President and CEO will take into account the aggregated target opportunity of long-term variable compensation programs and STV; andBroaden the pension guidelines for Swedish members of the group management by removal of specific wordings related to the Swedish collective pension plan ITP1  to accommodate for potential future changes in collective pension plans and to allow for supplementary pension contributions or supplementary cash pension allowance  in excess of any caps of pension contributions allowed under collective pension plans.IntroductionThese Guidelines for Remuneration to Group Management (the ""Guidelines"") apply to the Executive Team of Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (the ""Company"" or ""Ericsson"")  including the President and Chief Executive Officer (the ""President and CEO"") (""Group Management""). These Guidelines apply to remuneration agreed and changes to previously agreed remuneration after the date of approval of the Guidelines and are intended to remain in place for four years until the Annual General Meeting of shareholders 2027. For employments outside of Sweden  due adaptations may be made to comply with mandatory local rules or established local practices. In such cases  the overall purpose of these Guidelines shall be accommodated to the largest extent possible. These Guidelines do not cover remuneration resolved by the general meeting of shareholders  such as long-term variable compensation programs (""LTV"").ObjectiveThese Guidelines aim to ensure alignment with the current remuneration philosophy and practices applicable for the Company's employees based on the principles of competitiveness  fairness  transparency  and performance. In particular to:attract and retain highly competent  performing  and motivated people that have the ability  experience  and skill to deliver on the Ericsson strategy;encourage behavior consistent with Ericsson's culture and core values;ensure fairness in reward by delivering total remuneration that is appropriate but not excessive  and clearly explained;have a total compensation mix of fixed pay  variable pay and benefits that",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,True,English,"['Annual General Meeting', 'Notice', 'Ericsson', 'A Long-Term Variable Compensation Program', '2023, three-year total shareholder return targets', 'Long-Term Variable Compensation Programs', 'The Annual General Meeting', 'three-year vesting period', 'two equal installments', 'Arne Beurlings Torg', 'one-year Group EBITA', 'Euroclear Sweden AB', 'The Nomination Committee', 'Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson', 'postal voting form', 'meeting venue', 'Group Management', 'respective Committee', 'voting rights', 'postal vote', 'other things', 'Jonas Synnergren', 'Christy Wyatt', 'new members', 'Jan Carlson', 'Executive Team', 'operating income', 'treasury stock', 'new Guidelines', 'Kistam√§ssan', 'state name', 'participating assistants', 'corresponding document', 'other documents', 'special form', 'The Board', 'The AGM', '10 a', 'share issue', 'share register', 'new Chair', 'legal entity', 'special instructions', 'dated power', 'telephone number', 'registration number', 'Board fees', 'votes', 'Feb.', 'PRNewswire', 'shareholders', 'NASDAQ', 'Wednesday', 'March', 'item', 'Increase', 'work', 'Committees', 'Directors', 'SEK', 'Executives', 'Transfer', 'employees', 'exchange', 'authorization', 'acquisition', 'offer', 'relation', 'Resolution', 'Remuneration', 'Notice', 'Company', 'CEST', 'Kista/Stockholm', 'accordance', 'articles', 'association', 'Swedish', 'English', 'participation', 'person', 'proxy', 'presentation', 'circumstances', 'Tuesday', 'Thursday', 'weekdays', 'CET', 'Box', 'mail', 'website', 'birth', 'address', 'written', 'attorney', 'representative', 'certificate', 'authority', 'order', 'advance', 'Forms', 'verification', 'BankID', '1.30', '4']",2023-02-22,2023-02-23,prnewswire.com

Most Read from BloombergApple Makes Major Progress on No-Prick Blood Glucose Tracking for Its WatchRussian Support for Putin‚Äôs War in Ukraine Is HardeningPlane Forced to U-Turn Minutes Before Landing Sends Passengers Back HomeUS Housing Market Posts $2.,(Bloomberg) -- Billions of dollars are accumulating in Moscow beyond the reach of its foreign owners.Most Read from BloombergStock dividends  interest payments on bonds and anything else that Western investors didn‚Äôt sell before the war ‚Äî it‚Äôs all part of the pile of money that‚Äôs been trapped by sanctions.The accounts are remnants of what‚Äôs left of Russia‚Äôs ties to the world of international finance  and another marker of its growing isolation. As Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine begins a second year and anti-war demonstrations take place this week  questions remain about what will happen to the cash stuck in Moscow.Legally  the money belongs to some of the biggest investment houses  like JPMorgan Asset Management and Schroders Plc  but privately most acknowledge there‚Äôs no hope of recovery. At least  not while Vladimir Putin remains leader.‚ÄúYou have marked it to zero  you have to forget about it ‚Äù said Tim Love at GAM Investment Management  who owned Russian stocks as part of an emerging equity fund. ‚ÄúThe market is still there  but when one talks of repatriating dividends or accessing the underlying security  it all comes down to sanctions.‚ÄùIn conversations  money managers speak about the issue with some frustration  and many don‚Äôt want to talk on the record about owning Russian assets while there‚Äôs a war going on. Unless they‚Äôre willing to test the boundaries of sanctions  they can‚Äôt do anything with the cash.At a press conference this month  Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina declined to disclose how much money is in special non-resident bank accounts  known as Type C  but said it continues to grow.Interfax reported in November these accounts hold more than 280 billion rubles ($3.7 billion)  citing regulatory sources. Bank of Russia representatives declined to comment.Story continuesEuroclear Gets ‚Ç¨821m Interest From Russia-Sanctioned Cash AssetsBefore the war  foreign investments in Russia were substantial  amounting to around $150 billion of stocks and government bonds  data from the Moscow Exchange and Bank of Russia show.Asset managers have suspended their Russian funds  but some still calculate a theoretical value of how much the assets are worth for clients.For instance  JPMorgan Asset Management‚Äôs Emerging EMEA investment trust told clients that the Russian companies it held continued to pay dividends  with approximately ¬£6.3 million ($7.6 million) frozen in C-accounts as of Jan. 4  though it stressed the money was not accessible.In the case of BlackRock Inc.  it has terminated the iShares MSCI Russia ETF. The company said that it continues to talk to regulators and others in the market about how to exit the positions.‚ÄúThe Russian securities will be liquidated at some point in the future  if this is possible  practicable and appropriate ‚Äù the company said in a September posting online.Another asset manager  East Capital  said it had a total of ‚Ç¨13 million ($13.8 million) in the special accounts as of February.‚ÄúWe have to be cautious about what we can tell our clients ‚Äù said Alexandra Morris  investment director at Norwegian asset manager Skagen AS. ‚ÄúWe can show them these are the values currently priced  but the likelihood is low that we will be able to access them  in fact they could be confiscated any day.‚ÄùMorris said they held 9% of their emerging-market fund in Russian stocks before the invasion  calling it a ‚Äúmajor overweight.‚ÄùWritten Off to ZeroSome fund managers have hopes  albeit distant  of recovering some of their money. In a December report  East Capital said ‚Äúwe do still believe that there is value in most of our portfolio holdings  because we know they are generating free cash flow and paying dividends.‚Äù It added that it has written the assets to zero.Meanwhile  others are seeking legal help to recover even a fraction of their cash. Grigory Marinichev  a partner at law firm Morgan Lewis & Bockius in New York  said he‚Äôs talking to clients looking to explore technical loopholes.One possibility is a multi-stage transfer of the cash to similar accounts held by investors Russia does not class as ‚Äúunfriendly.‚Äù Another is to convert C-accounts into bundles of securities that could be sold to investors not bound by sanctions  he said.‚ÄúAll these options will involve substantial writeoffs ‚Äù Marinichev said. ‚ÄúBut something is better than nothing.‚Äù--With assistance from Stephanie Bodoni.(Updates with BlackRock statement on Russia funds)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek¬©2023 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.24,0.73,0.03,mixed,0.11,0.06,0.83,True,English,"['Growing Cash Pile', 'The', 'Moscow', 'Investors', 'Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina', 'Emerging EMEA investment trust', 'iShares MSCI Russia ETF', 'special non-resident bank accounts', 'biggest investment houses', 'GAM Investment Management', 'emerging equity fund', 'JPMorgan Asset Management', 'Norwegian asset manager', 'Bloomberg L.P.', 'free cash flow', 'Russia-Sanctioned Cash Assets', 'special accounts', 'investment director', 'Asset managers', 'emerging-market fund', 'fund managers', 'foreign owners', 'international finance', 'growing isolation', 'second year', 'anti-war demonstrations', 'Schroders Plc', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Tim Love', 'underlying security', 'press conference', 'Type C', '280 billion rubles', 'regulatory sources', 'foreign investments', 'Russian funds', 'Russian companies', 'BlackRock Inc.', 'September posting', 'East Capital', 'Skagen AS', 'December report', 'legal help', 'law firm', 'Morgan Lewis', 'New York', 'technical loopholes', 'multi-stage transfer', 'similar accounts', 'substantial writeoffs', 'Stephanie Bodoni', 'BlackRock statement', 'Russian assets', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'Russian stocks', 'Russia representatives', 'Russia funds', 'interest payments', 'government bonds', 'theoretical value', 'Russian securities', 'Alexandra Morris', 'Grigory Marinichev', 'One possibility', 'Western investors', 'Moscow Exchange', 'Stock dividends', 'money managers', 'Billions', 'dollars', 'reach', 'part', 'pile', 'sanctions', 'remnants', 'world', 'marker', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'place', 'questions', 'hope', 'recovery', 'leader', 'conversations', 'issue', 'frustration', 'record', 'boundaries', 'Interfax', 'November', 'Story', 'Euroclear', 'data', 'clients', 'instance', 'C-accounts', 'Jan.', 'case', 'company', 'regulators', 'others', 'positions', 'point', 'future', 'total', 'February', 'values', 'likelihood', 'fact', 'Zero', 'portfolio', 'holdings', 'fraction', 'Bockius', 'bundles', 'options', 'something', 'assistance', 'Updates']",2023-02-23,2023-02-23,uk.finance.yahoo.com

The Russia-Ukraine war disrupted the chances of global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic  at least in the short term. The war between these two countries has led to economic sanctions on multiple countries  surge in commodity prices  and supply chain disruptions  causing inflation across goods and services effecting many markets across the globe. The asset servicing market is expected to grow to $1830.69 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 9.4%.The asset servicing market consists of revenues earned by entities by providing administration services through a central securities depository (CSD) or custodian in connection with the custody and/or safekeeping of financial instruments (e.g.  the processing of corporate events or the handling of taxes) on a fee or commission basis. The market value includes the value of related goods sold by the service provider or included within the service offering.

(‚ÄúAMG‚Äù  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: ‚ÄúAMG‚Äù) reported fourth quarter 2022...,AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V.Amsterdam  22 February 2023 (Regulated Information) --- AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. (‚ÄúAMG‚Äù  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: ‚ÄúAMG‚Äù) reported fourth quarter 2022 revenue of $390 million  an 18% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Fourth quarter 2022 EBITDA of $104 million was more than double the fourth quarter of 2021  and drove AMG to a record-setting full year EBITDA of $343 million.In 000‚Äôs US dollars FY ‚Äò22 FY ‚Äò21 Change Revenue $1 642 774 $1 204 666 36% EBITDA (1) 342 550 136 676 151% Cash from operating activities 167 567 90 788 85% Net income attributable to shareholders 187 589 13 771 EPS - Fully diluted 5.73 0.44 Return on Capital Employed 30.8% 11.9%Note:(1) EBITDA is defined as EBIT adjusted for depreciation and amortization.Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  Chairman of the Management Board and CEO  said  ‚ÄúAMG's full year 2022 EBITDA  revenue  gross profit  operating cash flows  return on capital employed  and net income were the highest in the company's history by significant margins. This result is due to the AMG Clean Energy Materials segment  specifically AMG Lithium and its Brazil operation with an EBITDA contribution of $215 million  or 63% of the total EBITDA for the year. Moreover  AMG exceeded $100 million of EBITDA for the second straight quarter. EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $104 million compared to $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2021  an increase of $60 million  or 137%. Our Enabling CO 2 Reduction Portfolio (ECO 2 RP) in 2022 enabled 99.4 million tons of CO 2 reduction  26% more than the 79.0 million tons of enabled CO 2 reduction in 2021.‚ÄùOutlookAMG reaffirms its guidance for the full year 2023 to exceed $400 million EBITDA.AMG anticipates the Company will increase overall staffing from about 3 400 at the end of 2022 by 5% due to the hiring associated with the ramp-up of the vanadium expansion in Ohio and the lithium expansion in Germany.Story continuesCapital expenditures for 2023 are expected to be between $175 million and $200 million  mainly driven by the lithium concentrate expansion in Brazil and expenditures related to the construction of the lithium hydroxide plant in Germany.With regard to financing in 2023  AMG refinanced its $350 million term loan and $200 million revolver in November 2021  extending revolver and term loan maturities to 2026 and 2028  respectively. AMG has no significant near-term debt maturities. And although we look to consistently optimize our financial structure  our current liquidity of $532 million can fully fund all of the approved capital expansion projects and all other financial obligations.In addition  we reaffirm our two-pronged commitment to reduce our CO 2 emissions and increase our enabled CO 2 savings through 2030.Strategic HighlightsLithiumThe spodumene production expansion project in AMG Brazil is progressing. The project will solidify AMG‚Äôs low-cost position. The objective is to be at full capacity in the second half of 2023.The AMG Lithium refinery in Bitterfeld  Germany  Europe‚Äôs first lithium hydroxide refinery  is under construction  and commissioning for the first 20 000-ton module of the battery-grade lithium hydroxide upgrader will commence in the fourth quarter of 2023.AMG Lithium has signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with FREYR Battery  the basis of which is for AMG Lithium to supply FREYR between 3 000 to 5 000 tons per annum of battery-grade lithium hydroxide.AMG Brazil  JX Nippon Mining & Metals Corporation (‚ÄúJXNMM‚Äù) and TANIOBIS GmbH announced a strategic partnership in December 2022 for the production and supply of tantalum concentrate from AMG‚Äôs Mibra Mine in Brazil. JXNMM will invest in the expansion of tantalum concentrate production that is occurring in combination with AMG‚Äôs already announced expansion of spodumene capacity. All tantalum pre-concentrate will be sold to TANIOBIS  providing long-term stability in tantalum sales and corresponding by-product credits to lithium production costs for AMG Brazil.VanadiumAMG finalized the completion of the new vanadium spent catalyst recycling facility in Zanesville  Ohio. Operations began on October 29  2022  and we are targeting full production capacity in the second quarter of 2023.Shell & AMG Recycling B.V.

Basic engineering for the plant was completed in November  CAPEX is expected to be $15 million  and production is expected to start at the end of 2023.Financial HighlightsRevenue increased by 18% to $390 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 from $330 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. On a full year basis  revenue increased by 36%.EBITDA was $104 million in the fourth quarter of 2022  up 137% versus the fourth quarter 2021 EBITDA of $44 million. Full year EBITDA of $343 million is 151% higher than the prior year.Annualized return on capital employed was 30.8% for 2022  more than double the 11.9% for 2021.Cash flow from operations was $168 million for full year 2022  compared to $91 million in 2021  driven by the high profitability of AMG Lithium in Brazil.Net income attributable to shareholders for full year 2022 was $188 million  yielding $5.73 diluted earnings per share compared to $0.44 in 2021.AMG‚Äôs liquidity as of December 31  2022 was $532 million  with $346 million of unrestricted cash and $186 million of revolving credit availability.The total 2022 dividend proposed is ‚Ç¨0.70 per ordinary share  including the interim dividend of ‚Ç¨0.30  paid on August 10  2022.Key FiguresIn 000‚Äôs US dollars Q4 ‚Äò22 Q4 ‚Äò21 Change FY ‚Äò22 FY ‚Äò21 Change Revenue $390 004 $330 360 18% $1 642 774 $1 204 666 36% Gross profit 119 981 61 797 94% 409 486 208 243 97% Gross margin 30.8% 18.7% 24.9% 17.3% Operating profit 82 319 22 295 269% 307 059 57 141 437% Operating margin 21.1% 6.7% 18.7% 4.7% Net incomeattributable toshareholders 60 697 5 705 964% 187 589 13 771 1 262% EPS - Fully diluted 1.85 0.18 928% 5.73 0.44 1 202% EBIT (1) 91 719 32 678 181% 297 251 92 991 220% EBITDA (2) 104 061 43 885 137% 342 550 136 676 151% EBITDA margin 26.7% 13.3% 20.9% 11.3% Cash fromoperating activities 56 969 30 225 88% 167 567 90 788 85%Notes:(1) EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and income taxes.

The higher prices and volumes in 2022 propelled revenue for the segment 75% higher than in 2021.Gross profit before non-recurring items for the quarter increased 185% compared to the same period in the prior year. The segment‚Äôs full year 2022 gross profit before non-recurring items grew 241% compared to 2021  primarily due to the increased price environment.SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022 were in line with the same period in 2021 at $12 million. Full year 2022 SG&A expenses were 11% higher than in 2021  largely due to increased professional fees associated with strategic projects during 2022 offset by lower share-based compensation.The fourth quarter 2022 EBITDA increased 212%  to $80 million  from $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2021  due to the improved gross profit as noted above. The segment‚Äôs full year 2022 EBITDA of $259 million was 289% higher than the 2021 EBITDA  largely driven by the lithium business. Vanadium profitability was impacted in the fourth quarter of 2022 by a sequential drop in index prices of 16% from the third quarter and the impact of start-up costs for Zanesville.During the fourth quarter of 2022  a total of 21 329 dry metric tons (‚Äúdmt‚Äù) of spodumene was sold. The average realized sales price was $3 682/dmt CIF China for the quarter. The average cost per ton for the quarter was $228/dmt CIF China. This exceptional cost per ton result was driven by high sales volumes of tantalum concentrate in the quarter  and drove a quarterly EBITDA figure for AMG Brazil of $73 million.For the full year 2022  a total of 86 713 dmt of spodumene was sold. The average realized sales price was $2 805/dmt CIF China and the average cost per ton for the full year was $461/dmt CIF China. Total EBITDA for AMG Brazil was $215 million.AMG Critical MineralsQ4 ‚Äò22 Q4 ‚Äò21 Change FY ‚Äò22 FY ‚Äò21 Change Revenue $69 242 $79 422 (13%) $364 502 $308 523 18% Gross profit 19 017 11 189 70% 46 721 48 735 (4%) Gross profit beforenon-recurring items 18 641 11 379 64% 57 928 48 690 19% Operating profit 10 961 2 584 324% 63 995 20 181 217% EBITDA 14 001 6 459 117% 38 280 31 200 23%AMG Critical Minerals‚Äô revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased by $10 million  or 13%  to $69 million  mainly due to lower volumes across the segment. On a full year basis  revenue increased by 18% compared to 2021.Gross profit before non-recurring items of $19 million in the fourth quarter was 64% higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The segment‚Äôs full year 2022 gross profit before non-recurring items was 19% higher than in 2021  largely driven by the improved price environment and favorable energy contracts for silicon production in the fourth quarter.SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased by 20%  to $7 million  compared to the same period in 2021. This was largely driven by lower share-based compensation expense in the current quarter associated with a reversal recorded in the prior year. Full year 2022 SG&A expenses were slightly lower than 2021 by $0.6 million.The fourth quarter 2022 EBITDA increased 117% compared to the same period in 2021  to $14 million  due to improved gross profit as noted above and favorable energy contracts at AMG Silicon in the quarter. Improved prices during 2022 led to a 23% increase in full year EBITDA for the segment compared to 2021.Effective January 1  2023  AMG placed its silicon metal plant in Pocking  Germany  on care and maintenance. The plant will restart and operate one furnace in March of 2023. The operational parameters of the silicon business will continue to be reviewed on an ongoing basis and will be adjusted as appropriate in line with favorable and predictable market conditions. Due to the noted interruptions in silicon operations  the financial impact of the business will be excluded from EBITDA during this period of abnormal operations. The financial impact of the care and maintenance program does not significantly impact AMG‚Äôs overall projected 2023 financial results.AMG Critical Materials TechnologiesQ4 ‚Äò22 Q4 ‚Äò21 Change FY ‚Äò22 FY ‚Äò21 Change Revenue $144 697 $135 533 7% $610 468 $514 668 19% Gross profit 19 381 22 658 (14%) 94 903 84 413 12% Gross profit beforenon-recurring items 20 745 22 388 (7%) 96 449 84 309 14% Operating profit 1 579 3 410 (54%) 20 474 14 484 41% EBITDA 9 713 11 673 (17%) 44 790 38 854 15%AMG Critical Materials Technologies' fourth quarter 2022 revenue increased by $9 million  or 7%  compared to the same period in 2021. This improvement was driven by higher sales volumes of titanium aluminides and higher prices for chrome metal. Full year 2022 revenue was 19% higher than the prior year and gross profit before non-recurring items for 2022 of $96 million was 14% higher than the $84 million in 2021  due largely to the improved price environment versus the prior year associated with the continued recovery of the aerospace market post pandemic.During the first half of the year  market disruptions associated with the Russian invasion of Ukraine impacted the chrome metal supply chain  creating a dramatic increase in the price of raw materials and limited availability. To protect against operational interruptions  the Company secured additional raw material volumes at market conditions at fixed prices. In the fourth quarter  the disruptions to the supply chain were alleviated and the prices fell dramatically. This resulted in the company‚Äôs chrome margins being negatively impacted in the fourth quarter and an inventory write-down of $1.6 million.SG&A expenses decreased by 7% in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021  due to lower share-based expense in the current quarter associated with a reversal in the prior year.AMG Critical Materials Technologies‚Äô EBITDA was $10 million during the quarter compared to $12 million in the same period of 2021. The decrease is due to the chrome market dislocation noted above  offset by stronger profitability from our Engineering business. Full year 2022 EBITDA for the segment of $45 million was 15% higher than 2021. This was primarily due to the continued recovery in the aerospace sector in 2022.AMG Engineering signed $67 million in new orders during the fourth quarter of 2022  driven by strong orders of turbine blade and induction furnaces  representing a 1.28x book to bill ratio. In January 2023  the Company‚Äôs strong order intake continued with $44 million in new orders  mainly due to turbine blade coater sales. Order backlog was $220 million as of December 31  2022  the highest since March 31  2020.Financial ReviewTaxAMG recorded an income tax expense of $84 million in 2022  compared to $9 million in 2021. This variance was mainly driven by enhanced operating results in AMG Lithium at its Brazil operation coupled with movements in the Brazilian real. The effects of the Brazilian real caused a $7 million benefit in 2022  compared to a $4 million tax benefit in 2021. Fluctuations in the Brazilian real exchange rate impact the valuation of the Company‚Äôs net deferred tax positions related to our operations in Brazil.AMG paid taxes of $42 million in 2022  compared to tax payments of $10 million in 2021. The higher cash payments in 2022 were largely a result of improved operating results.Exceptional ItemsAMG‚Äôs fourth quarter and full year 2022 gross profit includes exceptional items  which are not included in the calculation of EBITDA.A summary of exceptional items included in gross profit in 2022 and 2021 are below:Exceptional items included in gross profitQ4 ‚Äò22 Q4 ‚Äò21 Change FY ‚Äò22 FY ‚Äò21 Change Gross profit $119 981 $61 797 94% $409 486 $208 243 97% Inventory cost adjustment 1 589 ‚Äî N/A 1 589 1 164 37% Restructuring expense (reversal) 389 (140) N/A 582 522 11% Asset impairment (reversal) expense (990) 153 N/A 10 597 (711) N/A Strategic project expense 1 201 1 501 (20%) 5 540 4 045 37% Others ‚Äî (506) N/A ‚Äî ‚Äî N/A Gross profit excluding exceptional items 122 170 62 805 95% 427 794 213 263 101%Energy CostsTotal energy costs were $16 million higher in 2022 versus 2021 due to the increases in gas and electricity costs during the year. The majority of this increase was at our silicon business in Germany  but that business benefited from fully hedged power costs. Other business units benefited from long-term electricity contracts that have no price escalation clauses  and the business units that did experience energy cost increases were able to pass through most of these increased costs to their customers.SG&AAMG‚Äôs fourth quarter 2022 SG&A expenses were $37 million compared to $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2021  with the decrease due to lower share-based compensation expense associated with a reversal in the prior year.Full year 2022 SG&A expenses were $148 million  6% higher than in 2021  with the variance due to increased professional fees associated with strategic projects during the current period  offset by lower share-based compensation expense.LiquidityDecember 31  2022 December 31  2021 Change Senior secured debt $348 622 $371 897 (6%) Cash & cash equivalents 346 043 337 877 2% Senior secured net debt 2 579 34 020 (92%) Other debt 14 959 24 398 (39%) Net debt excluding municipal bond 17 538 58 418 (70%) Municipal bond debt 319 244 319 476 ‚Äî% Restricted cash 6 920 93 434 (93%) Net debt 329 862 284 460 16%AMG ended the year in a $330 million net debt position. This increase was mainly due to the significant investment in growth initiatives during the year  particularly at our Zanesville facility  which utilized the restricted cash associated with the municipal bond. This use of restricted cash was offset by $34 million of debt repayment and higher unrestricted cash.AMG continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the fourth quarter. As of December 31  2022  the Company had $346 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $186 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $532 million of total liquidity as of December 31  2022.Net Finance CostsAMG‚Äôs fourth quarter 2022 net finance income was $4 million compared to a cost of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This variance was mainly driven by foreign exchange gains of $10 million during the quarter primarily due to non-cash intergroup balances.AMG capitalized $1 million of interest costs in the fourth quarter of 2022 versus $4 million in the same period in 2021  driven by interest associated with the Company‚Äôs tax-exempt municipal bond supporting the vanadium expansion in Ohio. This decrease is due to a portion of the municipal bond interest costs which are no longer being capitalized due to the ramp-up of production at our Zanesville facility.Final Dividend ProposalAMG intends to declare a dividend of ‚Ç¨0.70 per ordinary share over the financial year 2022. The interim dividend of ‚Ç¨0.30  paid on August 10  2022  will be deducted from the amount to be distributed to shareholders. The proposed final dividend per ordinary share therefore amounts to ‚Ç¨0.40.A proposal to resolve upon the final dividend distribution will be included on the agenda for the Annual General Meeting to be held on May 4  2023.Profit for the period to adjusted EBITDA reconciliationQ4 ‚Äò22 Q4 ‚Äò21 FY ‚Äò22 FY ‚Äò21 Profit for the period $62 669 $4 139 $190 771 $13 779 Income tax expense 23 827 5 293 84 097 8 707 Net finance (income) cost (4 177) 12 644 30 941 33 602 Equity-settled share-based payment transactions 1 414 6 883 5 552 10 206 Restructuring expense (reversal) 389 (140) 582 522 Net contract settlements (1) 971 ‚Äî (45 436) ‚Äî Inventory cost adjustment 1 589 ‚Äî 1 589 1 164 Asset impairment (reversal) expense (1) (990) 153 10 597 (711) Environmental provision 143 230 133 11 941 Strategic project expense (2) 5 885 3 769 17 070 12 157 Share of loss of associates ‚Äî 219 1 250 1 053 Others (1) (512) 105 571 EBIT 91 719 32 678 297 251 92 991 Depreciation and amortization 12 342 11 207 45 299 43 685 EBITDA 104 061 43 885 342 550 136 676Notes:(1) Associated with the silicon metal shutdown  AMG recorded income from the sale of an existing supply contract which positively impacted operating profit for the year.

The shares will be purchased over a period ending December 31  2023 on NYSE / Euronext Milan / Euronext Paris.The opportunity to initiate the buyback program stems from the company‚Äôs significant cash flow generation and strong balance sheet.These factors enable the company to ensure adequate liquidity to manage a wide variety of economic and market backdrops  while simultaneously facilitating attractive capital returns to shareholders.The share buyback program will be carried out under the authority granted by the general meeting of shareholders held on April 13  2022  which may be renewed or extended  up to a maximum of 10% of the Company‚Äôs capital. The purchase price per common share will be no higher than an amount equal to 110% of the market price of the shares on the NYSE  Euronext Milan or Euronext Paris. The market price will be calculated as the average of the highest price on each of the five days of trading prior to the date on which the acquisition is made  as shown in the official price list of the NYSE  Euronext Milan or Euronext Paris. Following the share buyback transaction for 69.1 million shares (2.2% of the Company‚Äôs capital) executed on September 15  2022  the remaining authorization stands at 244 million shares  more than adequate to cover this share buyback program and the potential repurchase of 99.42 million shares currently owned by Chinese JV partner Dongfeng Corporation under the terms announced on July 15  2022.Stellantis will provide updates on the start of buybacks and on the buyback program via a press release and on the Investors section of the corporate website. The buybacks will be carried out subject to market conditions and in compliance with applicable rules and regulations  including the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014 and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052.Story continues###About StellantisStellantis N.V.

19034,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://cleantechnica.com/2023/02/22/us-pokes-the-sleeping-giant-of-ocean-wave-energy/,US Pokes The Sleeping Giant Of Ocean Wave Energy,US banks on massive new PacWave South test site to nail down a piece of the global wave energy industry pie.,Tapping ocean waves to generate clean electricity sounds simple enough  but the devil is in the details. Corrosion and durability issues are daunting out there on the open seas. Nevertheless  the US is racing to grab a share of the Earth‚Äôs wave energy  and the reason is simple. An estimated 1 170 terawatt-hours per year in recoverable wave resources sits along the shores of the US and Puerto Rico  accounting for a sizeable portion of the nation‚Äôs annual electricity demand.Wave Power: What‚Äôs Taking You So Long?What is taking so long  indeed. The Electric Power Research Institute has been assessing the state of affairs in the wave energy field every year since 2000. Doing the math  that was 23 years ago.In a 2005 update  EPRI cautioned that ‚Äúbecause so many conflicting and overly optimistic claims are often made about the performance and economic potential of emerging energy sources like ocean tidal and wave energy  it is important to conduct careful and objective assessments of the status  performance  cost  environmental impacts  and other aspects of the technologies.‚ÄùThe US Marine Corps got the memo. In 2010  it cranked up the first ever grid-connected testing system for wave energy converters at Marine Corps Base Hawaii  in Oahu. The idea was to help spur private sector investment by offering hopeful innovators a place to test their wares.CleanTechnica was paying attention as well. We took note of the project launch and cited then-Secretary of the Navy and huge climate action fan Ray Mabus  who said: ‚ÄúThis project demonstrates the Navy and Marine Corps commitment to lead the country toward a new energy future.‚ÄùThe Oahu test site has also gotten an assist from the Department of Energy as well as the Department of the Navy.In 2011  EPRI rendered a meticulous analysis of wave energy resources off the coasts of the US and Puerto Rico  in collaboration with the Virginia Tech Advanced Research Institute and the Energy Department‚Äôs National Renewable Energy Laboratory. They came up with an estimate of 2 640 terrawatt-hours per year  of which 1 170 terawatt-hours is potentially recoverable.Here Comes PacWaveThe Marines Corps wave energy test site is located in a bay. The next step in terms of attracting interest from the private sector is an ocean test site off an open coast. That set the stage for the twin PacWave projects off the coast of Oregon: PacWave North  an established test site located in relatively shallow waters north of the port of Newport  Oregon  and PacWave South  a more expansive site in deeper waters south of the port.PacWave South is billed as the first pre-permitted  grid-connected  open-waters test facility in the US. It is capable of testing up to 20 different wave energy converters at a time. The devices will be distributed among four berths with a total output of up to 5 megawatts each.‚ÄúThe facility will offer wave energy developers the opportunity to try different technologies for harnessing the power of ocean waves and transmitting that energy to the local electrical grid ‚Äù explains Oregon University  which is a lead partner in the project along with the US Department of Energy.The PacWave South facility is still under construction and is actually not connected to the grid yet (more on that in a sec)  but activity is already beginning to stir. Last September the Energy Department put up $25 million to fund for eight wave energy converter projects at the site.The Pieces Of The Wave Energy Puzzle Are Coming TogetherPacWave is getting closer to that grid connection. Construction began on a medium voltage onshore facility earlier this month  and is expected to finish next year.Another big piece of the puzzle is the cable that connects the test bed to the shoreside facility  and that‚Äôs where Nexans comes in.The Paris-based company emailed CleanTechnica with an advance look at its press release  announcing that it has been selected ‚Äúfor the design  engineering and manufacturing of the 36kV submarine and terrestrial cables that will run across the ocean floor.‚Äù‚ÄúThis major project is a significant step in the American sustainable energy transition and will further solidify Nexans‚Äô position as a pure player in sustainable electrification ‚Äù the company emphasized.Meanwhile  wave energy converters are already proliferating all over the world in various stages of development. They‚Äôre being disguised as boats  integrated with solar panels  and piggybacked onto offshore wind farms.Wait  What Is Nexans?CleanTechnica took note of Nexans back in 2009 when it won the contract to lay cable for the London Array offshore wind farm  and we have a lot of catching up to do.Nexans has roots in the cable business going back 120 years  and it is shifting gears into sustainability. The company is transitioning from a ‚Äúgeneralist cable manufacturer‚Äù to a ‚Äúpure electrification player.‚Äù‚ÄúThe electrification market represents 65% of the world cable market and is expected to grow by +4.3% per annum over the next 10 years driven by key growth trends: changing of lifestyles and growing energy consumption  demand for sustainable energies  grid modernization and protection ‚Äù Nexans explains.‚ÄúThe world is becoming more electric and carbon neutral. Likewise  our scope of customer needs are changing from cables to systems and interconnected solutions ‚Äù Nexans adds.They‚Äôre not kidding around when it comes to marine energy. Nexans‚Äôs Generation and Transmission branch already has a hand in offshore wind  floating wind  and floating solar. The new PacWave South contract provides it with a high profile foothold in the wave energy field.Woke  SchmokeThat thing about carbon neutral may set off a new round of bleating and braying among US office holders in the Republican party  who have taken to attacking the corporate ESG (environment  social  governance) movement along with something called ‚Äúwoke capitalism.‚ÄùApparently Nexans did not get the memo. Last month  the company announced that it has joined the new CAC SBT 1.5¬∞ index  which is the climate-focused iteration of the main stock index in France  the CAC 40 index.The stock exchange operator Euronext launched the CAC SBT 1.5¬∞ in January. It builds on the CAC 40 ESG Index  which Euronext introduced in 2021  and it conforms to guidelines for companies to measure and track their greenhouse gas emissions under the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).‚ÄúThe CAC SBT 1.5¬∞ will provide a climate-focused version of the CAC 40 and respond to the growing demand for sustainable investment tools from investors and from the market ‚Äù Euronext explains.‚ÄúThe CAC SBT 1.5¬∞ Index is designed to facilitate the adoption of mainstream ESG investment approaches by institutional and private investors while providing a strong focus on climate change considerations ‚Äù they add.Euronext notes that the application of SBTi methodology is a ‚Äúfirst for a stock exchange operator. The index was created with the support of the leading European asset manager Amundi and the nonprofit CDP (the Carbon Disclosure Project) as well as SBTi.Olivier Chevreau  Nexans VP of Sustainability  states that ‚ÄúNexans‚Äô inclusion in the SBT 1.5¬∞ index is a further recognition of the decarbonization efforts undertaken by the Group  and of the seriousness of its approach  reviewed by the SBTi in April 2022.‚ÄùStay tuned for more on that. Meanwhile  here in the US the energy transition marches on. Some of the most far-reaching and influential clean tech projects are taking form in states where Republican office holders are beating the anti-ESG drum the most loudly  so go figure.Follow me on Trainwreck Twitter @TinaMCasey.Find me on LinkedIn: @TinaMCasey or Mastodon: @Casey or Post: @tinamcaseyPhoto: PacWave South wave energy test site courtesy of US Department of Energy.,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.29,0.12,0.59,True,English,"['The Sleeping Giant', 'Ocean Wave Energy', 'US', 'huge climate action fan Ray Mabus', 'The Marines Corps wave energy test site', 'up to 20 different wave energy converters', 'Virginia Tech Advanced Research Institute', 'London Array offshore wind farm', 'The Electric Power Research Institute', 'eight wave energy converter projects', 'Marine Corps Base Hawaii', 'medium voltage onshore facility', 'National Renewable Energy Laboratory', 'grid-connected, open-waters test facility', 'American sustainable energy transition', 'The US Marine Corps', 'The Oahu test site', 'The PacWave South facility', 'Marine Corps commitment', 'offshore wind farms', 'grid-connected testing system', 'wave energy field', 'wave energy developers', 'twin PacWave projects', 'ocean test site', 'key growth trends', 'emerging energy sources', 'new energy future', 'wave energy resources', 'annual electricity demand', 'The Paris-based company', 'Wave Energy Puzzle', 'private sector investment', 'local electrical grid', 'generalist cable manufacturer', 'pure electrification player', 'world cable market', 'Wave Power', 'wave resources', 'test bed', 'different technologies', 'sustainable electrification', 'expansive site', 'shoreside facility', 'pure player', 'growing energy', 'electrification market', 'Energy Department', 'clean electricity', 'ocean waves', 'ocean tidal', 'ocean floor', 'PacWave North', 'durability issues', 'open seas', 'Puerto Rico', 'sizeable portion', 'many conflicting', 'optimistic claims', 'economic potential', 'objective assessments', 'environmental impacts', 'other aspects', 'hopeful innovators', 'meticulous analysis', 'next step', 'shallow waters', 'deeper waters', 'four berths', 'total output', 'lead partner', 'grid connection', 'big piece', 'advance look', 'press release', '36kV submarine', 'terrestrial cables', 'significant step', 'various stages', 'solar panels', 'cable business', 'next 10 years', 'project launch', 'open coast', 'major project', 'Oregon University', 'US Department', 'Nexans‚Äô position', 'devil', 'details', 'Corrosion', 'share', 'Earth', 'reason', '1,170 terawatt-hours', 'state', 'affairs', 'math', '2005 update', 'EPRI', 'performance', 'careful', 'status', 'cost', 'memo', 'first', 'idea', 'place', 'wares', 'CleanTechnica', 'attention', 'note', 'Secretary', 'Navy', 'country', 'assist', 'coasts', 'collaboration', 'estimate', '2,640 terrawatt-hours', 'bay', 'terms', 'interest', 'Newport', 'time', 'devices', '5 megawatts', 'opportunity', 'construction', 'activity', 'Pieces', 'design', 'engineering', 'manufacturing', 'development', 'boats', 'contract', 'lot', 'roots', 'gears', 'sustainability', 'lifestyles']",2023-02-22,2023-02-23,cleantechnica.com

(‚ÄúAMG‚Äù  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: ‚ÄúAMG‚Äù) reported fourth quarter 2022 revenue of $390 million  an 18% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Fourth quarter 2022 EBITDA of $104 million was more than double the fourth quarter of 2021  and drove AMG to a record-setting full year EBITDA of $343 million.In 000‚Äôs US dollars FY ‚Äò22 FY ‚Äò21 Change Revenue $1 642 774 $1 204 666 36% EBITDA (1) 342 550 136 676 151% Cash from operating activities 167 567 90 788 85% Net income attributable to shareholders 187 589 13 771 EPS - Fully diluted 5.73 0.44 Return on Capital Employed 30.8% 11.9%Note:(1) EBITDA is defined as EBIT adjusted for depreciation and amortization.Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  Chairman of the Management Board and CEO  said  ‚ÄúAMG's full year 2022 EBITDA  revenue  gross profit  operating cash flows  return on capital employed  and net income were the highest in the company's history by significant margins. This result is due to the AMG Clean Energy Materials segment  specifically AMG Lithium and its Brazil operation with an EBITDA contribution of $215 million  or 63% of the total EBITDA for the year. Moreover  AMG exceeded $100 million of EBITDA for the second straight quarter. EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $104 million compared to $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2021  an increase of $60 million  or 137%. Our Enabling CO 2 Reduction Portfolio (ECO 2 RP) in 2022 enabled 99.4 million tons of CO 2 reduction  26% more than the 79.0 million tons of enabled CO 2 reduction in 2021.‚ÄùOutlookAMG reaffirms its guidance for the full year 2023 to exceed $400 million EBITDA.AMG anticipates the Company will increase overall staffing from about 3 400 at the end of 2022 by 5% due to the hiring associated with the ramp-up of the vanadium expansion in Ohio and the lithium expansion in Germany.Capital expenditures for 2023 are expected to be between $175 million and $200 million  mainly driven by the lithium concentrate expansion in Brazil and expenditures related to the construction of the lithium hydroxide plant in Germany.With regard to financing in 2023  AMG refinanced its $350 million term loan and $200 million revolver in November 2021  extending revolver and term loan maturities to 2026 and 2028  respectively. AMG has no significant near-term debt maturities. And although we look to consistently optimize our financial structure  our current liquidity of $532 million can fully fund all of the approved capital expansion projects and all other financial obligations.In addition  we reaffirm our two-pronged commitment to reduce our CO 2 emissions and increase our enabled CO 2 savings through 2030.Strategic HighlightsLithiumThe spodumene production expansion project in AMG Brazil is progressing. The project will solidify AMG‚Äôs low-cost position. The objective is to be at full capacity in the second half of 2023.The AMG Lithium refinery in Bitterfeld  Germany  Europe‚Äôs first lithium hydroxide refinery  is under construction  and commissioning for the first 20 000-ton module of the battery-grade lithium hydroxide upgrader will commence in the fourth quarter of 2023.AMG Lithium has signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with FREYR Battery  the basis of which is for AMG Lithium to supply FREYR between 3 000 to 5 000 tons per annum of battery-grade lithium hydroxide.AMG Brazil  JX Nippon Mining & Metals Corporation (‚ÄúJXNMM‚Äù) and TANIOBIS GmbH announced a strategic partnership in December 2022 for the production and supply of tantalum concentrate from AMG‚Äôs Mibra Mine in Brazil. JXNMM will invest in the expansion of tantalum concentrate production that is occurring in combination with AMG‚Äôs already announced expansion of spodumene capacity. All tantalum pre-concentrate will be sold to TANIOBIS  providing long-term stability in tantalum sales and corresponding by-product credits to lithium production costs for AMG Brazil.VanadiumAMG finalized the completion of the new vanadium spent catalyst recycling facility in Zanesville  Ohio. Operations began on October 29  2022  and we are targeting full production capacity in the second quarter of 2023.Shell & AMG Recycling B.V. (‚ÄúSARBV‚Äù) is advancing its projects in the Middle East  in particular the first phase of the Supercenter project based on long-term supply agreements with Saudi Arabian Oil Company (‚ÄúAramco‚Äù).

The higher prices and volumes in 2022 propelled revenue for the segment 75% higher than in 2021.Gross profit before non-recurring items for the quarter increased 185% compared to the same period in the prior year. The segment‚Äôs full year 2022 gross profit before non-recurring items grew 241% compared to 2021  primarily due to the increased price environment.SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022 were in line with the same period in 2021 at $12 million. Full year 2022 SG&A expenses were 11% higher than in 2021  largely due to increased professional fees associated with strategic projects during 2022 offset by lower share-based compensation.The fourth quarter 2022 EBITDA increased 212%  to $80 million  from $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2021  due to the improved gross profit as noted above. The segment‚Äôs full year 2022 EBITDA of $259 million was 289% higher than the 2021 EBITDA  largely driven by the lithium business. Vanadium profitability was impacted in the fourth quarter of 2022 by a sequential drop in index prices of 16% from the third quarter and the impact of start-up costs for Zanesville.During the fourth quarter of 2022  a total of 21 329 dry metric tons (‚Äúdmt‚Äù) of spodumene was sold. The average realized sales price was $3 682/dmt CIF China for the quarter. The average cost per ton for the quarter was $228/dmt CIF China. This exceptional cost per ton result was driven by high sales volumes of tantalum concentrate in the quarter  and drove a quarterly EBITDA figure for AMG Brazil of $73 million.For the full year 2022  a total of 86 713 dmt of spodumene was sold. The average realized sales price was $2 805/dmt CIF China and the average cost per ton for the full year was $461/dmt CIF China. Total EBITDA for AMG Brazil was $215 million.AMG Critical MineralsQ4 ‚Äò22 Q4 ‚Äò21 Change FY ‚Äò22 FY ‚Äò21 Change Revenue $69 242 $79 422 (13%) $364 502 $308 523 18% Gross profit 19 017 11 189 70% 46 721 48 735 (4%) Gross profit beforenon-recurring items 18 641 11 379 64% 57 928 48 690 19% Operating profit 10 961 2 584 324% 63 995 20 181 217% EBITDA 14 001 6 459 117% 38 280 31 200 23%AMG Critical Minerals‚Äô revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased by $10 million  or 13%  to $69 million  mainly due to lower volumes across the segment. On a full year basis  revenue increased by 18% compared to 2021.Gross profit before non-recurring items of $19 million in the fourth quarter was 64% higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The segment‚Äôs full year 2022 gross profit before non-recurring items was 19% higher than in 2021  largely driven by the improved price environment and favorable energy contracts for silicon production in the fourth quarter.SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased by 20%  to $7 million  compared to the same period in 2021. This was largely driven by lower share-based compensation expense in the current quarter associated with a reversal recorded in the prior year. Full year 2022 SG&A expenses were slightly lower than 2021 by $0.6 million.The fourth quarter 2022 EBITDA increased 117% compared to the same period in 2021  to $14 million  due to improved gross profit as noted above and favorable energy contracts at AMG Silicon in the quarter. Improved prices during 2022 led to a 23% increase in full year EBITDA for the segment compared to 2021.Effective January 1  2023  AMG placed its silicon metal plant in Pocking  Germany  on care and maintenance. The plant will restart and operate one furnace in March of 2023. The operational parameters of the silicon business will continue to be reviewed on an ongoing basis and will be adjusted as appropriate in line with favorable and predictable market conditions. Due to the noted interruptions in silicon operations  the financial impact of the business will be excluded from EBITDA during this period of abnormal operations. The financial impact of the care and maintenance program does not significantly impact AMG‚Äôs overall projected 2023 financial results.AMG Critical Materials TechnologiesQ4 ‚Äò22 Q4 ‚Äò21 Change FY ‚Äò22 FY ‚Äò21 Change Revenue $144 697 $135 533 7% $610 468 $514 668 19% Gross profit 19 381 22 658 (14%) 94 903 84 413 12% Gross profit beforenon-recurring items 20 745 22 388 (7%) 96 449 84 309 14% Operating profit 1 579 3 410 (54%) 20 474 14 484 41% EBITDA 9 713 11 673 (17%) 44 790 38 854 15%AMG Critical Materials Technologies' fourth quarter 2022 revenue increased by $9 million  or 7%  compared to the same period in 2021. This improvement was driven by higher sales volumes of titanium aluminides and higher prices for chrome metal. Full year 2022 revenue was 19% higher than the prior year and gross profit before non-recurring items for 2022 of $96 million was 14% higher than the $84 million in 2021  due largely to the improved price environment versus the prior year associated with the continued recovery of the aerospace market post pandemic.During the first half of the year  market disruptions associated with the Russian invasion of Ukraine impacted the chrome metal supply chain  creating a dramatic increase in the price of raw materials and limited availability. To protect against operational interruptions  the Company secured additional raw material volumes at market conditions at fixed prices. In the fourth quarter  the disruptions to the supply chain were alleviated and the prices fell dramatically. This resulted in the company‚Äôs chrome margins being negatively impacted in the fourth quarter and an inventory write-down of $1.6 million.SG&A expenses decreased by 7% in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021  due to lower share-based expense in the current quarter associated with a reversal in the prior year.AMG Critical Materials Technologies‚Äô EBITDA was $10 million during the quarter compared to $12 million in the same period of 2021. The decrease is due to the chrome market dislocation noted above  offset by stronger profitability from our Engineering business. Full year 2022 EBITDA for the segment of $45 million was 15% higher than 2021. This was primarily due to the continued recovery in the aerospace sector in 2022.AMG Engineering signed $67 million in new orders during the fourth quarter of 2022  driven by strong orders of turbine blade and induction furnaces  representing a 1.28x book to bill ratio. In January 2023  the Company‚Äôs strong order intake continued with $44 million in new orders  mainly due to turbine blade coater sales. Order backlog was $220 million as of December 31  2022  the highest since March 31  2020.Financial ReviewTaxAMG recorded an income tax expense of $84 million in 2022  compared to $9 million in 2021. This variance was mainly driven by enhanced operating results in AMG Lithium at its Brazil operation coupled with movements in the Brazilian real. The effects of the Brazilian real caused a $7 million benefit in 2022  compared to a $4 million tax benefit in 2021. Fluctuations in the Brazilian real exchange rate impact the valuation of the Company‚Äôs net deferred tax positions related to our operations in Brazil.AMG paid taxes of $42 million in 2022  compared to tax payments of $10 million in 2021. The higher cash payments in 2022 were largely a result of improved operating results.Exceptional ItemsAMG‚Äôs fourth quarter and full year 2022 gross profit includes exceptional items  which are not included in the calculation of EBITDA.A summary of exceptional items included in gross profit in 2022 and 2021 are below:Exceptional items included in gross profitQ4 ‚Äò22 Q4 ‚Äò21 Change FY ‚Äò22 FY ‚Äò21 Change Gross profit $119 981 $61 797 94% $409 486 $208 243 97% Inventory cost adjustment 1 589 ‚Äî N/A 1 589 1 164 37% Restructuring expense (reversal) 389 (140) N/A 582 522 11% Asset impairment (reversal) expense (990) 153 N/A 10 597 (711) N/A Strategic project expense 1 201 1 501 (20%) 5 540 4 045 37% Others ‚Äî (506) N/A ‚Äî ‚Äî N/A Gross profit excluding exceptional items 122 170 62 805 95% 427 794 213 263 101%Energy CostsTotal energy costs were $16 million higher in 2022 versus 2021 due to the increases in gas and electricity costs during the year. The majority of this increase was at our silicon business in Germany  but that business benefited from fully hedged power costs. Other business units benefited from long-term electricity contracts that have no price escalation clauses  and the business units that did experience energy cost increases were able to pass through most of these increased costs to their customers.SG&AAMG‚Äôs fourth quarter 2022 SG&A expenses were $37 million compared to $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2021  with the decrease due to lower share-based compensation expense associated with a reversal in the prior year.Full year 2022 SG&A expenses were $148 million  6% higher than in 2021  with the variance due to increased professional fees associated with strategic projects during the current period  offset by lower share-based compensation expense.LiquidityDecember 31  2022 December 31  2021 Change Senior secured debt $348 622 $371 897 (6%) Cash & cash equivalents 346 043 337 877 2% Senior secured net debt 2 579 34 020 (92%) Other debt 14 959 24 398 (39%) Net debt excluding municipal bond 17 538 58 418 (70%) Municipal bond debt 319 244 319 476 ‚Äî% Restricted cash 6 920 93 434 (93%) Net debt 329 862 284 460 16%AMG ended the year in a $330 million net debt position. This increase was mainly due to the significant investment in growth initiatives during the year  particularly at our Zanesville facility  which utilized the restricted cash associated with the municipal bond. This use of restricted cash was offset by $34 million of debt repayment and higher unrestricted cash.AMG continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the fourth quarter. As of December 31  2022  the Company had $346 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $186 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $532 million of total liquidity as of December 31  2022.Net Finance CostsAMG‚Äôs fourth quarter 2022 net finance income was $4 million compared to a cost of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This variance was mainly driven by foreign exchange gains of $10 million during the quarter primarily due to non-cash intergroup balances.AMG capitalized $1 million of interest costs in the fourth quarter of 2022 versus $4 million in the same period in 2021  driven by interest associated with the Company‚Äôs tax-exempt municipal bond supporting the vanadium expansion in Ohio. This decrease is due to a portion of the municipal bond interest costs which are no longer being capitalized due to the ramp-up of production at our Zanesville facility.Final Dividend ProposalAMG intends to declare a dividend of ‚Ç¨0.70 per ordinary share over the financial year 2022. The interim dividend of ‚Ç¨0.30  paid on August 10  2022  will be deducted from the amount to be distributed to shareholders. The proposed final dividend per ordinary share therefore amounts to ‚Ç¨0.40.A proposal to resolve upon the final dividend distribution will be included on the agenda for the Annual General Meeting to be held on May 4  2023.Profit for the period to adjusted EBITDA reconciliationQ4 ‚Äò22 Q4 ‚Äò21 FY ‚Äò22 FY ‚Äò21 Profit for the period $62 669 $4 139 $190 771 $13 779 Income tax expense 23 827 5 293 84 097 8 707 Net finance (income) cost (4 177) 12 644 30 941 33 602 Equity-settled share-based payment transactions 1 414 6 883 5 552 10 206 Restructuring expense (reversal) 389 (140) 582 522 Net contract settlements (1) 971 ‚Äî (45 436) ‚Äî Inventory cost adjustment 1 589 ‚Äî 1 589 1 164 Asset impairment (reversal) expense (1) (990) 153 10 597 (711) Environmental provision 143 230 133 11 941 Strategic project expense (2) 5 885 3 769 17 070 12 157 Share of loss of associates ‚Äî 219 1 250 1 053 Others (1) (512) 105 571 EBIT 91 719 32 678 297 251 92 991 Depreciation and amortization 12 342 11 207 45 299 43 685 EBITDA 104 061 43 885 342 550 136 676Notes:(1) Associated with the silicon metal shutdown  AMG recorded income from the sale of an existing supply contract which positively impacted operating profit for the year. This income was offset by a settlement with a major customer and an impairment of existing assets.(2) The Company is in the initial development and ramp-up phases for several strategic expansion projects  including AMG Vanadium‚Äôs expansion project  the joint venture with Shell  Hybrid Lithium Vanadium Redox Flow Battery System  and the lithium expansion in Germany  which incurred project expenses during the quarter but are not yet operational. AMG is adjusting EBITDA for these exceptional charges.AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V.

The shares will be purchased over a period ending December 31  2023 on NYSE / Euronext Milan / Euronext Paris.The opportunity to initiate the buyback program stems from the company‚Äôs significant cash flow generation and strong balance sheet.These factors enable the company to ensure adequate liquidity to manage a wide variety of economic and market backdrops  while simultaneously facilitating attractive capital returns to shareholders.The share buyback program will be carried out under the authority granted by the general meeting of shareholders held on April 13  2022  which may be renewed or extended  up to a maximum of 10% of the Company‚Äôs capital. The purchase price per common share will be no higher than an amount equal to 110% of the market price of the shares on the NYSE  Euronext Milan or Euronext Paris. The market price will be calculated as the average of the highest price on each of the five days of trading prior to the date on which the acquisition is made  as shown in the official price list of the NYSE  Euronext Milan or Euronext Paris. Following the share buyback transaction for 69.1 million shares (2.2% of the Company‚Äôs capital) executed on September 15  2022  the remaining authorization stands at 244 million shares  more than adequate to cover this share buyback program and the potential repurchase of 99.42 million shares currently owned by Chinese JV partner Dongfeng Corporation under the terms announced on July 15  2022.Stellantis will provide updates on the start of buybacks and on the buyback program via a press release and on the Investors section of the corporate website. The buybacks will be carried out subject to market conditions and in compliance with applicable rules and regulations  including the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014 and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052.###About StellantisStellantis N.V.

Benchmark figures are performance measures used by management. See Note 3 for a reconciliation from IFRS to benchmark figures.Full-Year 2023 OutlookOur guidance for 2023 is provided below. We expect full-year organic growth to be in line with the prior year and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve. In the first and second quarters of 2023  organic growth is expected to be slower compared to the prior year period  most notably in Health and Governance  Risk & Compliance. The adjusted operating margin is expected to ease in the first half.Story continuesFull-Year 2023 Outlook Performance indicators 2023 Guidance 2022 Actual Adjusted operating profit margin* 26.1%-26.5% 26.1% Adjusted free cash flow** Around ‚Ç¨1 200 million ‚Ç¨1 220 million ROIC* 16.5%-17.0% 15.5% Diluted adjusted EPS growth** High-single-digit 8% *Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reporting currency and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2023 of ‚Ç¨/$1.07. **Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (‚Ç¨/$ 1.05). Guidance reflects share repurchases of ‚Ç¨1 billion in 2023.If the current U.S. dollar rate persists  currency will have a slightly negative effect on full-year 2023 results reported in euros. In 2022  Wolters Kluwer generated over 60% of revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2022 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average ‚Ç¨/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 3 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS1.We include restructuring costs in adjusted operating profit. We expect 2023 restructuring costs to be in the range of ‚Ç¨10-‚Ç¨15 million (FY 2022: ‚Ç¨6 million).We expect adjusted net financing costs2 in constant currencies to be approximately ‚Ç¨40 million. We expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to be in the range of 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2022: 22.6%).Capital expenditure is expected to increase but to remain within our normal range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2022: 5.4%). We expect full-year cash conversion ratio to be approximately 100% (FY 2022: 107%).Our guidance assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins  earnings  and ROIC in the near term.The impact of discontinuing activities in Russia and Belarus is expected to be immaterial to the consolidated financial results in 2023.2023 Outlook by DivisionHealth: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to be stable.Tax & Accounting: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to improve modestly.Governance  Risk & Compliance: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to improve modestly.Legal & Regulatory: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and full-year adjusted operating profit margin to be stable.Formation of a new division: Corporate Performance & ESGToday we are announcing that  in March  we intend to bring together four of our global enterprise software businesses to form a new division  Corporate Performance & ESG  to meet the growing demand from corporations and banks for integrated financial  operational  and ESG performance management and reporting solutions.This new division will be comprised of the following global software units:Corporate Performance (CCH Tagetik  including U.S. Corporate Tax)EHS/ORM Software (Enablon)Finance  Risk & ReportingInternal Audit Solutions (TeamMate).All four businesses serve global corporations and banks with cloud and on-premise solutions and have leading market positions in their specific areas of expertise. Combining these assets will allow us to accelerate synergies and leverage their combined global strengths to pursue a growing market opportunity.Corporate Performance & ESG will be led by Karen Abramson  who has been CEO of our Tax & Accounting division for the past 9 years. Jason Marx  currently leading North America Tax & Accounting  will be appointed CEO of the Tax & Accounting division. The Governance  Risk & Compliance (GRC) division will become Financial & Corporate Compliance and will comprise CT Corporation and Compliance Solutions  which provide legal services and banking compliance software  content  and lien solutions to mainly U.S. businesses. Steve Meirink will be appointed CEO of Financial & Corporate Compliance. Steve has been EVP and General Manager of Compliance Solutions for the past 7 years. Last year  Richard Flynn  currently CEO of GRC  informed us of his plans to pursue new experiences outside Wolters Kluwer. We thank him for his many contributions to the company.Our Enterprise Legal Management unit (ELM)  currently part of GRC Legal Services  will be transferred to the Legal & Regulatory division where we see opportunities for closer alignment with our Legal Software business.We will report our 2023 results under both the historic reporting segments and the new divisional structure. A pro forma 2022 revenue breakdown of the new divisional structure is provided in Appendix 4 of this release. More detailed pro forma financial information will be provided in the second quarter.Our Mission  Business Model and StrategyOur mission is to empower our professional customers with the information  software solutions  and services they need to make critical decisions  achieve successful outcomes  and save time. Every day  our customers face the challenge of increasing proliferation and complexity of information and the pressure to deliver better outcomes at a lower cost. Many of our customers are looking for mobility  flexibility  intuitive interfaces  and integrated open architecture technology to support their decision-making. We aim to solve their problems and add value to their workflow with our range of digital solutions and services  which we continuously evolve to meet their changing needs.Our expert solutions combine deep domain knowledge with technology to deliver both content and workflow automation to drive improved outcomes and productivity for our customers. Expert solutions  which include our software products and certain advanced information solutions  accounted for 56% of total revenues in 2022 (FY 2021: 55%) and grew 9% organically (FY 2021: 6%). Software revenues accounted for 44% of total revenues (FY 2021: 42%) and also grew 9% organically (FY 2021: 6%)  with cloud software revenues up 17% organically (FY 2021: 17%).Based on revenues  our largest expert solutions by division are:Health : global clinical decision support tool UpToDate; clinical drug databases Medi-Span and Lexicomp; and Lippincott nursing solutions for practice and learning.Tax & Accounting : global corporate performance solution CCH Tagetik; global corporate internal audit platform TeamMate; and professional tax and accounting software  including CCH Axcess and CCH ProSystem fx in North America and similar software for professionals across Europe.Governance  Risk & Compliance : finance  risk  and regulatory reporting suite OneSumX; banking compliance solutions ComplianceOne  Expere  eOriginal  and Gainskeeper; and enterprise legal management software Passport and TyMetrix.Legal & Regulatory: global EHS/ORM3 suite Enablon; legal workflow solutions Kleos and Legisway; and other software tools for European legal professionals.Our business model is primarily based on subscriptions  software maintenance  and other recurring revenues (80% of total revenues in FY 2022)  augmented by implementation services and license fees as well as volume-based transactional and other non-recurring revenues. Renewal rates for our recurring digital information  software  and service revenues are high and are one of the key indicators by which we measure our success. More than half of our operating costs relate to our employees  who create  develop  maintain  sell  implement  and support our solutions on behalf of our customers. Our technology architecture is increasingly based on globally scalable platforms that use standardized components. An increasing proportion of our solutions is built cloud-first. Many of our solutions incorporate advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence  natural language processing  robotic process automation  and predictive analytics. Our development teams follow a customer-centric  contextual design process and develop solutions based on the scaled agile framework. Our solutions are sold by our own sales teams or through selected distribution partners.Strategy 2022-2024: Elevate Our ValueOur strategy aims to deliver good organic growth and improved margins and returns over the three-year period (2022-2024). Our strategic priorities for 2022-2024 are:Accelerate Expert Solutions : we are focusing our investments on cloud-based expert solutions while continuing to transform selected digital information products into expert solutions. We are investing to enrich the customer experience of our products by leveraging advanced data analytics.Expand Our Reach : we are seeking to extend organically into high-growth adjacencies along our customer workflows and to adapt our existing products for new customer segments. We are developing partnerships and ecosystems for our key software platforms.Evolve Core Capabilities: we intend to enhance our central functions to drive excellence and scale economies  mainly in sales and marketing (go-to-market) and in technology. We plan to advance our environmental  social  and governance (ESG) performance and capabilities and to continue investing in diverse and engaged talent to support innovation and growth.Product innovation is a key driver of organic growth and customer satisfaction. In our current strategic plan  we expect that annual product development spend4 will average approximately 10% of total revenues over the three-year period. While our strategy remains centered on organic investment and growth  we may make selected acquisitions and non-core disposals to enhance our value and market positions. Acquisitions must fit our strategy  strengthen or extend our existing business  generally be accretive to diluted adjusted EPS in their first full year and  when integrated  deliver a return on invested capital above our weighted average cost of capital (8%) within three to five years. Key ESG goals in our current strategic plan are to drive an improvement in our belonging score5  to align with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)  and to obtain validated science-based targets.Financial Policy  Capital Allocation  Net Debt  and LiquidityWolters Kluwer uses its free cash flow to invest in the business organically and through acquisitions  to maintain optimal leverage  and to provide returns to shareholders. We regularly assess our financial position and evaluate the appropriate level of debt in view of our expectations for cash flow  investment plans  interest rates  and capital market conditions. While we may temporarily deviate from our leverage target  we continue to believe that  in the longer run  a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of around 2.5x remains appropriate for our business given the high proportion of recurring revenues and resilient cash flows.Dividend Policy and Proposed Final Dividend 2022Wolters Kluwer remains committed to a progressive dividend policy  under which we aim to increase the dividend per share in euros each year  independent of currency fluctuations. The payout ratio6 can vary from year to year. Proposed annual increases in the dividend per share take into account our Ô¨Ånancial performance  market conditions  and our need for Ô¨Ånancial Ô¨Çexibility. The policy takes into consideration the characteristics of our business  our expectations for future cash Ô¨Çows  and our plans for organic investment in innovation and productivity  or for acquisitions. We balance these factors with the objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet.At the 2023 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders  we will propose a final dividend of ‚Ç¨1.18  which would result in a total dividend over the 2022 financial year of ‚Ç¨1.81  an increase of 15%. Dividends are paid in cash. Shareholders can choose to reinvest both interim and Ô¨Ånal dividends by purchasing additional Wolters Kluwer shares through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) administered by ABN AMRO Bank N.V.Share Buybacks 2022 and 2023As a matter of policy since 2012  Wolters Kluwer will offset the dilution caused by our annual incentive share issuance with share repurchases (Anti-Dilution Policy). In addition  from time to time when appropriate  we return capital to shareholders through share buyback programs. Shares repurchased by the company are added to and held as treasury shares and are either cancelled or utilized to meet future obligations arising from share-based incentive plans.In 2022  we completed share repurchases of ‚Ç¨1 billion (10.1 million shares at an average price of ‚Ç¨98.75). See Note 8 for further information on issued share capital.Today  we are announcing our intention to repurchase shares for up to ‚Ç¨1 billion during 2023. In the year to date  up to and including February 20  2023  we have repurchased ‚Ç¨100 million in shares (1.0 million shares at an average price of ‚Ç¨100.18). Assuming global economic conditions do not deteriorate substantially  we believe this level of share buybacks leaves us with ample headroom to support our dividend plans  to sustain organic investment  and to make selective acquisitions. The share repurchase program may be suspended  discontinued  or modified at any time. For the period starting February 24  2023  up to and including April 28  2023  we have mandated a third party to execute ‚Ç¨160 million in share buybacks on our behalf  within the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and the company‚Äôs Articles of Association. The maximum number of shares which may be repurchased will not exceed the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.Net Debt  Leverage  Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility  and Liquidity PositionNet debt on December 31  2022  was ‚Ç¨2 253 million  compared to ‚Ç¨2 131 million on December 31  2021. The net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x (2021: 1.4x). Effective July 2022  we agreed to the final one-year extension of our ‚Ç¨600 million multi-currency credit facility  such that the facility will now mature in 2025. The facility is ESG-linked  with pricing tied to four key ESG performance indicators. The facility is currently fully undrawn. In September 2022  we issued a new ‚Ç¨500 million Eurobond with a four-year term and 3.0% annual coupon. Our liquidity position remains strong with  net cash available of ‚Ç¨1 330 million as of December 31  2022.7Full-Year 2022 ResultsBenchmark FiguresGroup revenues were ‚Ç¨5 453 million  up 14% overall  benefitting from a stronger U.S. dollar for most of the year. Excluding the effect of exchange rate movements  revenues increased 5% in constant currencies. The effect of divestments (almost entirely in Legal & Regulatory) outweighed the effect of acquisitions. Organic revenue growth was 6% (FY 2021: 6%).Revenues from North America  64% of total group revenues  grew 6% organically (FY 2021: 7%). Revenues from Europe  29% of total revenues  also grew 6% organically (FY 2021: 4%). Revenues from Asia Pacific and Rest of World  7% of total revenues  grew 10% organically (FY 2021: 3%).Adjusted operating profit was ‚Ç¨1 424 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨1 205 million)  up 7% in constant currencies. The related margin increased 80 basis points to 26.1% (FY 2021: 25.3%)  reflecting a favorable currency mix (40 basis points)  operational gearing  and the ongoing gradual shift in business mix. These factors more than offset an increase in operating costs  including higher product development expenses. Total product development spending  including capitalized expenditures  increased to 11% of total revenues (FY 2021: 10%). Restructuring expenses  which are included in adjusted operating profit  were in line with the prior year ‚Ç¨6 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨6 million).Adjusted net financing costs were ‚Ç¨56 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨78 million) due to higher interest rates on cash and cash equivalents. Included in adjusted net financing costs was a ‚Ç¨5 million net foreign exchange loss (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨15 million net foreign exchange loss) mainly related to the translation of intercompany balances. This non-cash loss was lower than we had guided in November 2022 due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar in the final weeks of 2022.Adjusted profit before tax was ‚Ç¨1 368 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨1 128 million)  up 21% overall and up 8% in constant currencies. The benchmark tax rate on adjusted profit before tax increased to 22.6% (FY 2021: 21.5%) due to newly introduced restrictions on tax deductibility of finance costs in the Netherlands  while 2021 included a one-time benefit following the closure of tax audits. Adjusted net profit was ‚Ç¨1 059 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨885 million)  an increase of 20% overall and 6% in constant currencies.Diluted adjusted EPS was ‚Ç¨4.14 (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨3.38)  up 8% in constant currencies  reflecting the increase in adjusted net profit and a 2% reduction in the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding to 255.8 million (FY 2021: 261.8 million).IFRS Reported FiguresReported operating profit increased 32% to ‚Ç¨1 333 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨1 012 million). The increase reflects the increase in adjusted operating profit and a ‚Ç¨75 million net disposal gain on the divestments during the year (most notably the sale of our Spanish and French publishing assets)  partly offset by a ‚Ç¨20 million impairment of certain Health assets.Reported financing results amounted to a net cost of ‚Ç¨57 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨84 million cost).The reported effective tax rate decreased to 19.5% (FY 2021: 21.6%). The 2022 gain on divestment was not taxable while the prior period included a taxable disposal gain and a disposal-related loss which was not tax-deductible.Net profit increased 41% overall to ‚Ç¨1 027 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨728 million) and diluted earnings per share increased 44% to ‚Ç¨4.01 (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨2.78).Cash FlowAdjusted operating cash flow was ‚Ç¨1 528 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨1 348 million)  up 2% in constant currencies. As anticipated  the cash conversion ratio decreased to 107% (FY 2021: 112%). Capital expenditures were ‚Ç¨295 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨239 million)  an increase of 16% in constant currencies. Capital expenditures remained within our guided range at 5.4% of group revenues (FY 2021: 5.0%). Cash payments related to leases  including lease interest paid  were ‚Ç¨81 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨77 million). Depreciation of physical assets and the amortization and impairment of internally developed software assets amounted to ‚Ç¨234 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨237 million)  a decrease of 8% in constant currencies. The depreciation and impairment of right-of-use assets  mainly leased offices  was ‚Ç¨71 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨72 million).Net interest paid  excluding lease interest paid  was ‚Ç¨45 million  lower than in the prior period (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨57 million). Corporate income tax paid increased to ‚Ç¨289 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨277 million)  reflecting higher income before tax and the newly introduced U.S. tax rules on the capitalization of research & development expenses. Net cash outflows related to restructuring were ‚Ç¨12 million  lower than in the prior year (FY 2021: outflow of ‚Ç¨33 million). Consequently  adjusted free cash flow was ‚Ç¨1 220 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨1 010 million)  up 7% in constant currencies.Total acquisition spending  net of cash acquired and including transaction costs  was ‚Ç¨95 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨113 million)  primarily relating to the acquisition of IDS on April 8  2022 by the Governance Risk & Compliance division. Total divestment proceeds amounted to ‚Ç¨103 million  net of cash divested and divestment-related costs  primarily relating to the divestment of our Spanish and French publishing assets.Dividends paid to shareholders amounted to ‚Ç¨424 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨373 million)  including the 2021 final dividend and the 2022 interim dividend. Cash spent on share buybacks was ‚Ç¨1 billion (FY 2021 ‚Ç¨410 million). As such  more than 100% of adjusted free cash flow was returned to shareholders.ESG Highlights 2022Advancing our performance against relevant and material ESG objectives is a core element of our strategy. We are focused on delivering high levels of customer satisfaction and innovative  impactful solutions and services; we are nurturing an engaged  talented  and diverse workforce; we are supporting strong ethics  compliance  and governance; and we are investing to maintain highly secure systems. We are committed to reducing our greenhouse gas footprint in line with the Paris Agreement.Investment in product development and innovation was 11% of revenues in 2022 (FY 2021: 10%).In 2022  our employee engagement and belonging scores  now measured by Glint  both increased by 1 point  to 77 and 73 respectively. We have plans and targets in place to drive further improvement. Employee turnover remained elevated amid a tight global market for talent  especially for technology and other skilled professionals. During the year  we expanded initiatives designed to attract  engage  and retain talent.A year ago  we committed to aligning our practices and reporting to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures (TCFD) and to setting science-based targets. During 2022  we made significant progress. We completed an assessment of our greenhouse gas footprint  including scope 1  2 and 3 emissions and improved existing processes for scope 1 and scope 2 data collection. We have committed to reduce our emissions in line with 1.5¬∞C global warming and reaching net-zero no later than by 2050. In early 2023  we submitted near-term targets to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for validation  to reduce absolute Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions by 50% and absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 30% by the year 2030 from a 2019 base year. We will submit a net-zero target to the SBTi within two years of our commitment.In the meantime  efforts to reduce our scope 1 and 2 emissions continued. Most notably in 2022  we achieved a 5% organic reduction in our global office footprint (m2) and decommissioned 1 032 on-premise servers by migrating applications to more energy-efficient cloud infrastructure.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services for the healthcare; tax and accounting; governance  risk and compliance; and legal and regulatory sectors.

Its main objective is to validate the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation treatments  in particular nicotine substitutes (transdermal patches  tablets  gum  inhalers and nicotine sprays)  with a view to developing an innovative treatment method combining NFL-101 with other smoking cessation methods. PRECESTO is being implemented at Eurofins Optimed's clinical research center in Gi√®res  in the Grenoble area.In this new treatment method  for which a patent was filed in October 2022  the administration of NFL-101 prior to the quit attempt aims to break the link between cigarettes and the satisfaction they provide  and to reduce the desire to smoke. Smokers can then focus on their quit attempt and manage their nicotine withdrawal symptoms (irritability  nervousness  anxiety  etc.) with the help of other smoking cessation treatments  including nicotine replacement therapies.The PRECESTO study compares the ability of NFL-101 to reduce cigarette satisfaction and craving with placebo. It is a randomized  double-blind study that will include a total of 34 smokers who do not wish to quit and have high smoking satisfaction in a cross-over design. Each subject is his or her own control and receives either NFL-101 or placebo randomly and alternately at the beginning of each of two periods during which he or she assesses satisfaction with cigarettes and craving for cigarettes using international questionnaires. The periods are each one month long. The Modified Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire (mCEQ) is used as the main instrument. It measures satisfaction with smoking  psychological reward  aversion  pleasant sensations in the airways  and reduction in craving. Results of the PRECESTO study are expected in the third quarter of 2023. This study is expected to increase the attractiveness of NFL-101 to pharmaceutical companies marketing smoking cessation drugs and who may be interested in licensing it.Bruno Lafont  Chief Operating Officer and co-founder of NFL Biosciences  said: ""PRECESTO complements the ongoing CESTO II study (318 smokers  9 clinical investigation centers in France) designed to validate the efficacy of NFL-101 as a smoking cessation therapy. PRECESTO is a proof-of-concept study that aims to increase the addressable market for NFL-101 by expanding it  by administering it in combination with other smoking cessation treatments  in particular nicotine substitutes. The global market for smoking cessation drugs is estimated to be close to USD 6 billion  with a growth rate of around 6% in the years to come.‚ÄùAbout NFL BiosciencesNFL Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company based in the Montpellier area which develops botanical drug candidates for the treatment of addictions.

Its main objective is to validate the complementarity of NFL-101 with other smoking cessation treatments  in particular nicotine substitutes (transdermal patches  tablets  gum  inhalers and nicotine sprays)  with a view to developing an innovative treatment method combining NFL-101 with other smoking cessation methods. PRECESTO is being implemented at Eurofins Optimed's clinical research center in Gi√®res  in the Grenoble area.In this new treatment method  for which a patent was filed in October 2022  the administration of NFL-101 prior to the quit attempt aims to break the link between cigarettes and the satisfaction they provide  and to reduce the desire to smoke. Smokers can then focus on their quit attempt and manage their nicotine withdrawal symptoms (irritability  nervousness  anxiety  etc.) with the help of other smoking cessation treatments  including nicotine replacement therapies.The PRECESTO study compares the ability of NFL-101 to reduce cigarette satisfaction and craving with placebo. It is a randomized  double-blind study that will include a total of 34 smokers who do not wish to quit and have high smoking satisfaction in a cross-over design. Each subject is his or her own control and receives either NFL-101 or placebo randomly and alternately at the beginning of each of two periods during which he or she assesses satisfaction with cigarettes and craving for cigarettes using international questionnaires. The periods are each one month long. The Modified Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire (mCEQ) is used as the main instrument. It measures satisfaction with smoking  psychological reward  aversion  pleasant sensations in the airways  and reduction in craving. Results of the PRECESTO study are expected in the third quarter of 2023. This study is expected to increase the attractiveness of NFL-101 to pharmaceutical companies marketing smoking cessation drugs and who may be interested in licensing it.Bruno Lafont  Chief Operating Officer and co-founder of NFL Biosciences  said: ""PRECESTO complements the ongoing CESTO II study (318 smokers  9 clinical investigation centers in France) designed to validate the efficacy of NFL-101 as a smoking cessation therapy. PRECESTO is a proof-of-concept study that aims to increase the addressable market for NFL-101 by expanding it  by administering it in combination with other smoking cessation treatments  in particular nicotine substitutes. The global market for smoking cessation drugs is estimated to be close to USD 6 billion  with a growth rate of around 6% in the years to come.‚ÄùAbout NFL BiosciencesNFL Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company based in the Montpellier area which develops botanical drug candidates for the treatment of addictions.

Adjusted for changes in the consolidation scope and at constant currency exchange rates  turnover for the half-year ended 31 December 2022 was up with a solid 4.8% organic sales growth. Sales growth in France of 4.2% is mainly supported by volume growth and medical purchases rechargeable revenue  despite the ongoing shift towards ambulatory care. In the Nordics countries  organics sales grew at 6.4% for the semester on a constant exchange rate basis. The impact of past acquisitions  including GHP  amounts to ‚Ç¨117.6m of additional revenues  or 19% of extra growth for the Nordics countries.Decrease in the reported EBITDA under IFRS16 of 6.8%  to ‚Ç¨312.7m (last year ‚Ç¨335.4m) with a margin of 14.2% (last year 16.5%). EBITDA and margin were mainly driven by the negative trend on inflation and the resources invested to support our medical staff. Recent acquisitions have contributed ‚Ç¨12.4m to the overall half-year EBITDA  in line with our acquisition business plan. The revenue guarantee scheme put in place by the French government resulted in additional revenue of ‚Ç¨62 million (same as last half-year) in the half-year ended 31 December 2022. Ramsay Sant√© was eligible to receive support from the French government regarding inflation of procurement and salary for a total consideration of ‚Ç¨45.6m  which did not fully cover it  however.Net profit for the Group share was ‚Ç¨43.9m  2.0% of turnover (last year ‚Ç¨59.6m and 2.9% of turnover)  impacted by lower operational margins and reflecting increased funding costs.Total capital expenditure for the last 6 months was ‚Ç¨110m  slightly below last year  including maintenance and optimisation  as well as improvement on our portfolio of clinics. This covers the ongoing maternity expansion of St G√∂ran as well as significant effort to roll out our strategy to increase Ramsay Sant√©‚Äôs imaging assets portfolio  to invest on digital tools  amongst which the new version of the Ramsay Services portal  and on new equipment such as surgical robots for our French clinics.Net financial debt at the end of 31 December 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨3 820m  including ‚Ç¨2 143m of IFRS16 lease liabilities. During the first semester of this fiscal year  Ramsay Sant√© successfully completed the issuance of a new Fiducie tranche for ‚Ç¨150m. The group has as well participated in a real estate project involving one of our clinics in Olso  Norway.Net cash increased by ‚Ç¨97.5m over the period with a ‚Ç¨194.5m contribution from increased borrowings. The cash flow from operating activities was unfavourably impacted by the phasing of the payment related to the various subsidies.Ramsay Sant√© has continued to invest in initiatives in line with its Yes We Care 2025 strategy  and expect that this strategy will lead to a capex consumption trend in H2 FY23 similar to H1 FY23Finally  discussions are ongoing regarding the potential extension of a modified French revenue guarantee scheme under which the government may prolong its support to the industry  although with a mechanism reducing over time.Pascal Roch√©  Chief Executive Officer of Ramsay Sant√©  says:‚ÄúRamsay Sant√© has continued to play a major role in complementing public hospitals in Europe over the past six months. With the management of 5.8 million patient visits  up 18%  the ‚ÄúYes We Care 2025‚Äù strategy of providing patients with physical and digital health solutions to coordinate pathways  is more relevant than ever  and implementation is on plan. Revenue grew by 8.4% over the period and operating margin fell by 6.8% due to inflation  which affects all costs. Finally  the integration of acquisitions  notably GHP  made last year  is in line with expectations.‚ÄùThe Board of Directors that met on 22 February 2023 approved the consolidated financial statements for the six-month period ended 31 December 2022. The consolidated financial statements have been subject to a limited review by the statutory auditors.Synthetic resultsP&L ‚Äì in ‚Ç¨ millions From 1 July 2022 to 31 December 2022 from 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2021 Variation Turnover 2 209.5 2 037.7 +8.4% EBITDA 312.7 335.4 (6.8)% As a % of Turnover 14.2% 16.5% (2.3) point Current Operating Result 113.1 149.1 (24.1)% As a % of Turnover 5.1% 7.3% (2.2) point Operating Result 134.7 151.4 (11.0)% As a % of Turnover 6.1% 7.4% (1.3) point Net income  Group share 43.9 59.6 (26.3)% Earnings per share (in ‚Ç¨) 0.40 0.54 (26.4)%Net Financial Debt ‚Äì in ‚Ç¨ millions 31 December 2022 30 June 2022 Non-current financial liabilities 1 916.4 1 763.6 Non-current lease liability 1 935.3 1 922.3 Current lease liability 207.5 196.0 Current financial liabilities 52.1 35.4 (Cash and cash equivalents) (220.9) (132.5) Other financial assets & liabilities (70.0) (74.9) Net financial debt 3 820.4 3 709.9Cash Flow Statement ‚Äì in ‚Ç¨ millions From 1 July 2022 to 31 December 2022 from 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2021 EBITDA 312.7 335.4 Change in Working Capital requirements (83.5) (291.4) Net cash flow from operating activities 183.6 23.8 Net cash flow used in investing activities (96.9) (131.4) Net cash flow from/(used in) financing activities 10.8 (92.3) Change in net cash position 97.5 (199.9) Closing cash and cash equivalents 220.9 408.1Breakdown of revenue by operating segmentEn M‚Ç¨ From 1 July 2022 to 31 December 2022 from 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2021 Variation √éle-de-France 517.9 497.3 4.1% Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes 295.2 275.2 7.3% Hauts de France 190.9 190.0 0.5% Occitanie 134.8 131.0 2.9% Other regions 349.1 335.4 4.1% Nordics countries 721.6 608.8 18.5% Published Turnover 2 209.5 2 037.7 8.4%Note: the table above details the contributions of the main operating segments to the Group's consolidated revenue.Changes in reported turnover from the half- year ended 3 1 December 202 1 to the half-year ended31 December 2022.Reported Turnover31 December 2021 Changes in foreign exchange rates Acquisitions and disposals Organic growth Reported turnover31 December 2022 Variation In ‚Ç¨ millions 2 037.7 (44.0) 117.6 98.1 2 209.5 171.7 (2.2%) 5.8% 4.8% 8.4%Significant events of the financial year:Healthcare market evolution includ ing COVID-19 health crisisThe six-month period ending 31 December 2022 continued to be impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic in all countries in which the Group operates  albeit at a markedly lower intensity level compared to crisis peaks experienced in prior periods.FranceIn France  private hospitals have continued to actively participate in the national plan to combat theCOVID-19 epidemic in conjunction with and in support of public hospitals. Depending on the evolution of the health situation during surges of COVID-19 as well as other seasonal viruses prevalent in autumn and winter  the activity of private hospitals was carried out under more or less normal conditions.Ramsay Sant√© has continued to participate in the effort of caring for COVID-19 patients with more than 4 000 patients treated in France  including 1 600 in critical care.As other public and private hospital providers  Ramsay Sant√© has continued to operate for the full six-month period under the French Government‚Äôs revenue guarantee which was extended to 31 December 2022. The provisions of the revenue guarantee are similar to that in place in the prior corresponding period except for the mental health activities which are now out of its scope due to their new bundled payment funding structure. In addition to the revenue guarantee scheme  the government has throughout the pandemic also prolonged the funding of healthcare facilities to compensate the additional costs related to the COVID-19 epidemic that would not otherwise be covered.Nordic s :The group‚Äôs facilities in Scandinavia have actively participated in the care of COVID-19 patients as well as in the screening and vaccination of the population  in support of public institutions and in close collaboration with the supervisory authorities.The positive development in adding listed patients into our Proximity care business has continued in both Sweden and Denmark through a dedicated work to improve both availably and attractivity in our facilities. Patient demand in our Specialist and Orthopedic businesses in all countries has been increasing. The integration of the newly acquired GHP business is progressing according to plan and synergies have been realised as expected to date. Finally  during the period two new geriatric contracts were awarded in Sweden for a period of 4+4 years representing an annual turnover of approximately ‚Ç¨50m (SEK500m)  starting in May 2023.Scope of consolidationDuring the first six months of the current financial year Ramsay Sant√© has completed one small bolt-on acquisition in the Nordics. Compared to the prior corresponding period  this half-year included the full contribution of the 8 acquisitions completed throughout FY22.Comments on the half-year accountsActivity and turnover:In the six-month period 1st July 2022 to 31st December 2022  Ramsay Sant√© Group reported a consolidated turnover of ‚Ç¨2 209.5m  compared with ‚Ç¨2 037.7m for the prior corresponding period  up 8.4%. On a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates  the Group's sales increased by 4.8 % despite 2 less working days than the same period last year in France.FranceFor the six-month period ending 31 December 2022  Ramsay Sant√©'s French total the number of patient admissions increased on last year by 2.2%. The breakdown by business line is as follows:+1.2% in Medicine  Surgery and Obstetrics+11.6% in Follow-up Care and Rehabilitation-0.6% in Mental HealthRevenue growth in France of 4.2% is mainly supported by this activity growth but also by an increase in revenue from rechargeable medical purchases  and despite the ongoing shift towards ambulatory care.In March 2022  average tariff increase was set for the year at 0.7% for the French market. For Ramsay Sant√© and given its care mix  the average increase was at 0.1%  including the ability for the French government to adjust this evolution by up to 0.7pt downwards under certain conditions (‚Äúthe prudential coefficient‚Äù). Only half of the prudential coefficient on the 2022 tariffed revenue was released in December 2022 versus a full release in 2021. This decision means that the 2022 prices were in fact a ‚Äì 0.2% reduction from the prior year  applied to our mix of activities.The 3 Nordics countriesRevenue growth in the Nordics of 18.5% was mainly from the impact of the latest acquisitions that have represented ‚Ç¨117m of additional revenue during the last 6-month period. A ‚Ç¨(44)m negative foreign exchange impact on Nordics revenue partially offsets this growth. Organic sales growth in the Group's Nordic activities for the first six-month of the financial year was +6.4% compared to last year  arising mainly from our primary care and specialist clinics in Sweden and Denmark.EBITDAGroup EBITDA reached ‚Ç¨312.7m (last year ‚Ç¨335.4m) for the six-month period ended 31 December 2022  down ‚Äì 6.8% on a reported basis. It includes a ‚Ç¨8.3m EBITDA contribution from Nordics acquisitions and a ‚Ç¨(4.3)m unfavourable FX variance impact. On a like-for-like basis  at constant consolidation scope and exchange rates  EBITDA for the group therefore reduces by ‚Äì 8.0% compared to December 2021.The EBITDA margin as a percentage of sales was 14.2%  down from 16.5% for the same period last year on a reported basis  or 14.5% this half-year versus 16.5% on a constant scope and foreign exchange rate basis. This decrease reflects the impact of the effort made on the compensations and benefits made to our medical staff and the impact of the inflation on our medical purchases and indirect costs. Such impacts have not been fully mitigated by the level of subsidies received or the upsides of our productivity measures.GrantsGroup EBITDA for the six-month period that ended 31 December 2022 includes ‚Ç¨62m (last year ‚Ç¨62m as well) related to the French revenue guarantee scheme  which has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements of the group as ‚ÄúOther operating income‚Äù. This line also includes Covid costs compensation and support grants from the French government for ‚Ç¨20m (last year ‚Ç¨32m).As there is a timing delay between when the costs are incurred in the business and when the regional health agencies notify our facilities  a large part of the subsidies accounted for in the six-month period relates to the period prior to the current financial year  a similar situation to the comparable six-month period last year. The whole amount recognized in the current six-month period of ‚Ç¨20m (last year ‚Ç¨27.5m) relate to the preceding financial year.In addition to those Covid-related subsidies  specific grants totalling of ‚Ç¨46m were extended to the French facilities to fund inflation that had not been sized in the applicable tariffs  as well as national healthcare staff salary increases applicable from 1st July 2022.Conversely in the Nordics countries  Covid-related compensation grants and additional revenues have been significantly lower than in the previous period negatively impacting results and margins compared to the previous period. In total  the amount of aid received by our facilities in Sweden was ‚Ç¨8.7m in the period  compared to ‚Ç¨15.5m in the previous period.Personnel costsPersonnel costs increase due to inflationary pressures that have to date only been partially compensated by government funding. French minimum wage has been lifted by 8.0% from successive increases effective from October 2021 to August 2022. Concomitantly  the French national private healthcare employee award lifted the minimum award wages by 3%  for which we have received subsidies from the government  and raised the penalty rates for night  weekend and public holiday time by 50%  effective 1st July 2022. In addition  specific salary revalorisation for midwifes and critical care nurses also took effect with the corresponding funding.Attractivity and retention measures in favour of hospital personnel and shortage of certain staff categories resulting in a higher use of agency staff also added to the inflationary burden across our different geographies. For these areas targeted actions have been initiated to improve the situation over time.Current Operating ResultCurrent operating result amounted to ‚Ç¨113.1m (last year ‚Ç¨149.1m) for the first six-month period representing a current operating margin of 5.1% (last year 7.3%)  down 24.1% over the previous period primarily from inflation pressure.Non-recurring itemsOther non-current income and expenses net to a profit of ‚Ç¨21.6m (last year ‚Ç¨2.3m) for the six-month period ended 31 December 2022  including a ‚Ç¨29.2m profit on the sale of the land and car parks adjacent to one of our hospital in Oslo.Financial resultThe cost of net financial debt amounted to ‚Ç¨68.7m (last year 59.9m) for the six-month period ended 31 December 2022. The increase in the cost of funding results from new borrowings bearing interest over this period compared to the half-year closed December 2021  namely the Euro PP ‚Ç¨100m bond issued in December 2021 and the new Fiducie Suret√© ‚Ç¨150m tranche drawn in July 2022  as well as an uptick in margins and floating rates.Other financial expenses and income include a positive mark-to market valuation of our interest rate derivatives offset by the interest expense recognised upon the sale of long-term receivables.Group‚Äôs share of net profit reached ‚Ç¨43.9 million (last year ‚Ç¨59.6 million) for the six-month period that ended 31 December 2022.Financing:Net financial debt as of 31 December 2022 increased to ‚Ç¨3 820m compared with ‚Ç¨3 710m as of 30 June 2022  and has been negatively impacted by the timing of payments of various grants accrued over the period.Net debt includes ‚Ç¨1 916 million in non-current borrowings and ‚Ç¨52 million in current borrowings  offset by ‚Ç¨221 million in cash and cash equivalents. IFRS 16 leases debt amounts to ‚Ç¨2 143 million including ‚Ç¨1 935 million in non-current lease debt and ‚Ç¨208 million in current lease debt.During this half-year period  Ramsay Sant√© has strengthened its financing structure thanks to an additional ‚Ç¨150m tranche of its Fiducie Suret√©.The Group complies with all commitments relating to the financial documentation in place. The application of IFRS 16 has no effect on the methods used to calculate the financial aggregates referred to in these debt agreements.About Ramsay Sant√©Ramsay Sant√© is the leader in private hospitalisation and primary care in Europe.

(the ‚ÄúCompany"" or ""Besi"") (Euronext Amsterdam: BESI; OTC markets: BESIY)  a leading manufacturer of assembly equipment for the semiconductor industry  today announced its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31  2022.Key Highlights Q4-22Revenue of ‚Ç¨ 137.7 million down 18.4% vs. Q3-22 and 19.8% vs. Q4-21 due primarily to lower shipments for high performance computing  mainstream electronics applications from Asian subcontractors and ongoing weakness in mobile end-user marketsOrders of ‚Ç¨ 180.5 million up 44.1% vs. Q3-22 due primarily to increased bookings for high-end smartphone applications and hybrid bonding systems. Down 10.9% vs. Q4-21 principally from lower bookings for mainstream computing and automotive end-user marketsGross margin of 62.3% was equal to Q3-22 and above prior guidance. Up 5.6 points vs. Q4-21Net income of ‚Ç¨ 40.2 million declined 29.8% vs. Q3-22 primarily due to lower revenue and increased R&D spending for wafer level assembly activities. Similarly  down 40.1% vs. Q4-21 which included ‚Ç¨ 8.9 million deferred tax benefitsQ4-22 net margin of 29.2% realized despite industry downturn vs. 34.0% in Q3-22 and 39.1% in Q4-21Net cash increased 1.2% vs. Q3-22 to reach ‚Ç¨ 346.5 million. Declined 6.5% vs. year-end 2021 due primarily to ‚Ç¨ 416.3 million capital allocation to shareholdersKey Highlights FY 2022Revenue of ‚Ç¨ 722.9 million decreased 3.5% primarily due to lower shipments for smartphone and Chinese end-user markets after two years of strong capacity growth. Partially offset by continued strength in automotive end-user markets and initial sales of hybrid bonding systemsOrders of ‚Ç¨ 663.7 million declined 29.3% principally due to decreased demand for high-end smartphone applications post new product cycle in 2021 and reduced bookings from Chinese subcontractors for mobile and mainstream computing applicationsGross margin rose to 61.3% vs. 59.6% in 2021 primarily as a result of lower temporary headcount levels  favorable forex influences and absence of inventory impairment charge recorded in 2021Net income of ‚Ç¨ 240.6 million decreased 14.8% primarily due to lower revenue  increased R&D spending and absence of ‚Ç¨ 15.0 million deferred tax benefits vs. 2021Net margin 33.3% vs. 37.7% in 2021.Proposed dividend of ‚Ç¨ 2.85 per share.

Blickman  President and Chief Executive Officer of Besi  commented:""This year marked an important inflection point in our strategic development as we position Besi for sustainable growth over the next decade. Our business model generated revenue and profitability levels substantially higher than our peers as we effectively responded to an assembly equipment downturn which began in the spring following large capacity additions over the past two years.""We also made a number of important R&D and business investments in 2022 to better position ourselves for anticipated growth over the next industry cycle. Development spending was increased by 48% to ramp hybrid bonding for commercial production  to introduce two new wafer level assembly systems and to upgrade our existing product portfolio. Operational resources were utilized to increase cleanroom production and service/support capacity in Malaysia and Singapore as we prepare for anticipated hybrid bonding growth over the next five years. Strong cash flow from operations was used to increase our capital allocation by 132% versus 2021 including the initiation of a new ‚Ç¨ 300 million share repurchase program. Progress also continued on Besi‚Äôs ESG agenda where approximately 80% of our 2022 targets were met or significantly exceeded in key carbon emissions categories as well as in the areas of waste  hazardous materials and renewable energy.""For the year  revenue and net income of ‚Ç¨ 722.9 million and ‚Ç¨ 240.6 million declined by 3.5% and 14.8%  respectively  versus 2021. Orders of ‚Ç¨ 663.7 million declined by 29.3% principally due to decreased demand for high-end smartphone applications post new product introductions in 2021. The decrease also reflected reduced bookings from Chinese subcontractors for mobile and mainstream computing applications linked to softening economic conditions in China. Of note  revenue from Chinese customers declined by 33.5% and represented 25.9% of revenue in 2022 versus 37.6% in 2021. Revenue and order weakness in smartphone applications was partially offset by continued strength in Besi‚Äôs computing/hybrid bonding and automotive end-user markets as well as increased revenue from spares/service activities which grew by 25.7% year over year.""We achieved peer leading operating and net margins of 40.7% and 33.3% in a difficult environment as we successfully aligned production to changing market conditions. In fact  gross margins increased to 61.3% this year due primarily to a 77% reduction of temporary headcount from peak first quarter levels  effective management of our supply chain and price increases implemented to help offset inflationary cost pressures.""Besi ended the year with a solid liquidity base consisting of cash  cash equivalents and deposits aggregating ‚Ç¨ 671.7 million  or ‚Ç¨ 8.56 per basic share and net cash of ‚Ç¨ 346.5 million. Our net cash position reflected strong cash flow from operations of ‚Ç¨ 271.9 million equal to 37.6% of revenue  the conversion into equity of ‚Ç¨ 139.9 million of Convertible Notes due 2027 and the capital allocation of ‚Ç¨ 416.3 million to shareholders. Given Besi‚Äôs earnings  cash flow and solid financial position  we propose to pay a cash dividend of ‚Ç¨ 2.85 per share for approval at our 2023 AGM. The proposed distribution is the thirteenth consecutive annual dividend paid and reflects a pay-out ratio of 93%. Including such dividend  Besi will have returned approximately ‚Ç¨ 1.6 billion to shareholders over the past 13 years  or approximately 25% of cumulative revenue during this period.""In addition  substantial progress was achieved to help hybrid bonding become a market reality. Significant improvements in placement accuracy  throughput  yield and lead times for delivery all contributed to its commercial viability. Full scale production by a customer began in the second half of 2022. In total  Besi has shipped 35 hybrid bonding systems since the fourth quarter of 2021 of which 10 were demonstration units. In addition  we received orders for an incremental 14 units from multiple customers subsequent to Q3-22 of which 3 were received to date in Q1-23. Orders received in Q4-22 are not anticipated to be shipped until Q2-23 of which several are to be incorporated into integrated hybrid bonding production lines. Of note  the first hybrid bonding integrated production line was shipped in the fourth quarter.""Besi‚Äôs fourth quarter operating results were better than expected in an ongoing industry downturn. Revenue of ‚Ç¨ 137.7 million decreased by 18.4% versus Q3-22 reflecting a number of headwinds including weakness in high performance computing and mainstream electronics applications and ongoing weakness in mobile end-user markets. However  our backlog rose by 12.2% to reach ‚Ç¨ 270 million at year-end due to a ‚Ç¨ 55.2 million  or 44.1% sequential order increase versus Q3-22. Such increase resulted primarily from higher bookings for high-end smartphones and hybrid bonding systems. Current order trends reflect customers‚Äô continued investment in high-end versus mainstream assembly applications as well as ongoing weakness in demand by Chinese customers. Besi‚Äôs profitability and efficiency remained at attractive levels in Q4-22 despite the downturn with gross margins reaching 62.3%  net income of ‚Ç¨ 40.2 million and a net margin realized of 29.2%.""There is a high degree of uncertainty as to the outlook for 2023. The assembly equipment market is in a classic downturn after two strong years of growth. However  we believe there are a variety of potential outcomes for Besi‚Äôs business prospects this year in the context of the current downcycle including the outlook for smartphone and hybrid bonding demand as well as the impact of the re-opening of the Chinese economy. The headwinds we face are many including higher inflation and interest rates  decelerating economic growth  geo-political tensions and ongoing weakness in mainstream electronics  computing and mobile handset end-user markets.""For Q1-23  we forecast that revenue will decrease by 0-10% versus Q4-22 as many orders received in Q4-22 are scheduled for delivery in Q2-23 and Q3-23. In addition  we estimate that Besi‚Äôs gross margin will range between 61%-63% and for baseline operating expenses to decrease by 0-5% versus Q4-22. Total operating expenses are expected to increase by 15%-20% due to an incremental ‚Ç¨ 7 million of non-cash  share based compensation expense.‚ÄùFourth Quarter Results of Operations‚Ç¨ millions Q4-2022 Q3-2022 Œî Q4-2021 Œî Revenue 137.7 168.8 -18.4 % 171.7 -19.8 % Orders 180.5 125.3 +44.1 % 202.6 -10.9 % Book to Bill Ratio 1.3x 0.7x +0.6 1.2x +0.1Q4-22 revenue of ‚Ç¨ 137.7 million decreased by 18.4% versus Q3-22 and 19.8% versus Q4-21 due primarily to lower shipments for high performance computing  reduced revenue from Asian subcontractors for mainstream electronics applications and ongoing weakness in mobile end-user markets. The Q4-22 revenue decrease versus each of such periods also reflected general market softness and was partially offset by continued strength in shipments for automotive applications.Orders of ‚Ç¨ 180.5 million increased by 44.1% versus Q3-22 due to increased orders for high-end smartphone applications from Asian subcontractors and new orders for hybrid bonding systems from multiple IDM customers. Versus Q4-21  orders decreased by 10.9% primarily due to lower bookings for mainstream computing and automotive applications. Per customer type  IDM orders increased ‚Ç¨ 17.5 million  or 21.7%  versus Q3-22 and represented 54% of total orders for the period. Subcontractor orders increased by ‚Ç¨ 37.7 million  or 84.5%  versus Q3-22 and represented 46% of total orders.‚Ç¨ millions Q4-2022 Q3-2022 Œî Q4-2021 Œî Gross Margin 62.3 % 62.3 % - 56.7%* +5.6 Operating Expenses 37.1 34.0 +9.1 % 30.3 +22.4 % Financial Expense  net 3.6 5.5 -34.5 % 3.0 +20.0 % EBITDA 54.8 77.1 -28.9 % 72.0 -23.9 %* Gross margin in Q4-21 included a one-time  ‚Ç¨ 7.4 million inventory impairment charge. Ex such charges  gross margin would have been 61.0%Besi‚Äôs gross margin of 62.3% in Q4-22 was equal to Q3-22 and above guidance primarily due to favorable forex influences. Versus Q4-21  gross margin increased by 5.6 points primarily due to the absence of a one-time  ‚Ç¨ 7.4 million inventory impairment charge recorded in Q4-21. Excluding such charge  Besi‚Äôs gross margin rose by 1.3% versus Q4-21.Q4-22 operating expenses increased by ‚Ç¨ 3.1 million  or 9.1%  versus Q3-22 due primarily to a ‚Ç¨ 1.0 million increase in R&D spending and higher share-based compensation expense. Versus Q4-21  operating expenses increased by ‚Ç¨ 6.8 million  or 22.4%  due primarily to ‚Ç¨ 4.6 million of higher R&D spending for next generation wafer level assembly systems as well as higher marketing and technical support costs related thereto and increased travel expenses post the pandemic. As a percentage of revenue  operating expenses increased to 26.9% in Q4-22 versus 20.2% in Q3-22.Financial expense  net  decreased by ‚Ç¨ 1.9 million versus Q3-22 primarily as a result of increased interest income earned on cash balances outstanding.‚Ç¨ millions Q4-2022 Q3-2022 Œî Q4-2021 Œî Net Income 40.2 57.3 -29.8 % 67.1 -40.1 % Net Margin 29.2 % 34.0 % -4.8 39.1 % -9.9 Tax Rate 10.9 % 12.8 % -1.9 -4.6 % +15.5 %Besi‚Äôs Q4-22 net income of ‚Ç¨ 40.2 million decreased ‚Ç¨ 17.1 million  or 29.8%  versus Q3-22. The profit reduction was primarily due to an 18.4% sequential revenue decrease and a 9.1% increase in operating expenses associated primarily with higher R&D spending levels partially offset by higher interest income earned and a lower effective tax rate. Versus Q4-21  net income decreased by ‚Ç¨ 26.9 million  or 40.1%  principally as a result of (i) a 19.8% revenue decrease  (ii) increased R&D spending and (iii) a higher effective tax due to the absence of ‚Ç¨ 8.9 million in tax benefits recognized in the prior year period partially offset by a 5.6 point gross margin increase. As a result  Besi‚Äôs net margin decreased to 29.2% in Q4-22 versus 34.0% in Q3-22 and 39.1% in Q4-21.Full Year Results of Operations‚Ç¨ millions FY 2022 FY 2021* Œî Revenue 722.9 749.3 -3.5 % Orders 663.7 939.1 -29.3 % Gross Margin 61.3 % 59.6 % +1.7 Operating Income 294.1 317.6 -7.4 % Net Income* 240.6 282.4 -14.8 % Net Margin* 33.3 % 37.7 % -4.4 Tax Rate * 12.6 7.1 % +5.5* Excluding inventory impairment charge in Q4-21 and tax benefits recorded during the year  Besi‚Äôs net income  net margin and effective tax rate in 2021 would have been ‚Ç¨ 273.9 million  36.6% and 12.0%  respectively.Besi‚Äôs revenue in 2022 declined by ‚Ç¨ 26.4 million  or 3.5%  versus 2021 primarily due to a variety of trends affecting its end-user markets. Significant revenue decreases were reported for smartphone and Chinese end-user markets. Such adverse headwinds were partially offset by continued strength in (i) automotive end-user markets as supply chain issues began to recede and (ii) computing applications as hybrid bonding shipments increased for commercial production in the second half of the year.Orders of ‚Ç¨ 663.7 million declined by 29.3% in comparison to 2021 principally due to significantly decreased demand for high-end smartphone applications post new product introductions in 2021 and reduced bookings from Chinese subcontractors for mobile and computing applications linked to softening economic conditions. In both 2022 and 2021  bookings by IDMs and subcontractors represented approximately 55% and 45% of total orders. Revenue and orders in 2022 were not adversely affected by trade restrictions and regulations resulting from geo-political tensions between the US and China.Besi maintained its financial efficiency at elevated levels this year despite the adverse impact of weakening market conditions. Our gross margin increased from 59.6% in 2021 to 61.3% and operating margins remained above 40%. Operating income of ‚Ç¨ 294.1 million declined by 7.4% versus 2021 primarily due to a 48% increase in R&D spending for next generation wafer level assembly systems.Besi‚Äôs net income of ‚Ç¨ 240.6 million decreased by ‚Ç¨ 41.8 million  or 14.8%  versus 2021 and resulted in a net margin of 33.3%. Decreased profitability was primarily due to lower spending for smartphones and in Chinese end-user markets  increased R&D spending and the absence of ‚Ç¨ 15.0 million deferred tax benefits recognized in 2021.Financial Condition‚Ç¨ millions Q42022 Q32022 Œî Q42021 Œî FY 2022 FY2021Œî Total Cash and Deposits 671.7 661.8 +1.5 % 672.2 -0.1 % 671.7 672.2 -0.1 % Net Cash and Deposits 346.5 342.5 +1.2 % 370.4 -6.5 % 346.5 370.4 -6.5 % Cash flow from Ops. 86.6 112.7 -23.2 % 101.8 -14.9 % 271.9 277.9 -2.2 %At year-end 2022  Besi had a strong liquidity position with total cash and deposits aggregating ‚Ç¨ 671.7 million  or an increase of ‚Ç¨ 9.9 million (+1.5%)  versus Q3-22.

Besi‚Äôs year-end net cash position of ‚Ç¨ 346.5 million decreased by ‚Ç¨ 23.9 million versus year end 2021 which also included the conversion into equity of ‚Ç¨ 139.9 million of our 2017 Convertible Notes.Share Repurchase ActivityDuring the quarter  Besi repurchased approximately 1.2 million of its ordinary shares at an average price of ‚Ç¨ 55.41 per share for a total of ‚Ç¨ 65.0 million.

The DACH region (Germany  Switzerland  Austria)  the UK and Belgium contributed strongly to this performance.In France (23% of Q4 2022 revenues)  business grew very strongly in the last quarter  with revenues up 26.0% (-1% on a pro forma basis at constant exchange rates) to ‚Ç¨4.1 million.The change in activity in Q4 2022 is in particular explained by:Consolidation of Respondi AG over three months in Q4 2022  compared to one month in Q4 2021;A very challenging comparison with Q4 2021  which had already recorded strong growth;Each year  the sector can benefit in Q4 from the spending of more or less significant ""marketing budget tails"". In 2022  these budgets were very low given the current economic environment.2022 : a record year with ‚Ç¨61.5 million consolidated revenues  up 39.5%For the full year 2022  Bilendi will post record consolidated revenues of ‚Ç¨61.5 million  up 39.5% compared to 2021 (6.2% on a pro forma basis at constant exchange rates). This record comes after a highly remarkable 2021  which was characterised by 29% growth  including 21% in organic growth alone.In 3 years  since 2019  the company has thus almost doubled its revenues from ‚Ç¨32.4M to ‚Ç¨61.5M (x1.9)  representing a compound average annual growth (CAGR) of 24%.

This certification assesses the robustness of processes and procedures in the provision of research  insights and data services (market research planning  execution  data collection...) and demonstrates the group's commitment to providing quality panels and services to ensure client satisfaction.Continued growth trajectory anticipated in 2023On the strength of a successful year in 2022 despite an uncertain environment  Bilendi remains confident to maintain a growth trajectory in 2023 by capitalising on its solid foundation  strengthened with the acquisition of Respondi AG:A leading position in Europe   among the top 3 players in Europe;A strong international footprint with 13 sales offices in Europe;An expanded technology offering   particularly in qualitative research;Proprietary panels that are among the most robust in Europe  with over 2.5 million members;A unique technology platform ;A portfolio of over 1 700 diversified and loyal clients .Bilendi thus reaffirms its ambition to reach revenues of ‚Ç¨100 million by 2026  and an EBITDA of 20 to 25% of revenues  i.e. ‚Ç¨20 to 25 million  combining organic development and targeted acquisitions.Next publication: results for the 2022 financial year will be published on 4 April 2023 (after market close)About BilendiAt a time when the amount  variety and speed of data being issued and communicated are increasing exponentially  Bilendi provides an innovative technological response to the collection  processing and enhancement of this data.That is why Bilendi is positioned at the epicenter of data collection for two market segments.

(Euronext Paris: CNV; ISIN: NL0010949392) (‚ÄúCnova‚Äù) today announced its fourth quarter 2022 activity and full-year unaudited financial results for 2022.During 2022  Cnova‚Äôs first priority was the continuous development of its marketplace and advertising services in a persistent context of macro-economic uncertainties and disruptions  while recalibrating its cost structure to preserve cash and improve profitability. 2022 also confirmed the relevant positioning of its B2B business model with the commercial acceleration of Octopia and C-logistics.This mix evolution towards more platform revenues has driven Cnova‚Äôs gross margin up by more than 5pts over the last 3 years to 23.2% of net sales.Story continuesMarketplace GMV  after reaching more than 50% of product GMV for the first time in the 2nd quarter of 2022  continues on its positive trend and now represents 54% of GMV in the 4th quarter (+9pts vs. last year) with a nearly stable GMV (-2%) in a receding French ecommerce market. In January and February 2023  marketplace continues to be dynamic with record high GMV shares of more than 60% for several days. Over the last 5 years  marketplace has been growing at an annual rate of +7% supporting Cnova‚Äôs first strategic pillar with a GMV share increasing by +18pts up to 52%.This marketplace development has been supported by a sharp increase in customer satisfaction measured by the NPS which grew by +3pts compared to 2021 and +14 pts compared to 2019  narrowing the gap with the direct sales customer satisfaction by 4pts since 2019. The primary lever of this improvement has been the constant enhancement in marketplace delivery services: Fulfilment by Cdiscount and Cdiscount Express Seller orders now cover more than half of marketplace GMV (+20 pts between 2019 and 2022).Advertising services revenues reached ‚Ç¨71m in the Full Year 2022  growing +5% compared to 2021 supported by the traction of our proprietary advertising bidding platform which grew by +29% yoy now representing two thirds of advertising services revenues.Overall GMV decreased by -15% in the Full Year 2022 on a comparable basis impacted by the direct sales rationalization (-27%) to focus on products generating more profit and cash. As part of this voluntary strategic move  direct sales inventories nearly halved at end 2022 compared to last year end (+‚Ç¨112m positive impact on working capital).Long-term value creation through B2B activities development: Octopia signed 14 new clients in 2022 to reach a total of 26 clients at year-end of 2022 out of which 17 clients are already live on the platform. C-logistics signed 3 new clients in 2022 to reach 4 clients at year-end for its end-to-end third-party logistic solution and has already successfully launched 3 of them.In Q2 2022  Cnova launched an Efficiency Plan to swiftly recalibrate its cost structure & capex level to the current volume of activity with a ‚Ç¨75m savings target on a full-year basis by the end of 2023.This efficiency plan already generated ‚Ç¨47m of savings of OPEX and CAPEX in 2022 compared to 2021  overperforming the July 28  2022 savings guidance by +‚Ç¨17m.Thanks to those initiatives  Cnova was able to protect profitability and cash with an EBITDA of ‚Ç¨52m and a positive free cash flow before financial interests of +‚Ç¨15m for the Full Year 2022  an improvement of +‚Ç¨94m compared to last year.Thomas M√©tivier  Cnova's CEO  commented:‚ÄúIn 2022  Cnova proved its ability to quicky adapt to macro-economic disruptions by focusing on our marketplace and advertising services while reducing our cost structure with decisions taken as early as Q1.

Cnova accelerated its shift towards the marketplace: marketplace and Cdiscount advertising together brought more than +2.5pts in gross margin.

Marketing costs represented 4.9% of net sales (-0.3 pt vs. 2021)  decreasing by ‚Ç¨17.7m in value. Cdiscount maintained its acquisition marketing spend proportionally to a lower GMV and benefited from the implementation of the savings plan. Technology & Content costs increased at 3.7% of net sales (+1.7 pts vs. 2021) related to the continuous investment in Octopia‚Äôs product and commercial development partly offset by the savings plan that was achieved gradually throughout the second half of the year.

In a context of significant market headwinds  EBITDA benefited from a resilient marketplace performance and increased revenues from advertising services while heavy destocking initiatives negatively weighted on Direct Sales gross margin.

Benchmark figures are performance measures used by management. See Note 3 for a reconciliation from IFRS to benchmark figures. Full-Year 2023 Outlook Our guidance for 2023 is provided below. We expect full-year organic growth to be in line with the prior year and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve. In the first and second quarters of 2023  organic growth is expected to be slower compared to the prior year period  most notably in Health and Governance  Risk & Compliance. The adjusted operating margin is expected to ease in the first half. Full-Year 2023 Outlook Performance indicators 2023 Guidance 2022 Actual Adjusted operating profit margin* 26.1%-26.5% 26.1% Adjusted free cash flow** Around ‚Ç¨1 200 million ‚Ç¨1 220 million ROIC* 16.5%-17.0% 15.5% Diluted adjusted EPS growth** High-single-digit 8% *Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reporting currency and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2023 of ‚Ç¨/$1.07. **Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (‚Ç¨/$ 1.05). Guidance reflects share repurchases of ‚Ç¨1 billion in 2023. If the current U.S. dollar rate persists  currency will have a slightly negative effect on full-year 2023 results reported in euros. In 2022  Wolters Kluwer generated over 60% of revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2022 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average ‚Ç¨/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 3 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS1. We include restructuring costs in adjusted operating profit. We expect 2023 restructuring costs to be in the range of ‚Ç¨10-‚Ç¨15 million (FY 2022: ‚Ç¨6 million). We expect adjusted net financing costs2 in constant currencies to be approximately ‚Ç¨40 million. We expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to be in the range of 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2022: 22.6%). Capital expenditure is expected to increase but to remain within our normal range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2022: 5.4%). We expect full-year cash conversion ratio to be approximately 100% (FY 2022: 107%). Our guidance assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins  earnings  and ROIC in the near term. The impact of discontinuing activities in Russia and Belarus is expected to be immaterial to the consolidated financial results in 2023. 2023 Outlook by Division Health: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to be stable. Tax & Accounting: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to improve modestly. Governance  Risk & Compliance: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to improve modestly. Legal & Regulatory: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and full-year adjusted operating profit margin to be stable. Formation of a new division: Corporate Performance & ESG Today we are announcing that  in March  we intend to bring together four of our global enterprise software businesses to form a new division  Corporate Performance & ESG  to meet the growing demand from corporations and banks for integrated financial  operational  and ESG performance management and reporting solutions. This new division will be comprised of the following global software units: Corporate Performance (CCH Tagetik  including U.S. Corporate Tax)EHS/ORM Software (Enablon)Finance  Risk & ReportingInternal Audit Solutions (TeamMate). All four businesses serve global corporations and banks with cloud and on-premise solutions and have leading market positions in their specific areas of expertise. Combining these assets will allow us to accelerate synergies and leverage their combined global strengths to pursue a growing market opportunity.Corporate Performance & ESG will be led by Karen Abramson  who has been CEO of our Tax & Accounting division for the past 9 years. Jason Marx  currently leading North America Tax & Accounting  will be appointed CEO of the Tax & Accounting division. The Governance  Risk & Compliance (GRC) division will become Financial & Corporate Compliance and will comprise CT Corporation and Compliance Solutions  which provide legal services and banking compliance software  content  and lien solutions to mainly U.S. businesses. Steve Meirink will be appointed CEO of Financial & Corporate Compliance. Steve has been EVP and General Manager of Compliance Solutions for the past 7 years. Last year  Richard Flynn  currently CEO of GRC  informed us of his plans to pursue new experiences outside Wolters Kluwer. We thank him for his many contributions to the company. Our Enterprise Legal Management unit (ELM)  currently part of GRC Legal Services  will be transferred to the Legal & Regulatory division where we see opportunities for closer alignment with our Legal Software business. We will report our 2023 results under both the historic reporting segments and the new divisional structure. A pro forma 2022 revenue breakdown of the new divisional structure is provided in Appendix 4 of this release. More detailed pro forma financial information will be provided in the second quarter. Our Mission  Business Model and Strategy Our mission is to empower our professional customers with the information  software solutions  and services they need to make critical decisions  achieve successful outcomes  and save time. Every day  our customers face the challenge of increasing proliferation and complexity of information and the pressure to deliver better outcomes at a lower cost. Many of our customers are looking for mobility  flexibility  intuitive interfaces  and integrated open architecture technology to support their decision-making. We aim to solve their problems and add value to their workflow with our range of digital solutions and services  which we continuously evolve to meet their changing needs. Our expert solutions combine deep domain knowledge with technology to deliver both content and workflow automation to drive improved outcomes and productivity for our customers. Expert solutions  which include our software products and certain advanced information solutions  accounted for 56% of total revenues in 2022 (FY 2021: 55%) and grew 9% organically (FY 2021: 6%). Software revenues accounted for 44% of total revenues (FY 2021: 42%) and also grew 9% organically (FY 2021: 6%)  with cloud software revenues up 17% organically (FY 2021: 17%). Based on revenues  our largest expert solutions by division are: Health : global clinical decision support tool UpToDate; clinical drug databases Medi-Span and Lexicomp; and Lippincott nursing solutions for practice and learning.: global clinical decision support tool UpToDate; clinical drug databases Medi-Span and Lexicomp; and Lippincott nursing solutions for practice and learning.

Legal & Regulatory: global EHS/ORM3 suite Enablon; legal workflow solutions Kleos and Legisway; and other software tools for European legal professionals. Our business model is primarily based on subscriptions  software maintenance  and other recurring revenues (80% of total revenues in FY 2022)  augmented by implementation services and license fees as well as volume-based transactional and other non-recurring revenues. Renewal rates for our recurring digital information  software  and service revenues are high and are one of the key indicators by which we measure our success. More than half of our operating costs relate to our employees  who create  develop  maintain  sell  implement  and support our solutions on behalf of our customers. Our technology architecture is increasingly based on globally scalable platforms that use standardized components. An increasing proportion of our solutions is built cloud-first. Many of our solutions incorporate advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence  natural language processing  robotic process automation  and predictive analytics. Our development teams follow a customer-centric  contextual design process and develop solutions based on the scaled agile framework. Our solutions are sold by our own sales teams or through selected distribution partners. Strategy 2022-2024: Elevate Our ValueOur strategy aims to deliver good organic growth and improved margins and returns over the three-year period (2022-2024). Our strategic priorities for 2022-2024 are: Accelerate Expert Solutions : we are focusing our investments on cloud-based expert solutions while continuing to transform selected digital information products into expert solutions. We are investing to enrich the customer experience of our products by leveraging advanced data analytics.: we are focusing our investments on cloud-based expert solutions while continuing to transform selected digital information products into expert solutions. We are investing to enrich the customer experience of our products by leveraging advanced data analytics. Expand Our Reach : we are seeking to extend organically into high-growth adjacencies along our customer workflows and to adapt our existing products for new customer segments. We are developing partnerships and ecosystems for our key software platforms.: we are seeking to extend organically into high-growth adjacencies along our customer workflows and to adapt our existing products for new customer segments. We are developing partnerships and ecosystems for our key software platforms. Evolve Core Capabilities: we intend to enhance our central functions to drive excellence and scale economies  mainly in sales and marketing (go-to-market) and in technology. We plan to advance our environmental  social  and governance (ESG) performance and capabilities and to continue investing in diverse and engaged talent to support innovation and growth. Product innovation is a key driver of organic growth and customer satisfaction. In our current strategic plan  we expect that annual product development spend4 will average approximately 10% of total revenues over the three-year period. While our strategy remains centered on organic investment and growth  we may make selected acquisitions and non-core disposals to enhance our value and market positions. Acquisitions must fit our strategy  strengthen or extend our existing business  generally be accretive to diluted adjusted EPS in their first full year and  when integrated  deliver a return on invested capital above our weighted average cost of capital (8%) within three to five years. Key ESG goals in our current strategic plan are to drive an improvement in our belonging score5  to align with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)  and to obtain validated science-based targets. Financial Policy  Capital Allocation  Net Debt  and Liquidity Wolters Kluwer uses its free cash flow to invest in the business organically and through acquisitions  to maintain optimal leverage  and to provide returns to shareholders. We regularly assess our financial position and evaluate the appropriate level of debt in view of our expectations for cash flow  investment plans  interest rates  and capital market conditions. While we may temporarily deviate from our leverage target  we continue to believe that  in the longer run  a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of around 2.5x remains appropriate for our business given the high proportion of recurring revenues and resilient cash flows. Dividend Policy and Proposed Final Dividend 2022Wolters Kluwer remains committed to a progressive dividend policy  under which we aim to increase the dividend per share in euros each year  independent of currency fluctuations. The payout ratio6 can vary from year to year. Proposed annual increases in the dividend per share take into account our Ô¨Ånancial performance  market conditions  and our need for Ô¨Ånancial Ô¨Çexibility. The policy takes into consideration the characteristics of our business  our expectations for future cash Ô¨Çows  and our plans for organic investment in innovation and productivity  or for acquisitions. We balance these factors with the objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet. At the 2023 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders  we will propose a final dividend of ‚Ç¨1.18  which would result in a total dividend over the 2022 financial year of ‚Ç¨1.81  an increase of 15%. Dividends are paid in cash. Shareholders can choose to reinvest both interim and Ô¨Ånal dividends by purchasing additional Wolters Kluwer shares through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) administered by ABN AMRO Bank N.V. Share Buybacks 2022 and 2023As a matter of policy since 2012  Wolters Kluwer will offset the dilution caused by our annual incentive share issuance with share repurchases (Anti-Dilution Policy). In addition  from time to time when appropriate  we return capital to shareholders through share buyback programs. Shares repurchased by the company are added to and held as treasury shares and are either cancelled or utilized to meet future obligations arising from share-based incentive plans. In 2022  we completed share repurchases of ‚Ç¨1 billion (10.1 million shares at an average price of ‚Ç¨98.75). See Note 8 for further information on issued share capital. Today  we are announcing our intention to repurchase shares for up to ‚Ç¨1 billion during 2023. In the year to date  up to and including February 20  2023  we have repurchased ‚Ç¨100 million in shares (1.0 million shares at an average price of ‚Ç¨100.18). Assuming global economic conditions do not deteriorate substantially  we believe this level of share buybacks leaves us with ample headroom to support our dividend plans  to sustain organic investment  and to make selective acquisitions. The share repurchase program may be suspended  discontinued  or modified at any time. For the period starting February 24  2023  up to and including April 28  2023  we have mandated a third party to execute ‚Ç¨160 million in share buybacks on our behalf  within the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and the company‚Äôs Articles of Association. The maximum number of shares which may be repurchased will not exceed the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. Net Debt  Leverage  Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility  and Liquidity PositionNet debt on December 31  2022  was ‚Ç¨2 253 million  compared to ‚Ç¨2 131 million on December 31  2021. The net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x (2021: 1.4x). Effective July 2022  we agreed to the final one-year extension of our ‚Ç¨600 million multi-currency credit facility  such that the facility will now mature in 2025. The facility is ESG-linked  with pricing tied to four key ESG performance indicators. The facility is currently fully undrawn. In September 2022  we issued a new ‚Ç¨500 million Eurobond with a four-year term and 3.0% annual coupon. Our liquidity position remains strong with  net cash available of ‚Ç¨1 330 million as of December 31  2022.7Full-Year 2022 Results Benchmark FiguresGroup revenues were ‚Ç¨5 453 million  up 14% overall  benefitting from a stronger U.S. dollar for most of the year. Excluding the effect of exchange rate movements  revenues increased 5% in constant currencies. The effect of divestments (almost entirely in Legal & Regulatory) outweighed the effect of acquisitions. Organic revenue growth was 6% (FY 2021: 6%). Revenues from North America  64% of total group revenues  grew 6% organically (FY 2021: 7%). Revenues from Europe  29% of total revenues  also grew 6% organically (FY 2021: 4%). Revenues from Asia Pacific and Rest of World  7% of total revenues  grew 10% organically (FY 2021: 3%). Adjusted operating profit was ‚Ç¨1 424 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨1 205 million)  up 7% in constant currencies. The related margin increased 80 basis points to 26.1% (FY 2021: 25.3%)  reflecting a favorable currency mix (40 basis points)  operational gearing  and the ongoing gradual shift in business mix. These factors more than offset an increase in operating costs  including higher product development expenses. Total product development spending  including capitalized expenditures  increased to 11% of total revenues (FY 2021: 10%). Restructuring expenses  which are included in adjusted operating profit  were in line with the prior year ‚Ç¨6 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨6 million). Adjusted net financing costs were ‚Ç¨56 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨78 million) due to higher interest rates on cash and cash equivalents. Included in adjusted net financing costs was a ‚Ç¨5 million net foreign exchange loss (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨15 million net foreign exchange loss) mainly related to the translation of intercompany balances. This non-cash loss was lower than we had guided in November 2022 due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar in the final weeks of 2022. Adjusted profit before tax was ‚Ç¨1 368 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨1 128 million)  up 21% overall and up 8% in constant currencies. The benchmark tax rate on adjusted profit before tax increased to 22.6% (FY 2021: 21.5%) due to newly introduced restrictions on tax deductibility of finance costs in the Netherlands  while 2021 included a one-time benefit following the closure of tax audits. Adjusted net profit was ‚Ç¨1 059 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨885 million)  an increase of 20% overall and 6% in constant currencies. Diluted adjusted EPS was ‚Ç¨4.14 (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨3.38)  up 8% in constant currencies  reflecting the increase in adjusted net profit and a 2% reduction in the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding to 255.8 million (FY 2021: 261.8 million). IFRS Reported FiguresReported operating profit increased 32% to ‚Ç¨1 333 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨1 012 million). The increase reflects the increase in adjusted operating profit and a ‚Ç¨75 million net disposal gain on the divestments during the year (most notably the sale of our Spanish and French publishing assets)  partly offset by a ‚Ç¨20 million impairment of certain Health assets. Reported financing results amounted to a net cost of ‚Ç¨57 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨84 million cost). The reported effective tax rate decreased to 19.5% (FY 2021: 21.6%). The 2022 gain on divestment was not taxable while the prior period included a taxable disposal gain and a disposal-related loss which was not tax-deductible. Net profit increased 41% overall to ‚Ç¨1 027 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨728 million) and diluted earnings per share increased 44% to ‚Ç¨4.01 (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨2.78). Cash FlowAdjusted operating cash flow was ‚Ç¨1 528 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨1 348 million)  up 2% in constant currencies. As anticipated  the cash conversion ratio decreased to 107% (FY 2021: 112%). Capital expenditures were ‚Ç¨295 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨239 million)  an increase of 16% in constant currencies. Capital expenditures remained within our guided range at 5.4% of group revenues (FY 2021: 5.0%). Cash payments related to leases  including lease interest paid  were ‚Ç¨81 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨77 million). Depreciation of physical assets and the amortization and impairment of internally developed software assets amounted to ‚Ç¨234 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨237 million)  a decrease of 8% in constant currencies. The depreciation and impairment of right-of-use assets  mainly leased offices  was ‚Ç¨71 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨72 million). Net interest paid  excluding lease interest paid  was ‚Ç¨45 million  lower than in the prior period (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨57 million). Corporate income tax paid increased to ‚Ç¨289 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨277 million)  reflecting higher income before tax and the newly introduced U.S. tax rules on the capitalization of research & development expenses. Net cash outflows related to restructuring were ‚Ç¨12 million  lower than in the prior year (FY 2021: outflow of ‚Ç¨33 million). Consequently  adjusted free cash flow was ‚Ç¨1 220 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨1 010 million)  up 7% in constant currencies. Total acquisition spending  net of cash acquired and including transaction costs  was ‚Ç¨95 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨113 million)  primarily relating to the acquisition of IDS on April 8  2022 by the Governance Risk & Compliance division. Total divestment proceeds amounted to ‚Ç¨103 million  net of cash divested and divestment-related costs  primarily relating to the divestment of our Spanish and French publishing assets. Dividends paid to shareholders amounted to ‚Ç¨424 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨373 million)  including the 2021 final dividend and the 2022 interim dividend. Cash spent on share buybacks was ‚Ç¨1 billion (FY 2021 ‚Ç¨410 million). As such  more than 100% of adjusted free cash flow was returned to shareholders. ESG Highlights 2022 Advancing our performance against relevant and material ESG objectives is a core element of our strategy. We are focused on delivering high levels of customer satisfaction and innovative  impactful solutions and services; we are nurturing an engaged  talented  and diverse workforce; we are supporting strong ethics  compliance  and governance; and we are investing to maintain highly secure systems. We are committed to reducing our greenhouse gas footprint in line with the Paris Agreement. Investment in product development and innovation was 11% of revenues in 2022 (FY 2021: 10%). In 2022  our employee engagement and belonging scores  now measured by Glint  both increased by 1 point  to 77 and 73 respectively. We have plans and targets in place to drive further improvement. Employee turnover remained elevated amid a tight global market for talent  especially for technology and other skilled professionals. During the year  we expanded initiatives designed to attract  engage  and retain talent. A year ago  we committed to aligning our practices and reporting to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures (TCFD) and to setting science-based targets. During 2022  we made significant progress. We completed an assessment of our greenhouse gas footprint  including scope 1  2 and 3 emissions and improved existing processes for scope 1 and scope 2 data collection. We have committed to reduce our emissions in line with 1.5¬∞C global warming and reaching net-zero no later than by 2050. In early 2023  we submitted near-term targets to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for validation  to reduce absolute Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions by 50% and absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 30% by the year 2030 from a 2019 base year. We will submit a net-zero target to the SBTi within two years of our commitment. In the meantime  efforts to reduce our scope 1 and 2 emissions continued. Most notably in 2022  we achieved a 5% organic reduction in our global office footprint (m2) and decommissioned 1 032 on-premise servers by migrating applications to more energy-efficient cloud infrastructure.

Benchmark figures are performance measures used by management. See Note 3 for a reconciliation from IFRS to benchmark figures.Full-Year 2023 OutlookOur guidance for 2023 is provided below. We expect full-year organic growth to be in line with the prior year and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve. In the first and second quarters of 2023  organic growth is expected to be slower compared to the prior year period  most notably in Health and Governance  Risk & Compliance. The adjusted operating margin is expected to ease in the first half.Full-Year 2023 Outlook Performance indicators 2023 Guidance 2022 Actual Adjusted operating profit margin* 26.1%-26.5% 26.1% Adjusted free cash flow** Around ‚Ç¨1 200 million ‚Ç¨1 220 million ROIC* 16.5%-17.0% 15.5% Diluted adjusted EPS growth** High-single-digit 8% *Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reporting currency and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2023 of ‚Ç¨/$1.07. **Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (‚Ç¨/$ 1.05). Guidance reflects share repurchases of ‚Ç¨1 billion in 2023.If the current U.S. dollar rate persists  currency will have a slightly negative effect on full-year 2023 results reported in euros. In 2022  Wolters Kluwer generated over 60% of revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2022 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average ‚Ç¨/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 3 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS1.We include restructuring costs in adjusted operating profit. We expect 2023 restructuring costs to be in the range of ‚Ç¨10-‚Ç¨15 million (FY 2022: ‚Ç¨6 million).We expect adjusted net financing costs2 in constant currencies to be approximately ‚Ç¨40 million. We expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to be in the range of 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2022: 22.6%).Capital expenditure is expected to increase but to remain within our normal range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2022: 5.4%). We expect full-year cash conversion ratio to be approximately 100% (FY 2022: 107%).Our guidance assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins  earnings  and ROIC in the near term.The impact of discontinuing activities in Russia and Belarus is expected to be immaterial to the consolidated financial results in 2023.2023 Outlook by DivisionHealth: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to be stable.Tax & Accounting: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to improve modestly.Governance  Risk & Compliance: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to improve modestly.Legal & Regulatory: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and full-year adjusted operating profit margin to be stable.Formation of a new division: Corporate Performance & ESGToday we are announcing that  in March  we intend to bring together four of our global enterprise software businesses to form a new division  Corporate Performance & ESG  to meet the growing demand from corporations and banks for integrated financial  operational  and ESG performance management and reporting solutions.This new division will be comprised of the following global software units:Corporate Performance (CCH Tagetik  including U.S. Corporate Tax)EHS/ORM Software (Enablon)Finance  Risk & ReportingInternal Audit Solutions (TeamMate).All four businesses serve global corporations and banks with cloud and on-premise solutions and have leading market positions in their specific areas of expertise. Combining these assets will allow us to accelerate synergies and leverage their combined global strengths to pursue a growing market opportunity.Corporate Performance & ESG will be led by Karen Abramson  who has been CEO of our Tax & Accounting division for the past 9 years. Jason Marx  currently leading North America Tax & Accounting  will be appointed CEO of the Tax & Accounting division. The Governance  Risk & Compliance (GRC) division will become Financial & Corporate Compliance and will comprise CT Corporation and Compliance Solutions  which provide legal services and banking compliance software  content  and lien solutions to mainly U.S. businesses. Steve Meirink will be appointed CEO of Financial & Corporate Compliance. Steve has been EVP and General Manager of Compliance Solutions for the past 7 years. Last year  Richard Flynn  currently CEO of GRC  informed us of his plans to pursue new experiences outside Wolters Kluwer. We thank him for his many contributions to the company.Our Enterprise Legal Management unit (ELM)  currently part of GRC Legal Services  will be transferred to the Legal & Regulatory division where we see opportunities for closer alignment with our Legal Software business.We will report our 2023 results under both the historic reporting segments and the new divisional structure. A pro forma 2022 revenue breakdown of the new divisional structure is provided in Appendix 4 of this release. More detailed pro forma financial information will be provided in the second quarter.Our Mission  Business Model and StrategyOur mission is to empower our professional customers with the information  software solutions  and services they need to make critical decisions  achieve successful outcomes  and save time.

Software revenues accounted for 44% of total revenues (FY 2021: 42%) and also grew 9% organically (FY 2021: 6%)  with cloud software revenues up 17% organically (FY 2021: 17%).Based on revenues  our largest expert solutions by division are:Health : global clinical decision support tool UpToDate; clinical drug databases Medi-Span and Lexicomp; and Lippincott nursing solutions for practice and learning.: global clinical decision support tool UpToDate; clinical drug databases Medi-Span and Lexicomp; and Lippincott nursing solutions for practice and learning.

Legal & Regulatory: global EHS/ORM3 suite Enablon; legal workflow solutions Kleos and Legisway; and other software tools for European legal professionals.Our business model is primarily based on subscriptions  software maintenance  and other recurring revenues (80% of total revenues in FY 2022)  augmented by implementation services and license fees as well as volume-based transactional and other non-recurring revenues. Renewal rates for our recurring digital information  software  and service revenues are high and are one of the key indicators by which we measure our success. More than half of our operating costs relate to our employees  who create  develop  maintain  sell  implement  and support our solutions on behalf of our customers. Our technology architecture is increasingly based on globally scalable platforms that use standardized components. An increasing proportion of our solutions is built cloud-first. Many of our solutions incorporate advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence  natural language processing  robotic process automation  and predictive analytics. Our development teams follow a customer-centric  contextual design process and develop solutions based on the scaled agile framework. Our solutions are sold by our own sales teams or through selected distribution partners.Strategy 2022-2024: Elevate Our ValueOur strategy aims to deliver good organic growth and improved margins and returns over the three-year period (2022-2024). Our strategic priorities for 2022-2024 are:Accelerate Expert Solutions : we are focusing our investments on cloud-based expert solutions while continuing to transform selected digital information products into expert solutions. We are investing to enrich the customer experience of our products by leveraging advanced data analytics.: we are focusing our investments on cloud-based expert solutions while continuing to transform selected digital information products into expert solutions. We are investing to enrich the customer experience of our products by leveraging advanced data analytics. Expand Our Reach : we are seeking to extend organically into high-growth adjacencies along our customer workflows and to adapt our existing products for new customer segments. We are developing partnerships and ecosystems for our key software platforms.: we are seeking to extend organically into high-growth adjacencies along our customer workflows and to adapt our existing products for new customer segments. We are developing partnerships and ecosystems for our key software platforms. Evolve Core Capabilities: we intend to enhance our central functions to drive excellence and scale economies  mainly in sales and marketing (go-to-market) and in technology. We plan to advance our environmental  social  and governance (ESG) performance and capabilities and to continue investing in diverse and engaged talent to support innovation and growth.Product innovation is a key driver of organic growth and customer satisfaction. In our current strategic plan  we expect that annual product development spend4 will average approximately 10% of total revenues over the three-year period. While our strategy remains centered on organic investment and growth  we may make selected acquisitions and non-core disposals to enhance our value and market positions. Acquisitions must fit our strategy  strengthen or extend our existing business  generally be accretive to diluted adjusted EPS in their first full year and  when integrated  deliver a return on invested capital above our weighted average cost of capital (8%) within three to five years. Key ESG goals in our current strategic plan are to drive an improvement in our belonging score5  to align with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)  and to obtain validated science-based targets.Financial Policy  Capital Allocation  Net Debt  and LiquidityWolters Kluwer uses its free cash flow to invest in the business organically and through acquisitions  to maintain optimal leverage  and to provide returns to shareholders. We regularly assess our financial position and evaluate the appropriate level of debt in view of our expectations for cash flow  investment plans  interest rates  and capital market conditions. While we may temporarily deviate from our leverage target  we continue to believe that  in the longer run  a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of around 2.5x remains appropriate for our business given the high proportion of recurring revenues and resilient cash flows.Dividend Policy and Proposed Final Dividend 2022Wolters Kluwer remains committed to a progressive dividend policy  under which we aim to increase the dividend per share in euros each year  independent of currency fluctuations. The payout ratio6 can vary from year to year. Proposed annual increases in the dividend per share take into account our Ô¨Ånancial performance  market conditions  and our need for Ô¨Ånancial Ô¨Çexibility. The policy takes into consideration the characteristics of our business  our expectations for future cash Ô¨Çows  and our plans for organic investment in innovation and productivity  or for acquisitions. We balance these factors with the objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet.At the 2023 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders  we will propose a final dividend of ‚Ç¨1.18  which would result in a total dividend over the 2022 financial year of ‚Ç¨1.81  an increase of 15%. Dividends are paid in cash. Shareholders can choose to reinvest both interim and Ô¨Ånal dividends by purchasing additional Wolters Kluwer shares through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) administered by ABN AMRO Bank N.V.Share Buybacks 2022 and 2023As a matter of policy since 2012  Wolters Kluwer will offset the dilution caused by our annual incentive share issuance with share repurchases (Anti-Dilution Policy). In addition  from time to time when appropriate  we return capital to shareholders through share buyback programs. Shares repurchased by the company are added to and held as treasury shares and are either cancelled or utilized to meet future obligations arising from share-based incentive plans.In 2022  we completed share repurchases of ‚Ç¨1 billion (10.1 million shares at an average price of ‚Ç¨98.75). See Note 8 for further information on issued share capital.Today  we are announcing our intention to repurchase shares for up to ‚Ç¨1 billion during 2023. In the year to date  up to and including February 20  2023  we have repurchased ‚Ç¨100 million in shares (1.0 million shares at an average price of ‚Ç¨100.18). Assuming global economic conditions do not deteriorate substantially  we believe this level of share buybacks leaves us with ample headroom to support our dividend plans  to sustain organic investment  and to make selective acquisitions. The share repurchase program may be suspended  discontinued  or modified at any time. For the period starting February 24  2023  up to and including April 28  2023  we have mandated a third party to execute ‚Ç¨160 million in share buybacks on our behalf  within the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and the company‚Äôs Articles of Association. The maximum number of shares which may be repurchased will not exceed the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.Net Debt  Leverage  Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility  and Liquidity PositionNet debt on December 31  2022  was ‚Ç¨2 253 million  compared to ‚Ç¨2 131 million on December 31  2021. The net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x (2021: 1.4x). Effective July 2022  we agreed to the final one-year extension of our ‚Ç¨600 million multi-currency credit facility  such that the facility will now mature in 2025. The facility is ESG-linked  with pricing tied to four key ESG performance indicators. The facility is currently fully undrawn. In September 2022  we issued a new ‚Ç¨500 million Eurobond with a four-year term and 3.0% annual coupon. Our liquidity position remains strong with  net cash available of ‚Ç¨1 330 million as of December 31  2022.7Full-Year 2022 ResultsBenchmark FiguresGroup revenues were ‚Ç¨5 453 million  up 14% overall  benefitting from a stronger U.S. dollar for most of the year. Excluding the effect of exchange rate movements  revenues increased 5% in constant currencies. The effect of divestments (almost entirely in Legal & Regulatory) outweighed the effect of acquisitions. Organic revenue growth was 6% (FY 2021: 6%).Revenues from North America  64% of total group revenues  grew 6% organically (FY 2021: 7%). Revenues from Europe  29% of total revenues  also grew 6% organically (FY 2021: 4%). Revenues from Asia Pacific and Rest of World  7% of total revenues  grew 10% organically (FY 2021: 3%).Adjusted operating profit was ‚Ç¨1 424 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨1 205 million)  up 7% in constant currencies. The related margin increased 80 basis points to 26.1% (FY 2021: 25.3%)  reflecting a favorable currency mix (40 basis points)  operational gearing  and the ongoing gradual shift in business mix. These factors more than offset an increase in operating costs  including higher product development expenses. Total product development spending  including capitalized expenditures  increased to 11% of total revenues (FY 2021: 10%). Restructuring expenses  which are included in adjusted operating profit  were in line with the prior year ‚Ç¨6 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨6 million).Adjusted net financing costs were ‚Ç¨56 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨78 million) due to higher interest rates on cash and cash equivalents. Included in adjusted net financing costs was a ‚Ç¨5 million net foreign exchange loss (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨15 million net foreign exchange loss) mainly related to the translation of intercompany balances. This non-cash loss was lower than we had guided in November 2022 due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar in the final weeks of 2022.Adjusted profit before tax was ‚Ç¨1 368 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨1 128 million)  up 21% overall and up 8% in constant currencies. The benchmark tax rate on adjusted profit before tax increased to 22.6% (FY 2021: 21.5%) due to newly introduced restrictions on tax deductibility of finance costs in the Netherlands  while 2021 included a one-time benefit following the closure of tax audits. Adjusted net profit was ‚Ç¨1 059 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨885 million)  an increase of 20% overall and 6% in constant currencies.Diluted adjusted EPS was ‚Ç¨4.14 (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨3.38)  up 8% in constant currencies  reflecting the increase in adjusted net profit and a 2% reduction in the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding to 255.8 million (FY 2021: 261.8 million).IFRS Reported FiguresReported operating profit increased 32% to ‚Ç¨1 333 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨1 012 million). The increase reflects the increase in adjusted operating profit and a ‚Ç¨75 million net disposal gain on the divestments during the year (most notably the sale of our Spanish and French publishing assets)  partly offset by a ‚Ç¨20 million impairment of certain Health assets.Reported financing results amounted to a net cost of ‚Ç¨57 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨84 million cost).The reported effective tax rate decreased to 19.5% (FY 2021: 21.6%). The 2022 gain on divestment was not taxable while the prior period included a taxable disposal gain and a disposal-related loss which was not tax-deductible.Net profit increased 41% overall to ‚Ç¨1 027 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨728 million) and diluted earnings per share increased 44% to ‚Ç¨4.01 (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨2.78).Cash FlowAdjusted operating cash flow was ‚Ç¨1 528 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨1 348 million)  up 2% in constant currencies. As anticipated  the cash conversion ratio decreased to 107% (FY 2021: 112%). Capital expenditures were ‚Ç¨295 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨239 million)  an increase of 16% in constant currencies. Capital expenditures remained within our guided range at 5.4% of group revenues (FY 2021: 5.0%). Cash payments related to leases  including lease interest paid  were ‚Ç¨81 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨77 million). Depreciation of physical assets and the amortization and impairment of internally developed software assets amounted to ‚Ç¨234 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨237 million)  a decrease of 8% in constant currencies. The depreciation and impairment of right-of-use assets  mainly leased offices  was ‚Ç¨71 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨72 million).Net interest paid  excluding lease interest paid  was ‚Ç¨45 million  lower than in the prior period (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨57 million). Corporate income tax paid increased to ‚Ç¨289 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨277 million)  reflecting higher income before tax and the newly introduced U.S. tax rules on the capitalization of research & development expenses. Net cash outflows related to restructuring were ‚Ç¨12 million  lower than in the prior year (FY 2021: outflow of ‚Ç¨33 million). Consequently  adjusted free cash flow was ‚Ç¨1 220 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨1 010 million)  up 7% in constant currencies.Total acquisition spending  net of cash acquired and including transaction costs  was ‚Ç¨95 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨113 million)  primarily relating to the acquisition of IDS on April 8  2022 by the Governance Risk & Compliance division. Total divestment proceeds amounted to ‚Ç¨103 million  net of cash divested and divestment-related costs  primarily relating to the divestment of our Spanish and French publishing assets.Dividends paid to shareholders amounted to ‚Ç¨424 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨373 million)  including the 2021 final dividend and the 2022 interim dividend. Cash spent on share buybacks was ‚Ç¨1 billion (FY 2021 ‚Ç¨410 million). As such  more than 100% of adjusted free cash flow was returned to shareholders.ESG Highlights 2022Advancing our performance against relevant and material ESG objectives is a core element of our strategy. We are focused on delivering high levels of customer satisfaction and innovative  impactful solutions and services; we are nurturing an engaged  talented  and diverse workforce; we are supporting strong ethics  compliance  and governance; and we are investing to maintain highly secure systems. We are committed to reducing our greenhouse gas footprint in line with the Paris Agreement.Investment in product development and innovation was 11% of revenues in 2022 (FY 2021: 10%).In 2022  our employee engagement and belonging scores  now measured by Glint  both increased by 1 point  to 77 and 73 respectively. We have plans and targets in place to drive further improvement. Employee turnover remained elevated amid a tight global market for talent  especially for technology and other skilled professionals. During the year  we expanded initiatives designed to attract  engage  and retain talent.A year ago  we committed to aligning our practices and reporting to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures (TCFD) and to setting science-based targets. During 2022  we made significant progress. We completed an assessment of our greenhouse gas footprint  including scope 1  2 and 3 emissions and improved existing processes for scope 1 and scope 2 data collection. We have committed to reduce our emissions in line with 1.5¬∞C global warming and reaching net-zero no later than by 2050. In early 2023  we submitted near-term targets to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for validation  to reduce absolute Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions by 50% and absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 30% by the year 2030 from a 2019 base year. We will submit a net-zero target to the SBTi within two years of our commitment.In the meantime  efforts to reduce our scope 1 and 2 emissions continued. Most notably in 2022  we achieved a 5% organic reduction in our global office footprint (m2) and decommissioned 1 032 on-premise servers by migrating applications to more energy-efficient cloud infrastructure.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services for the healthcare; tax and accounting; governance  risk and compliance; and legal and regulatory sectors.

19083,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ACTIA-GROUP-5110/news/ACTIA-Q4-AND-2022-FINANCIAL-YEAR-TURNOVER-43048932/?utm_medium=RSS&utm_content=20230222,ACTIA : Q4 AND 2022 FINANCIAL YEAR TURNOVER,(marketscreener.com) Tel: +33 561 176198 - www.actia.com     1/1        The Automotive Division represented 84.2% of the Group's annual revenues or ‚Ç¨420.7 million. The growth rate of 10.0% continued to be hindered by the components crisis. Taking‚Ä¶,For 2022  the international business represented 63.8% of revenue with stable volumes  but with a slightly lower share than in 2021 with 69.2%. This is linked to the business in Sweden (the Volvo Car contract)  which nevertheless remained the second largest country with a diversified customer base (Trucks  Aeronautics and Space)  and strong growth in France thanks as much to the recovery of the aeronautics and space segments as to the Automotive and Telecoms businesses. The gradual deployment of the contracts won during the health crisis meant that Bra¬≤zil entered the top 10 countries in terms of billing  with the end of the significant SatCom deliveries making Egypt lose ground. China  despite a year that was complicated by the lockdowns imposed due to Covid-19  was down by 12.4% in terms of the domestic market whereas our subsidiary grew by 23.6% thanks to its export market. In the United States  the performance remained mixed due to difficulties in the labour market (recruitment) which ACTIA is making every effort to resolve as they are limiting the Group's ability to respond to numerous tenders.ACTIA Group's customer portfolio and order book for the coming years bear witness to the robust prospects for growth allowing it to envisage revenues in excess of ‚Ç¨800 million at the end of 2025  despite the disposals made in 2022. For 2023  ACTIA could achieve growth of over 15%.For a year that promised to be full of challenges  ACTIA consolidated its growth with revenues of ‚Ç¨499.8 million  up by 12.1% after growth of 5.5% in 2021  taking into account IFRS restatements IFRS for the disposal of the Power Division completed on 1 August 2022. Thanks to the Group's ongoing investment in its lines of business and expertise  uninterrupted despite the series of recent crises  all market segments in which ACTIA operates grew  making it possible to offset the end of the significant contract with Volvo Car  a negative effect of ‚Ç¨43.1 million. With the exception of Light Vehicles  related to the end of this contract  growth reached 3.5% (Power) and 46.3% (Aeronautics  Defence & Space). This was achieved in spite of supplies of components remaining under pressure and continuing to cause production delays (more than ‚Ç¨10 million at the end of the year) and the storage of items that were easier to procure.The Automotive Division represented 84.2% of the Group's annual revenues or ‚Ç¨420.7 million. The growth rate of 10.0% continued to be hindered by the components crisis. Taking into account the end of  the Volvo Car telematics contract  down by 63.7% compared to 2021  the division still generated ‚Ç¨81.2 million of additional business  while being held back by supply difficulties. For the OEM* customers  representing 75.2% of the division's turnover  growth of 6.5% was driven by industrial vehicles  up by 42.3%  particularly in the agricultural area  Buses & Coaches  up by 25.7%  and Trucks  up by 15.3%. Due to the disposal of the Technical Inspection and Garage Equipment business on 21 April 2022  the Aftermarket** business experienced a drop of 22.6%. The business still represented 7.6% of turnover for the full year  produced by the Diagnostics and Fleet Management businesses. The MDS*** electronics outsourcing business  at 17.2% of the division's turnover and up by 64.0%  reflected both our customers' trust in ACTIA's production facilities and the good health or recovery of certain sectors  such as Aeronautics.The Telecoms Division represented 15.7% of the Group's annual revenues or ‚Ç¨78.6 million. With growth of 24.1%  the division finished the year with a very good level of billing. After a very robust year in 2021  the Power and Rail business  up respectively by 5.7% and 14.4%  nevertheless lagged behind the SatCom business with growth of 43.0% following the start of the Syracuse IV program. However  all of these businesses remain exposed to the components shortage. The progress made by the SatCom business in the French market meant that the division regained a significant share of revenues in France  with 82.2%.2023 OUTLOOKReassured by the robustness of its order book and growing numbers of multi-year contracts  ACTIA Group continues to aim at revenues in excess of ‚Ç¨800 million by the end of 2025. For 2023  should there be no significant improvement in the supply situation  ACTIA could see growth of over 15%. The disposals made in 2022 and the buoyant business have helped to improve profitability  while working capital requirements continue to be under pressure due to the difficulties in the components market. Should certain covenants (gearing) not be complied with at 31 December 2022  ratios not yet established at the time of this release  in December ACTIA was granted waivers of the covenants by the banking partners in question (less than 20% of total debt).OEM: Original Equipment ManufacturerAftermarket: including maintenance and repairsMDS: Manufacturing Design & Services‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ABOUT ACTIAACTIA Group is a mid-market company (ETI) founded in 1986.

Prof. Hartmut J. Ehrlich  M.D.  CEO of Abivax said: ‚ÄúWe are excited to announce today‚Äôs successful pricing of Abivax‚Äôs oversubscribed capital increase of EUR 130M  with a balanced mix of top-tier existing and new investors  mostly US biotech specialists. We believe these new financial resources will allow us to move full steam ahead with our ongoing global clinical Phase 3 program of obefazimod for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The recruitment of patients for this program is ongoing in the U.S. and the study centers in Europe  Latin America and Asia Pacific are expected to start including patients in the weeks and months to come. Based on our consistent Phase 2a and Phase 2b data  we expect that the Phase 3 studies will support the short- and long-term efficacy and safety profile of obefazimod. The Abivax team is fully focused on making obefazimod rapidly accessible to all the patients in need.‚Äù Didier Blondel  CFO of Abivax  added: ‚ÄúWe are extremely pleased to announce our successful EUR 130M capital increase at market price. Abivax  once again  could attract new top-tier US and European biotech investors  including Great Point Partners  LLC  Deerfield Management Company  Commodore Capital  Samsara BioCapital  Boxer Capital and a few additional great names  as well as most of our existing US and European biotech investors. We believe this proves that Abivax and obefazimod are not only recognized within the scientific and medical communities  but also among very specialized financial investors who believe in the potential of obefazimod as an effective treatment option for chronic inflammatory diseases  starting with ulcerative colitis. Based on our current assumptions  our cash runway has been extended until the end of the second quarter of 2024. These new financial resources will be mainly used to continue our Phase 3 clinical program. Besides our ambition to confirm obefazimod‚Äôs potential as a long-lasting and effective treatment for patients in need  we continue to give particular attention to the maximization of shareholder value. We are committed to securing the full funding of our Phase 3 clinical program in due course through additional non-dilutive and dilutive financial resources.‚Äù Reasons for the issuance and use of the net proceeds of the Capital Increase  equal to EUR 123M The Company plans to use the net proceeds of the Capital Increase for the following (on an indicative basis): Launch and continuation of the clinical programs of obefazimod (ABX464)  the Company‚Äôs lead drug candidate in clinical development: For ulcerative colitis (‚Äú UC ‚Äù): continuation of the pivotal Phase 3 program  which was initiated in the first half of 2022 with the first patient enrolled in October 2022  and of the Phase 2a and 2b maintenance trials. The Phase 3 program will combine two induction trials and one single maintenance trial  involving a total of 1 200 patients and over 600 clinical study centers  mainly in North America  Europe  Latin America and Asia Pacific.‚Äù): continuation of the pivotal Phase 3 program  which was initiated in the first half of 2022 with the first patient enrolled in October 2022  and of the Phase 2a and 2b maintenance trials. The Phase 3 program will combine two induction trials and one single maintenance trial  involving a total of 1 200 patients and over 600 clinical study centers  mainly in North America  Europe  Latin America and Asia Pacific. Continuation of the research and development (‚ÄúR&D‚Äù) work on the compound's mechanism of action  nonclinical work  chemical and pharmaceutical development work  regulatory and pharmacovigilance activities for obefazimod  and the remaining clinical activities for obefazimod outside the ulcerative colitis indication (Phase 2a maintenance trial in rheumatoid arthritis (‚ÄúRA‚Äù) and various current and future Phase 1 trials necessary to prepare potential submissions for marketing authorizations for obefazimod); Approximately 80% of the net proceeds of the Capital Increase will be allocated to the development of obefazimod as per the above aspects (and primarily for the Phase 3 UC program);Financing of R&D and working capital and other general purposes of the Company  accounting for approximately 10% of the proceeds; andRedemption of (and payment of amounts payable pursuant to) existing indebtedness  accounting for approximately 10% of the proceeds (approximately EUR 12.7M split between EUR 8.9M paid under the Kreos loans  EUR 1.6M paid under the OCEANE convertible bonds  EUR 2.1M paid under the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale state guaranteed loan  and EUR 120K paid as reimbursement linked with the Ebola program financed by BPI). The Company expects that the proceeds from the Capital Increase will provide the Company with financial resources to fund its operations until the end of Q2 2024  based on a prioritization of its UC program. The Company certifies that  in its view  following the settlement-delivery of the new shares issued in the framework of the Capital Increase  the Company's financial resources will be sufficient to cover its net financing needs for the upcoming twelve months. The Company specifies that the additional financing needs required to complete its Phase 3 clinical program for obefazimod in UC until the end of 2024  which corresponds to the period during which the clinical results of the induction phase are expected  amount to approximately EUR 154M  thus requiring additional financing estimated at EUR 31M beyond the EUR 123M obtained in the framework of the Capital Increase. In addition  EUR 70M will be required to obtain clinical results for the maintenance phase of treatment planned for the end of 2025. Thus  the total amount of additional financing required to cover the Company's financial needs until the completion of the entire Phase 3 program for obefazimod in UC at the end of 2025 amounts to approximately EUR 224M before the completion of the Capital Increase  i.e.  EUR 101M in addition to the amounts financed by the Capital Increase. The above amounts also take into account the amounts required for the continuation of long-term maintenance studies for the Company's various programs (Phase 2a and 2b in UC and Phase 2a in RA)  other R&D expenses  general expenses  as well as the repayment of the Company‚Äôs existing loans over the periods considered. The financing requirements for the development of obefazimod in the treatment of UC detailed above are based solely on clinical and regulatory work. They do not include investments relating to the preparation of market access or the establishment of marketing and commercial resources necessary for the commercialization of the drug candidate. These costs have not been quantified by the Company at this stage. In order to meet the above-mentioned short- and medium-term financing needs  the Company is seeking to obtain  as soon as possible  one or more dilutive or non-dilutive financings that are the most favorable for the Company  depending on market conditions. In particular  the Company is considering the following alternatives: Carrying out one or more new capital increases  Entering into loan or issuing bonds; in particular Abivax has received a non-binding indicative offer from lenders  which is currently being evaluated by the Company  for the implementation of dilutive and non-dilutive financing for a total amount of up to EUR 45M. The implementation of this financing would be  in particular  conditional upon the prior repayment of the existing Kreos loans (approximately EUR 11M on the date hereof)  and/or Conclusion of regional licensing agreements for obefazimod  specifically targeting Asia. Key characteristics of the Capital Increase The New Shares are being issued through a capital increase  without existing shareholders‚Äô preferential subscription rights  reserved to a specified category of investors (investors in the pharma sector) pursuant to the 4th resolution of the Annual General Shareholders‚Äô Meeting held on November 9  2022.

Dechert LLP acted as legal advisor to the Company in connection with the Capital Increase. Cooley LLP and Gide acted as legal advisors to the financial advisors. Update on Company activities The Company has developed a portfolio of drug candidates targeting various inflammatory diseases. Its most advanced drug candidate  obefazimod  is in clinical development for the treatment of UC. The Company also plans to advance the clinical development of obefazimod in Crohn's disease (""CD"") and RA  subject to the availability of resources and funding. Historically  the Company‚Äôs research programs were organized into three distinct platforms (a ""Modulation of RNA Biogenesis"" platform  an ""Immune Stimulation"" platform and a ""Polyclonal Antibodies"" platform). To date  the Company is focusing its resources on the development of its Modulation of RNA biogenesis platform. In particular  the Company is focused on the anti-inflammatory field  from which its lead drug candidate  obefazimod (formerly named ABX464)  and the new drug candidate  ABX711  an active metabolite of obefazimod in early-stage development  have resulted. In the absence of progress on partnership research in the second half of 2022  the Company has decided to put the ABX196 program on hold. At this time  priority is given to the Phase 3 program in UC  which consists of an international trial of 1 200 patients suffering from moderate to severe UC at 600 investigator sites covering North America  Europe  Latin America and Asia Pacific. The Phase 3 program was initiated in the first half of 2022 and the first patient in the United States was enrolled on October 11  2022. Enrolment of the first patients in the other jurisdictions will take place during 2023. To the Company‚Äôs knowledge  obefazimod is the only small molecule drug candidate in clinical development with a mechanism of action that is designed to specifically induce the intracellular production of a microRNA called miR-124  a potent anti-inflammatory agent. In its Phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of UC  which included 252 patients across 17 different countries  obefazimod met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in the Modified Mayo Score  the standard measure of disease severity  as well as the secondary endpoints of endoscopic improvement  clinical response  clinical remission and reduction in fecal calprotectin  compared to placebo. Durable clinical remission was observed in the one-year maintenance studies  as well as clinical activity in patients already refractory to advanced therapies: of the 222 patients who completed the Phase 2b induction trial  217 (97.7%) participated in an open-label maintenance trial to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy profile of obefazimod for up to two years. After the first year of oral administration of obefazimod 50 mg once daily: (i) 119 patients (or 54.8%) of the 217 patients enrolled in the maintenance trial) were in clinical remission; and (ii) of the 124 patients with a clinical response after induction  82 (66.1%) achieved clinical remission. In addition  the safety and tolerability profile of obefazimod has been favorable to date  after more than 1 000 subjects have been treated as per November 30  2022  of which more than 200 subjects have been treated for at least one year  including over 150 subjects who received treatment for two years or more. The next steps envisaged for the Phase 3 program for obefazimod for the treatment of UC are (i) obtaining the first results of the induction trials at the end of 2024  (ii) obtaining the first results of the maintenance trial at the end of 2025  and (iii) submission of marketing authorization applications in Europe and the United States by 2026. At this stage  the Company's programs for obefazimod for the treatment of CD and RA are suspended until the necessary financing is obtained. The Company will seek such financing once it has been able to complete the financing of the entire Phase 3 program for UC. Therefore  the Company does not currently have an established timetable for the advancement of its programs for obefazimod for the treatment of CD and RA. The Company's primary objective is to develop and commercialize obefazimod for the treatment of inflammatory diseases  including UC. To achieve its objective  the key elements of the Company's strategy are as follows: Advance obefazimod through pivotal Phase 3 program for the treatment of UC Advance the clinical development of obefazimod in other inflammatory diseases  including CD and RA  subject to the availability of resources and funding Further develop relationships with manufacturing partners to continue to rapidly expand obefazimod manufacturing capabilities  andTo discover  develop and scale up future new drug candidates for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.

Net revenue for each Segment corresponds to the according Segment revenues less certain direct  order-related inter-Segment and external costs. Management reporting data excludes revenues from minor activities (primarily the Sonopress Business) outside Majorel Group‚Äôs core business which are reported in the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (the ‚ÄúSonopress Business‚Äù is defined as certain non-core business activities historically carried out by Arvato de Mexico  S.A. de C.V.  which was wound down in 2021).

With over ‚Ç¨ 50m in acquisitions and ‚Ç¨ 40m in disposals during the year  we demonstrated our capacity to carry out targeted acquisitions but also the good liquidity of our assets in line with appraisers values. Supported by a robust financial structure  and our confidence in delivering a sustainable growth  we will propose a distribution of a ‚Ç¨ 1.30 dividend per share  up by +4.0% compared to last year. ¬ª Operational performance In an uncertain economic context  characterized by inflation and the rise in interest rates  Patrimoine & Commerce saw its gross rental income increase by +8.3%  and maintained a very dynamic asset rotation strategy  with the acquisition of seven retail properties  and the disposal of eight assets during 2022. The retail park model proved its performance and alignment with current trends in consumption. Besides core strengths of the model (human-sized stores  easy car parking  limited service charges  adapted rents)  retail parks stand out with an activity not very dependent on tourism  focused on local consumption  open spaces and high attractivity for discount stores. Patrimoine & Commerce had a sustained leasing activity and signed 55 leases (of which 21 renewals). The financial occupancy rate is increasing and stands at 94.3% (5) on the portfolio. The collection rate on rents and service charges invoiced in 2022 stands at 98.1%. FFO increasing by +9.6% In 2022  Patrimoine & Commerce continued to deliver a solid financial performance. For the fiscal year ended December 31  2022  Patrimoine & Commerce reported consolidated gross rental income of ‚Ç¨ 47.3m  against ‚Ç¨ 43.7m for the fiscal year ended December 31  2021: in millions of euros - 12 months 31/12/2022 31/12/2021 Var. % Like-for-like 41.6 39.9 +4.3% Acquisitions 3.9 0.4 n.a Disposals 1.3 3.5 n.a Properties under restructuring 0.5 - n.a Gross rental income 47.3 43.7 +8.3% The increase of gross rental income is mainly explained by (i) the effect of the acquisitions and disposals made in 2021 and 2022 (ii) the delivery of restructuring operations on a property in Martinique and (iii) the like-for-like increase  driven by contractual indexation (2.5% in average on the period) and the decrease in the amortization of Covid-19 rent free periods. Net rental income stands at 93% of gross rental income (stable compared to 2021)  mainly composed of unrecovered rental expenses and provisions for credit losses: in millions of euros - 12 months 31/12/2022 31/12/2021 Var. % Gross rental income * 47.3 43.7 +8.3% Entry fees 0.0 0.2 n.a. Gross rental revenue 47.4 43.9 +7.8% Unrecovered rental expenses (2.7) (2.4) +9.8% Other building expenses (0.6) (0.7) n.a. Net rental income 44.2 40.8 +8.3% * incl. rental guarantees Operating expenses and other revenues remained under control at ‚Ç¨ 5.0m (vs. ‚Ç¨ 4.5m in 2021)  the increase derives from property management costs (leasing fees  asset management fees based on the evolution of rents). Net cost of debt amounted to ‚Ç¨ 9.5m in 2022  almost stable compared to last year (+0.7%). In a context of a rise in interest rates  the Company continues to benefit from the renegotiations carried out in the past years  as well as from the hedging of its debt portfolio. The average interest rate on debt is 2.07% for the 12 months ending December 31  2022 (versus 2.04% in 2021)  while 79% of the debt is either at fixed rate or at hedged variable rate. Recurring net result (FFO) amounted to ‚Ç¨ 29.3m in 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨ 26.7m in 2021: in millions of euros - 12 months 31/12/2022 31/12/2021 Var. % Restated current operational result 39.2 36.3 +7.9% Restated net cost of debt (9.5) (9.4) +0.7% Current taxes (0.4) (0.2) n.a. Funds from operations (FFO) (6) 29.3 26.7 +9.6% Diluted FFO per share 1.93 1.78 +8.6% The external appraisal valuation campaign resulted in a fair value adjustment of +‚Ç¨ 14.9m in 2022  reflecting the resilience of the portfolio in a context of high inflation and of sharp rise in interest rates. Including the share of the result of companies accounted for using the equity method (+‚Ç¨ 0.5m)  other non-recurring revenues and charges (-‚Ç¨ 1.4m)  and the contribution of hedging strategies on debt (+‚Ç¨ 2.8m)  net profit amounted to ‚Ç¨ 46.1m for the fiscal year 2022 and ‚Ç¨ 47.8m in group share  increasing by +51.7% compared to last year. Decrease of the LTV ratio and increase of the NAV per share at ‚Ç¨ 28.5 (+6.8%) The Group consolidated net debt of ‚Ç¨ 360.9m as of December 31  2022  implies a Loan-to-Value ratio of 44.0%  leaving a significant investment capacity compared to the target of 50% set by Patrimoine & Commerce. in millions of euros - 12 months 31/12/2022 31/12/2021 Net Debt 360.9 359.2 (-) other lease liabilities (0.6) (0.6) (+) deposits on real estate projects 0 0 (0.3) (-) financial instruments 2.2 (1.3) Restated Net debt 362.4 357.1 Property valuation (excl.

Those investments totalled ‚Ç¨ 53.6m in 2022. Other investments were made on the existing portfolio as well as on restructuring operations in Ville-du-Bois and La Martinique  for a global amount of ‚Ç¨ 8.2m. Patrimoine & Commerce also completed the disposal of several assets in Epagny (Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes)  Vitrolles (Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur)  Sarreguemines (Grand Est)  Parign√© L‚ÄôEv√™que (Pays-de-la-Loire)  Bourgoin-Jallieu (Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes)  Salon-de-Provence (Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur)  and an office property in Guadeloupe  for a total consideration of ‚Ç¨ 42.5m  in line with external appraisers‚Äô valuations. Dividend payment of ‚Ç¨ 1.30 per share The distribution of a dividend of ‚Ç¨ 1.30 per share will be proposed to the Annual General Meeting of Patrimoine & Commerce. The proposed dividend is increasing by +4.0% compared to last year and implies a 4.6% yield on net asset value per share as of December 31  2022  and of 7.9% on the current stock price as of February 21  2023.

In 2023  we also aim to bring new treatment options to people living with generalized myasthenia gravis. What guides us is our belief that everyone deserves to live the best live that they can "" Jean-Christophe Tellier  CEO UCB commented. ""Acting with focus and care  keeping our impact on society and the planet in mind  we are pleased with the progress we made towards our extra-financial targets  recognized by key ESG ratings. Together with our employees and partners we are working towards our strong long-term growth and our ambition to create value for all stakeholders  now and into the future."" 1 CER = constant exchange rates2 adj. EBITDA = adjusted Earnings Before Interest  Taxes  Depreciation and Amortization charges3 Core EPS = core earnings per share FY 2022 revenue reached ‚Ç¨ 5.52 billion (-4%; -7% CER1). Net sales reached ‚Ç¨ 5.14 billion (-6%; -8% CER1)  based on the continued growth of UCB's product portfolio and the newly acquired product FINTEPLA¬Æ. This was more than offset by the contracting effects of the loss of exclusivity of two products. Underlying profitability (adjusted EBITDA2) reached ‚Ç¨ 1.26 billion (-23%; -21% CER1)  reflecting lower revenue due to the loss of exclusivity and the integration of Zogenix  which explains higher total operating expenses. Strong cost discipline allowed the absorption of inflation costs. Marketing and selling expenses reflect investments behind ongoing and upcoming launches  research and development expenses reflect the pipeline progress. Higher other operating income was driven by EVENITY¬Æ. Profit decreased to ‚Ç¨ 418 million (-61%; -55% CER1). Core EPS3 were ‚Ç¨ 4.37 after ‚Ç¨ 6.49 in 2021. The Board of Directors of UCB proposes a dividend of ‚Ç¨ 1.33 per share (gross)  +2%. Sandrine Dufour  CFO UCB says: ""We are pleased to deliver 2022 financial results at the upper end of our financial guidance shared in June 2022. We successfully integrated Zogenix - diluting our earnings significantly but slightly less than anticipated. As expected  we're seeing the impacts from the loss of exclusivity for E KEPPRA¬Æ in Japan and VIMPAT¬Æ in the U.S. and Europe reflected in our topline. Smart resource allocation enabled us to invest behind the planned product launches and strong cost discipline mitigated the impacts from inflation. In 2023  although we will see the full annualized effect of the loss of exclusivity to VIMPAT¬Æ and the inflation costs  we will continue to invest behind multiple launches also benefiting from the Zogenix acquisition becoming earnings accretive."" Regulatory and Clinical Pipeline Update UCB continuously innovates and strives to find new ways to deliver solutions to people living with severe immunological and neurological diseases  leading in 2022 to an unprecedented regulatory and clinical pipeline  set to help people live their best possible lives. BimekizumabIn September 2022  the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted for regulatory review the two marketing authorization applications (MAA) for bimekizumab for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA)  and adult patients with active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). In May 2022  UCB announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding the Biologics License Application (BLA) for bimekizumab for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The letter indicated that the FDA could not approve the application in its current form and that certain pre-approval inspection observations of UCB's manufacturing site in Belgium must be resolved before approval of the application. The CRL is not related to efficacy nor to safety of bimekizumab. In November 2022  UCB announced that it had resubmitted the BLA to the FDA for bimekizumab for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. In December 2022  the FDA accepted the BLA resubmission for review. The FDA validated the resubmission as 'Class 2' with a six-month review period. UCB expects the FDA action in Q2 2023. In December 2022  UCB announced positive top-line results from two Phase 3 studies  BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II  evaluating the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). HS is a chronic  recurring  painful  and debilitating inflammatory skin disease. The two Phase 3 studies met their primary and key secondary endpoints with statistical significance and consistent clinical relevance. The positive results from these two studies will form the basis of global regulatory license application submissions for bimekizumab in hidradenitis suppurativa starting in Q3 2023. Brivaracetam In October 2022  UCB announced positive top-line results from the latest Phase 3 study of brivaracetam. The study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjunctive brivaracetam in participants from Asia (‚â•16 to 80 years of age) with partial epilepsy seizures with or without secondary generalization. The study met the primary and all secondary endpoints. UCB plans regulatory submissions in Japan in Q3 2023. FINTEPLA¬Æ (fenfluramine) In September 2022  FINTEPLA¬Æ (fenfluramine) oral solution was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome as an add-on therapy to other anti-epileptic medicines for patients 2 years of age and older. Fenfluramine will be marketed by Nippon Shinyaku Co.  Ltd. based on the exclusive sales agreement signed in 2019 between Zogenix Inc.  (acquired by UCB in 2022) and Nippon Shinyaku Co.  Ltd. UCB is now the Marketing Authorization holder. In December 2022  FINTEPLA¬Æ was recommended by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for marketing authorization in the European Union (EU) for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) as an add-on therapy to other anti-epileptic medicines for patients two years of age and older. In February 2023  UCB announced the European marketing authorization for FINTEPLA¬Æ (fenfluramine) in LGS. Additionally  the European Commission has also adopted the EMA Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) recommendation that the orphan designation for fenfluramine be maintained. ZilucoplanIn November 2022  the NDA and the MAA for zilucoplan  a self-administered (via subcutaneous injection) peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor)  were accepted by FDA and EMA  respectively  for review seeking approval for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are acetylcholine receptor antibody positive (AChR-Ab+). UCB expects to receive feedback from the agencies in Q4 2023. Doxecitine and doxribtimine (doxTM  MT1621) Doxecitine and doxribtimine (doxTM)  a dual substrate pyrimidine nucleoside enhancement therapy being developed for the treatment of patients with thymidine kinease 2 deficiency (TK2d)  an ultra-rare debilitating and life-threatening genetic mitochondrial disorder  causing progressive and severe muscle weakness. Following in-depth evaluation and alignment meetings with key regulatory agencies on the filing strategy for doxTM  regulatory submissions are now planned for H1 2024. Rozanolixizumab In January 2023  FDA accepted the filing and granted priority review for the BLA for rozanolixizumab - a subcutaneously infused monoclonal antibody targeting the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive. UCB expects to receive feedback from the FDA in Q2 2023. The FDA Priority Review designation follows the December 2022 EMA validation of the MAA for rozanolixizumab for the treatment of adults with AChR or MuSK antibody positive gMG. UCB expects to receive initial feedback for Europe in Q1/Q2 2024. In Q4 2022  UCB initiated a Phase 2a (proof-of-concept) study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rozanolixizumab to treat adult study participants with severe fibromyalgia syndrome. First topline results are expected in H2 2024. Fibromyalgia is a common  severe and debilitating disorder of unknown etiology characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain  fatigue  sleep disturbances  and mood disorders. Bepranemab is a recombinant  humanized  full-length immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal anti-tau antibody currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in partnership with Roche/Genentech. The efficacy  safety and tolerability of bepranemab in patients with early AD are investigated in a Phase 2 study  which started in Q2 2021. Recruitment for this study was completed ahead of time and topline results are now expected earlier  in Q4 2024. UCB0599 is an orally bioavailable and brain-barrier-penetrant small molecule that prevents the pathological misfolding and accumulation of alpha-synuclein  a protein which plays a key role in Parkinson's disease(PD) pathology. By inhibiting the disease-causing biology of alpha-synuclein misfolding  it is believed that the progression of PD can be slowed or halted. Under a global co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Novartis  UCB is conducting a phase 2a study with UCB0599 for study participants with early-stage PD. In 2022  an additional dosing arm was introduced into the study. Recruitment is complete and topline results are now expected in Q4 2024. UCB initiated Phase 1b studies in atopic dermatitis addressing two different targeted immune pathways with UCB9741 and UCB1381. These early studies evaluate the safety  pharmacokinetics and efficacy in people with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic condition that causes dry  itchy and inflamed skin and can affect people at all ages. All other clinical development programs are continuing as planned.Net sales break-down by productDue to rounding  some financial data may not add up in the tables.CIMZIA¬Æ (certolizumab pegol) reached 180 000 people living with inflammatory TNF-mediated diseases. CIMZIA is showing a stronger growth than the anti-TNF market - based on differentiation and driven by double-digit growth in the U.S. and Japan. CIMZIA has reached UCB's projected peak sales target of ‚Ç¨ two billion - ahead of time.VIMPAT¬Æ (lacosamide) was accessed by over 600 000 people living with epilepsy and is experiencing generic competition since end of March 2022 in the U.S. and since September 2022 in Europe due to loss of exclusivity in these two regions. In Japan and international markets  the net sales show continued solid growth. KEPPRA¬Æ (levetiracetam) reached over 1.8 million people living with epilepsy. The generic erosion due to loss of exclusivity in Japan started early January 2022 and was stronger than expected due to multiple generics and governmental support for generic levetiracetam. Also  in the U.S. and Europe the performance is reflecting generic competition. BRIVIACT¬Æ (brivaracetam)  was used by 190 000 people living with epilepsy and showed significant growth in all regions. Briviact¬Æ has a different mode of action from Vimpat¬Æ and differentiates from Keppra¬Æ. NEUPRO¬Æ (rotigotine)  the patch for Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome  used by over 340000 patients  recorded stable net sales in a competitive market environment. FINTEPLA¬Æ (fenfluramine) is now part of the UCB epilepsy portfolio thanks to the completed acquisition of Zogenix  Inc. in early March and reached more than 1 000 patients and their families. FINTEPLA¬Æ is approved for seizures associated with rare epileptic syndromes  Dravet (since mid-2020) in U.S. Europe and Lennox Gastaut syndrome (since late March 2022) in the U.S.  providing new treatment options for patients and families living with these rare syndromes that are particularly challenging to treat. Net sales (March - December) were ‚Ç¨ 116 million. The integration of Zogenix was successfully completed as planned by the end of 2022. NAYZILAM¬Æ (midazolam) Nasal SprayCIV  a nasal rescue treatment for epilepsy seizure clusters in the U.S. reached over 90 000 patients and net sales of ‚Ç¨ 78 million  a plus by 36% (+21% CER). BIMZELX¬Æ (bimekizumab) reached over 4 000 people living with psoriasis and is being launched throughout Europe  the UK  Japan  Canada and further countries. Net sales were ‚Ç¨ 35 million (after ‚Ç¨ 4 million in 2021). For the U.S.  the regulatory review is ongoing with an expected decision by the U.S. authority in Q2 2023. EVENITY¬Æ (romosozumab) since launch globally reached more than 400 000 women living with severe postmenopausal osteoporosis at high risk of fracture. Net sales increased to ‚Ç¨ 25 million after ‚Ç¨ 10 million in 2021. It had its first European launch in March 2020 and was impacted by the pandemic since then. EVENITY¬Æ is being launched successfully globally by Amgen  Astellas and UCB since 2019  with net sales outside Europe reported by the partners. 2022 FY financial highlightsDue to rounding  some financial data may not add up in the tables. ""The statutory auditor has issued an unqualified report with no emphasis of matter paragraph dated 21 February 2023 on the company's consolidated accounts as of and for the year ended 31 December 2022  and has confirmed that the accounting data reported in the accompanying press release is consistent  in all material respects  with the accounts from which it has been derived."" Revenue in 2022 reached ‚Ç¨ 5 517 million (-4%; -7% CER1) and net sales were ‚Ç¨ 5 140 million (-6%; -8% CER1). This was driven by the continued growth of UCB's product portfolio - namely CIMZIA¬Æ  BRIVIACT¬Æ  NAYZILAM¬Æ; EVENITY¬Æ as well as newly launched BIMZELX¬Æ - and the addition of FINTEPLA¬Æ. This performance was slightly over-compensated by the effects of the loss of exclusivity for VIMPAT¬Æ in the U.S. and Europe and E KEPPRA¬Æ in Japan. Royalty income and fees were ‚Ç¨ 85 million (+8%; -3% CER1) and other revenue went up by 28% (+24% CER1) to ‚Ç¨ 292 million due to milestones and other payments from R&D partners and include a one-time amount of ‚Ç¨ 70 million from sale of intellectual property rights (olokizumab). Gross profit before ""amortization of intangible assets linked to sales"" was ‚Ç¨ 4 239 million (-6%; -7% CER1) and in-line with the net sales performance. The adjusted gross margin is 76.8% after 77.7% in 2021.Gross profit after ""amortization of intangible assets linked to sales"" reached ‚Ç¨ 3 843 million - a gross margin of 69.7% after 75.1% in 2021 and reflecting the addition of FINTEPLA¬Æ amortization. Operating expenses increased to ‚Ç¨ 3 168 million (+5%; +1 CER1) reflecting higher expenses due to the addition and integration of Zogenix. Strong cost discipline allowed the absorption of inflation costs. Operating expenses are consisting of: marketing and selling expenses of ‚Ç¨ 1 489 million (+11%; +3% CER 1 ) - focused reallocation and cost discipline allowed to invest behind the launches and pre-launch activities for 2023: global FINTEPLA ¬Æ launch activities  global BIMZELX ¬Æ launch activities as well as ongoing preparations for a launch in the U.S.  global pre-launch activities for rozanolixizumab and zilucoplan for people living with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) and EVENITY ¬Æ ongoing launches throughout Europe.research and development expenses of ‚Ç¨ 1 670 million (+3%; 0% CER 1 ) reflecting the continued investments in UCB's progressing pipeline which resulted in several ongoing regulatory reviews: bimekizumab (several indications)  rozanolixizumab  zilucoplan and FINTEPLA ¬Æ . During 2022  6 phase 3 programs and 3 phase 2 programs were ongoing as well as earlier clinical development  3 new programs were added to the clinical pipeline. The decision to terminate the clinical development in ITP led to termination costs of ‚Ç¨ 46 million in 2022. The R&D ratio reached 30% in 2022 after 28% in 2021.general and administrative expenses of ‚Ç¨ 225 million (+9%; +6%)  due to the integration of Zogenixother operating income of ‚Ç¨ 216 million following ‚Ç¨ 162 million in 2021 - driven by an income of ‚Ç¨ 240 million (+59%) reflecting the net contribution from Amgen in connection with the commercialization of EVENITY¬Æ. This was partly compensated by write-offs on receivables. Underlying operational profitability - adjusted EBITDA2 - reached ‚Ç¨ 1 260 million (-23%; +21% CER1) driven by decreased revenue and increased operating expenses  reflecting the investments into the future growth of UCB  namely into product launches and ongoing clinical development. The adjusted EBITDA ratio for 2022 (in % of revenue) reached 22.8%  after 28.4% in 2021. Total impairment  restructuring and other expenses increased to ‚Ç¨ 90 million  after ‚Ç¨ 34 million in 2021. This was mainly driven by fees and restructuring expenses related to the acquisition of Zogenix in March 2022. Net financial expenses went up to ‚Ç¨ 74 million from ‚Ç¨ 58 million  based on higher interest rates as well as higher interest cost due to higher net debt in connection with the acquisition of Zogenix. Income tax expenses were ‚Ç¨ 91 million compared to ‚Ç¨ 170 million in 2021. The average effective tax rate was 17.8% compared to 13.9% in 2021  reflecting the lower earnings and earnings mix. Profit amounted to ‚Ç¨ 418 million (-61%; -55% CER1). Reflecting lower revenue due to the loss of exclusivity and higher operating expenses driven by launch activities and launch preparations for the 2023 potential launches. Core earnings per share  which reflect profit attributable to UCB shareholders  adjusted for the after-tax impact of to be adjusted items  the financial one-offs  the after-tax contribution from discontinued operations and the net amortization of intangibles linked to sales  reached ‚Ç¨ 4.37 after ‚Ç¨ 6.49 in 2021  based on stable 190 million weighted average shares outstanding. Dividend - The Board of Directors of UCB proposes a dividend of ‚Ç¨1.33 per share (gross)  +2%. Guidance 2023: The year 2023 will be marked by ongoing launches and several upcoming launches in the U.S. and Europe - subject to regulatory approvals. At the same time UCB is impacted by the full annualized and ongoing generic erosion to VIMPAT¬Æ. For 2023  UCB expects revenues in the range of ‚Ç¨ 5.15 - 5.35 billion based on expected launch contributions like the expected mid-year U.S. launch of bimekizumab for people living with psoriasis and taking into account the full annualized negative impacts from the loss of exclusivity for VIMPAT¬Æ in the U.S. and Europe as well as based on continued solid contribution from the existing product portfolio. UCB will continue to invest in upcoming launches to offer potential new solutions for people living with severe diseases and remains committed to invest into research and development advancing its late-stage development pipeline. UCB will also continue to execute strong cost discipline  sell non-core assets and manage the significant impact of inflation in 2023. At the same time  the integration of the Zogenix acquisition will become earnings accretive during 2023. Underlying profitability  adjusted EBITDA  is expected in the range of 22.5 - 23.5% of revenue. Core earnings per share are therefore expected in the range of ‚Ç¨ 3.40 - 3.80 per share-based on an average of 190 million shares outstanding. The figures for the financial guidance 2023 as mentioned above are calculated on the same basis as the actual figures for 2022. Guidance for 2025 confirmed: UCB confirms its growth ambition for 2025. Based on the strong product portfolio and the promising assets currently under regulatory review - leading to multiple expected launches in all geographies. UCB aims to lead in five specific populations by 2025  creating value for patients now and into the future.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of pandemics (such as COVID-19)  wars on territories where UCB has businesses  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB' efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release  either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based  unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.Additionally  information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities  nor shall there be any offer  solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.Asset Download UCB Press Release FY 2022 final ENG UCB Press Release FY 2022 final NL UCB Press Release FY 2022 final FR 0 Like Attachments Original LinkOriginal DocumentPermalink Disclaimer UCB SA published this content on 22 February 2023 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

Adjusted for changes in the consolidation scope and at constant currency exchange rates  turnover for the half-year ended 31 December 2022 was up with a solid 4.8% organic sales growth. Sales growth in France of 4.2% is mainly supported by volume growth and medical purchases rechargeable revenue  despite the ongoing shift towards ambulatory care. In the Nordics countries  organics sales grew at 6.4% for the semester on a constant exchange rate basis. The impact of past acquisitions  including GHP  amounts to ‚Ç¨117.6m of additional revenues  or 19% of extra growth for the Nordics countries.Decrease in the reported EBITDA under IFRS16 of 6.8%  to ‚Ç¨312.7m (last year ‚Ç¨335.4m) with a margin of 14.2% (last year 16.5%). EBITDA and margin were mainly driven by the negative trend on inflation and the resources invested to support our medical staff. Recent acquisitions have contributed ‚Ç¨12.4m to the overall half-year EBITDA  in line with our acquisition business plan. The revenue guarantee scheme put in place by the French government resulted in additional revenue of ‚Ç¨62 million (same as last half-year) in the half-year ended 31 December 2022. Ramsay Sant√© was eligible to receive support from the French government regarding inflation of procurement and salary for a total consideration of ‚Ç¨45.6m  which did not fully cover it  however.Net profit for the Group share was ‚Ç¨43.9m  2.0% of turnover (last year ‚Ç¨59.6m and 2.9% of turnover)  impacted by lower operational margins and reflecting increased funding costs.Total capital expenditure for the last 6 months was ‚Ç¨110m  slightly below last year  including maintenance and optimisation  as well as improvement on our portfolio of clinics. This covers the ongoing maternity expansion of St G√∂ran as well as significant effort to roll out our strategy to increase Ramsay Sant√©‚Äôs imaging assets portfolio  to invest on digital tools  amongst which the new version of the Ramsay Services portal  and on new equipment such as surgical robots for our French clinics.Net financial debt at the end of 31 December 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨3 820m  including ‚Ç¨2 143m of IFRS16 lease liabilities. During the first semester of this fiscal year  Ramsay Sant√© successfully completed the issuance of a new Fiducie tranche for ‚Ç¨150m. The group has as well participated in a real estate project involving one of our clinics in Olso  Norway.Net cash increased by ‚Ç¨97.5m over the period with a ‚Ç¨194.5m contribution from increased borrowings. The cash flow from operating activities was unfavourably impacted by the phasing of the payment related to the various subsidies.Ramsay Sant√© has continued to invest in initiatives in line with its Yes We Care 2025 strategy  and expect that this strategy will lead to a capex consumption trend in H2 FY23 similar to H1 FY23Finally  discussions are ongoing regarding the potential extension of a modified French revenue guarantee scheme under which the government may prolong its support to the industry  although with a mechanism reducing over time.Pascal Roch√©  Chief Executive Officer of Ramsay Sant√©  says: ‚ÄúRamsay Sant√© has continued to play a major role in complementing public hospitals in Europe over the past six months. With the management of 5.8 million patient visits  up 18%  the ‚ÄúYes We Care 2025‚Äù strategy of providing patients with physical and digital health solutions to coordinate pathways  is more relevant than ever  and implementation is on plan. Revenue grew by 8.4% over the period and operating margin fell by 6.8% due to inflation  which affects all costs. Finally  the integration of acquisitions  notably GHP  made last year  is in line with expectations.‚Äù The Board of Directors that met on 22 February 2023 approved the consolidated financial statements for the six-month period ended 31 December 2022. The consolidated financial statements have been subject to a limited review by the statutory auditors.

France In France  private hospitals have continued to actively participate in the national plan to combat theCOVID-19 epidemic in conjunction with and in support of public hospitals. Depending on the evolution of the health situation during surges of COVID-19 as well as other seasonal viruses prevalent in autumn and winter  the activity of private hospitals was carried out under more or less normal conditions. Ramsay Sant√© has continued to participate in the effort of caring for COVID-19 patients with more than 4 000 patients treated in France  including 1 600 in critical care. As other public and private hospital providers  Ramsay Sant√© has continued to operate for the full six-month period under the French Government‚Äôs revenue guarantee which was extended to 31 December 2022. The provisions of the revenue guarantee are similar to that in place in the prior corresponding period except for the mental health activities which are now out of its scope due to their new bundled payment funding structure. In addition to the revenue guarantee scheme  the government has throughout the pandemic also prolonged the funding of healthcare facilities to compensate the additional costs related to the COVID-19 epidemic that would not otherwise be covered. Nordic s : The group‚Äôs facilities in Scandinavia have actively participated in the care of COVID-19 patients as well as in the screening and vaccination of the population  in support of public institutions and in close collaboration with the supervisory authorities. The positive development in adding listed patients into our Proximity care business has continued in both Sweden and Denmark through a dedicated work to improve both availably and attractivity in our facilities. Patient demand in our Specialist and Orthopedic businesses in all countries has been increasing. The integration of the newly acquired GHP business is progressing according to plan and synergies have been realised as expected to date. Finally  during the period two new geriatric contracts were awarded in Sweden for a period of 4+4 years representing an annual turnover of approximately ‚Ç¨50m (SEK500m)  starting in May 2023. Scope of consolidation During the first six months of the current financial year Ramsay Sant√© has completed one small bolt-on acquisition in the Nordics. Compared to the prior corresponding period  this half-year included the full contribution of the 8 acquisitions completed throughout FY22. Comments on the half-year accounts Activity and turnover: In the six-month period 1st July 2022 to 31st December 2022  Ramsay Sant√© Group reported a consolidated turnover of ‚Ç¨2 209.5m  compared with ‚Ç¨2 037.7m for the prior corresponding period  up 8.4%. On a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates  the Group's sales increased by 4.8 % despite 2 less working days than the same period last year in France. France For the six-month period ending 31 December 2022  Ramsay Sant√©'s French total the number of patient admissions increased on last year by 2.2%. The breakdown by business line is as follows: +1.2% in Medicine  Surgery and Obstetrics+11.6% in Follow-up Care and Rehabilitation-0.6% in Mental HealthRevenue growth in France of 4.2% is mainly supported by this activity growth but also by an increase in revenue from rechargeable medical purchases  and despite the ongoing shift towards ambulatory care. In March 2022  average tariff increase was set for the year at 0.7% for the French market. For Ramsay Sant√© and given its care mix  the average increase was at 0.1%  including the ability for the French government to adjust this evolution by up to 0.7pt downwards under certain conditions (‚Äúthe prudential coefficient‚Äù). Only half of the prudential coefficient on the 2022 tariffed revenue was released in December 2022 versus a full release in 2021. This decision means that the 2022 prices were in fact a ‚Äì 0.2% reduction from the prior year  applied to our mix of activities. The 3 Nordics countries Revenue growth in the Nordics of 18.5% was mainly from the impact of the latest acquisitions that have represented ‚Ç¨117m of additional revenue during the last 6-month period. A ‚Ç¨(44)m negative foreign exchange impact on Nordics revenue partially offsets this growth. Organic sales growth in the Group's Nordic activities for the first six-month of the financial year was +6.4% compared to last year  arising mainly from our primary care and specialist clinics in Sweden and Denmark. EBITDA Group EBITDA reached ‚Ç¨312.7m (last year ‚Ç¨335.4m) for the six-month period ended 31 December 2022  down ‚Äì 6.8% on a reported basis. It includes a ‚Ç¨8.3m EBITDA contribution from Nordics acquisitions and a ‚Ç¨(4.3)m unfavourable FX variance impact. On a like-for-like basis  at constant consolidation scope and exchange rates  EBITDA for the group therefore reduces by ‚Äì 8.0% compared to December 2021. The EBITDA margin as a percentage of sales was 14.2%  down from 16.5% for the same period last year on a reported basis  or 14.5% this half-year versus 16.5% on a constant scope and foreign exchange rate basis. This decrease reflects the impact of the effort made on the compensations and benefits made to our medical staff and the impact of the inflation on our medical purchases and indirect costs. Such impacts have not been fully mitigated by the level of subsidies received or the upsides of our productivity measures. Grants Group EBITDA for the six-month period that ended 31 December 2022 includes ‚Ç¨62m (last year ‚Ç¨62m as well) related to the French revenue guarantee scheme  which has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements of the group as ‚ÄúOther operating income‚Äù. This line also includes Covid costs compensation and support grants from the French government for ‚Ç¨20m (last year ‚Ç¨32m).As there is a timing delay between when the costs are incurred in the business and when the regional health agencies notify our facilities  a large part of the subsidies accounted for in the six-month period relates to the period prior to the current financial year  a similar situation to the comparable six-month period last year. The whole amount recognized in the current six-month period of ‚Ç¨20m (last year ‚Ç¨27.5m) relate to the preceding financial year. In addition to those Covid-related subsidies  specific grants totalling of ‚Ç¨46m were extended to the French facilities to fund inflation that had not been sized in the applicable tariffs  as well as national healthcare staff salary increases applicable from 1st July 2022. Conversely in the Nordics countries  Covid-related compensation grants and additional revenues have been significantly lower than in the previous period negatively impacting results and margins compared to the previous period. In total  the amount of aid received by our facilities in Sweden was ‚Ç¨8.7m in the period  compared to ‚Ç¨15.5m in the previous period. Personnel costs Personnel costs increase due to inflationary pressures that have to date only been partially compensated by government funding. French minimum wage has been lifted by 8.0% from successive increases effective from October 2021 to August 2022. Concomitantly  the French national private healthcare employee award lifted the minimum award wages by 3%  for which we have received subsidies from the government  and raised the penalty rates for night  weekend and public holiday time by 50%  effective 1st July 2022. In addition  specific salary revalorisation for midwifes and critical care nurses also took effect with the corresponding funding. Attractivity and retention measures in favour of hospital personnel and shortage of certain staff categories resulting in a higher use of agency staff also added to the inflationary burden across our different geographies. For these areas targeted actions have been initiated to improve the situation over time. Current Operating Result Current operating result amounted to ‚Ç¨113.1m (last year ‚Ç¨149.1m) for the first six-month period representing a current operating margin of 5.1% (last year 7.3%)  down 24.1% over the previous period primarily from inflation pressure. Non-recurring items Other non-current income and expenses net to a profit of ‚Ç¨21.6m (last year ‚Ç¨2.3m) for the six-month period ended 31 December 2022  including a ‚Ç¨29.2m profit on the sale of the land and car parks adjacent to one of our hospital in Oslo. Financial result The cost of net financial debt amounted to ‚Ç¨68.7m (last year 59.9m) for the six-month period ended 31 December 2022. The increase in the cost of funding results from new borrowings bearing interest over this period compared to the half-year closed December 2021  namely the Euro PP ‚Ç¨100m bond issued in December 2021 and the new Fiducie Suret√© ‚Ç¨150m tranche drawn in July 2022  as well as an uptick in margins and floating rates. Other financial expenses and income include a positive mark-to market valuation of our interest rate derivatives offset by the interest expense recognised upon the sale of long-term receivables. Group‚Äôs share of net profit reached ‚Ç¨43.9 million (last year ‚Ç¨59.6 million) for the six-month period that ended 31 December 2022. Financing: Net financial debt as of 31 December 2022 increased to ‚Ç¨3 820m compared with ‚Ç¨3 710m as of 30 June 2022  and has been negatively impacted by the timing of payments of various grants accrued over the period.Net debt includes ‚Ç¨1 916 million in non-current borrowings and ‚Ç¨52 million in current borrowings  offset by ‚Ç¨221 million in cash and cash equivalents. IFRS 16 leases debt amounts to ‚Ç¨2 143 million including ‚Ç¨1 935 million in non-current lease debt and ‚Ç¨208 million in current lease debt. During this half-year period  Ramsay Sant√© has strengthened its financing structure thanks to an additional ‚Ç¨150m tranche of its Fiducie Suret√©. The Group complies with all commitments relating to the financial documentation in place. The application of IFRS 16 has no effect on the methods used to calculate the financial aggregates referred to in these debt agreements.

Adjusted for changes in the consolidation scope and at constant currency exchange rates  turnover for the half-year ended 31 December 2022 was up with a solid 4.8% organic sales growth. Sales growth in France of 4.2% is mainly supported by volume growth and medical purchases rechargeable revenue  despite the ongoing shift towards ambulatory care. In the Nordics countries  organics sales grew at 6.4% for the semester on a constant exchange rate basis. The impact of past acquisitions  including GHP  amounts to ‚Ç¨117.6m of additional revenues  or 19% of extra growth for the Nordics countries.Decrease in the reported EBITDA under IFRS16 of 6.8%  to ‚Ç¨312.7m (last year ‚Ç¨335.4m) with a margin of 14.2% (last year 16.5%). EBITDA and margin were mainly driven by the negative trend on inflation and the resources invested to support our medical staff. Recent acquisitions have contributed ‚Ç¨12.4m to the overall half-year EBITDA  in line with our acquisition business plan. The revenue guarantee scheme put in place by the French government resulted in additional revenue of ‚Ç¨62 million (same as last half-year) in the half-year ended 31 December 2022. Ramsay Sant√© was eligible to receive support from the French government regarding inflation of procurement and salary for a total consideration of ‚Ç¨45.6m  which did not fully cover it  however.Net profit for the Group share was ‚Ç¨43.9m  2.0% of turnover (last year ‚Ç¨59.6m and 2.9% of turnover)  impacted by lower operational margins and reflecting increased funding costs.Total capital expenditure for the last 6 months was ‚Ç¨110m  slightly below last year  including maintenance and optimisation  as well as improvement on our portfolio of clinics. This covers the ongoing maternity expansion of St G√∂ran as well as significant effort to roll out our strategy to increase Ramsay Sant√©‚Äôs imaging assets portfolio  to invest on digital tools  amongst which the new version of the Ramsay Services portal  and on new equipment such as surgical robots for our French clinics.Net financial debt at the end of 31 December 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨3 820m  including ‚Ç¨2 143m of IFRS16 lease liabilities. During the first semester of this fiscal year  Ramsay Sant√© successfully completed the issuance of a new Fiducie tranche for ‚Ç¨150m. The group has as well participated in a real estate project involving one of our clinics in Olso  Norway.Net cash increased by ‚Ç¨97.5m over the period with a ‚Ç¨194.5m contribution from increased borrowings. The cash flow from operating activities was unfavourably impacted by the phasing of the payment related to the various subsidies.Ramsay Sant√© has continued to invest in initiatives in line with its Yes We Care 2025 strategy  and expect that this strategy will lead to a capex consumption trend in H2 FY23 similar to H1 FY23Finally  discussions are ongoing regarding the potential extension of a modified French revenue guarantee scheme under which the government may prolong its support to the industry  although with a mechanism reducing over time.Pascal Roch√©  Chief Executive Officer of Ramsay Sant√©  says:‚ÄúRamsay Sant√© has continued to play a major role in complementing public hospitals in Europe over the past six months. With the management of 5.8 million patient visits  up 18%  the ‚ÄúYes We Care 2025‚Äù strategy of providing patients with physical and digital health solutions to coordinate pathways  is more relevant than ever  and implementation is on plan. Revenue grew by 8.4% over the period and operating margin fell by 6.8% due to inflation  which affects all costs. Finally  the integration of acquisitions  notably GHP  made last year  is in line with expectations.‚ÄùThe Board of Directors that met on 22 February 2023 approved the consolidated financial statements for the six-month period ended 31 December 2022. The consolidated financial statements have been subject to a limited review by the statutory auditors.Synthetic resultsP&L ‚Äì in ‚Ç¨ millions From 1 July 2022 to 31 December 2022 from 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2021 Variation Turnover 2 209.5 2 037.7 +8.4% EBITDA 312.7 335.4 (6.8)% As a % of Turnover 14.2% 16.5% (2.3) point Current Operating Result 113.1 149.1 (24.1)% As a % of Turnover 5.1% 7.3% (2.2) point Operating Result 134.7 151.4 (11.0)% As a % of Turnover 6.1% 7.4% (1.3) point Net income  Group share 43.9 59.6 (26.3)% Earnings per share (in ‚Ç¨) 0.40 0.54 (26.4)%Net Financial Debt ‚Äì in ‚Ç¨ millions 31 December 2022 30 June 2022 Non-current financial liabilities 1 916.4 1 763.6 Non-current lease liability 1 935.3 1 922.3 Current lease liability 207.5 196.0 Current financial liabilities 52.1 35.4 (Cash and cash equivalents) (220.9) (132.5) Other financial assets & liabilities (70.0) (74.9) Net financial debt 3 820.4 3 709.9Cash Flow Statement ‚Äì in ‚Ç¨ millions From 1 July 2022 to 31 December 2022 from 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2021 EBITDA 312.7 335.4 Change in Working Capital requirements (83.5) (291.4) Net cash flow from operating activities 183.6 23.8 Net cash flow used in investing activities (96.9) (131.4) Net cash flow from/(used in) financing activities 10.8 (92.3) Change in net cash position 97.5 (199.9) Closing cash and cash equivalents 220.9 408.1Breakdown of revenue by operating segmentEn M‚Ç¨ From 1 July 2022 to 31 December 2022 from 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2021 Variation √éle-de-France 517.9 497.3 4.1% Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes 295.2 275.2 7.3% Hauts de France 190.9 190.0 0.5% Occitanie 134.8 131.0 2.9% Other regions 349.1 335.4 4.1% Nordics countries 721.6 608.8 18.5% Published Turnover 2 209.5 2 037.7 8.4%Note: the table above details the contributions of the main operating segments to the Group's consolidated revenue.Changes in reported turnover from the half- year ended 3 1 December 202 1 to the half-year ended31 December 2022.Reported Turnover31 December 2021 Changes in foreign exchange rates Acquisitions and disposals Organic growth Reported turnover31 December 2022 Variation In ‚Ç¨ millions 2 037.7 (44.0) 117.6 98.1 2 209.5 171.7 (2.2%) 5.8% 4.8% 8.4%Significant events of the financial year:Healthcare market evolution includ ing COVID-19 health crisisThe six-month period ending 31 December 2022 continued to be impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic in all countries in which the Group operates  albeit at a markedly lower intensity level compared to crisis peaks experienced in prior periods.FranceIn France  private hospitals have continued to actively participate in the national plan to combat theCOVID-19 epidemic in conjunction with and in support of public hospitals. Depending on the evolution of the health situation during surges of COVID-19 as well as other seasonal viruses prevalent in autumn and winter  the activity of private hospitals was carried out under more or less normal conditions.Ramsay Sant√© has continued to participate in the effort of caring for COVID-19 patients with more than 4 000 patients treated in France  including 1 600 in critical care.As other public and private hospital providers  Ramsay Sant√© has continued to operate for the full six-month period under the French Government‚Äôs revenue guarantee which was extended to 31 December 2022. The provisions of the revenue guarantee are similar to that in place in the prior corresponding period except for the mental health activities which are now out of its scope due to their new bundled payment funding structure. In addition to the revenue guarantee scheme  the government has throughout the pandemic also prolonged the funding of healthcare facilities to compensate the additional costs related to the COVID-19 epidemic that would not otherwise be covered.Nordic s :The group‚Äôs facilities in Scandinavia have actively participated in the care of COVID-19 patients as well as in the screening and vaccination of the population  in support of public institutions and in close collaboration with the supervisory authorities.The positive development in adding listed patients into our Proximity care business has continued in both Sweden and Denmark through a dedicated work to improve both availably and attractivity in our facilities. Patient demand in our Specialist and Orthopedic businesses in all countries has been increasing. The integration of the newly acquired GHP business is progressing according to plan and synergies have been realised as expected to date. Finally  during the period two new geriatric contracts were awarded in Sweden for a period of 4+4 years representing an annual turnover of approximately ‚Ç¨50m (SEK500m)  starting in May 2023.Scope of consolidationDuring the first six months of the current financial year Ramsay Sant√© has completed one small bolt-on acquisition in the Nordics. Compared to the prior corresponding period  this half-year included the full contribution of the 8 acquisitions completed throughout FY22.Comments on the half-year accountsActivity and turnover:In the six-month period 1st July 2022 to 31st December 2022  Ramsay Sant√© Group reported a consolidated turnover of ‚Ç¨2 209.5m  compared with ‚Ç¨2 037.7m for the prior corresponding period  up 8.4%. On a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates  the Group's sales increased by 4.8 % despite 2 less working days than the same period last year in France.FranceFor the six-month period ending 31 December 2022  Ramsay Sant√©'s French total the number of patient admissions increased on last year by 2.2%. The breakdown by business line is as follows:+1.2% in Medicine  Surgery and Obstetrics+11.6% in Follow-up Care and Rehabilitation-0.6% in Mental HealthRevenue growth in France of 4.2% is mainly supported by this activity growth but also by an increase in revenue from rechargeable medical purchases  and despite the ongoing shift towards ambulatory care.In March 2022  average tariff increase was set for the year at 0.7% for the French market. For Ramsay Sant√© and given its care mix  the average increase was at 0.1%  including the ability for the French government to adjust this evolution by up to 0.7pt downwards under certain conditions (‚Äúthe prudential coefficient‚Äù). Only half of the prudential coefficient on the 2022 tariffed revenue was released in December 2022 versus a full release in 2021. This decision means that the 2022 prices were in fact a ‚Äì 0.2% reduction from the prior year  applied to our mix of activities.The 3 Nordics countriesRevenue growth in the Nordics of 18.5% was mainly from the impact of the latest acquisitions that have represented ‚Ç¨117m of additional revenue during the last 6-month period. A ‚Ç¨(44)m negative foreign exchange impact on Nordics revenue partially offsets this growth. Organic sales growth in the Group's Nordic activities for the first six-month of the financial year was +6.4% compared to last year  arising mainly from our primary care and specialist clinics in Sweden and Denmark.EBITDAGroup EBITDA reached ‚Ç¨312.7m (last year ‚Ç¨335.4m) for the six-month period ended 31 December 2022  down ‚Äì 6.8% on a reported basis. It includes a ‚Ç¨8.3m EBITDA contribution from Nordics acquisitions and a ‚Ç¨(4.3)m unfavourable FX variance impact. On a like-for-like basis  at constant consolidation scope and exchange rates  EBITDA for the group therefore reduces by ‚Äì 8.0% compared to December 2021.The EBITDA margin as a percentage of sales was 14.2%  down from 16.5% for the same period last year on a reported basis  or 14.5% this half-year versus 16.5% on a constant scope and foreign exchange rate basis. This decrease reflects the impact of the effort made on the compensations and benefits made to our medical staff and the impact of the inflation on our medical purchases and indirect costs. Such impacts have not been fully mitigated by the level of subsidies received or the upsides of our productivity measures.GrantsGroup EBITDA for the six-month period that ended 31 December 2022 includes ‚Ç¨62m (last year ‚Ç¨62m as well) related to the French revenue guarantee scheme  which has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements of the group as ‚ÄúOther operating income‚Äù. This line also includes Covid costs compensation and support grants from the French government for ‚Ç¨20m (last year ‚Ç¨32m).As there is a timing delay between when the costs are incurred in the business and when the regional health agencies notify our facilities  a large part of the subsidies accounted for in the six-month period relates to the period prior to the current financial year  a similar situation to the comparable six-month period last year. The whole amount recognized in the current six-month period of ‚Ç¨20m (last year ‚Ç¨27.5m) relate to the preceding financial year.In addition to those Covid-related subsidies  specific grants totalling of ‚Ç¨46m were extended to the French facilities to fund inflation that had not been sized in the applicable tariffs  as well as national healthcare staff salary increases applicable from 1st July 2022.Conversely in the Nordics countries  Covid-related compensation grants and additional revenues have been significantly lower than in the previous period negatively impacting results and margins compared to the previous period. In total  the amount of aid received by our facilities in Sweden was ‚Ç¨8.7m in the period  compared to ‚Ç¨15.5m in the previous period.Personnel costsPersonnel costs increase due to inflationary pressures that have to date only been partially compensated by government funding. French minimum wage has been lifted by 8.0% from successive increases effective from October 2021 to August 2022. Concomitantly  the French national private healthcare employee award lifted the minimum award wages by 3%  for which we have received subsidies from the government  and raised the penalty rates for night  weekend and public holiday time by 50%  effective 1st July 2022. In addition  specific salary revalorisation for midwifes and critical care nurses also took effect with the corresponding funding.Attractivity and retention measures in favour of hospital personnel and shortage of certain staff categories resulting in a higher use of agency staff also added to the inflationary burden across our different geographies. For these areas targeted actions have been initiated to improve the situation over time.Current Operating ResultCurrent operating result amounted to ‚Ç¨113.1m (last year ‚Ç¨149.1m) for the first six-month period representing a current operating margin of 5.1% (last year 7.3%)  down 24.1% over the previous period primarily from inflation pressure.Non-recurring itemsOther non-current income and expenses net to a profit of ‚Ç¨21.6m (last year ‚Ç¨2.3m) for the six-month period ended 31 December 2022  including a ‚Ç¨29.2m profit on the sale of the land and car parks adjacent to one of our hospital in Oslo.Financial resultThe cost of net financial debt amounted to ‚Ç¨68.7m (last year 59.9m) for the six-month period ended 31 December 2022. The increase in the cost of funding results from new borrowings bearing interest over this period compared to the half-year closed December 2021  namely the Euro PP ‚Ç¨100m bond issued in December 2021 and the new Fiducie Suret√© ‚Ç¨150m tranche drawn in July 2022  as well as an uptick in margins and floating rates.Other financial expenses and income include a positive mark-to market valuation of our interest rate derivatives offset by the interest expense recognised upon the sale of long-term receivables.Group‚Äôs share of net profit reached ‚Ç¨43.9 million (last year ‚Ç¨59.6 million) for the six-month period that ended 31 December 2022.Financing:Net financial debt as of 31 December 2022 increased to ‚Ç¨3 820m compared with ‚Ç¨3 710m as of 30 June 2022  and has been negatively impacted by the timing of payments of various grants accrued over the period.Net debt includes ‚Ç¨1 916 million in non-current borrowings and ‚Ç¨52 million in current borrowings  offset by ‚Ç¨221 million in cash and cash equivalents. IFRS 16 leases debt amounts to ‚Ç¨2 143 million including ‚Ç¨1 935 million in non-current lease debt and ‚Ç¨208 million in current lease debt.During this half-year period  Ramsay Sant√© has strengthened its financing structure thanks to an additional ‚Ç¨150m tranche of its Fiducie Suret√©.The Group complies with all commitments relating to the financial documentation in place. The application of IFRS 16 has no effect on the methods used to calculate the financial aggregates referred to in these debt agreements.About Ramsay Sant√©Ramsay Sant√© is the leader in private hospitalisation and primary care in Europe.

(the ‚ÄúCompany"" or ""Besi"") (Euronext Amsterdam: BESI; OTC markets: BESIY)  a leading manufacturer of assembly equipment for the semiconductor industry  today announced its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31  2022.Key Highlights Q4-22Revenue of ‚Ç¨ 137.7 million down 18.4% vs. Q3-22 and 19.8% vs. Q4-21 due primarily to lower shipments for high performance computing  mainstream electronics applications from Asian subcontractors and ongoing weakness in mobile end-user marketsOrders of ‚Ç¨ 180.5 million up 44.1% vs. Q3-22 due primarily to increased bookings for high-end smartphone applications and hybrid bonding systems. Down 10.9% vs. Q4-21 principally from lower bookings for mainstream computing and automotive end-user marketsGross margin of 62.3% was equal to Q3-22 and above prior guidance. Up 5.6 points vs. Q4-21Net income of ‚Ç¨ 40.2 million declined 29.8% vs. Q3-22 primarily due to lower revenue and increased R&D spending for wafer level assembly activities. Similarly  down 40.1% vs. Q4-21 which included ‚Ç¨ 8.9 million deferred tax benefitsQ4-22 net margin of 29.2% realized despite industry downturn vs. 34.0% in Q3-22 and 39.1% in Q4-21Net cash increased 1.2% vs. Q3-22 to reach ‚Ç¨ 346.5 million. Declined 6.5% vs. year-end 2021 due primarily to ‚Ç¨ 416.3 million capital allocation to shareholdersKey Highlights FY 2022Revenue of ‚Ç¨ 722.9 million decreased 3.5% primarily due to lower shipments for smartphone and Chinese end-user markets after two years of strong capacity growth. Partially offset by continued strength in automotive end-user markets and initial sales of hybrid bonding systemsOrders of ‚Ç¨ 663.7 million declined 29.3% principally due to decreased demand for high-end smartphone applications post new product cycle in 2021 and reduced bookings from Chinese subcontractors for mobile and mainstream computing applicationsGross margin rose to 61.3% vs. 59.6% in 2021 primarily as a result of lower temporary headcount levels  favorable forex influences and absence of inventory impairment charge recorded in 2021Net income of ‚Ç¨ 240.6 million decreased 14.8% primarily due to lower revenue  increased R&D spending and absence of ‚Ç¨ 15.0 million deferred tax benefits vs. 2021Net margin 33.3% vs. 37.7% in 2021.Proposed dividend of ‚Ç¨ 2.85 per share.

Blickman  President and Chief Executive Officer of Besi  commented:""This year marked an important inflection point in our strategic development as we position Besi for sustainable growth over the next decade. Our business model generated revenue and profitability levels substantially higher than our peers as we effectively responded to an assembly equipment downturn which began in the spring following large capacity additions over the past two years.""We also made a number of important R&D and business investments in 2022 to better position ourselves for anticipated growth over the next industry cycle. Development spending was increased by 48% to ramp hybrid bonding for commercial production  to introduce two new wafer level assembly systems and to upgrade our existing product portfolio. Operational resources were utilized to increase cleanroom production and service/support capacity in Malaysia and Singapore as we prepare for anticipated hybrid bonding growth over the next five years. Strong cash flow from operations was used to increase our capital allocation by 132% versus 2021 including the initiation of a new ‚Ç¨ 300 million share repurchase program. Progress also continued on Besi‚Äôs ESG agenda where approximately 80% of our 2022 targets were met or significantly exceeded in key carbon emissions categories as well as in the areas of waste  hazardous materials and renewable energy.""For the year  revenue and net income of ‚Ç¨ 722.9 million and ‚Ç¨ 240.6 million declined by 3.5% and 14.8%  respectively  versus 2021. Orders of ‚Ç¨ 663.7 million declined by 29.3% principally due to decreased demand for high-end smartphone applications post new product introductions in 2021. The decrease also reflected reduced bookings from Chinese subcontractors for mobile and mainstream computing applications linked to softening economic conditions in China. Of note  revenue from Chinese customers declined by 33.5% and represented 25.9% of revenue in 2022 versus 37.6% in 2021. Revenue and order weakness in smartphone applications was partially offset by continued strength in Besi‚Äôs computing/hybrid bonding and automotive end-user markets as well as increased revenue from spares/service activities which grew by 25.7% year over year.""We achieved peer leading operating and net margins of 40.7% and 33.3% in a difficult environment as we successfully aligned production to changing market conditions. In fact  gross margins increased to 61.3% this year due primarily to a 77% reduction of temporary headcount from peak first quarter levels  effective management of our supply chain and price increases implemented to help offset inflationary cost pressures.""Besi ended the year with a solid liquidity base consisting of cash  cash equivalents and deposits aggregating ‚Ç¨ 671.7 million  or ‚Ç¨ 8.56 per basic share and net cash of ‚Ç¨ 346.5 million. Our net cash position reflected strong cash flow from operations of ‚Ç¨ 271.9 million equal to 37.6% of revenue  the conversion into equity of ‚Ç¨ 139.9 million of Convertible Notes due 2027 and the capital allocation of ‚Ç¨ 416.3 million to shareholders. Given Besi‚Äôs earnings  cash flow and solid financial position  we propose to pay a cash dividend of ‚Ç¨ 2.85 per share for approval at our 2023 AGM. The proposed distribution is the thirteenth consecutive annual dividend paid and reflects a pay-out ratio of 93%. Including such dividend  Besi will have returned approximately ‚Ç¨ 1.6 billion to shareholders over the past 13 years  or approximately 25% of cumulative revenue during this period.""In addition  substantial progress was achieved to help hybrid bonding become a market reality. Significant improvements in placement accuracy  throughput  yield and lead times for delivery all contributed to its commercial viability. Full scale production by a customer began in the second half of 2022. In total  Besi has shipped 35 hybrid bonding systems since the fourth quarter of 2021 of which 10 were demonstration units. In addition  we received orders for an incremental 14 units from multiple customers subsequent to Q3-22 of which 3 were received to date in Q1-23. Orders received in Q4-22 are not anticipated to be shipped until Q2-23 of which several are to be incorporated into integrated hybrid bonding production lines. Of note  the first hybrid bonding integrated production line was shipped in the fourth quarter.""Besi‚Äôs fourth quarter operating results were better than expected in an ongoing industry downturn. Revenue of ‚Ç¨ 137.7 million decreased by 18.4% versus Q3-22 reflecting a number of headwinds including weakness in high performance computing and mainstream electronics applications and ongoing weakness in mobile end-user markets. However  our backlog rose by 12.2% to reach ‚Ç¨ 270 million at year-end due to a ‚Ç¨ 55.2 million  or 44.1% sequential order increase versus Q3-22. Such increase resulted primarily from higher bookings for high-end smartphones and hybrid bonding systems. Current order trends reflect customers‚Äô continued investment in high-end versus mainstream assembly applications as well as ongoing weakness in demand by Chinese customers. Besi‚Äôs profitability and efficiency remained at attractive levels in Q4-22 despite the downturn with gross margins reaching 62.3%  net income of ‚Ç¨ 40.2 million and a net margin realized of 29.2%.""There is a high degree of uncertainty as to the outlook for 2023. The assembly equipment market is in a classic downturn after two strong years of growth. However  we believe there are a variety of potential outcomes for Besi‚Äôs business prospects this year in the context of the current downcycle including the outlook for smartphone and hybrid bonding demand as well as the impact of the re-opening of the Chinese economy. The headwinds we face are many including higher inflation and interest rates  decelerating economic growth  geo-political tensions and ongoing weakness in mainstream electronics  computing and mobile handset end-user markets.""For Q1-23  we forecast that revenue will decrease by 0-10% versus Q4-22 as many orders received in Q4-22 are scheduled for delivery in Q2-23 and Q3-23. In addition  we estimate that Besi‚Äôs gross margin will range between 61%-63% and for baseline operating expenses to decrease by 0-5% versus Q4-22. Total operating expenses are expected to increase by 15%-20% due to an incremental ‚Ç¨ 7 million of non-cash  share based compensation expense.‚ÄùFourth Quarter Results of Operations‚Ç¨ millions Q4-2022 Q3-2022 Œî Q4-2021 Œî Revenue 137.7 168.8 -18.4 % 171.7 -19.8 % Orders 180.5 125.3 +44.1 % 202.6 -10.9 % Book to Bill Ratio 1.3x 0.7x +0.6 1.2x +0.1Q4-22 revenue of ‚Ç¨ 137.7 million decreased by 18.4% versus Q3-22 and 19.8% versus Q4-21 due primarily to lower shipments for high performance computing  reduced revenue from Asian subcontractors for mainstream electronics applications and ongoing weakness in mobile end-user markets. The Q4-22 revenue decrease versus each of such periods also reflected general market softness and was partially offset by continued strength in shipments for automotive applications.Orders of ‚Ç¨ 180.5 million increased by 44.1% versus Q3-22 due to increased orders for high-end smartphone applications from Asian subcontractors and new orders for hybrid bonding systems from multiple IDM customers. Versus Q4-21  orders decreased by 10.9% primarily due to lower bookings for mainstream computing and automotive applications. Per customer type  IDM orders increased ‚Ç¨ 17.5 million  or 21.7%  versus Q3-22 and represented 54% of total orders for the period. Subcontractor orders increased by ‚Ç¨ 37.7 million  or 84.5%  versus Q3-22 and represented 46% of total orders.‚Ç¨ millions Q4-2022 Q3-2022 Œî Q4-2021 Œî Gross Margin 62.3 % 62.3 % - 56.7%* +5.6 Operating Expenses 37.1 34.0 +9.1 % 30.3 +22.4 % Financial Expense  net 3.6 5.5 -34.5 % 3.0 +20.0 % EBITDA 54.8 77.1 -28.9 % 72.0 -23.9 %* Gross margin in Q4-21 included a one-time  ‚Ç¨ 7.4 million inventory impairment charge. Ex such charges  gross margin would have been 61.0%Besi‚Äôs gross margin of 62.3% in Q4-22 was equal to Q3-22 and above guidance primarily due to favorable forex influences. Versus Q4-21  gross margin increased by 5.6 points primarily due to the absence of a one-time  ‚Ç¨ 7.4 million inventory impairment charge recorded in Q4-21. Excluding such charge  Besi‚Äôs gross margin rose by 1.3% versus Q4-21.Q4-22 operating expenses increased by ‚Ç¨ 3.1 million  or 9.1%  versus Q3-22 due primarily to a ‚Ç¨ 1.0 million increase in R&D spending and higher share-based compensation expense. Versus Q4-21  operating expenses increased by ‚Ç¨ 6.8 million  or 22.4%  due primarily to ‚Ç¨ 4.6 million of higher R&D spending for next generation wafer level assembly systems as well as higher marketing and technical support costs related thereto and increased travel expenses post the pandemic. As a percentage of revenue  operating expenses increased to 26.9% in Q4-22 versus 20.2% in Q3-22.Financial expense  net  decreased by ‚Ç¨ 1.9 million versus Q3-22 primarily as a result of increased interest income earned on cash balances outstanding.‚Ç¨ millions Q4-2022 Q3-2022 Œî Q4-2021 Œî Net Income 40.2 57.3 -29.8 % 67.1 -40.1 % Net Margin 29.2 % 34.0 % -4.8 39.1 % -9.9 Tax Rate 10.9 % 12.8 % -1.9 -4.6 % +15.5 %Besi‚Äôs Q4-22 net income of ‚Ç¨ 40.2 million decreased ‚Ç¨ 17.1 million  or 29.8%  versus Q3-22. The profit reduction was primarily due to an 18.4% sequential revenue decrease and a 9.1% increase in operating expenses associated primarily with higher R&D spending levels partially offset by higher interest income earned and a lower effective tax rate. Versus Q4-21  net income decreased by ‚Ç¨ 26.9 million  or 40.1%  principally as a result of (i) a 19.8% revenue decrease  (ii) increased R&D spending and (iii) a higher effective tax due to the absence of ‚Ç¨ 8.9 million in tax benefits recognized in the prior year period partially offset by a 5.6 point gross margin increase. As a result  Besi‚Äôs net margin decreased to 29.2% in Q4-22 versus 34.0% in Q3-22 and 39.1% in Q4-21.Full Year Results of Operations‚Ç¨ millions FY 2022 FY 2021* Œî Revenue 722.9 749.3 -3.5 % Orders 663.7 939.1 -29.3 % Gross Margin 61.3 % 59.6 % +1.7 Operating Income 294.1 317.6 -7.4 % Net Income* 240.6 282.4 -14.8 % Net Margin* 33.3 % 37.7 % -4.4 Tax Rate * 12.6 7.1 % +5.5* Excluding inventory impairment charge in Q4-21 and tax benefits recorded during the year  Besi‚Äôs net income  net margin and effective tax rate in 2021 would have been ‚Ç¨ 273.9 million  36.6% and 12.0%  respectively.Besi‚Äôs revenue in 2022 declined by ‚Ç¨ 26.4 million  or 3.5%  versus 2021 primarily due to a variety of trends affecting its end-user markets. Significant revenue decreases were reported for smartphone and Chinese end-user markets. Such adverse headwinds were partially offset by continued strength in (i) automotive end-user markets as supply chain issues began to recede and (ii) computing applications as hybrid bonding shipments increased for commercial production in the second half of the year.Orders of ‚Ç¨ 663.7 million declined by 29.3% in comparison to 2021 principally due to significantly decreased demand for high-end smartphone applications post new product introductions in 2021 and reduced bookings from Chinese subcontractors for mobile and computing applications linked to softening economic conditions. In both 2022 and 2021  bookings by IDMs and subcontractors represented approximately 55% and 45% of total orders. Revenue and orders in 2022 were not adversely affected by trade restrictions and regulations resulting from geo-political tensions between the US and China.Besi maintained its financial efficiency at elevated levels this year despite the adverse impact of weakening market conditions. Our gross margin increased from 59.6% in 2021 to 61.3% and operating margins remained above 40%. Operating income of ‚Ç¨ 294.1 million declined by 7.4% versus 2021 primarily due to a 48% increase in R&D spending for next generation wafer level assembly systems.Besi‚Äôs net income of ‚Ç¨ 240.6 million decreased by ‚Ç¨ 41.8 million  or 14.8%  versus 2021 and resulted in a net margin of 33.3%. Decreased profitability was primarily due to lower spending for smartphones and in Chinese end-user markets  increased R&D spending and the absence of ‚Ç¨ 15.0 million deferred tax benefits recognized in 2021.Financial Condition‚Ç¨ millions Q42022 Q32022 Œî Q42021 Œî FY 2022 FY2021Œî Total Cash and Deposits 671.7 661.8 +1.5 % 672.2 -0.1 % 671.7 672.2 -0.1 % Net Cash and Deposits 346.5 342.5 +1.2 % 370.4 -6.5 % 346.5 370.4 -6.5 % Cash flow from Ops. 86.6 112.7 -23.2 % 101.8 -14.9 % 271.9 277.9 -2.2 %At year-end 2022  Besi had a strong liquidity position with total cash and deposits aggregating ‚Ç¨ 671.7 million  or an increase of ‚Ç¨ 9.9 million (+1.5%)  versus Q3-22. Growth was primarily due to ‚Ç¨ 86.6 million of cash flow from operations which was used to fund (i) ‚Ç¨ 65.0 million of share repurchases  (ii) ‚Ç¨ 5.5 million of capitalized development spending and (iii) ‚Ç¨ 2.1 million of capital expenditures. Similarly  net cash of ‚Ç¨ 346.5 million at quarter end increased by 1.2% versus Q3-22.For the full year  Besi‚Äôs cash and deposits were roughly comparable to 2021 year-end balances (-‚Ç¨ 0.5 million) and reflected (i) a capital allocation of ‚Ç¨ 416.3 million to shareholders and (ii) ‚Ç¨ 172.2 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of Besi‚Äôs 2022 Convertible Notes due 2029. Besi‚Äôs year-end net cash position of ‚Ç¨ 346.5 million decreased by ‚Ç¨ 23.9 million versus year end 2021 which also included the conversion into equity of ‚Ç¨ 139.9 million of our 2017 Convertible Notes.Share Repurchase ActivityDuring the quarter  Besi repurchased approximately 1.2 million of its ordinary shares at an average price of ‚Ç¨ 55.41 per share for a total of ‚Ç¨ 65.0 million. For the full year  a total of approximately 2.7 million shares were repurchased at an average price of ‚Ç¨ 54.38 per share for a total of ‚Ç¨ 146.8 million. At year end 2022  Besi held approximately 3.3% of its shares outstanding in treasury.Dividend for 2022Given its earnings  cash flow generation and prospects  Besi‚Äôs Board of Management has proposed a cash dividend for 2022 equal to ‚Ç¨ 2.85 per share for approval at its AGM on April 26  2023. The proposed dividend reflects a pay-out ratio of 93% and will be payable from May 4  2023.OutlookBased on its December 31  2022 backlog and feedback from customers  Besi forecasts for Q1-23 that:Revenue will decrease by 0-10% versus the ‚Ç¨ 137.7 million reported in Q4-22.Gross margin will range between 61%-63% versus the 62.3% realized in Q4-22.Baseline operating expenses are expected to decrease by 0%-5% from ‚Ç¨ 34.3 million in Q4-22Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 15%-20% versus Q4-22 primarily due to approximately ‚Ç¨ 7 million of incremental non-cash  share based compensation expense.Investor and media conference callA conference call and webcast for investors and media will be held today at 4:00 pm CET (10:00 am EST).

(Euronext Paris: CNV; ISIN: NL0010949392) (‚ÄúCnova‚Äù) today announced its fourth quarter 2022 activity and full-year unaudited financial results for 2022. During 2022  Cnova‚Äôs first priority was the continuous development of its marketplace and advertising services in a persistent context of macro-economic uncertainties and disruptions  while recalibrating its cost structure to preserve cash and improve profitability. 2022 also confirmed the relevant positioning of its B2B business model with the commercial acceleration of Octopia and C-logistics.This mix evolution towards more platform revenues has driven Cnova‚Äôs gross margin up by more than 5pts over the last 3 years to 23.2% of net sales. Marketplace GMV  after reaching more than 50% of product GMV for the first time in the 2nd quarter of 2022  continues on its positive trend and now represents 54% of GMV in the 4th quarter (+9pts vs. last year) with a nearly stable GMV (-2%) in a receding French ecommerce market. In January and February 2023  marketplace continues to be dynamic with record high GMV shares of more than 60% for several days. Over the last 5 years  marketplace has been growing at an annual rate of +7% supporting Cnova‚Äôs first strategic pillar with a GMV share increasing by +18pts up to 52%.This marketplace development has been supported by a sharp increase in customer satisfaction measured by the NPS which grew by +3pts compared to 2021 and +14 pts compared to 2019  narrowing the gap with the direct sales customer satisfaction by 4pts since 2019. The primary lever of this improvement has been the constant enhancement in marketplace delivery services: Fulfilment by Cdiscount and Cdiscount Express Seller orders now cover more than half of marketplace GMV (+20 pts between 2019 and 2022).Advertising services revenues reached ‚Ç¨71m in the Full Year 2022  growing +5% compared to 2021 supported by the traction of our proprietary advertising bidding platform which grew by +29% yoy now representing two thirds of advertising services revenues.Overall GMV decreased by -15% in the Full Year 2022 on a comparable basis impacted by the direct sales rationalization (-27%) to focus on products generating more profit and cash. As part of this voluntary strategic move  direct sales inventories nearly halved at end 2022 compared to last year end (+‚Ç¨112m positive impact on working capital).Long-term value creation through B2B activities development: Octopia signed 14 new clients in 2022 to reach a total of 26 clients at year-end of 2022 out of which 17 clients are already live on the platform. C-logistics signed 3 new clients in 2022 to reach 4 clients at year-end for its end-to-end third-party logistic solution and has already successfully launched 3 of them.In Q2 2022  Cnova launched an Efficiency Plan to swiftly recalibrate its cost structure & capex level to the current volume of activity with a ‚Ç¨75m savings target on a full-year basis by the end of 2023.This efficiency plan already generated ‚Ç¨47m of savings of OPEX and CAPEX in 2022 compared to 2021  overperforming the July 28  2022 savings guidance by +‚Ç¨17m.Thanks to those initiatives  Cnova was able to protect profitability and cash with an EBITDA of ‚Ç¨52m and a positive free cash flow before financial interests of +‚Ç¨15m for the Full Year 2022  an improvement of +‚Ç¨94m compared to last year. Thomas M√©tivier  Cnova's CEO  commented: ‚ÄúIn 2022  Cnova proved its ability to quicky adapt to macro-economic disruptions by focusing on our marketplace and advertising services while reducing our cost structure with decisions taken as early as Q1. In 2023  we will accelerate the pace of this transformation  focusing on strengthening our profitability  growing our marketplace while leveraging on advertising services and on the commercial success of Octopia and C-Logistics‚Äô solutions. All those actions will pave the way for more growth potential and margin expansion in the coming years.‚Äù Financial highlights Financial performance(‚Ç¨ millions  GMV figures incl.

Net sales evolution has been impacted by the improvement of product mix towards the marketplace  whose revenues are just recognized for the amount of associated commissions  with a GMV share increasing by +6.1pts in a year. This product mix improvement has been accelerating in Q4 with GMV marketplace share increasing by +9.1pts. Gross margin was ‚Ç¨393.8m for the Full Year 2022  decreasing by -16.9% compared to 2021 but representing 23.2% of net sales  which represents an improvement compared to 2021 of +1.3pts. Cnova accelerated its shift towards the marketplace: marketplace and Cdiscount advertising together brought more than +2.5pts in gross margin. This increase more than compensated one-off negative impact from destocking initiatives (-0.6pts on gross margin) that contributed to a +‚Ç¨112m positive impact on working capital related to inventory reduction. SG&A costs excluding depreciation and amortization amounted to ‚Ç¨(341.8)m for the Full Year 2022  decreasing by ‚Ç¨29.1m thanks to the implementation in early Q2 of an efficiency plan to recalibrate cost structure to current level of activity. This efficiency plan including SG&A and CAPEX savings outperformed the ‚Ç¨30m July 28  2022 guidance by ‚Ç¨17m in 2022. Fulfillment costs  at 7.1% of net sales (-0.6 pt vs. 2021)  decreasing by ‚Ç¨19.1m in value as a result of (i) lower volumes  (ii) efficiency plan on square meter optimization (iii) productivity enhancement and (iv) renegotiations that together offset high inflation headwinds. Marketing costs represented 4.9% of net sales (-0.3 pt vs. 2021)  decreasing by ‚Ç¨17.7m in value. Cdiscount maintained its acquisition marketing spend proportionally to a lower GMV and benefited from the implementation of the savings plan. Technology & Content costs increased at 3.7% of net sales (+1.7 pts vs. 2021) related to the continuous investment in Octopia‚Äôs product and commercial development partly offset by the savings plan that was achieved gradually throughout the second half of the year. General & Administrative represented 2.4% of net sales (-0.3 pt vs. 2021)  decreasing by ‚Ç¨4.0m in value. Most of the savings incurred in this cost line were concentrated on central costs with a full-year impact expected in 2023. As a result  FY 2022 EBITDA decreased to +‚Ç¨52.0m representing 3.1% of net sales (-1.7 pts vs. 2021). In a context of significant market headwinds  EBITDA benefited from a resilient marketplace performance and increased revenues from advertising services while heavy destocking initiatives negatively weighted on Direct Sales gross margin. This negative impact on gross margin was partly offset by the positive +‚Ç¨29m impact of the efficiency plan at OPEX level. Operating EBIT decreased to ‚Ç¨(45.8)m representing -2.7% of net sales (-3.3 pts vs. 2021)  with depreciation and amortization increasing by ‚Ç¨8.1m y-o-y due to growing investment over the past years in new B2B activities especially Octopia‚Äôs product developments. Other non-recurring income / (expenses) amounted to ‚Ç¨(4.6)m. Costs related to the efficiency plan and assets impairment was mainly compensated by a positive gain on Floa assets disposal for ‚Ç¨14.0m. Net financial expenses ‚Äì mainly related to 4-installment payment solutions offered to customers ‚Äì amounted to ‚Ç¨(72.5)m representing -4.3% of net sales (-1.8 pt vs. 2021) an increase of ‚Ç¨(19.7)m compared to last year: 4-installment payment cost of risk was temporarily negatively impacted in 2022 by higher take rate in H2 2021 and H1 2022 together with higher interest rates for c. ‚Ç¨(14)mcost of risk was temporarily negatively impacted in 2022 by higher take rate in H2 2021 and H1 2022 together with higher interest rates for c. ‚Ç¨(14)m Long Term loan with the Casino Group increasing from ‚Ç¨150m up to ‚Ç¨300m for c. ‚Ç¨(5)m Net loss from continuing operations amounted to ‚Ç¨(128.0)m  representing -7.5% of net sales (-5.1 pts vs. 2021).

(‚ÄúAMG‚Äù  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: ‚ÄúAMG‚Äù) reported fourth quarter 2022 revenue of $390 million  an 18% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Fourth quarter 2022 EBITDA of $104 million was more than double the fourth quarter of 2021  and drove AMG to a record-setting full year EBITDA of $343 million. In 000‚Äôs US dollars FY ‚Äò22 FY ‚Äò21 Change Revenue $1 642 774 $1 204 666 36% EBITDA (1) 342 550 136 676 151% Cash from operating activities 167 567 90 788 85% Net income attributable to shareholders 187 589 13 771 EPS - Fully diluted 5.73 0.44 Return on Capital Employed 30.8% 11.9% Note:(1) EBITDA is defined as EBIT adjusted for depreciation and amortization.Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  Chairman of the Management Board and CEO  said  ‚ÄúAMG's full year 2022 EBITDA  revenue  gross profit  operating cash flows  return on capital employed  and net income were the highest in the company's history by significant margins. This result is due to the AMG Clean Energy Materials segment  specifically AMG Lithium and its Brazil operation with an EBITDA contribution of $215 million  or 63% of the total EBITDA for the year. Moreover  AMG exceeded $100 million of EBITDA for the second straight quarter. EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $104 million compared to $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2021  an increase of $60 million  or 137%. Our Enabling CO 2 Reduction Portfolio (ECO 2 RP) in 2022 enabled 99.4 million tons of CO 2 reduction  26% more than the 79.0 million tons of enabled CO 2 reduction in 2021.‚Äù Outlook AMG reaffirms its guidance for the full year 2023 to exceed $400 million EBITDA. AMG anticipates the Company will increase overall staffing from about 3 400 at the end of 2022 by 5% due to the hiring associated with the ramp-up of the vanadium expansion in Ohio and the lithium expansion in Germany. Capital expenditures for 2023 are expected to be between $175 million and $200 million  mainly driven by the lithium concentrate expansion in Brazil and expenditures related to the construction of the lithium hydroxide plant in Germany. With regard to financing in 2023  AMG refinanced its $350 million term loan and $200 million revolver in November 2021  extending revolver and term loan maturities to 2026 and 2028  respectively. AMG has no significant near-term debt maturities. And although we look to consistently optimize our financial structure  our current liquidity of $532 million can fully fund all of the approved capital expansion projects and all other financial obligations. In addition  we reaffirm our two-pronged commitment to reduce our CO 2 emissions and increase our enabled CO 2 savings through 2030. Strategic Highlights Lithium The spodumene production expansion project in AMG Brazil is progressing. The project will solidify AMG‚Äôs low-cost position. The objective is to be at full capacity in the second half of 2023.The AMG Lithium refinery in Bitterfeld  Germany  Europe‚Äôs first lithium hydroxide refinery  is under construction  and commissioning for the first 20 000-ton module of the battery-grade lithium hydroxide upgrader will commence in the fourth quarter of 2023.AMG Lithium has signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with FREYR Battery  the basis of which is for AMG Lithium to supply FREYR between 3 000 to 5 000 tons per annum of battery-grade lithium hydroxide.AMG Brazil  JX Nippon Mining & Metals Corporation (‚ÄúJXNMM‚Äù) and TANIOBIS GmbH announced a strategic partnership in December 2022 for the production and supply of tantalum concentrate from AMG‚Äôs Mibra Mine in Brazil.

On a full year basis  revenue increased by 36%.EBITDA was $104 million in the fourth quarter of 2022  up 137% versus the fourth quarter 2021 EBITDA of $44 million. Full year EBITDA of $343 million is 151% higher than the prior year.Annualized return on capital employed was 30.8% for 2022  more than double the 11.9% for 2021.Cash flow from operations was $168 million for full year 2022  compared to $91 million in 2021  driven by the high profitability of AMG Lithium in Brazil.Net income attributable to shareholders for full year 2022 was $188 million  yielding $5.73 diluted earnings per share compared to $0.44 in 2021.AMG‚Äôs liquidity as of December 31  2022 was $532 million  with $346 million of unrestricted cash and $186 million of revolving credit availability.The total 2022 dividend proposed is ‚Ç¨0.70 per ordinary share  including the interim dividend of ‚Ç¨0.30  paid on August 10  2022.Key Figures In 000‚Äôs US dollars Q4 ‚Äò22 Q4 ‚Äò21 Change FY ‚Äò22 FY ‚Äò21 Change Revenue $390 004 $330 360 18% $1 642 774 $1 204 666 36% Gross profit 119 981 61 797 94% 409 486 208 243 97% Gross margin 30.8% 18.7% 24.9% 17.3% Operating profit 82 319 22 295 269% 307 059 57 141 437% Operating margin 21.1% 6.7% 18.7% 4.7% Net incomeattributable toshareholders 60 697 5 705 964% 187 589 13 771 1 262% EPS - Fully diluted 1.85 0.18 928% 5.73 0.44 1 202% EBIT (1) 91 719 32 678 181% 297 251 92 991 220% EBITDA (2) 104 061 43 885 137% 342 550 136 676 151% EBITDA margin 26.7% 13.3% 20.9% 11.3% Cash fromoperating activities 56 969 30 225 88% 167 567 90 788 85% Notes: (1) EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and income taxes.

Operational Review AMG Clean Energy Materials Q4 ‚Äò22 Q4 ‚Äò21 Change FY ‚Äò22 FY ‚Äò21 Change Revenue $176 065 $115 405 53% $667 804 $381 475 75% Gross profit 81 583 27 950 192% 267 862 75 095 257% Gross profit beforenon-recurring items 82 784 29 038 185% 273 417 80 264 241% Operating profit 69 779 16 301 328% 222 590 22 476 890% EBITDA 80 347 25 753 212% 259 480 66 622 289% AMG Clean Energy Materials‚Äô revenue increased 53% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021  to $176 million  driven mainly by higher prices in vanadium  tantalum and lithium concentrates  as well as increased sales volumes of vanadium and tantalum concentrate. The higher prices and volumes in 2022 propelled revenue for the segment 75% higher than in 2021. Gross profit before non-recurring items for the quarter increased 185% compared to the same period in the prior year. The segment‚Äôs full year 2022 gross profit before non-recurring items grew 241% compared to 2021  primarily due to the increased price environment. SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022 were in line with the same period in 2021 at $12 million. Full year 2022 SG&A expenses were 11% higher than in 2021  largely due to increased professional fees associated with strategic projects during 2022 offset by lower share-based compensation. The fourth quarter 2022 EBITDA increased 212%  to $80 million  from $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2021  due to the improved gross profit as noted above. The segment‚Äôs full year 2022 EBITDA of $259 million was 289% higher than the 2021 EBITDA  largely driven by the lithium business. Vanadium profitability was impacted in the fourth quarter of 2022 by a sequential drop in index prices of 16% from the third quarter and the impact of start-up costs for Zanesville. During the fourth quarter of 2022  a total of 21 329 dry metric tons (‚Äúdmt‚Äù) of spodumene was sold. The average realized sales price was $3 682/dmt CIF China for the quarter. The average cost per ton for the quarter was $228/dmt CIF China. This exceptional cost per ton result was driven by high sales volumes of tantalum concentrate in the quarter  and drove a quarterly EBITDA figure for AMG Brazil of $73 million. For the full year 2022  a total of 86 713 dmt of spodumene was sold. The average realized sales price was $2 805/dmt CIF China and the average cost per ton for the full year was $461/dmt CIF China. Total EBITDA for AMG Brazil was $215 million.

On a full year basis  revenue increased by 18% compared to 2021. Gross profit before non-recurring items of $19 million in the fourth quarter was 64% higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The segment‚Äôs full year 2022 gross profit before non-recurring items was 19% higher than in 2021  largely driven by the improved price environment and favorable energy contracts for silicon production in the fourth quarter. SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased by 20%  to $7 million  compared to the same period in 2021. This was largely driven by lower share-based compensation expense in the current quarter associated with a reversal recorded in the prior year. Full year 2022 SG&A expenses were slightly lower than 2021 by $0.6 million. The fourth quarter 2022 EBITDA increased 117% compared to the same period in 2021  to $14 million  due to improved gross profit as noted above and favorable energy contracts at AMG Silicon in the quarter. Improved prices during 2022 led to a 23% increase in full year EBITDA for the segment compared to 2021. Effective January 1  2023  AMG placed its silicon metal plant in Pocking  Germany  on care and maintenance. The plant will restart and operate one furnace in March of 2023. The operational parameters of the silicon business will continue to be reviewed on an ongoing basis and will be adjusted as appropriate in line with favorable and predictable market conditions. Due to the noted interruptions in silicon operations  the financial impact of the business will be excluded from EBITDA during this period of abnormal operations. The financial impact of the care and maintenance program does not significantly impact AMG‚Äôs overall projected 2023 financial results. AMG Critical Materials Technologies Q4 ‚Äò22 Q4 ‚Äò21 Change FY ‚Äò22 FY ‚Äò21 Change Revenue $144 697 $135 533 7% $610 468 $514 668 19% Gross profit 19 381 22 658 (14%) 94 903 84 413 12% Gross profit beforenon-recurring items 20 745 22 388 (7%) 96 449 84 309 14% Operating profit 1 579 3 410 (54%) 20 474 14 484 41% EBITDA 9 713 11 673 (17%) 44 790 38 854 15% AMG Critical Materials Technologies' fourth quarter 2022 revenue increased by $9 million  or 7%  compared to the same period in 2021. This improvement was driven by higher sales volumes of titanium aluminides and higher prices for chrome metal. Full year 2022 revenue was 19% higher than the prior year and gross profit before non-recurring items for 2022 of $96 million was 14% higher than the $84 million in 2021  due largely to the improved price environment versus the prior year associated with the continued recovery of the aerospace market post pandemic. During the first half of the year  market disruptions associated with the Russian invasion of Ukraine impacted the chrome metal supply chain  creating a dramatic increase in the price of raw materials and limited availability. To protect against operational interruptions  the Company secured additional raw material volumes at market conditions at fixed prices. In the fourth quarter  the disruptions to the supply chain were alleviated and the prices fell dramatically. This resulted in the company‚Äôs chrome margins being negatively impacted in the fourth quarter and an inventory write-down of $1.6 million. SG&A expenses decreased by 7% in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021  due to lower share-based expense in the current quarter associated with a reversal in the prior year. AMG Critical Materials Technologies‚Äô EBITDA was $10 million during the quarter compared to $12 million in the same period of 2021. The decrease is due to the chrome market dislocation noted above  offset by stronger profitability from our Engineering business. Full year 2022 EBITDA for the segment of $45 million was 15% higher than 2021. This was primarily due to the continued recovery in the aerospace sector in 2022. AMG Engineering signed $67 million in new orders during the fourth quarter of 2022  driven by strong orders of turbine blade and induction furnaces  representing a 1.28x book to bill ratio. In January 2023  the Company‚Äôs strong order intake continued with $44 million in new orders  mainly due to turbine blade coater sales. Order backlog was $220 million as of December 31  2022  the highest since March 31  2020. Financial Review Tax AMG recorded an income tax expense of $84 million in 2022  compared to $9 million in 2021. This variance was mainly driven by enhanced operating results in AMG Lithium at its Brazil operation coupled with movements in the Brazilian real. The effects of the Brazilian real caused a $7 million benefit in 2022  compared to a $4 million tax benefit in 2021. Fluctuations in the Brazilian real exchange rate impact the valuation of the Company‚Äôs net deferred tax positions related to our operations in Brazil. AMG paid taxes of $42 million in 2022  compared to tax payments of $10 million in 2021. The higher cash payments in 2022 were largely a result of improved operating results. Exceptional Items AMG‚Äôs fourth quarter and full year 2022 gross profit includes exceptional items  which are not included in the calculation of EBITDA. A summary of exceptional items included in gross profit in 2022 and 2021 are below: Exceptional items included in gross profit Q4 ‚Äò22 Q4 ‚Äò21 Change FY ‚Äò22 FY ‚Äò21 Change Gross profit $119 981 $61 797 94% $409 486 $208 243 97% Inventory cost adjustment 1 589 ‚Äî N/A 1 589 1 164 37% Restructuring expense (reversal) 389 (140) N/A 582 522 11% Asset impairment (reversal) expense (990) 153 N/A 10 597 (711) N/A Strategic project expense 1 201 1 501 (20%) 5 540 4 045 37% Others ‚Äî (506) N/A ‚Äî ‚Äî N/A Gross profit excluding exceptional items 122 170 62 805 95% 427 794 213 263 101% Energy Costs Total energy costs were $16 million higher in 2022 versus 2021 due to the increases in gas and electricity costs during the year. The majority of this increase was at our silicon business in Germany  but that business benefited from fully hedged power costs. Other business units benefited from long-term electricity contracts that have no price escalation clauses  and the business units that did experience energy cost increases were able to pass through most of these increased costs to their customers. SG&A AMG‚Äôs fourth quarter 2022 SG&A expenses were $37 million compared to $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2021  with the decrease due to lower share-based compensation expense associated with a reversal in the prior year. Full year 2022 SG&A expenses were $148 million  6% higher than in 2021  with the variance due to increased professional fees associated with strategic projects during the current period  offset by lower share-based compensation expense. Liquidity December 31  2022 December 31  2021 Change Senior secured debt $348 622 $371 897 (6%) Cash & cash equivalents 346 043 337 877 2% Senior secured net debt 2 579 34 020 (92%) Other debt 14 959 24 398 (39%) Net debt excluding municipal bond 17 538 58 418 (70%) Municipal bond debt 319 244 319 476 ‚Äî% Restricted cash 6 920 93 434 (93%) Net debt 329 862 284 460 16% AMG ended the year in a $330 million net debt position. This increase was mainly due to the significant investment in growth initiatives during the year  particularly at our Zanesville facility  which utilized the restricted cash associated with the municipal bond. This use of restricted cash was offset by $34 million of debt repayment and higher unrestricted cash. AMG continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the fourth quarter. As of December 31  2022  the Company had $346 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $186 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $532 million of total liquidity as of December 31  2022. Net Finance Costs AMG‚Äôs fourth quarter 2022 net finance income was $4 million compared to a cost of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This variance was mainly driven by foreign exchange gains of $10 million during the quarter primarily due to non-cash intergroup balances. AMG capitalized $1 million of interest costs in the fourth quarter of 2022 versus $4 million in the same period in 2021  driven by interest associated with the Company‚Äôs tax-exempt municipal bond supporting the vanadium expansion in Ohio. This decrease is due to a portion of the municipal bond interest costs which are no longer being capitalized due to the ramp-up of production at our Zanesville facility. Final Dividend Proposal AMG intends to declare a dividend of ‚Ç¨0.70 per ordinary share over the financial year 2022. The interim dividend of ‚Ç¨0.30  paid on August 10  2022  will be deducted from the amount to be distributed to shareholders. The proposed final dividend per ordinary share therefore amounts to ‚Ç¨0.40. A proposal to resolve upon the final dividend distribution will be included on the agenda for the Annual General Meeting to be held on May 4  2023.Profit for the period to adjusted EBITDA reconciliation Q4 ‚Äò22 Q4 ‚Äò21 FY ‚Äò22 FY ‚Äò21 Profit for the period $62 669 $4 139 $190 771 $13 779 Income tax expense 23 827 5 293 84 097 8 707 Net finance (income) cost (4 177) 12 644 30 941 33 602 Equity-settled share-based payment transactions 1 414 6 883 5 552 10 206 Restructuring expense (reversal) 389 (140) 582 522 Net contract settlements (1) 971 ‚Äî (45 436) ‚Äî Inventory cost adjustment 1 589 ‚Äî 1 589 1 164 Asset impairment (reversal) expense (1) (990) 153 10 597 (711) Environmental provision 143 230 133 11 941 Strategic project expense (2) 5 885 3 769 17 070 12 157 Share of loss of associates ‚Äî 219 1 250 1 053 Others (1) (512) 105 571 EBIT 91 719 32 678 297 251 92 991 Depreciation and amortization 12 342 11 207 45 299 43 685 EBITDA 104 061 43 885 342 550 136 676 Notes:(1) Associated with the silicon metal shutdown  AMG recorded income from the sale of an existing supply contract which positively impacted operating profit for the year. This income was offset by a settlement with a major customer and an impairment of existing assets.(2) The Company is in the initial development and ramp-up phases for several strategic expansion projects  including AMG Vanadium‚Äôs expansion project  the joint venture with Shell  Hybrid Lithium Vanadium Redox Flow Battery System  and the lithium expansion in Germany  which incurred project expenses during the quarter but are not yet operational. AMG is adjusting EBITDA for these exceptional charges. AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V.

(Euronext Paris: CNV; ISIN: NL0010949392) (‚ÄúCnova‚Äù) today announced its fourth quarter 2022 activity and full-year unaudited financial results for 2022.During 2022  Cnova‚Äôs first priority was the continuous development of its marketplace and advertising services in a persistent context of macro-economic uncertainties and disruptions  while recalibrating its cost structure to preserve cash and improve profitability. 2022 also confirmed the relevant positioning of its B2B business model with the commercial acceleration of Octopia and C-logistics.This mix evolution towards more platform revenues has driven Cnova‚Äôs gross margin up by more than 5pts over the last 3 years to 23.2% of net sales.Marketplace GMV  after reaching more than 50% of product GMV for the first time in the 2nd quarter of 2022  continues on its positive trend and now represents 54% of GMV in the 4th quarter (+9pts vs. last year) with a nearly stable GMV (-2%) in a receding French ecommerce market. In January and February 2023  marketplace continues to be dynamic with record high GMV shares of more than 60% for several days. Over the last 5 years  marketplace has been growing at an annual rate of +7% supporting Cnova‚Äôs first strategic pillar with a GMV share increasing by +18pts up to 52%.This marketplace development has been supported by a sharp increase in customer satisfaction measured by the NPS which grew by +3pts compared to 2021 and +14 pts compared to 2019  narrowing the gap with the direct sales customer satisfaction by 4pts since 2019. The primary lever of this improvement has been the constant enhancement in marketplace delivery services: Fulfilment by Cdiscount and Cdiscount Express Seller orders now cover more than half of marketplace GMV (+20 pts between 2019 and 2022).Advertising services revenues reached ‚Ç¨71m in the Full Year 2022  growing +5% compared to 2021 supported by the traction of our proprietary advertising bidding platform which grew by +29% yoy now representing two thirds of advertising services revenues.Overall GMV decreased by -15% in the Full Year 2022 on a comparable basis impacted by the direct sales rationalization (-27%) to focus on products generating more profit and cash.
