The Russia-Ukraine war disrupted the chances of global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic  at least in the short term. The war between these two countries has led to economic sanctions on multiple countries  surge in commodity prices  and supply chain disruptions  causing inflation across goods and services effecting many markets across the globe. The asset servicing market is expected to grow to $1830.69 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 9.4%.The asset servicing market consists of revenues earned by entities by providing administration services through a central securities depository (CSD) or custodian in connection with the custody and/or safekeeping of financial instruments (e.g.  the processing of corporate events or the handling of taxes) on a fee or commission basis. The market value includes the value of related goods sold by the service provider or included within the service offering. Only goods and services traded between entities or sold to end consumers are included.Asset servicing refers to a set of tasks and activities performed by a custodian for his clients in relation to the assets in his custody.North America was the largest region in the asset servicing market in 2022.Western Europe was the second largest region in the asset management market.The regions covered in the asset servicing market report are Asia-Pacific  Western Europe  Eastern Europe  North America  South America  Middle East  and Africa.The main services offered in asset servicing are fund services  custody and accounting  outsourcing services  and securities lending.Securities lending is the process of lending shares of stock  commodities  derivative contracts  or other securities to other investors or firms.The borrower must put up collateral in the form of cash  other assets  or a letter of credit when applying for a security loan. The services are offered to large enterprises  medium-sized and small enterprises  capital markets  and wealth management firms.Globalization acts as a major driver for the growth of the asset servicing industry.According to a study on global asset servicing  nearly 60% of asset services in Assets Under Administration (AUA) and Assets Under Contract (AUC) predict that globalization is likely to be a strong driver for the asset servicing market's growth over the coming years.The players dealing in the asset servicing industry are majorly focusing on the APAC markets and other growing economies.Moreover  according to the BNP Paribas Securities Services article published in January 2020  India was expected to experience impressive growth in the asset management and servicing industry owing to the increasing working population  the rising buying power of the populace  and expected growth in the GDP of the country.Thus  globalization creates a large avenue for the expansion and growth of the asset servicing market over the coming years.The stringent regulatory framework is predicted to limit the growth of the asset servicing industry over the forecast period.According to Funds Europe's asset servicing roundtable  rising global regulation is adding cost and risk to asset servicing  creating a requirement for asset servicers to constantly engage with clients and regulators.In addition to this  according to EY's new opportunities for asset servicing study  nearly 75% of the companies see the impact of regulations as the greater risk facing the asset servicing industry. Therefore  the increased scrutiny from regulatory agencies is anticipated to hinder the asset service market's growth in the coming years.Robotic process automation (RPA) or automation is a major trend shaping the growth of the asset servicing market.Robotic process automation alone could reduce the headcount by 60–70% in the asset servicing industry while also achieving cost savings of approximately 30–40%.Robotic process automation (RPA) refers to a set of software tools known as bots or robots that are used to perform a repetitive or routine business process that is currently used by transaction processing teams or service centers.RPA can replace manual tasks involved in asset servicing such as reconciliation  trade processing  and reporting for regulators and clients  reducing the time required with cost-efficiency.For instance  the ANZ Banking Group was one of the early ones to adopt RPA aggressively and automated its HR  finance  and technology processes in its Bengaluru hub  creating thousands of bots.In April 2020  JP Morgan sought to take whole ownership of China International Fund Management (CIFM)  a local asset management firm  for an amount of $1 billion.This step was taken following China's reforms on the elimination of caps on foreign companies' taking full control of local asset management operations.This acquisition is expected to enable JP Morgan's long-term involvement with CIFM and strengthen the company's position in the Chinese market. China International Fund Management (CIFM) was founded in 2004 and offers asset management and related services to China.The countries covered in the asset servicing market are Australia  Brazil  China  France  Germany  India  Indonesia  Japan  Russia  South Korea  UK  and USA.The market value is defined as the revenues that enterprises gain from goods and/or services sold within the specified market and geography through sales  grants  or donations in terms of currency (in USD ($) unless otherwise specified).The revenues for specified geography are consumption values – that is  they are revenues generated by organizations in the specified geography within the specified market  irrespective of where they are produced.

Negative market performances in virtually all asset classes left no investor untouched. We nevertheless achieved high net inflows in assets under management (AuM) and increased savings. I’m grateful to our clients for their confidence in us and would also like to thank my colleagues for their personal and entrepreneurial approach in the past year  helping our clients in these turbulent times.“In 2022  we enhanced our financial and sustainability objectives as well as our capital strategy. Profitable growth  both organically and via acquisitions  remains our focus  while maintaining a capital-light balance sheet. We’re proud to have added two major Dutch clients to our fiduciary management activities and shortly before year-end we announced the acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden  a further strengthening of our position in Belgium. As part of this transaction  Mercier Vanderlinden’s managing partners will obtain a significant stake in Van Lanschot Kempen  anchoring our shareholder base in our second home market.Story continues“What really pleases me is that over 70% of our colleagues now hold shares in Van Lanschot Kempen  a clear sign of their engagement. I’m also proud that we’ve managed to retain and attract talent in a tight labour market. And on that note  I consider the addition of the Robeco Retail Nederland team to Evi van Lanschot a real boon. On 2 February 2023  we announced that we would enter into a strategic partnership with Robeco and acquire their online investment platform with €4.7 billion in AuM. We look forward to a great partnership and expect to complete the transaction in June 2023.”Client assets and AuMNet AuM inflows amounted to €13.7 billion and negative market performance was €21.5 billion  resulting in a decrease in total AuM of €107.8 billion (2021: €115.6 billion). Client savings rose to €12.7 billion (2021: €11.7 billion) and total client assets were €124.2 billion (2021: €131.2 billion).2022 resultsFull-year net profit amounted to €84.3 million (2021: €143.8 million). The decrease can mainly be explained by high results on participating interests in 2021 and one-off charges related to the acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden in 2022.Commission income rose 6% to €407.8 million (2021: €385.5 million) on the back of higher average AuM levels. Interest income was up 6% to €162.7 million (2021: €153.6 million)  reflecting the interest rate hikes the European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on in the second half of the year.In 2022  operating expenses rose to €438.2 million (2021: €409.9 million)  fuelled by higher staff costs. The increase mostly reflects an increase in FTE to 1 780 (2021: 1 654)  including at the IT and compliance functions and at the teams responsible for investment solutions. Moreover  after the acquisition of the initial 70% stake in July 2021  Mercier Vanderlinden’s operating expenses were now recognised for the full calendar year.PERFORMANCE REPORT/PRESENTATION/WEBCASTFor a detailed discussion of Van Lanschot Kempen’s results and balance sheet  please refer to our performance report and presentation on the 2022 full-year results at vanlanschotkempen.com/results.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today announced it has been granted Breakthrough Device Designation status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of its ARC-EX platform for bladder control  alleviation of spasticity  and blood pressure regulation in people with SCI. ONWARD has now been awarded a total of eight Breakthrough Device Designations  highlighting the company’s innovative approach to developing therapies for people with SCI.ARC-EX is an external  non-invasive platform consisting of a stimulator and wireless programmer. Positive top-line data were reported in 2022 from the company’s first pivotal study  called Up-LIFT  which evaluated the ability for ARC-EX Therapy to improve upper extremity strength and function. ONWARD is now preparing regulatory submissions for the U.S. and Europe  with the expectation that this therapy may be approved for commercialization in late 2023.“Bladder control  spasticity  and blood pressure dysregulation are three of the many challenges people with spinal cord injury must manage in order to navigate their daily lives ” said Dave Marver  Chief Executive Officer of ONWARD. “We are proud of our eight total Breakthrough Device Designations from the FDA  which validate the significant unmet needs of the SCI community and the pioneering nature of our work.”Breakthrough Device Designation is an FDA program designed to help patients and their physicians receive timely access to technologies that have the potential to provide more effective treatment or diagnosis for debilitating conditions of significant unmet need  such as spinal cord injury. As part of this designation  the FDA will provide ONWARD with priority review and the opportunity to interact with FDA experts throughout the premarket review phase as the technology moves toward eventual commercialization.Story continuesAbout Spinal Cord InjurySpinal cord injury (SCI) represents a major unmet medical need for which there is no cure.

This is improved from our previous target of 25 to 30% growth. This expectation is built primarily on orders already booked and  to a lesser extent  on our very promising pipeline of opportunities from existing and new customers. With this improved topline  EBITDA  EBIT and Cash flow are expected to be positive and net earnings are moving close to the break-even point.OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS AND STRATEGY UPDATEStrategy UpdateGeoJunxion’s strategy remains focused on creating “map agnostic” data products: digital geo-localized content  designed to be fully integrated into or overlaid on any commercial or open-source maps  or to be utilised in developing smart solutions for a large variety of use cases  in different industries and market sectors.This strategy has proven itself  as it delivered year-over-year growth of +40% during the last 36 months. We will therefore continue to diligently execute on this strategy and expand the scope of our existing product portfolio.In the second semester of the financial year  great attention and dedication will continue to be paid for the existing clients (Global Tech Companies) in executing custom Location Intelligence services and extending the scope of those project.GeoJunxion’s activities are directed towards establishing long-term relationships with our customers  through the creation of recurring business models rather than one-off opportunities. Although the relationship with clients frequently starts with a proof-of-concept or a custom one-off project  most of the Company’s efforts go into building value-added  dynamic content  requiring continuous and frequent updates to maintain and increase their value over time. This means that most of our proof-of-concept and one-off projects are a launch-pad for establishing a service or license contract  converting the initial activities into a recurring  more predictable and sustainable business model.When executing projects  GeoJunxion typically retains the Intellectual Property and ownership of the newly developed datasets and solutions  for licensing to other customers. Thereby  leveraging the initial investment and creating a virtuous business cycle.Our mission remains focused on improving road safety and contributing to a more sustainable world  reducing the impact on the environment  through intelligent solutions enabling more environmentally conscious decisions.Central to GeoJunxion’s strategy are:Cost effective research  sourcing  production  ingestion  and aggregation of geodata.Flexible licensing models at competitive pricing.Direct delivery of dynamic  up-to-date content via APIs.Highly customised solutions and content creation.Market DevelopmentsWhile clear signs of improvement were showing in some industry sectors  the conflict in Ukraine and its direct and indirect consequences continues to bring serious concerns in the market. Existing and prospect clients strictly monitor their expenditures and continue to be prudent in contracting projects.GeoJunxion has no direct business exposure to the events in Ukraine or Russia. We have no active customers  or deliveries due to  or to be received from Ukraine or Russia. GeoJunxion is however exposed to rising inflation rates  resulting from increased energy and other raw material prices. This is impacting salary & benefit expenses of our staff  costs for office rent and other services.At the same time  we see that demand for location-aware content is still increasing in various industries and markets  despite the concerns on the health of the global economy. While many big Companies are executing significant reductions in force  to cut costs  GeoJunxion remains positive and is actively re-enforcing the team with key profiles necessary to consolidate the current results and pave the way for continued growth.The largest market opportunity for GeoJunxion remains  by far  with big Tech Companies  making extensive use of geo-localized data for their business and end-user solutions. In this market segment  we are dedicating a sizable portion of our resources on project execution. We booked and executed sizable projects in Q1 and received project extensions and booked new opportunities also in the second quarter. There are additional new and interesting opportunities in the pipeline for the remaining part of the fiscal year.In the automotive industry we see growing opportunities derived from adoption of advanced driver-assistance systems  such as ISA (Intelligent Speed Assistance). We can also experience a growing demand for more cost-effective mapping solutions which have the most up-to-date and relevant data content. Premium data content towards safety on the road and environmental sustainability remains our major interest and focus for product development.GeoJunxion also remains active in identifying opportunities in more traditional markets  such as Transport & Logistics  Real Estate  Geo-Marketing  Business Analysis  Travel & Tourism  as well as with the Public Administration. For the next months  GeoJunxion is also re-enforcing the efforts for the Outdoor Venue Plans  our last mile customized maps  where other global map providers do not offer concrete solutions.Business DevelopmentIn 1H (July to December) 2022-23  the Location Intelligence Services have played a fundamental role in our business development. In Q1 we started and partly completed the execution of a newly won big project  which has been extended in scope during Q2 2022/23. In Q2 we have been also awarded for new Location Intelligence projects. These new contracts  which are in execution  will continue to convert into revenue during the third quarter of this Financial Year.During Q2  our Sales and Business development teams attended more events in person  meeting with partners and clients face to face  to promote GeoJunxion’s brand  its products and services.Product DevelopmentCustom project executionWe continue to put significant efforts in the development of custom location intelligence projects for a global Tech Company. The first project  announced in August ’22  has been extended in scope  and therefore prolonged into Q2. In the second quarter  other custom projects for global Tech Companies have been added to our workload. Their execution is in progress and is expected to be completed during the Q3 of F.Y. 2022/23.Automotive product developmentOn the R&D side  most of the product development was focused on the execution and refinement of the data for an important Infotainment System Manufacturer. This project  announced in April 2022  is close to the completion of the first phase: the completion of a market ready product  including field tests and quality controls.Eco Alert Zones and School Safety ZonesSmart Geofences are key products in the GeoJunxion’s portfolio. Eco Alert Zones and School Safety Zones have been kept up to date during the course of last quarter. They are increasing in number  geographical coverage and also in the type of areas. New School Streets have been analyzed and encoded. Having confirmed specific market interest for such geofences  we have decided to launch an innovative proof of concept project with the intent to develop deep learning methods in the field of satellite imagery  analysis and object recognition  applied to this specific use case. This activity will continue for the entire year 2023.ORDER INTAKEOrder intake confirmed the positive trend: following an exceptionally good Q1 2022/23  with an increase of more than 6 times compared with the same period of last year  Q2 order intake was 10% better than last year. The value of orders booked in this very remarkable first semester F.Y. 2022/23  was 4 times bigger than 1H 2021/22.REVENUEIn Q2 2022/23  revenue increased by +25%. Growth was realised in all our product lines  with recurring revenue growing by 45% and non-recurring service revenue growing by 17%. It is very encouraging to see the recurring products now showing the highest growth percentage.For 1H 2022/23  revenue increased by +63%. Also  during the entire first semester  the growth has been realized in all our product lines  with recurring revenue growing by 22% and non-recurring service revenue growing by 87%.GeoJunxion tracks its revenue by product type and by the nature of the underlying contract (recurring versus non-recurring). The main revenue growth has been realized in non-recurring location services  but also the recurring revenue from licenses and royalties showed an increase. The recurring service revenue showed a reduction  primarily due to the timing of the project execution. This will be caught up during Q2 2022-23. Recurring service revenue includes the updating services of our Eco Alert Zones product and other data products. The non-recurring service revenue includes tailored research and collection of data sets and creation of geo-located content.OPERATING RESULTThe Q2 2022-23 operating result shows a profit €153 K  compared to a loss of €60K during the same quarter last year. There are three main drivers for this year-over-year improvement:25% increase in revenue to €846K (€679K  PY).6% decrease in net operational expenses. This is remarkable considering the inflationary pressures and the 25% increase in revenue.Higher Capitalized development costs +€33K (+27%) due to ongoing investments in new products and coverage extension of existing products.The 1H 2022-23 operating result shows an operating profit €797 K  compared to a loss of €185 K during the same period last year. The main drivers for such a positive result are similar to those mentioned for the quarterly improvement:63% increase in revenue to €2.213 K (€1.354 K  PY).8% decrease in net operational expenses. This is remarkable considering the inflationary pressures and the 63% increase in revenue.Higher Capitalized development costs +€96K (+39%) due to ongoing investments in new products and coverage extension of existing products.ORGANIZATIONGeoJunxion has achieved Level 2 certification on Social Entrepreneurship: the Prestatieladder Socialer Ondernemen. This independent assessment showed that GeoJunxion offers high-quality employment to people who have difficulty accessing the labor market and collaborating with like-minded organizations. With this certification  GeoJunxion provides an above-average contribution in the field of social entrepreneurship in a sustainable way.In the second quarter  we increased the efforts to identify the right profile as IT Administrator. We succeeded in this search at the end of December and the new employee started his new adventure with GeoJunxion early January 2023.FINANCIAL POSITIONGeoJunxion continues to make great progress in turning its business around from a digital map supplier to a premium location content and location intelligence service provider with a subscription based  recurring “data as a service” revenue model. The results reported for the 1st Half of 2022-23  with growing revenue and a net profit for the period  are evidence of this progress. Based on our current outlook  the available cash on hand is estimated to be sufficient to cover our operational requirements for at least the next 12 months.APPOINTMENT OF EXTERNAL AUDITORIn the past few months  we have had extensive discussions with OOB/PIE licensed auditing companies. In spite of improved financial results  positive cash flows generated  improved governance & internal control processes  none of the auditing companies contacted was willing to provide a quotation for performing the audit work. The main reasons given by the auditing firms are the lack of internal staff capacity to execute the work and the limited size of the company and its market capitalization.With the end of the 24-months period given by Euronext Amsterdam approaching  we are actively reaching out to other companies in a comparable situation to formulate a joint position. At the same time  we continue to investigate alternative resolutions such as for example: the NBA route and alternative stock markets. Our thinking is however not limited to these 2 options. We are exploring all other options  in order to make the best decision if and when we are faced with this situation.RISK MANAGEMENTRisk management is an integral managerial task. Our risk management and control procedures take into consideration the size of the company and the character of the business to identify the most significant risks which the company is exposed to. The risks identified are discussed on a periodical basis and mitigated or fully resolved  where possible. Such a system cannot provide absolute certainty that objectives will be realized. Neither can it guarantee prevention of potential cases of material mistakes  damage  fraud  or breaches of statutory laws.The 2021-22 annual report  as published on 27 October 2022  describes the primary strategic  operational  and financial risks. The risks and uncertainties described in the annual report are relevant and are deemed incorporated and repeated by reference in this report. There were no cases of material damage  fraud or breaches of law detected since issuing the Annual Accounts.On the Social aspect  we continue to pay particular attention on preventive actions to limit exposure of our people to Covid-19  encouraging and supporting smart working from home  combined with making the best use of our office space in Capelle aan den IJssel to facilitate personal contact and create an optimal work environment. Our people are our key assets  and we do our utmost to keep them satisfied  safe and healthy.BOARD OF MANAGEMENT STATEMENTThe Board of Management hereby declares that  to the best of its knowledge  the summarized Q2 and 1st Half (July – December) 2022-’23 interim consolidated financial statements  drawn up in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim financial reporting”  represents a faithful rendering of the assets  liabilities  financial position  profit and cash flow of GeoJunxion NV and its subsidiary as stated in the consolidated financial statements  and that the Board Report  as included in this Interim Financial statements  represents a faithful rendering of the information required in relation to item 5:25d subs 8 and 9 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act.GROUP STRUCTUREThe GeoJunxion group contains 2 entities: GeoJunxion N.V.

On the other hand  it has a lot of drawbacks  including a lack of durability  a propensity to absorb moisture  issues with hygiene  and a propensity to splinter and shatter easily. To stop the spread of insects and diseases  the wooden pallets must go by rules such International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No. 15 (ISPM 15). Due to its benefits  such as being lighter and more environmentally friendly than timber pallets  logistics and shipping organisations are now gravitating more toward plastic pallets. Additionally  as people become more aware of the need to lessen their carbon footprint  there is an uptick in the demand for plastic pallets  which will support the growth of the worldwide pallets market.Report Scope:Report Attribute Details Market Size in 2029 USD 11.76 billion CAGR 6.9% (2023–2029) Base Year 2021 Forecast Period 2023–2029 Historical Data 2022 Forecast Units Value (USD Billion) Report Coverage Revenue Forecast  Competitive Landscape  Growth Factors  and Trends Segments Covered By Type  Product  End-User  and Region Geographies Covered North America  Europe  Asia-Pacific  and Rest of the World (RoW) Key Market Drivers The global market for plastic pellets will increase as a result of the high demand for plastic from various end-use industries. The market is anticipated to be driven by rising demand from the food and beverage  pharmaceutical  and chemical sectors for hygienic.Key Plastic Pallets Market DriverThe benefits associated with the use of plastic pallets is one of the key drivers fueling the market growth.Compared to other kinds of pallets  such as material (or load) handling tools  plastic pallets offer greater longevity  dependability  and space economy. These advantages are encouraging the use of plastic pallets  which is growing the market's revenue production.The three most popular kinds of pallets used as cargo or material processing tools are made of wood  plastic  and metal. Additionally  plastic crates typically cost less than metal or hardwood pallets.When they are piled  plastic pallets are more efficient in terms of conserving room. They are also more durable than other materials because they do not fracture or shatter.Compared to wooden or metal pallets  plastic pallets can hold a wider variety of products with various forms and sizes because they are more flexible in their construction. Additionally  because they don't have sharp edges or set structure  they are safer to handle. These elements significantly contribute to the industry under consideration's expansion.Key Plastic Pallets Market TrendManufacturing plastic pallets using 100% recyclable plastics is one of the key market trends propelling market growth.Vendors have been trying to produce more plastic containers that are made entirely of recyclable plastic . This is due to the ongoing emphasis on cutting back on environmental waste and carbon impact. It has a significant potential for energy savings  which is made possible by its inherent recyclable nature.The majority of well-known suppliers in the international market are striving to produce plastic pallets that are completely ecologically friendly.Prominent sellers distinguish their plastic container products and reduce their carbon impact by using 100% recyclable business plastic and domestic refuse plastics. During the production of plastic containers  the goal is to use less energy and emit as little carbon dioxide as possible. Thus  manufacturing plastic containers from 100% recyclable plastic contributes to environmental stewardship while also ensuring cost effectiveness.Key Plastic Pallets Market ChallengeRegulatory norms and standards on the use of plastic pallets is one of the factors limiting the market growth.Regulations are in place to control the use of plastic pallets in certain sectors to guarantee adherence to the necessary safety standards and environmental sustainability. These legal requirements are clearly visible in the food manufacturing and packing sectors.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US developed a number of guidelines for the management  processing  and shipping of food. A collection of rules called the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) aims to stop germs  chemicals  and other dangerous outside agents from contaminating food. This implies that those involved in the US food manufacturing business should use hygienic food transportation gear.To fully comprehend market sellers' impact on carbon footprint  it is crucial that they participate in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. Vendors should also make sure that the making of plastic pallets uses the least amount possible of dangerous chemicals like lead  mercury  cadmium  and polybrominated biphenyls. Such regulation requirements impose design and production limitations on market sellers  which serves as a market restraint.Plastic Pallet Market PlayersThe Plastic Pallet market key players include Agrico Plastiques Ltee  Allied Plastics Inc.

However  prospects in specialty markets associated with energy transition represent a source of growth and optimism for the Group.About Baikowski®: Baikowski® has existed for a hundred years and is a leading manufacturer of specialist industrial minerals and  more particularly  of ultra-pure alumina powders and formulations  as well as of other high-quality oxides and composites such as spinel  ZTA  YAG and cerium for technical ceramic applications  precision polishing  crystals and additives or coverings.

The consolidat…,"Press releaseParis  23 February 2023A simplified group  focused on Exail's activitiesExail Technologies publishes for the first time its revenues in its new simplified perimeter  now focused on Exail's activities. The consolidated revenues for the 4th quarter thus include the contribution of the company iXblue. Exail Technologies also indicates a proforma 2022 revenue  including the contribution of iXblue for the whole year 2022.The activities of the former Engineering & Protection Systems division  the sale of which was approved by the General Meeting of December 8  2022  are classified as discontinued operations (IFRS 5) and no longer contribute to revenues  including in the historical figures. The last effective disposal will take place before the end of the first quarter  in accordance with the announced schedule.Revenues and backlog(in €million) Q4 2021 Q4 2022 variation(%)[1] FY2021 FY2022 variation(%) FY 2022proforma[2] Revenues 33 9 88 3 +161% 115 9 179 8 +55% 279 8 Backlog at the end of the period - - - 489 9 633 7 +29% 633 7An excellent level of revenues  particularly strong at the end of 2022Exail Technologies achieved particularly strong revenues in the last quarter of 2022  at €88 million. This excellent level of activity is explained by the favorable seasonality of the fourth quarter (the largest of the year) and the strong performance of navigation and positioning systems sales. These products  which have a relatively short sales cycle  quickly benefited from the supportive context of the defense market for naval and land equipment.Proforma 2022 revenues  including iXblue for the full year  amount to €280 million  illustrating the change in Exail's dimension. The contribution of the BENL program represents approximately €45 million  in line with what was announced at the beginning of 2022  and reflects the successful execution of this first major mine countermeasure project. This contract remains the group's largest  but its relative weight is declining significantly in favor of product sales to a very diversified client base.Strong and accelerating commercial activity: €104 million in new orders in the fourth quarter 2022  growing by around +40%.The volume of orders booked in the fourth quarter is a major success for the end of 2022. It illustrates the momentum of the group  with order intake growing faster than revenues. Exail Technologies won €104 million in orders in the 4th quarter 2022  representing an increase of around +40% compared to the volume of orders for the same period last year on a comparable basis[3].The activity was notably driven by numerous orders for positioning and navigation systems  for nearly €50 million (link to the dedicated press release). In addition  Exail also won three major orders for a total of nearly €25 million  including the first joint sale of ex-ECA drones and ex-iXblue products. The rest of the sales concern in particular on-board equipment as well as photonic and quantum components used by the group and also sold to external customers.The order backlog at the end of the year thus amounts to €633 million  representing more than two years of revenues.Outlook: strong growth in the short and medium termThe sustained activity of the fourth quarter allows Exail Technologies to start the year 2023 with a very good momentum. The favorable geopolitical context  which was not anticipated at the time of the agreement to acquire iXblue a year ago  has had a positive impact on the group's activities. The increase in Defense spending is materializing both in the short term  through sales of navigation and positioning systems  and in the medium term  for major mine-hunting projects or the protection of underwater infrastructure using drones.Significant tenders are underway in the field of underwater mine hunting  with some notifications expected in 2023. In addition  the revenue generated by the BENL program should continue to grow in 2023.Consequently  revenue growth should accelerate this year: Exail Technologies has set a revenue growth target of more than +15% in 2023 compared to proforma 2022 revenues. This objective is supported by the favorable context of the group's activities  confirming both the revenue development trajectory and the capacity to maintain a good level of profitability.About Exail TechnologiesExail Technologies is the new name of Groupe Gorgé  adopted after the transformation of the group at the end of 2022  now focused on the activities of its subsidiary Exail.

In the fourth quarter  organic growth achieved a strong 9.3%.This is reflected as follows by business:More than half of the portfolio (Marine & Offshore  Buildings & Infrastructure and Agri-Food & Commodities) achieved high single digit revenue growth  up 8.5% organically on average. Marine & Offshore (up 9.4% organically) was amongst the best performing activities  led by both in-service and new build activity and essentially fueled by decarbonization trends. Agri-Food & Commodities (up 9.3% organically) outperformed the Group average and was supported by very favorable market conditions in Metals & Minerals  improving Oil & Petrochemical markets and strong growth for Government services. Buildings & Infrastructure growth (+7.6% organic) benefited from strong momentum across its Americas platforms but was impacted by lockdowns in China;A fifth of the portfolio (Industry) delivered double digit organic revenue growth  up 11.4% during the year with strong business activity for the energy segment and in particular Renewables and Oil & Gas;Another fifth of the portfolio (Consumer Products and Certification) grew low to mid-single digit organically  up 2.6% on average. Certification (up 5.5%) benefited from the rising demand for Sustainability and ESG-driven services  despite challenging comparables. Conversely  Consumer Products Services’ growth was subdued by the multiple disruptions in China and weaker consumer spending overall which impacted the business.Hinda Gharbi joined Bureau Veritas in May 2022On February 24  2022  the Board of Directors of Bureau Veritas announced the renewal of the term of office of the Chief Executive Officer  Didier Michaud-Daniel  until the Annual General Meeting in June 2023  which will be called to approve the financial statements for the year 2022.As of May 1  2022  Hinda Gharbi joined Bureau Veritas as Chief Operating Officer and became a member of the Group’s Executive Committee.

With this acquisition  Bureau Veritas increases the diversification of the Consumer Products Services division by expanding its footprint in North America and enters the fast-growing Consumer Healthcare market.AMSfashionBased in Spain  AMSfashion is an expert in Sustainability  quality and conformity services for the fashion industry. This acquisition strengthens Bureau Veritas’ presence in Iberia  a key hub for the expansion of its Consumer Products Services business  supporting the continuing growth in near shoring from South Europe and Africa.The pipeline of opportunities is healthy  and the Group will continue to deploy its very selective bolt-on acquisitions strategy in targeted areas (notably Buildings & Infrastructure  Consumer Products Services  Sustainability Assurance  Renewable Energy and Cybersecurity) and geographies (North America notably).IMPACT OF THE CHINESE LOCKDOWNS IN THE YEAR 2022Following the Chinese government’s “zero Covid policy”  the Group faced selective lockdowns in several cities across the country since the end of March 2022.Given its exposure to China (16% of total revenue in FY 2022)  the lockdown measures had a material impact on performance since the second quarter of 2022. The impact varied however by business:In Consumer Products Services  which makes up around half of the Group’s Chinese revenue  Bureau Veritas showed resilience and ability to adapt during the lockdowns. In the second quarter  the impact was thereby contained as the teams were able to divert samples from one location to another across the country or outside of China to the Group’s South Asia testing capabilities (Vietnam  Bangladesh  India and Sri Lanka). In the fourth quarter  the business was impacted by localized lockdowns and increased level of absenteeism due to the spread of the pandemic;In Buildings & Infrastructure (representing around a quarter of China’s revenue  and solely focused on infrastructure assets in the transportation field and energy)  the business was impacted by site closures. Consequently  organic revenue declined by 9.2% in 2022. This was notably the case in the second quarter due to mobility restrictions imposed in many areas (Shanghai and Shenzhen notably). Once the mobility restrictions had been removed  the Group operated under “stop & go” rules with sites required to shut down as soon as the slightest suspicion of Covid-19 arose. Since Q3  the construction sites have gradually recovered  but remained disrupted by positive cases and the resulting absenteeism;In Certification  remote audits enabled to deliver services and 7.2% organic revenue growth was achieved in 2022  primarily led by ESG related services;In Marine & Offshore  the business remained well oriented (+8.1% organic growth in FY22) and faced very limited disruption.Excluding the impact from the Chinese lockdowns  the full-year 2022 Group margin would have been up c.10 basis points to 16.2% compared to the level of 2021.LIMITED IMPACT AND EXPOSURE TO THE RUSSIA / UKRAINE WARThe Group generated c.1% of its consolidated revenue in 2022 with Russia and Ukraine together  mainly related to commodities markets.In Ukraine (0.2% of Group revenue)  the Group has put its people’s safety at the heart of crisis management. Since the beginning of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine  Bureau Veritas regularly assess and monitor its position in Russia according to international sanctions. In application of the latter  the Group has reduced its activities.A GOOD PRICE DISCIPLINEThe Group has overall good traction on pricing with variations across sectors and geographies. Price realization is more favorable in the mass market and in highly regulated activities  but more complex with a delayed impact for multi-year and large contracts. At the end of 2022 Group price increases had a 1.5- 2.0% positive impact on revenue. For 2023  the pricing benefit is expected to be higher.Throughout the year  Bureau Veritas  as a service company  has been mainly impacted by wage inflation. It has adapted its pricing strategy consequently and maintained its cost management discipline.STRONG FINANCIAL POSITIONAt the end of December 2022  the Group's adjusted net financial debt decreased compared with the level at December 31  2021. Bureau Veritas has a solid financial structure with the bulk of its maturities beyond 2024 and 100% at fixed interest rates. The Group had EUR 1.7 billion in available cash and cash equivalents and EUR 600 million in undrawn committed credit lines.At December 31  2022  the adjusted net financial debt/EBITDA ratio9 was further reduced to 0.97x (from 1.10x as of December 31  2021) and the EBITDA/consolidated net financial expense ratio was 18.25x. As of December 31  2022  the ratio of adjusted net financial debt to EBITDA had to be less than 3.5x and  only for the US Private Placement  the ratio of EBITDA to consolidated net financial expense had to be greater than 5.5x.On September 30  2022  Bureau Veritas successfully raised EUR 200 million on the US Private Placement market through a bilateral 10-year issuance at 3.6%. Bureau Veritas is a repeat issuer on this market since 2008. With this issuance  the Group seized attractive market conditions to partially refinance in advance its 2023 Bond. It also lengthened the average maturity of the Group’s financial debt to 3.9 years with a blended average cost of funds over the year of 2.1% excluding the impact of IFRS 16 (compared with 2.3% in 2021 excluding the impact of IFRS 16).PROPOSED DIVIDENDThe Board of Directors of Bureau Veritas is proposing a dividend of EUR 0.77 per share for 2022  up 45.3% compared to the prior year. This corresponds to an increase of the payout ratio to around 65% of its adjusted net profit (from 50% previously)  a level which the Group expects to maintain moving forward. Bureau Veritas has significant financial flexibility to make acquisitions to capture long-term growth opportunities.This is subject to the approval of the Shareholders’ Meeting to be held on June 22  2023 at 3:00pm at Bureau Veritas Headquarters  Immeuble Newtime  40-52 Boulevard du Parc  92200  Neuilly-sur-Seine  France. The dividend will be paid in cash on July 6  2023 (shareholders on the register on July 5  2023 will be entitled to the dividend and the share will go ex-dividend on July 4  2023).2023 OUTLOOKBased on a healthy sales pipeline and the significant growth opportunities related to Sustainability  and taking into account the current macro uncertainties  Bureau Veritas expects for the full year 2023 to deliver:Mid-single-digit organic revenue growth;A stable adjusted operating margin;A strong cash flow  with a cash conversion10 above 90%.BUREAU VERITAS’ CSR EVOLUTION IN 2022Bureau Veritas helps companies  governments and public authorities reduce their risks in terms of health  quality  safety  environmental protection and social responsibility. Those challenges are central to societal aspirations. Being a Business to Business to Society company comes with a duty: to be exemplary in terms of sustainability internally  and to be a role model for industry in terms of positive impact on people and the planet.Bureau Veritas’ CSR commitment recognized by non-financial ratingsThe Group’s commitment is to act responsibly in order to Shape a Better World. This commitment was again recognized by several non-financial ratings throughout 2022. This is a testament to Bureau Veritas constant efforts regarding Sustainability.The main non-financial ratings updated during 2022 are as follows:Moody’s E SG Solutions has ranked Bureau Veritas 1 st in the European business support services sector  in August 2022  among 99 companies. Bureau Veritas obtained a score of 70/100  compared to 66 in 2021  according to 38 ESG criteria;Sustainalytics has ranked Bureau Veritas 1 st among 69 companies of the Research & Consulting subindustry in October 2022. Bureau Veritas obtained 10.1 points to its ESG Risk Rating (Low risk).

This assessment is the basis of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI);Institutional Investor has ranked Bureau Veritas Best ESG Top 2 within the Business & Employment Services sector  which encompassed 60 companies in total.Bureau Veritas is included in the CAC40 ESG index since September 2021. The CAC40 ESG is a Euronext index intended to identify the 40 companies which demonstrate the best practices in environmental  social and governance areas.ANALYSIS OF THE GROUP'S RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITIONRevenue up 13.4% year on year (7.8% on an organic basis)Revenue in 2022 amounted to EUR 5 650.6 million  a 13.4% increase compared with 2021. The organic increase was 7.8%  benefiting from solid trends across most businesses and most geographies.Four businesses delivered high single-digit to low double-digit organic revenue growth  with Industry up 11.4%  Marine & Offshore 9.4%  Agri-Food & Commodities 9.3% and Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) 7.6%. The remainder of the portfolio saw low to mid organic revenue growth with Certification  up 5.5% and Consumer Products  up 1.0%.By geography  activities in the Americas strongly outperformed the rest of the Group (27% of revenue; up 17.4% organically)  led by a 11.8% increase in North America (B&I driven) and by a 27.8% increase in Latin America (Brazil driven). Europe (34% of revenue; up 4.8% organically) was primarily led by strong activity levels in Southern Europe and in the Netherlands. The activity in Asia Pacific (30% of revenue; up 2.2% organically) benefited from robust growth in Australia as well as strong growth in South-East Asian countries (notably Vietnam and India) while was impacted by the several lockdowns which occurred in China. Finally  in Africa and Middle East (9% of revenue)  business increased by 14.5% on an organic basis  essentially driven by B&I and energy projects in the Middle East.The scope effect was a positive 0.9% (including 1.6% in the last quarter)  reflecting the four bolt-on acquisitions realized in the year 2022  alongside those of the prior year.Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of 4.7% (including a positive impact of 3.0% in Q4 2022)  mainly due to the strong appreciation of the USD and pegged currencies against the euro  which was partly offset by the depreciation of some emerging countries’ currencies.Adjusted operating profit up 12.5% to EUR 902.1 millionAdjusted operating profit increased by 12.5% to EUR 902.1 million; the 2022 adjusted operating margin decreased by 13 basis points to 16.0%  including a 6 basis-point positive foreign exchange impact and a 1-basis point negative scope impact. Excluding the Chinese impact  it progressed by c.10 basis points to 16.2%.CHANGE IN ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN IN PERCENTAGE AND BASIS POINTS 2021 adjusted operating margin 16.1% Organic change (18)bps Organic adjusted operating margin 15.9% Scope (1)bps Adjusted operating margin at constant currency 15.9% Currency +6bps 2022 adjusted operating margin 16.0%Two businesses experienced higher organic margins thanks to operational leverage in a context of revenue recovery and positive mix effect: Marine & Offshore (24.1%  margin up 166 basis point) and Agri-Food & Commodities (14.4%  margin up 98 basis point). Two other businesses maintained their healthy margin  Consumer Products and Certification. Two businesses saw margin decline  namely Buildings & Infrastructure and Industry  as they were impacted by lockdown measures in China  contract terminations and portfolio mix effect.Adjustment items increased to EUR 102.8 million versus EUR 83.0 million in 2021. These include:EUR 65.7 million in amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions (EUR 64.1 million in 2021);EUR 10.2 million in write-offs of non-current assets related to laboratory consolidations (EUR 4.9 million in 2021);EUR 31.2 million in restructuring costs (EUR 6.9 million in 2021);EUR 4.3 million in net gains on disposals and acquisitions (net losses of EUR 7.1 million in 2021).Operating profit totaled EUR 799.3 million  up 11.2% from EUR 718.8 million in 2021.Adjusted EPS reached EUR 1.18  up 10.7% year on yearNet finance costs decreased to EUR 72.4 million (vs. EUR 74.7 million in 2021)  reflecting mainly the increase in the income from cash and cash equivalents as a result of the interest rates hikes in 2022.The foreign exchange impact is a positive EUR 4.6 million (vs. a positive EUR 6.6 million in 2021) due to the appreciation of the US dollar against the Euro and the appreciation of the US dollar and the Euro against most emerging market currencies.Other items (including interest cost on pension plans and other financial expenses) stood ata negative EUR 13.6 million  up from a negative EUR 5.2 million in 2021.As a result  net financial expenses increased to EUR 81.4 million in full-year 2022 compared with EUR 73.3 million in 2021.Income tax expense totaled EUR 233.4 million in 2022  compared with EUR 199.3 million in 2021.This represents an effective tax rate (ETR - income tax expense divided by profit before tax) of 32.5% for the period  compared with 30.9% in 2021. The adjusted ETR is up 150 basis points at 31.6%  compared with 2021. The increase is due to the rise in tax losses over the period without recognition of deferred tax assets and tax costs  such as withholding taxes  that are not directly calculated by reference to taxable income.Attributable net profit in 2022 was EUR 466.7 million  vs. a EUR 420.9 million profit in 2021.Earnings per share (EPS) stood at EUR 1.03 vs. EUR 0.93 in 2021.Adjusted attributable net profit totaled EUR 533.9 million  up 11.0% vs. EUR 480.8 million in 2021.Adjusted EPS stood at EUR 1.18  a 10.7% increase vs. EUR 1.07 in 2021.Strong free cash flow at EUR 657 million driven by operating performanceFull year 2022 operating cash flow increased by 5.6% to EUR 834.9 million vs. EUR 790.7 million in 2021. It benefited from the increase in profit before income tax  largely offset by higher income taxes  restructuring charges and higher capex. Despite the strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter  the working capital requirement outflow remained under control (at EUR 12.5 million  compared to a EUR 13.6. million outflow the previous year).Working capital requirement (WCR) stood at EUR 341.1 million at December 31  2022  compared to EUR 313.3 million at December 31  2021. As a percentage of revenue  WCR slightly decreased by 30 basis points to 6.0%  compared to 6.3% in 2021  which was a record low in a context of limited revenue growth. This showed the continued strong focus of the entire organization on cash metrics  with key initiatives implemented under the Move For Cash program (optimizing the “invoice to cash” process  accelerating billing and cash collection processes throughout the Group reinforced by a central task force  and daily monitoring cash inflows).Purchases of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  net of disposals (Net Capex)  amounted to EUR 125.4 million in 2022  an increase compared to EUR 114.5 million in 2021. This showed disciplined control over the Group’s net capex-to-revenue ratio of 2.2%  broadly stable compared to the level in 2021.Free cash flow (operating cash flow after tax  interest expenses and capex) wasEUR 657.0 million  compared to EUR 603.0 million in 2021  up 9.0% year on year  notably led by currency moves  a reversing trend versus 2021. On an organic basis  free cash flow was up 2.6% year on year.CHANGE IN FREE CASH FLOW IN EUR MILLIONS Free cash flow at December 31  2021 603.0 Organic change 15.9 Organic free cash flow 618.9 Scope 9.2 Free cash flow at constant currency 628.1 Currency 28.9 Free cash flow at December 31  2022 657.0At December 31  2022  adjusted net financial debt was EUR 975.3 million  i.e. 0.97x trailingtwelve-month EBITDA as defined in the calculation of the bank covenant  compared with 1.10x at December 31  2021. The decrease in adjusted net financial debt of EUR 76.1 million versusDecember 31  2021 (EUR 1 051.4 million) reflects:Free cash flow of EUR 657.0 million;Dividend payments totaling EUR 280.9 million;Acquisitions (net) and repayment of amounts owed to shareholders  accounting for EUR 95.1 million;Lease payments (related to the application of IFRS 16)  accounting for EUR 139.0 million;Other items that increased the Group's debt by EUR 65.9 million (including foreign exchange and share buybacks).2022 BUSINESS REVIEWMARINE & OFFSHOREIN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 418.3 375.2 +11.5% +9.4% - +2.1% Adjusted operating profit 100.7 84.1 +19.7% Adjusted operating margin 24.1% 22.4% +166bps +130bps - +36bpsMarine & Offshore activity recorded strong 9.4% growth on an organic basis in 2022. In the fourth quarter  organic revenue achieved an exceptional 15.8%  a reflection of a very high growth for the Core In-service activity. The full year organic growth performance results were fueled by:High single-digit growth in New Construction (39% of divisional revenue)  which benefited from the momentum of new order intake in the prior year  notably in Asia  and for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) fueled ships;Low double-digit growth in the Core In-service activity (46% of divisional revenue)  a reflection of several positive factors: i) exceptional level of activity for occasional surveys due to postponement of periodical surveys  notably in the last quarter  following the Covid-19 lockdowns in China; ii) one-off regulatory benefit with water ballast management services (with a December 2022 deadline to carry out water ballast survey for some ships) iii) solid pricing management; iv) the fleet’s modest growth. The fleet classed by Bureau Veritas continued to grow in 2022 (up 0.7% on a yearly basis)  led by all sectors. At year end  it comprised 11 609 ships  representing 143.6 million of Gross Register Tonnage (GRT);Mid-single-digit growth for Services (15% of divisional revenue  including Offshore)  benefiting from the diversification of services and strong commercial development for non-classification services including consulting services related to energy efficiency. During 2022  the Group strengthened its business development teams and opened branches in Australia and Korea. Conversely  the demand for risk assessment services in the Offshore Oil & Gas market was mixed while the year confirmed a significant increase in investments by oil players in offshore wind projects  both land-based and floating.The shipping market maintained a very positive momentum in 2022 with a level in worldwide new orders (in GRT) slightly above the average over the past 25 years. It was driven by a massive investment in LNG carriers and container ships. At year end  more than 60% of orders for new ships were based on dual fuel systems  which benefited to Bureau Veritas given its leadership position in the field. As a result  the Group’s new orders totaled 9.0 million gross tons in 2022  up 12.5% from 8.0 million gross tons in the prior-year period. The order book  which remains very diversified  stood at 20.1 million gross tons at the end of the year  up 23.3% year on year and compared to 16.3 million gross tons in 2021.Adjusted operating margin for the year improved by 166 basis points to 24.1% compared to 2021. Organically  it rose by 130 basis points  led by operating leverage and a positive mix.Sustainability achievementsIn a constantly evolving technological and regulatory landscape  Bureau Veritas continued to address the challenges of Sustainability and the energy transition by providing rules and guidelines for the safety  risk and performance requirements for innovation in future fuels and propulsion systems. The Group helped its clients comply with environmental regulations  implement Sustainable solutions on board  and measure progress in decarbonization.Amongst services and solutions delivered in 2022  the Group continued to support the deployment of offshore wind farms by developing a protocol  leading to certification  to help derisk for Subsea Power cables. Bureau Veritas Marine & Offshore also published a white paper detailing alternative fuels for the shipping industry  taking into account technology maturity  availability  safety  emissions and regulations.The Group estimates that decarbonization of shipping will continue to drive many market opportunities in 2023.AGRI-FOOD & COMMODITIESIN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 1 224.8 1 065.2 +15.0% +9.3% (0.2)% +5.9% Adjusted operating profit 176.0 142.5 +23.5% Adjusted operating margin 14.4% 13.4% +98bps +103bps +1bps (6)bpsThe Agri-Food & Commodities business delivered organic revenue growth of 9.3% in 2022  with strong trends for all activities apart Agri-Food. Q4 recorded 10.2% organic growth.The Oil & Petrochemicals segment (O&P  31% of divisional revenue) showed a steady recovery in the year  which was confirmed in the last quarter. The O&P Trade market achieved a high-single-digit organic revenue growth and benefited from increased testing volumes due to higher fuel consumption  notably for aviation fuel/gasoline  and price increase initiatives. Growth was particularly strong in the US (market share gains)  Europe and in the Middle East (new services). Both locations benefited from the trade flow route changes triggered by the Russia/Ukraine war. Double digit organic revenue growth was maintained for non-trade related services and value-added segments  an area where the Group continued to further reposition its portfolio: Oil Condition Monitoring  fuel marking program  biofuels (made from animal oil or cooking oil for instance)  Sustainable Aviation Fuel or Liquefied Natural Gas.Metals & Minerals (M&M  33% of divisional revenue) achieved double-digit organic growth overall  across the entire value chain. Upstream (circa two-thirds of M&M) continued to record strong growth  across the Group’s key hubs (Latin America  Canada and Australia). In mining related testing  the growth outlook remained solid driven by demand for metals to support the energy transition. The slowdown in demand for geochemistry services was triggered by tightening financial conditions for junior ‘greenfields’ explorers (notably for gold) although the situation eased in the last quarter. The Group continued to successfully develop its on-site labs business with key wins in all the main mining geographies. This contributed to the growth and an increase in revenue predictability. Trade activities reported double-digit organic revenue growth led by Asia  Latin America and Middle East & Africa. It was fueled by the main metals and coal which remained in high demand as a substitute for natural gas. The mega trends for electrification in many economies also continued to support a high demand for copper and base metals.The Agri-Food segment (21% of divisional revenue) recorded a low single-digit organic revenue growth in the year  led by Agricultural products. The Agricultural inspection activities grew strongly  primarily led by Brazil  which notably benefited from a record level of export of soybean and corn crops. It was also led by Asia (strong activity level for sugar and rice notably) and by Middle East. In Europe  business improved in the second half of the year although it remained disrupted by the impact of the Russia/Ukraine war on Black Sea exports. Conversely  the Agri Upstream business  including fertilizer services  was impacted in the Black Sea region on the back of continuous tension since the outbreak of the war. The Food business slightly decreased organically  reflecting a contrasted geographic situation: strong performance in the Middle East  Africa and the US (new greenfield labs opening)  while weak in the Group’s key hubs  Canada (contract terminations partly offset by new location) and Australia (Covid-19 related disruption).Government services (15% of divisional revenue) delivered a strong double-digit organic growth in the year (including a 20.2% increase in the fourth quarter) across most geographies. Strong activity level on existing contracts (benefiting from the increased value of inspected goods) as well as the ramp-up of several new contracts fueled the growth. This included the strong development of Verification of Conformity in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)  Nigeria  Zimbabwe  Tanzania  and Single Window contracts in DRC. In the Middle East  the activity also improved with the ramp-up of a contract in Iraq.Adjusted operating margin for the year jumped by c. 100 basis points to 14.4% from 13.4% in 2021. This was due to strong operational leverage  fueled by the growth recovery  the benefit of better operational excellence and a positive mix.Sustainability achievementsThe Group is building transparency and promoting Sustainability from farm to fork with its global  end-to-end expertise covering inspection  audit & certification  and testing services. It is committed to supporting responsible use of natural resources and animal welfare  as well as ensuring the reliability of complex supply chains  enabling end consumers to make informed decisions.INDUSTRYIN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 1 181.0 1 013.5 +16.5% +11.4% (0.6) % +5.7% Adjusted operating profit 139.1 126.6 +9.9% Adjusted operating margin 11.8% 12.5% (71)bps (102)bps +16bps +15bpsIndustry was amongst the best performing businesses within the Group’s portfolio in the full year with organic growth of 11.4%  across the board. In Q4  Industry organic revenue increased by 13.2%.By geography  most regions delivered strong growth in the year  with Latin America leading the way alongside Asia  and North America. Growth was less pronounced in Europe  in Africa and in Middle East.By market  Power & Utilities (13% of divisional revenue) delivered steady growth in 2022  supported by both Opex and Capex services. The activity was solid in Latin America (Argentina and Colombia) with the continued ramp-up of contract wins with various Power Distribution clients (power grid maintenance and domestic meters readings)  although the Group has been more selective on contracts profitability. In Europe  growth was primarily fueled by France and the UK (with high activity levels in nuclear power plants)  and Spain (power generation). In the current context of energy crisis  nuclear power generation has regained traction and provides mid-term attractive growth Capex opportunities for the Group.Renewable Power Generation (solar  wind  hydrogen) saw accelerating trends given the energy crisis  with a double-digit organic performance in 2022. The growth opportunities continued to be focused on Capex projects  with numerous offshore and onshore Wind and Battery Energy Storage projects. In the US  Bradley Construction Management (solar energy construction projects)  has shown an improving sales pipeline with easing supply chain difficulties related to shortage of components and benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act bill (tax incentives) in H2. The Group’s low carbon power generation business (renewable energies and nuclear) now largely exceeds revenues from Oil & Gas capex projects.In Oil & Gas (33% of divisional revenue)  the activity remained well oriented and grew double digit organically throughout the year. Two-thirds of the business rely on Opex-related activities which delivered 22.4% growth as they benefited from the conversion of a solid sales pipeline as well as a catch-up effect of projects which were put on hold or delayed in 2021. This was triggered by the companies’ willingness to manage their assets in a more Sustainable manner (low carbon strategy towards net zero target). Large contracts ramped up in Asia (China led)  Middle East (outsourcing monitoring activities) and Latin America  in particular  Brazil (market share gains) and Argentina (volume and price led). In Canada  the site assessment and remediation activities contributed to the growth (favorable weather in most regions).Oil & Gas investment accelerated during the year  triggered by rising oil prices. The Group’s Capex-related activities  including Procurement Services (c. 2% of Group revenue) achieved high single-digit organic revenue growth  thanks to multiple medium-sized contracts wins with international energy companies. It was primarily led by Asia Pacific (China essentially) and Latin America. In the US  the drilling activity was supported by the increase in the number of rigs.Elsewhere  the aerospace business saw a revenue stream decline following the decision to exit the business in Russia  and the automotive business grew little  still impacted by supply chain disruption.Adjusted operating margin for the year was 11.8%  down 71 basis points from 12.5% in 2021. It is attributable to the termination of low margin Opex contracts and the exit of the aerospace unit in Russia.Sustainability achievementsBureau Veritas is an important player in the energy transition  present at key stages of the renewable and alternative energy production chain. In 2022  the Group was selected to undertake many projects. This includes the project certification of Bada Energy’s Gray Whale 3  a major floating offshore wind farm project in Ulsan  Republic of Korea (capacity of approx. 500 MW)  in which the Group  in partnership with the Korean Register  will provide project certification services (conformity assessment related to design  manufacturing  transportation  installation  and operation). In the last quarter  the Group was also awarded a contract with Woodfibre LNG LTD in Canada to provide the quality control support for the whole LNG project bringing single window solution for all of the clients’ quality needs overseeing the EPC and vendors.BUILDINGS & INFRASTRUCTUREIN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 1 664.0 1 458.4 +14.1% +7.6% +2.2% +4.3% Adjusted operating profit 228.7 208.7 +9.6% Adjusted operating margin 13.7% 14.3% (56)bps (65)bps (2)bps +11bpsThe Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) business achieved strong organic growth of 7.6% in the year  primarily fueled by the Americas and by the Middle East. In the fourth quarter  revenue rose 11.5% organically.Double-digit organic revenue growth was achieved in Construction-related activities (Capex; 55% of divisional revenue) and mid-single-digit growth in Buildings In-service activities (45% of divisional revenue).The Americas region (27% of divisional revenue) experienced very strong double-digit growth  primarily led by the US and Brazil. In the United States  a strong dynamic was maintained throughout the year (up 18.4% organically) across the Group’s diversified portfolio of activities: data center commissioning services (up 21.8%)  where the Group has a leading expertise and benefits from the verticalization of the business and its international deployment; project management assistance for Opex-related services  with large contracts ramp-up in the Retail market; technical control and station product conformity services for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations  still benefiting from successful wins with many operators in North America. The integration of the latest acquisitions  PreScience and C.A.P  focusing on transportation infrastructure  are progressing as planned and both benefit from a growing pipeline. In Latin America  the Group delivered a very strong growth with Brazil leading the way thanks to the ramp-up of large capex contracts for industrial and steel facilities alongside infrastructure projects. Argentina also contributed to the growth  benefiting notably from a large project for the domestic water grid pipelines installation.In Asia Pacific (20% of divisional revenue)  the business activity suffered from the Covid-19-related disruption in China. The Group’s Chinese operations declined 9.2% organically in the year  with the impact of the lockdown measures in the second quarter and the “stop and go” policy in the second half with sites required to shut down as soon as the slightest suspicion of Covid-19 arose. This included a 11.7% decrease in Q4 due to positive cases and the resulting high level of absenteeism. While the short-term visibility is limited  the Group remains confident for the medium term and still expects to benefit from the Chinese government’s support to the domestic economy through long-term infrastructure spending. Elsewhere  the activity grew strongly in Japan (led by code compliance services) and in India (up 26.1% organically).In Europe (50% of divisional revenue)  growth was moderate overall. A strong performance was delivered in Italy (ramp-up of large contract wins on the motorway network)  the Netherlands (Opex led) and Spain (regulatory driven). France  the region’s largest contributor  grew 2.7% organically. Momentum remained solid in the In-service activity (around three quarters of the French operations)  mostly regulatory driven and reflected the delivery of a healthy backlog. A double-digit organic revenue growth for Bureau Veritas Solutions (technical assistance; consulting services) was triggered by the increase in headcount and a sustained momentum in energy efficiency program services (including the white certificates for eligible projects). The Group’s Capex-related work slightly rebounded  in an improving new build market and benefiting from a higher weighting towards infrastructure and public works. The pipeline of sales related to the numerous investment programs in the European Union (including the Green Deal and the upcoming 2024 Olympic Games in France) continued to grow and add to the revenue visibility.Lastly  in the Middle East & Africa region (3% of divisional revenue)  the Group achieved very strong growth as it continued to benefit from the development of numerous projects as oil prices rebounded (Saudi Arabia).Adjusted operating margin for the year declined by 56 basis points to 13.7% from 14.3% in 2021. This was attributed to the impact from the Chinese lockdown measures during the year and portfolio mix effect.Sustainability achievementsDuring the year  the Group has been the partner of a major transport infrastructure project in France (with SGP for the Paris Metro Line 18 project Phase 2) with environmental control  execution of sampling & analysis campaign (several pollutants) for the Project Manager to control the conformity of works to its environmental policy. In the last quarter  the Group was awarded several EVCS contracts with pilot sites across the US and Canada in the automotive sector for dealership program  site surveys and engineering.CERTIFICATIONIN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 428.3 398.2 +7.6% +5.5% +0.1% +2.0% Adjusted operating profit 81.4 75.5 +7.9% Adjusted operating margin 19.0% 19.0% +6bps (2)bps (3)bps +11bpsThe Certification business delivered an organic revenue growth of 5.5% in the year including 7.0% in the last quarter. The growth was supported by both volume and robust price increases across most geographies and schemes. Strong activity levels were notably achieved in Sustainability-driven solutions.All geographies grew organically. Latin America  Africa  the Middle East and Asia Pacific performed above the divisional average  led by a solid commercial development and strong traction for Sustainability-driven services. The Group capitalized on its diversification strategy with the strongest growth recorded in countries where the business mix has been significantly diversified in recent years (shift from traditional QHSE schemes towards new services). This was illustrated by Brazil (second party audits)  Australia  Vietnam  India (ESG driven)  Thailand and the UK (Sustainability driven)  which all saw double-digit organic growth in the year. North America and Europe (Germany notably)  more geared to QHSE and Transportation schemes  performed below the average  notably impacted by challenging comparables following several recertification schemes in 2021.During the year  the Certification business continued to be led by the increased client demand for more brand protection  traceability  and social responsibility commitments all along the supply chain. Within the Group’s portfolio  double-digit growth was recorded in Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability  Enterprise Risks (led by Cybersecurity) and Training & Personnel services; and high single-digit growth was achieved in Food certification (fueled by Organic Food Products and Food Safety) across most geographies. In Q4  the Group won the inspection food safety contract for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.Bureau Veritas’ Sustainability-related services for Certification delivered strong growth throughout the year  up 18% organically  a reflection of a strong demand for verification of carbon emissions  supply chain audits on ESG topics  Assurance of Sustainability Reporting and Wood Management Systems Certification. While the market is mainly driven by voluntary checks from companies  the regulation will soon play a more important role in the future (European directive  German Supply Chain Act  etc.). In Latin America  very strong growth was delivered as the Group benefited from the build-up of dedicated local sales teams and the development of local schemes (BV ESG 360 in Brazil  Casa Colombia in Colombia) and the leverage of international ones (Energy and Forest management system certification).The benefits for portfolio diversification continued to drive growth. A particularly strong momentum was achieved in high value  mission-critical solutions dedicated to Anti-bribery  Asset Management  IT Service Management Information Security  and Business Continuity  in all geographies. In 2022  the Cybersecurity offering achieved a 30% organic revenue growth  primarily led by Europe and by increasing demand for transparency and control of IT and security systems.Adjusted operating margin for the year was maintained at a healthy 19.0%  up 6 basis points compared to the prior year. This reflects operational leverage  tight cost control and the benefit of some remote audits (in China essentially).Sustainability achievementsThrough Clarity  the first solution to help companies manage their ESG strategy  measure its performance and track its implementation  Bureau Veritas enables companies to bring transparency and credibility to their ESG commitments and put their Sustainability strategy in motion.In the last quarter of 2022  Bureau Veritas was awarded a pre-audit contract by Teleperformance in seven countries (including Colombia)  after the opening of an investigation into the company’s moderation activities. Bureau Veritas acted as a third-party to deliver an independent assurance about the use and inclusion of International Standard ISO 26000 – Guidance on Social Responsibility. The Group has also been renewed by Nestlé to provide independent assurance of Sustainability reporting. In Austria  the Group was selected by the market leader in the refractory industry to conduct on-site supplier ESG audits.CONSUMER PRODUCTSIN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 734.2 670.6 +9.5% +1.0% +3.2% +5.3% Adjusted operating profit 176.2 164.4 +7.2% Adjusted operating margin 24.0% 24.5% (52)bps +3bps (49)bps (6)bpsAfter being the best performing division within the Group’s portfolio in 2021  Consumer Products faced significant challenges in 2022 due to the mobility restrictions in China (57% of divisional revenue) in Q2 and Q3. As a result  organic growth was 1.0% being impacted by regional mobility restrictions in China and the surge in Covid-19 cases in Q4  as well as by the economic downturn leading to less product launches and high inventory from clients. In the last quarter  organic revenue decreased by 4.4%.By geography  the Middle East was the best performer  while Americas and Europe delivered mid-single digit growth performances over the year. Posting double digit and mid-single digit growths  Southern and Southeastern Asia benefited from the diversification strategy leveraging sourcing shift implemented by the Group  notably in Vietnam  Bangladesh  India and Sri Lanka.Softlines (34% of divisional revenue) performed better than the divisional average in the year  demonstrating the agility of the business model induced by the diversification strategy. China suffered from strong Covid-19-related disruptions caused by the lockdown measures as well as by the surge of new cases at the end of the year. But growth was primarily fueled by the Southern and Southeastern Asian countries which continued to benefit from a structural sourcing shift out of China and by the more conjunctural diversion of samples from the regions of China impacted by mobility restrictions during some parts of the year. Western Europe outperformed whilst benefiting from the near shoring sourcing trends from retailers as well as from solid dynamics from luxury brands  notably in Germany and Italy.Hardlines (10% of divisional revenue) and Cosmetics  Health & Beauty (4% of divisional revenue) underperformed the divisional average  with mid-single digit decline over the year  as a result of the global slowdown in consumer demand impacting mostly the Chinese activities. Toys (7% of divisional revenue) displayed an almost stable performance over the year.Inspection and Audit services (12% of divisional revenue) performed well with high-single digit organic growth led mainly by strong momentum on CSR audits revolving around Sustainability solutions such as green textile  across all countries.Lastly  Technology11 (33% of divisional revenue) performed roughly in line with the divisional average  with a double-digit organic growth in Automotive  on the back of a good traction on new mobility (testing on electric vehicle engines  dashboards or charging stations) especially in China  Western Europe and North America. Wireless Testing (wireless technologies/Internet of Things (IoT) products) underperformed the divisional average due to project delays and Covid-19-related disruptions mainly impacting some of the Asian countries.The integration of the three companies acquired this year (ATL  AMSfashion and Galbraith Laboratories) as part of the diversification strategy is still ongoing  with performances ramping up in line with expectations. The Group will strive to pursue its acquisition strategy in a disciplined and selective approach to take full advantage of the development opportunities linked to near shoring trends and to the extension of its global footprint in new fast-growing markets.Adjusted operating margin for the Consumer Products division was maintained at a strong 24.0% level  showing stability organically despite a weak topline growth and the negative impact from the Chinese Covid-19 disruption. On a reported basis  it declined by 52 basis points due to the dilutive effect from acquisitions.Sustainability achievementsIn 2022  one of the world’s leading athleisure brands has joined Bureau Veritas’ Sustainable Chemical Management program and is leveraging BVE3 for their environmental emissions management. BVE3 Environmental Emissions Evaluator is a Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) recognized digital solution and a digital chemical inventory management tool  which is uniquely designed for the textile  apparel and footwear industry. It allows factories to add the chemical inventory details and enables companies to understand chemical controls and helps in the mission towards Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals.PRESENTATION Full year 2022 results will be presented on Thursday  February 23  2023  at 3:00 p.m. (Paris time) A video conference will be webcast live.

RECONCILIATION WITH IFRSThe management process used by Bureau Veritas is based on a series of alternative performance indicators  as presented below. These indicators were defined for the purposes of preparing the Group’s budgets and internal and external reporting. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators provide additional useful information to financial statement users  enabling them to better understand the Group’s performance  especially its operating performance. Some of these indicators represent benchmarks in the testing  inspection and certification (TIC) business and are commonly used and tracked by the financial community. These alternative performance indicators should be seen as a complement to IFRS-compliant indicators and the resulting changes.GROWTHTotal revenue growthThe total revenue growth percentage measures changes in consolidated revenue between the previous year and the current year. Total revenue growth has three components:organic growth;impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (scope effect);impact of changes in exchange rates (currency effect).Organic growthThe Group internally monitors and publishes “organic” revenue growth  which it considers to be more representative of the Group’s operating performance in each of its business sectors.The main measure used to manage and track consolidated revenue growth is like-for-like  or organic growth. Determining organic growth enables the Group to monitor trends in its business excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control  as well as scope effects  which concern new businesses or businesses that no longer form part of the business portfolio. Organic growth is used to monitor the Group’s performance internally.Bureau Veritas considers that organic growth provides management and investors with a more comprehensive understanding of its underlying operating performance and current business trends  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestments (outright divestments as well as the unplanned suspension of operations – in the event of international sanctions  for example) and changes in exchange rates for businesses exposed to foreign exchange volatility  which can mask underlying trends.The Group also considers that separately presenting organic revenue generated by its businesses provides management and investors with useful information on trends in its industrial businesses  and enables a more direct comparison with other companies in its industry.Organic revenue growth represents the percentage of revenue growth  presented at Group level and for each business  based on constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods:constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation over a 12-month period;constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.Scope effectTo establish a meaningful comparison between reporting periods  the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation is determined:for acquisitions carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the current year;for acquisitions carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the months in the previous year in which they were not consolidated;for disposals and divestments carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year in the months of the current year in which they were not part of the Group;for disposals and divestments carried out in the previous year  by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year prior to their disposal/divestment.Currency effectThe currency effect is calculated by translating revenue for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT AND ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGINAdjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin are key indicators used to measure the performance of the business  excluding material items that cannot be considered inherent to the Group’s underlying intrinsic performance owing to their nature. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators  presented at Group level and for each business  are more representative of the operating performance in its industry.Adjusted operating profitAdjusted operating profit represents operating profit prior to adjustments for the following:amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions;impairment of goodwill;impairment and retirement of non-current assets;gains and losses on disposals of businesses and other income and expenses relating to acquisitions (fees and costs on acquisitions of businesses  contingent consideration on acquisitions of businesses);restructuring costs.When an acquisition is carried out during the financial year  the amortization of the related intangible assets is calculated on a time proportion basis.Since a measurement period of 12 months is allowed for determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  amortization of intangible assets in the year of acquisition may  in some cases  be based on a temporary measurement and be subject to minor adjustments in the subsequent reporting period  once the definitive value of the intangible assets is known.Organic adjusted operating profit represents operating profit adjusted for scope and currency effects over comparable periods:at constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period;at constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of operating profit and adjusted operating profit.Adjusted operating marginAdjusted operating margin expressed as a percentage represents adjusted operating profit divided by revenue. Adjusted operating margin can be presented on an organic basis or at constant exchange rates  thereby  in the latter case  providing a view of the Group’s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control.ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATEThe effective tax rate (ETR) represents income tax expense divided by the amount of pre-tax profit.The adjusted effective tax rate (adjusted ETR) represents income tax expense adjusted for the tax effect on adjustment items divided by pre-tax profit before taking into account the adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition).ADJUSTED NET PROFITAdjusted attributable net profitAdjusted attributable net profit is defined as attributable net profit adjusted for adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition) and for the tax effect on adjustment items. Adjusted attributable net profit excludes non-controlling interests in adjustment items and only concerns continuing operations.Adjusted attributable net profit can be presented at constant exchange rates  thereby providing a view of the Group’s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control. The currency effect is calculated by translating the various income statement items for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.Adjusted attributable net profit per shareAdjusted attributable net profit per share (adjusted EPS or earnings per share) is defined as adjusted attributable net profit divided by the weighted average number of shares in the period.FREE CASH FLOWFree cash flow represents net cash generated from operating activities (operating cash flow)  adjusted for the following items:purchases of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets;proceeds from disposals of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets;interest paid.Net cash generated from operating activities is shown after income tax paid.Organic free cash flow represents free cash flow at constant scope and exchange rates over comparable periods:at constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period;at constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of net cash generated from operating activities and free cash flow.FINANCIAL DEBTGross debtGross debt (or gross finance costs/financial debt) represents bank loans and borrowings plus bank overdrafts.Net debtNet debt (or net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Group represents gross debt less cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents comprise marketable securities and similar receivables as well as cash at bank and on hand.Adjusted net debtAdjusted net debt (or adjusted net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Group represents net debt taking into account currency and interest rate hedging instruments.CONSOLIDATED EBITDAConsolidated EBITDA represents net profit before interest  tax  depreciation  amortization and provisions  adjusted for any entities acquired over the last 12 months. Consolidated EBITDA is used by the Group to track its bank covenants.1 Alternative performance indicators are presented  defined and reconciled with IFRS in appendices 6 and 7 of this press release.2 Ratio of adjusted net financial debt divided by consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest  tax  depreciation  amortization and provisions)  adjusted for any entities acquired over the last 12 months.3 Proposed dividend  subject to Shareholders’ Meeting approval on June 22  2023.4 Net cash generated from operating activities/Adjusted Operating Profit.5 TAR: Total Accident Rate (number of accidents with and without lost time x 200 000/number of hours worked).6 Proportion of women from the Executive Committee to Band II (internal grade corresponding to a management or executive management position) in the Group (number of women on a full-time equivalent basis in a leadership position/total number of full-time equivalents in leadership positions).7 Greenhouse gas emissions from offices and laboratories  tons of CO 2 equivalent net emissions per employee and per year corresponding to scopes 1  2 and 3 (emissions related to business travel).8 A new training  following the update of the Code of Ethics  was rolled out in the second half of 2021. The calculation of the indicator became more demanding since 2021. It is no longer limited to measuring the training of only new employees recruited during the year but focuses on measuring the percentage of employees trained  regardless of their length of service.9 Ratio of adjusted net financial debt divided by consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest  tax  depreciation  amortization and provisions)  adjusted for any entities acquired over the last 12 months10 Net cash generated from operating activities/Adjusted Operating Profit.11 Technology segment comprises Electrical & Electronics  Wireless testing activities and Automotive connectivity testing activities.Attachment,positive,0.67,0.32,0.0,mixed,0.69,0.15,0.16,True,English,"['BUREAU VERITAS', 'Strong operating', 'financial performance', 'Solid 2023 outlook', 'main consolidated financial items', 'Deputy Chief Executive Officer', 'Mid-single-digit organic revenue growth', 'sound 7.8% organic revenue growth', 'stable adjusted operating margin', 'sound financial structure', 'Chinese lockdown impact', 'disciplined capex policy', 'working capital requirement', 'several non-financial ratings', 'significant growth opportunities', 'current macro uncertainties', 'total annualized revenue', 'Covid-19 related disruption', 'healthy sales pipeline', 'strong topline growth', 'Free cash flow', 'strong financial position', 'net debt/EBITDA ratio', 'BV Green Line', 'Consumer Products Services', 'clients’ preferred partner', 'Group balance sheet', 'Attributable net profit', 'Strong cash conversion', 'strong cash flow', 'diversified business portfolio', 'Bureau Veritas’ future', 'full year results', 'Strong operating', 'strong results', 'operating profit', 'financial performance', 'financial statements', 'Diversified portfolio', 'payout ratio', 'Covid-19-related disruption', 'Group revenue', 'strong capacity', 'Group sales', 'cash conversion4', 'PRESS RELEASE', '2022 Key figures1', 'fourth quarter', 'entire portfolio', '90% target set', 'fixed rate', 'four bolt', 'strategic areas', 'Good progress', '2025 CSR ambitions', 'Didier Michaud-Daniel', 'geographical footprint', 'proven model', 'TIC sector', 'Hinda Gharbi', 'leadership qualities', 'next level', 'outstanding performance', 'clients’ trust', 'great ambition', 'solid portfolio', 'track record', 'reliable execution', 'resilient management', 'regulatory compliance', 'new value', 'strong commitment', 'The Group', 'Solid 2023 outlook', 'ESG-related solutions', 'hard work', 'ESG goals', 'Sustainability assurance', 'France', 'February', 'basis', 'share', 'December', 'EUR', '2022 Highlights', 'delivery', 'geographies', 'China', 'consequences', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'momentum', 'Strengthening', 'deleveraging', 'Increase', 'Board', 'company', 'Acquisition', 'companies', 'Buildings', 'Infrastructure', 'Story', 'account', 'confidence', 'prospects', 'terms', 'stakeholders', 'vision', 'tribute', 'employees', '140 countries', 'agility', 'congratulations', 'colleagues', 'contributions', 'anticipation', 'imperatives', 'excellence', 'sectors', 'diversity', 'people', 'knowledge', 'skills', 'thinking', 'core', 'innovation', 'digital', 'heart', 'Directors', 'MILLIONS']",2023-02-23,2023-02-24,finance.yahoo.com

We are therefore especially proud that our employees have made a huge effort to continue supplying feed to our customers on time and as agreed  even when the availability of raw materials became uncertain as a result of the dreadful war in Ukraine. Our volumes decreased  mainly due to the decline in the pig sector as a result of the contraction in this sector. Nevertheless  we achieved solid underlying EBITDA and underlying net profit that was higher than last year. This was thanks to tightened processes and a strong contribution from the Germany/Poland cluster and despite the sharp rise in raw material and energy prices. In the Netherlands we stood shoulder to shoulder with our farmers to emphasize that we believe that partnering and innovation are more effective solutions to the nitrogen problem than only restructuring. We see that the agricultural sector is facing an important transition. In our recently launched revised strategy 2025  we consequently put even more emphasis both on making our production processes more sustainable and on developing innovative feed concepts that reduce the impact of the sector on climate and nature. We do this through targeted sourcing of raw materials and co-products  proper utilisation of feed and appropriate advice. Our dairy customers in the Netherlands for example have already significantly reduced their greenhouse gas emissions.”Theo Spierings  CEO of ForFarmers: “I recently joined ForFarmers as CEO. During conversations and meetings over the past two months  I have been struck by the knowledge  experience  dedication and passion that are present in the company. Given the changes facing our sector  this provides a solid foundation. After all  there is currently a lack of a clear vision in the sector with regard to how we can make the sector more sustainable in a fitting and correct manner. That has to change and I want to actively contribute to this with ForFarmers. So that all players in the chain know where they stand and can act accordingly. I am confident that we can do this. We have a good team and our strategy and focus are clear. In addition  we have recently tightened the core values  building on the already existing corporate culture. This culture will help us to adapt the organization needed to properly implement the strategy.We cannot do without our customers  the members of the cooperative  employees  shareholders  suppliers and other stakeholders. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the Executive Team I want to thank them  for the trust placed in us in 2022.""For the entire press release < click here >For more information:Caroline Vogelzang  Director Investor RelationsT: +31 6 10 94 91 61E: caroline.vogelzang@forfarmers.euCompany profile ForFarmers N.V.ForFarmers N.V.

Payment volume has increased...,English FrenchHiPay GroupIn a continuous growth momentum  annual revenues have risen 9% compared to 2021  and 29% compared to 2020.Payment volume has increased by 14% compared to 2021 and by 35% compared to 2020.Revenues generated in points of sale (POS) have seen a strong 44% rise compared to 2021.Year-end figures are encouraging  with a 16% increase in revenues in the 4th quarter of 2022.The financial support brought by BJ Invest through existing shareholder current account agreements has contributed to maintaining positive cash flow.23 February 2023: HiPay  the fintech company specialising in omnichannel payment solutions  announces its 2022 revenues.In millions of euros 2022 2021 Var. % Year Payment volume 7 528 6 612 +14% Revenues 58.9 53.9 +9% 4th quarter Payment volume 2 186 1 934 +13% Revenues1 17.2 14.8 +16%Despite a challenging context  growth continued in 2022 with a promising year-endDriven by a continuous growth dynamic  HiPay closed the financial year with a 16% rise in its revenues for the last quarter.Across the entire year  HiPay recorded a 35% increase in payment volume compared to 2020 and a 14% increase compared to 2021. Revenues increased by 29% compared to 2020 and by 9% compared to 2021.This moderate progress is explained in particular by a first quarter of 2021 marked by strong growth within the context of the lockdowns imposed across Europe  in addition to unfavourable geopolitical and macroeconomic events. These factors have influenced companies’ consumption and investment decisions without  however  calling into question the positive outlook of the electronic payment market.For the 2022 financial year period  the turnover rate on flows is 0.78%. The level of this rate is explained both by the discontinuation of local payment methods used by clients in the iGaming sector  and whose volumes were transferred to other less lucrative means  and by the increase in payment volumes in points of sale.Success of the unified commerce offeringIn June 2022  HiPay launched its Online-to-Instore offering  which allows merchants in France to unify their sales channels  offering an optimised payment service both online and in store. This offering garnered a great deal of interest and led 12 brands to choose HiPay in 2022  including Jonak  Arthus Bertrand  JOTT and OÏA Beauté.This omnichannel growth is reflected in the turnover for transactions at the point of sale  with a 44% increase across the year compared to 2021.Continuous growth in all sectorsIn France  over 70 new contracts were signed in the retail trade sector  with brands such as Dodo  Hespéride  Atmosphera  Easypara  Notshy  Stella Forest  Sweet Pants  Avril Beauté and Aéroports de Lyon.HiPay took advantage of the opening up of the Dutch market to increase its market share in the iGaming sector. Entain  the world leader in sports betting  chose HiPay for its expertise to support it in rolling out its bwin & Go Bet brands in Europe.In Portugal  the payment volume increased thanks to the signing of 55 new customers  as well as growth among existing customers. In this way  HiPay strengthened its position as payment platform of choice in the online fashion sector and also made an incursion into the supermarket sector  signing a contract to handle the online orders for 21 E.Leclerc supermarkets.In Italy  HiPay continued its growth  winning customers in new high-performance sectors  such as InsurTech and travel  particularly ferry ticketing. New brands signed include traghetti.com  RCPolizza and Capital Group.HiPay’s offering continues its developmentAlongside its commercial achievements  HiPay is continuing to enrich its offering and optimise the performance of its service.Launch of the unified commerce offeringIn France  HiPay launched the Online-to-Instore unified commerce offering to allow its merchants to offer a smoother purchase experience both online and in store.Service performanceStrong authentication exemption requests have been made possible in France and Italy through the implementation of the new 3DS v2 protocol. Following a transaction risk analysis (TRA)  HiPay’s customers can now benefit from this exemption for transactions identified as low risk. A frictionless payment process then allows them to make their purchase quickly without having to confirm a second authentication factor. In this way  merchants strike a balance between performance and security.Optimised payment managementHiPay Console  the centralised management interface  has been optimised. Merchants can now benefit from increased security with multi-factor authentication and an improved user experience. The interface makes it possible to view  manage and configure all operations and payment data in real time.Cash flow situationThe company has drawn fully on credit lines made available by BJ Invest  its principal shareholder  to enable it to maintain a level of cash flow necessary to meet its contractual and regulatory obligations.Next financial communication: 6 April 2023 - 2022 year-end results.***About HiPayHiPay is a global payment services provider.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today announced it has been granted Breakthrough Device Designation status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of its ARC-EX platform for bladder control  alleviation of spasticity  and blood pressure regulation in people with SCI. ONWARD has now been awarded a total of eight Breakthrough Device Designations  highlighting the company’s innovative approach to developing therapies for people with SCI.ARC-EX is an external  non-invasive platform consisting of a stimulator and wireless programmer. Positive top-line data were reported in 2022 from the company’s first pivotal study  called Up-LIFT  which evaluated the ability for ARC-EX Therapy to improve upper extremity strength and function. ONWARD is now preparing regulatory submissions for the U.S. and Europe  with the expectation that this therapy may be approved for commercialization in late 2023.“Bladder control  spasticity  and blood pressure dysregulation are three of the many challenges people with spinal cord injury must manage in order to navigate their daily lives ” said Dave Marver  Chief Executive Officer of ONWARD. “We are proud of our eight total Breakthrough Device Designations from the FDA  which validate the significant unmet needs of the SCI community and the pioneering nature of our work.”Breakthrough Device Designation is an FDA program designed to help patients and their physicians receive timely access to technologies that have the potential to provide more effective treatment or diagnosis for debilitating conditions of significant unmet need  such as spinal cord injury. As part of this designation  the FDA will provide ONWARD with priority review and the opportunity to interact with FDA experts throughout the premarket review phase as the technology moves toward eventual commercialization.About Spinal Cord InjurySpinal cord injury (SCI) represents a major unmet medical need for which there is no cure. Approximately 7 million people globally have a spinal cord injury  with over 650 000 in the U.S. and Europe alone. The quality of life of people with SCI can be poor  with paralysis and loss of sensation  issues with blood pressure control and trunk stability  increased potential for infection  incontinence  and loss of sexual function. Assistance is required for daily living activities. And SCI is costly  with the average lifetime cost for paraplegia (paralysis of the legs) of $2.5 million and $5 million for tetraplegia (paralysis of all four limbs). Treatments are urgently needed to restore movement and improve quality of life.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD is a medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injuries. ONWARD’s work builds on more than a decade of basic science and preclinical research conducted at the world’s leading neuroscience laboratories. ONWARD’s ARC Therapy  which can be delivered by implantable (ARC-IM) or external (ARC-EX) systems  is designed to deliver targeted  programmed spinal cord stimulation to restore movement and other functions in people with spinal cord injury  ultimately improving their quality of life.ONWARD has received eight Breakthrough Device Designations from the US FDA encompassing both ARC-IM and ARC-EX. ARC-EX is an external  non-invasive platform consisting of a stimulator and wireless programmer. Positive top-line data were reported in 2022 from the company’s first pivotal study  called Up-LIFT  evaluating the ability of transcutaneous ARC Therapy to improve upper extremity strength and function. The company is now preparing marketing approval submissions for the US and Europe. ARC-IM consists of an implantable pulse generator and lead placed near the spinal cord. The company completed first-in-human use of the ARC-IM neurostimulator and reported positive interim clinical outcomes for ARC-IM Therapy for improved blood pressure regulation following SCI in 2022.ONWARD is headquartered in Eindhoven  the Netherlands. It maintains a Science and Engineering Center in Lausanne  Switzerland and has a growing US presence in Boston  Massachusetts.

The energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine  combined with mounting environmental challenges  has considerably increased the need for energy efficiency and strengthened ENOGIA’s business model in the fields of ORC modules and Hydrogen Compressors. With electricity prices set to remain high over the long term and in the wake of price renegotiations between industrial companies and energy suppliers  the company is seeing growing interest in its waste heat plants  which produce decarbonised electricity at very competitive prices. This growing interest is reflected in a strong sales pipeline and an order book of more than €5 million.”2022 revenue: €3.3 million  up 12%Revenue (€k) 2021 2022 Change First half 1 316 1 040 -21% Second half 1 624 2 256 +39% Total for the year 2 940 3 296 +12% of which ORC 2 841 3 127 +10% of which Hydrogen Compressors 99 169 +71%ENOGIA’s 2022 revenue amounted to €3.3 million  up 12% compared with 2021. The proportion of business derived from exports represented 92% of revenue last year  compared with 76% in 2021  driven mainly by the development of sales in Europe (excluding France) and Asia.As expected  the second half was stronger than the first  which was impacted by the health situation in China and the gradual ramp-up of the skills of the sales and technical teams recruited. After a 21% decline (to €1 million) in the first half of 2022  ENOGIA’s revenue grew by 39% (to €2.3 million) in the second half. From one half-year to the next  the company’s revenue more than doubled (+117%).Value proposition recognised through new contracts and several partnershipsFull-year ORC revenue was €3.1 million in 2022  compared with €2.8 million in 2021  an increase of 10%. This performance was slowed by the virtual stoppage of the ORC contract signed in China  due to health restrictions. As a reminder  this contract generated €1.5 million in revenue in 2021.In the second half  the ORC business benefited from the start of the contract signed last August in Germany  for a total of €6.5 million. This contract  which provides for the supply of 40 ORC modules to the world’s largest anaerobic digestion plant  has made ENOGIA the leader in the German biogas market.Other new orders have confirmed the commercial potential of ENOGIA’s ORC technology  which has also been strengthened by several partnerships. The agreement signed with ADEME Investissement in June 2022 gave rise to the ENOGIA Assets Industry joint venture  with investment potential of €15 million over five years for the rollout of the economy of use. The first orders linked to this business model  whose appeal has been compounded by the rise in electricity prices  are expected in 2023. Last November  the company entered into a partnership with Parlym for the distribution  promotion and marketing of ENOGIA’s ORC modules by this major player in industrial engineering  which boasts an extensive footprint in France and Africa.In Compressors for Hydrogen Fuel Cells  the ramp-up was confirmed over the last year  with revenue growing by 71% to €0.2 million.In October 2022  ENOGIA was selected as the lead partner in the SMAC-FC project  funded by the France 2030 plan and dedicated to the development of a new generation of more efficient compressors. ENOGIA’s involvement in this project illustrates the recognition of its technological expertise  which enables it to offer customised compressors perfectly adapted to the needs of its heat pump integrator customers  with unrivalled performance and compactness compared with the existing offer.Outlook: 2025 objectives confirmedENOGIA is approaching the new year with great confidence in its ability to carry out its current contracts and achieve its commercial acceleration strategy at the same time. The post-IPO recruitment campaign has now been completed and the headcount has risen from 45 to 62 today. The ramp-up of the teams’ skills now puts the company in a position to respond fully to growing demand from prospects looking for solutions that are both economical and ecological.ENOGIA’s order book[1] remains sound and continues to grow. It stood at more than €5 million as of 31 December 2022. It is fuelled by a high-quality and highly diversified sales pipeline [2] which still amounts to more than €140 million.As such  the company is confirming the roadmap to 2025 announced at the time of its IPO and reiterating  in the shorter term  its target of positive EBITDA in 2023.Next release:2022 annual results  29 March 2023 after tradingAbout ENOGIA ENOGIA responds to the major challenges of the ecological and energy transition with its unique and patented technology of compact  light and durable micro-turbomachinery.

Negative market performances in virtually all asset classes left no investor untouched. We nevertheless achieved high net inflows in assets under management (AuM) and increased savings. I’m grateful to our clients for their confidence in us and would also like to thank my colleagues for their personal and entrepreneurial approach in the past year  helping our clients in these turbulent times.“In 2022  we enhanced our financial and sustainability objectives as well as our capital strategy. Profitable growth  both organically and via acquisitions  remains our focus  while maintaining a capital-light balance sheet. We’re proud to have added two major Dutch clients to our fiduciary management activities and shortly before year-end we announced the acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden  a further strengthening of our position in Belgium. As part of this transaction  Mercier Vanderlinden’s managing partners will obtain a significant stake in Van Lanschot Kempen  anchoring our shareholder base in our second home market.“What really pleases me is that over 70% of our colleagues now hold shares in Van Lanschot Kempen  a clear sign of their engagement. I’m also proud that we’ve managed to retain and attract talent in a tight labour market. And on that note  I consider the addition of the Robeco Retail Nederland team to Evi van Lanschot a real boon. On 2 February 2023  we announced that we would enter into a strategic partnership with Robeco and acquire their online investment platform with €4.7 billion in AuM. We look forward to a great partnership and expect to complete the transaction in June 2023.”Client assets and AuMNet AuM inflows amounted to €13.7 billion and negative market performance was €21.5 billion  resulting in a decrease in total AuM of €107.8 billion (2021: €115.6 billion). Client savings rose to €12.7 billion (2021: €11.7 billion) and total client assets were €124.2 billion (2021: €131.2 billion).2022 resultsFull-year net profit amounted to €84.3 million (2021: €143.8 million). The decrease can mainly be explained by high results on participating interests in 2021 and one-off charges related to the acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden in 2022.Commission income rose 6% to €407.8 million (2021: €385.5 million) on the back of higher average AuM levels. Interest income was up 6% to €162.7 million (2021: €153.6 million)  reflecting the interest rate hikes the European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on in the second half of the year.In 2022  operating expenses rose to €438.2 million (2021: €409.9 million)  fuelled by higher staff costs. The increase mostly reflects an increase in FTE to 1 780 (2021: 1 654)  including at the IT and compliance functions and at the teams responsible for investment solutions. Moreover  after the acquisition of the initial 70% stake in July 2021  Mercier Vanderlinden’s operating expenses were now recognised for the full calendar year.PERFORMANCE REPORT/PRESENTATION/WEBCASTFor a detailed discussion of Van Lanschot Kempen’s results and balance sheet  please refer to our performance report and presentation on the 2022 full-year results at vanlanschotkempen.com/results.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today announced it has been granted Breakthrough Device Designation status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of its ARC-EX platform for bladder control  alleviation of spasticity  and blood pressure regulation in people with SCI. ONWARD has now been awarded a total of eight Breakthrough Device Designations  highlighting the company’s innovative approach to developing therapies for people with SCI.ARC-EX is an external  non-invasive platform consisting of a stimulator and wireless programmer. Positive top-line data were reported in 2022 from the company’s first pivotal study  called Up-LIFT  which evaluated the ability for ARC-EX Therapy to improve upper extremity strength and function. ONWARD is now preparing regulatory submissions for the U.S. and Europe  with the expectation that this therapy may be approved for commercialization in late 2023.“Bladder control  spasticity  and blood pressure dysregulation are three of the many challenges people with spinal cord injury must manage in order to navigate their daily lives ” said Dave Marver  Chief Executive Officer of ONWARD. “We are proud of our eight total Breakthrough Device Designations from the FDA  which validate the significant unmet needs of the SCI community and the pioneering nature of our work.”Breakthrough Device Designation is an FDA program designed to help patients and their physicians receive timely access to technologies that have the potential to provide more effective treatment or diagnosis for debilitating conditions of significant unmet need  such as spinal cord injury. As part of this designation  the FDA will provide ONWARD with priority review and the opportunity to interact with FDA experts throughout the premarket review phase as the technology moves toward eventual commercialization.About Spinal Cord InjurySpinal cord injury (SCI) represents a major unmet medical need for which there is no cure. Approximately 7 million people globally have a spinal cord injury  with over 650 000 in the U.S. and Europe alone. The quality of life of people with SCI can be poor  with paralysis and loss of sensation  issues with blood pressure control and trunk stability  increased potential for infection  incontinence  and loss of sexual function. Assistance is required for daily living activities. And SCI is costly  with the average lifetime cost for paraplegia (paralysis of the legs) of $2.5 million and $5 million for tetraplegia (paralysis of all four limbs). Treatments are urgently needed to restore movement and improve quality of life.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD is a medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injuries.

ARC-EX is an external  non-invasive platform consisting of a stimulator and wireless programmer. Positive top-line data were reported in 2022 from the company’s first pivotal study  called Up-LIFT  evaluating the ability of transcutaneous ARC Therapy to improve upper extremity strength and function. The company is now preparing marketing approval submissions for the US and Europe. ARC-IM consists of an implantable pulse generator and lead placed near the spinal cord. The company completed first-in-human use of the ARC-IM neurostimulator and reported positive interim clinical outcomes for ARC-IM Therapy for improved blood pressure regulation following SCI in 2022.ONWARD is headquartered in Eindhoven  the Netherlands.

Negative market performances in virtually all asset classes left no investor untouched. We nevertheless achieved high net inflows in assets under management (AuM) and increased savings. I’m grateful to our clients for their confidence in us and would also like to thank my colleagues for their personal and entrepreneurial approach in the past year  helping our clients in these turbulent times.“In 2022  we enhanced our financial and sustainability objectives as well as our capital strategy. Profitable growth  both organically and via acquisitions  remains our focus  while maintaining a capital-light balance sheet. We’re proud to have added two major Dutch clients to our fiduciary management activities and shortly before year-end we announced the acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden  a further strengthening of our position in Belgium. As part of this transaction  Mercier Vanderlinden’s managing partners will obtain a significant stake in Van Lanschot Kempen  anchoring our shareholder base in our second home market.“What really pleases me is that over 70% of our colleagues now hold shares in Van Lanschot Kempen  a clear sign of their engagement. I’m also proud that we’ve managed to retain and attract talent in a tight labour market. And on that note  I consider the addition of the Robeco Retail Nederland team to Evi van Lanschot a real boon. On 2 February 2023  we announced that we would enter into a strategic partnership with Robeco and acquire their online investment platform with €4.7 billion in AuM. We look forward to a great partnership and expect to complete the transaction in June 2023.”Client assets and AuMNet AuM inflows amounted to €13.7 billion and negative market performance was €21.5 billion  resulting in a decrease in total AuM of €107.8 billion (2021: €115.6 billion). Client savings rose to €12.7 billion (2021: €11.7 billion) and total client assets were €124.2 billion (2021: €131.2 billion).2022 resultsFull-year net profit amounted to €84.3 million (2021: €143.8 million). The decrease can mainly be explained by high results on participating interests in 2021 and one-off charges related to the acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden in 2022.Commission income rose 6% to €407.8 million (2021: €385.5 million) on the back of higher average AuM levels. Interest income was up 6% to €162.7 million (2021: €153.6 million)  reflecting the interest rate hikes the European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on in the second half of the year.In 2022  operating expenses rose to €438.2 million (2021: €409.9 million)  fuelled by higher staff costs.

Revenues increased by 29% compared to 2020 and by 9% compared to 2021.This moderate progress is explained in particular by a first quarter of 2021 marked by strong growth within the context of the lockdowns imposed across Europe  in addition to unfavourable geopolitical and macroeconomic events. These factors have influenced companies’ consumption and investment decisions without  however  calling into question the positive outlook of the electronic payment market.For the 2022 financial year period  the turnover rate on flows is 0.78%. The level of this rate is explained both by the discontinuation of local payment methods used by clients in the iGaming sector  and whose volumes were transferred to other less lucrative means  and by the increase in payment volumes in points of sale.Success of the unified commerce offeringIn June 2022  HiPay launched its Online-to-Instore offering  which allows merchants in France to unify their sales channels  offering an optimised payment service both online and in store. This offering garnered a great deal of interest and led 12 brands to choose HiPay in 2022  including Jonak  Arthus Bertrand  JOTT and OÏA Beauté.This omnichannel growth is reflected in the turnover for transactions at the point of sale  with a 44% increase across the year compared to 2021.Continuous growth in all sectorsIn France  over 70 new contracts were signed in the retail trade sector  with brands such as Dodo  Hespéride  Atmosphera  Easypara  Notshy  Stella Forest  Sweet Pants  Avril Beauté and Aéroports de Lyon.HiPay took advantage of the opening up of the Dutch market to increase its market share in the iGaming sector.

We are therefore especially proud that our employees have made a huge effort to continue supplying feed to our customers on time and as agreed  even when the availability of raw materials became uncertain as a result of the dreadful war in Ukraine. Our volumes decreased  mainly due to the decline in the pig sector as a result of the contraction in this sector. Nevertheless  we achieved solid underlying EBITDA and underlying net profit that was higher than last year. This was thanks to tightened processes and a strong contribution from the Germany/Poland cluster and despite the sharp rise in raw material and energy prices. In the Netherlands we stood shoulder to shoulder with our farmers to emphasize that we believe that partnering and innovation are more effective solutions to the nitrogen problem than only restructuring. We see that the agricultural sector is facing an important transition. In our recently launched revised strategy 2025  we consequently put even more emphasis both on making our production processes more sustainable and on developing innovative feed concepts that reduce the impact of the sector on climate and nature. We do this through targeted sourcing of raw materials and co-products  proper utilisation of feed and appropriate advice. Our dairy customers in the Netherlands for example have already significantly reduced their greenhouse gas emissions.”Theo Spierings  CEO of ForFarmers: “I recently joined ForFarmers as CEO. During conversations and meetings over the past two months  I have been struck by the knowledge  experience  dedication and passion that are present in the company. Given the changes facing our sector  this provides a solid foundation. After all  there is currently a lack of a clear vision in the sector with regard to how we can make the sector more sustainable in a fitting and correct manner. That has to change and I want to actively contribute to this with ForFarmers. So that all players in the chain know where they stand and can act accordingly. I am confident that we can do this. We have a good team and our strategy and focus are clear. In addition  we have recently tightened the core values  building on the already existing corporate culture. This culture will help us to adapt the organization needed to properly implement the strategy.We cannot do without our customers  the members of the cooperative  employees  shareholders  suppliers and other stakeholders. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the Executive Team I want to thank them  for the trust placed in us in 2022.""For the entire press release < click here >For more information:Caroline Vogelzang  Director Investor RelationsT: +31 6 10 94 91 61E: caroline.vogelzang@forfarmers.euCompany profile ForFarmers N.V.ForFarmers N.V.

The consideration under the Tender Offer will not be dispatched until the Company is duly satisfied. The decision of the Company as to which DCAC Ordinary Shares have been successfully tendered shall be final and binding on all DCAC Ordinary Shareholders.""As of today  23 February 2023  tenders were received purporting to cover 11 672 043 DCAC Ordinary Shares.Of these  the Company has agreed to repurchase 11 040 891 DCAC Ordinary Shares.Repurchase tenders for a further 631 152 DCAC Ordinary Shares are currently regarded by the DCAC Board as being invalid  being tenders for 270 275 DCAC Ordinary Shares received after the cut-off time; and tenders for 360 877 DCAC Ordinary Shares where the DCAC Board currently is of the opinion that either the DCAC Shareholder tendered for more than 95% of the DCAC Ordinary Shares held under their control as at the Record Date; or acquired the DCAC Ordinary Shares after the Record Date.

We do apologise that those who validly tendered have been inconvenienced accordingly. Whilst we had considered trying to pay interest on this delayed settlement  the complexities and costs of so doing outweigh the benefits  especially when taking into account that such interest will accrue to all the Shareholders in any event in respect of their remaining shareholdings.Edmund TruellCEO  DCACAbout DCACDCAC is a special purpose acquisition company incorporated on 29 April 2021 under the Companies Law as a non-cellular company limited by shares.

The performance of hotels over the second half of the year surpasses pre-crisis levels in almost all our regions. Only Asi…,SUSTAINABLE REVPAR RECOVERY ABOVE PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELFY 2023 GROUP REVPAR EXPECTED UP BETWEEN 5% AND 9% LFL YOYRETURN OF DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION AT €1.05 PER SHAREREVENUE UP 92% TO €4 224 MILLION (+80% LFL)EBITDA SURGE ABOVE THE GUIDANCE AT €675 MILLIONNET PROFIT GROUP SHARE AT €402 MILLIONTourism recovered substantially in 2022 and our performances  up strongly in all regions  reflected that rebound. We exceeded our financial and non-financial targets and can look to the future with serenity. Our brands are attractive  our distribution is powerful  our teams are talented and motivated  and our organization has been adapted to capture future growth even more effectively. These strengths combined with the genuine culture of the Group  placing people and talents in the heart of its model  give meaning to our action. In 2023  our ambition is to keep our growth and reinforce our leadership by continuing to evolve the codes of the hospitality industry and remain the chosen partner of our hotel owners and customers. Sébastien Bazin  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AccorAfter two years severely impacted by the health crisis  the fiscal-year 2022 posted a solid and sustainable rebound in Group’s activity. The performance of hotels over the second half of the year surpasses pre-crisis levels in almost all our regions. Only Asia  a region impacted by China's strict zero-Covid policy until year end  is still significantly below 2019 activity levels.Worldwide  our recovery was primarily driven by domestic guests  with levels exceeding those of 2019. Whereas international travelers  even whose number grows sharply  failed to return to the level of 2019. As observed in recent quarters  the recovery was led by a strong increase in prices  fueled by demand and accentuated by inflation.In 2022  Accor opened 299 hotels  corresponding to 43 000 rooms  accounting in a net organic growth in the network of 3.2% over the 12-month period. At end-December 2022  the Group had a hotel portfolio of 802 269 rooms (5 445 hotels) and a pipeline of 216 000 rooms (1 247 hotels).Consolidated revenueIn 2022  the Group recorded a revenue of €4 224 million  up 80% like-for-like (LFL) versus FY 2021. This growth breaks down into an improvement of 89% for HotelServices and 63% for Hotel Assets & Other. To provide a RevPAR comparison (presented as the change versus FY 2019 throughout this release)  the Group reported an increase of 4% in LFL revenue versus FY 2019.Changes in the scope of consolidation (acquisitions  disposals and reopenings) contributed positively with €72 million mainly due to the takeover of Paris Society and the reopening of the Pullman Montparnasse. Currency effects had a positive impact of €189 million  mainly linked to the US dollar ((11)%).Source: AccorHotelServices revenueHotelServices  which includes fees from Management & Franchise (M&F) and Services to Owners  generated €3 194 million in revenue  up 89% like-for-like versus FY 2021 (up 5% like-for-like versus FY 2019). This increase reflects the solid recovery in business over the year.Management & Franchise (M&F) revenue stood at €1 052 million  up 93% like-for-like versus FY 2021 (down 1% like-for-like versus FY 2019)  with regional performances correlated to health crisis situations in the considered countries.In some cases  the lower improvement in M&F revenue compared to RevPAR can be explained by the slower recovery in incentive fees based on the hotel operating margin generated from management contracts. This results from a lower business activity in 2022 in contrast with 2019 in Asia-Pacific and Northern Europe regions.Source: AccorConsolidated RevPAR reported a global increase of 15% during Q4 2022 compared to the same period in 2019  improving on the excellent performance in the Q3 (+14%). Group RevPAR for full-year 2022 was 2% higher than in 2019.South Europe  driven by France  reported a 12% increase in RevPAR in Q4 2022 compared with Q4 2019. Business performance increased quarter after quarter  with RevPAR for full-year 2022 exceeding that of 2019 by 3%.In France  RevPAR was up 13% in Q4 2022 compared with Q4 2019. The performance was driven mainly by Paris  which benefited from the return of international leisure guests.In Spain  RevPAR was up 5% in Q4 2022 versus Q4 2019.North Europe posted a 5% increase in RevPAR in Q4 2022 versus Q4 2019  marked by a slight slowdown compared to Q3 2022  notably owing to Germany. Northern Europe RevPAR for full-year 2022 was 6% lower than in 2019.In Germany  the sequential decrease in business activity reflected by the seasonality of trade fairs and conventions  with fewer events as well as a lower attendance in the Q4.In the United Kingdom  RevPAR remained solid and increased from the previous quarter. London and the province achieved comparable performances despite transport-impacting strikes over the period.Asia-Pacific benefitted from a sequential improvement in RevPAR (+3 percentage points between the third and fourth quarters)  to stand at -6% in Q4 2022 compared with Q4 2019. Asia-Pacific RevPAR for full-year 2022 is 18% lower than in 2019  offering the largest recovery potential in FY 2023 due to the activity lag.In the Pacific region  business activity was stronger than before the crisis  with a 13% increase in RevPAR in Q4 2022 versus Q4 2019  still largely driven by prices.In China  RevPAR decreased compared to Q3  falling at 39% in Q4 2022 compared with Q4 2019 owing to the strict application of a zero-Covid policy until December 2022. Business has since improved despite the sanitary situation still challenging.Southeast Asia posted a substantial improvement in Q4 2022 (up 17 percentage points from last quarter)  with RevPAR at 4% lower than in Q4 2019. The recovery was underpinned notably by Singapore  leisure guests in Thailand  and the reopening of Japan in October.In the India  Middle East Africa  & Turkey (IMEAT) region  business benefited considerably from the Soccer World Cup in Qatar in November and December  with RevPAR 73% higher in Q4 2022 than in Q4 2019. The World Cup had a knock-on effect across the Arabian Peninsula. Saudi Arabia also benefited from a solid activity linked to pilgrimages. Regional RevPAR for full-year 2022 was 47% higher than in 2019.In the Americas  the improvement in RevPAR was also noteworthy (+6 percentage points between the third and fourth quarters)  increasing 18% in Q4 2022 compared with Q4 2019. RevPAR for the Americas region in full-year 2022 was 5% higher than in 2019.North/Central America and Caribbean region RevPAR was 8% higher in Q4 2022 than in Q4 2019  still strongly fueled by prices.In South America  business also remained robust with Q4 2022 RevPAR exceeding that of Q4 2019 by 42%  the sustained rise in prices having has been driven by inflation over the last three years.The revenue from Services to Owners revenue came to €2 143 million in 2022. It includes the Sales  Marketing  Distribution and Loyalty division  as well as shared services and the reimbursement of hotel staff costs. In 2022  the reimbursement costs also included the re-invoicing of the costs incurred by Accor related to the services regarding supporters accommodation provided during the Soccer World Cup in Qatar.Hotel Assets & Other revenueRevenue in the “Hotel Assets & Other” segment was up 63% like-for-like versus 2021 and up 2% like-for-like versus 2019  reaching €1 084 million. This segment  which is closely linked to business in Australia  notably benefited from a recovery in leisure tourism demand on the northeastern coast of the country where most of the Group’s Strata activities are located (i.e. room and apartment distribution activities and managed properties).Since early 2021  this segment includes conciergerie services  luxury home rentals  private sales of hotel stays and digital services for hotel owners. All these activities benefited from the uptrend in tourism.At end-December 2022  this segment  which includes owned and leased hotels  represented 114 hotels and 22 436 rooms.Positive EBITDAConsolidated EBITDA stood at €675 million in 2022  compared with €22 million in 2021. The figure exceeded the target set in October 2022  notably owing to robust business activity in December.Source: AccorThe EBITDA margin came to 16% in FY 2022 versus 1% in 2021.Source: AccorHotelServices EBITDA by businessHotelServices EBITDA was positive at €661 million for 2022. The figure breaks down as positive EBITDA for Management & Franchise (M&F) and a negative contribution from Services to Owners related to marketing expenditure ahead of the rebound in business activity in first-half 2022. Services to Owners EBITDA came out at a positive €14 million in the second half of the year. Rebilling of costs (with revenue at €1 273 million) remained structurally at breakeven at the EBITDA level.Management & Franchise EBITDA by regionSource: AccorThe Management & Franchise division of HotelServices reported EBITDA of €737 million  significantly higher than in 2021 (€275 million) and down 5% like-for-like compared with 2019.Hotel Assets & Other EBITDAHotel Assets & Other EBITDA came to €137 million in 2022 versus €48 million in 2021. It was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific where business has recovered strongly since the end of 2021. New Businesses  which have benefitted from the momentum of the tourism recovery  reported positive EBITDA in full-year 2022.Net profitSource: AccorNet profit  Group share was €402 million in 2022  compared with €85 million in 2021.The share of net profit of equity-accounted investments was positive at €33 million for 2022  compared with €(273) million in 2021  reflecting the substantial improvement in AccorInvest business in its main market  Europe.Other income and expenses reached €63 million  notably including the net impairment reversals  the restructuring expenses and the capital gain on the disposal of ResDiary  specialised in developping systems for reserving tables and optimizing table management for restaurants.In 2021  this line mainly included a €649 million gain following the partial sale of a 1.5% stake in H World Group Ltd (Huazhu) in February 2021.Profit from discontinued operations mainly reflected a partial reversal of provisions for risks linked to guarantees issued as part of the AccorInvest disposal program like in 2021.Return of recurring free cash flowSource: AccorGroup recurring free cash flow returned to positive territory in 2022 at €373 million compared with cash burn of €246 million in 2021.The cost of net financial debt decreased from FY 2021 to FY 2022 following the redemption of two high coupons bonds.Recurring expenditure  which includes “key money” paid by HotelServices for its development as well as digital and IT investments  reached €159 million in 2022  at the lower end of the initially indicated range of €150-200 million. Recurring investments in 2023 are expected to be higher than €200 million.Change in working capital requirements remained close to breakeven. As in 2021  payment of fees was in line with business levels during 2022 as well as the collection of certain fees for which payment deadline extensions were granted to certain hotel owners.Group net financial debt as at December 31  2022 stood at €1 658 million  versus €1 844 million as at December 31  2021.This decrease resulted primarily from:The cash generation from the business recovery mentioned above The sale of a 10.8% stake in Ennismore for €185 million  announced on June 21  2022 The partial sale of shares in H World Group Ltd (Huazhu) before the end of the year for €154 million These three items offset the increase in debt arising from the full consolidation of Paris Society following the take-over of the company in November 2022.As at December 31  2022  the average cost of Accor debt came to 2.1% with an average maturity of 3.6 years  with no major maturities before 2026.At end-December 2022  combined with the undrawn credit facility of €1.2 billion  Accor had a liquidity position of €2.8 billion.The Group confirms its commitment to restore its “Investment Grade” rating.FY23 RevPAR GuidanceFY 2023 Group RevPAR is expected to increase between 5% and 9% on a like-for-like basis compared to FY 2022.DividendBased on the 2022 results  the dividend distribution policy implemented since 2019 (established on the basis of a payout rate of 50% of the recurring free cash flow)  and as recommended by the Board of Directors  Accor will submit to the approval of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May 17  2023 the payment of an ordinary dividend of €0.71 per share.In addition  based on recent disposals (i.e. a 10.8% stake in Ennismore and H World Group Ltd shares)  the Board of Directors has decided to propose the payment of an exceptional dividend of €0.34 per share.The combination of ordinary and exceptional dividends would result in a payment of €1.05 per share  in line with the last dividend paid out in 2019.Events in 2022Takeover of Paris SocietyOn November 16  2022  Accor exercised its option allowing to take the control of Paris Society. As a leading player in luxury hospitality in France  Paris Society reinforces Ennismore's strong expertise in this field by bringing its experience in the high-end catering and event management sector.Disposal of a 10.8% stake in EnnismoreOn November 17  2022  Accor sold a 10.8% stake in its subsidiary Ennismore  a lifestyle hotel operator which was owned at 66.67% and resulting from the merger in October 2021 with Ennismore Holdings Ltd (EHL)  to a Qatari consortium for €185 million.Prior to the disposal  the Group transferred to Ennismore its holdings in Rixos  a 70%-owned hotel operator specialized in all-inclusive business in the Middle East  and Paris Society.Board of Directors’ decisionsDuring the meeting held on February 23  2022  and based on the recommendations of the Appointments  Compensation and CSR Committee  the Board of Directors decided to propose the renewal of Mrs. Qionger Jiang  Mrs. Isabelle Simon  Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy and Mr. Sarmad Zok as Company Directors for a three-year duration.In addition  the Board decided to propose the appointment of Mrs. Hélène Auriol Potier  which was already announced  the appointments of Mrs. Asma Abdulrahman Al- Khulaifi and Mr. Ugo Arzani as Directors  for the same period of three years.Evolution in the organizationOn July 5  2022  the Group announced that it is changing its structure to capitalize on the transformation undertaken in recent years  consolidate its leadership positions  focus its efforts  strengthen its know-how  accelerate its growth and continue to improve its profitability. As such  Accor will leverage two divisions comprising separate and distinctive expertise with the aim of further strengthening the excellence of each of these business lines  improving their operational and financial performance  offering its owners and guests even more relevant products and services  and attracting the best talents.Since October 1  2022  Accor has been structured around two dedicated divisions:the “Economy  Midscale & Premium Division ” comprising notably the Group’s ibis  Novotel  Mercure  Swissôtel  Mövenpick and Pullman brands.the “Luxury & Lifestyle Division ” bringing together Accor’s luxury brands as well as the Group’s Lifestyle entity  Ennismore.To support the implementation and ensure the roll-out of this new structure  Accor’s Board of Directors has confirmed its support for the Group’s leadership and unanimously decided to propose the renewal of Sébastien Bazin’s term as Chairman and CEO at the upcoming Annual General Meeting called to approve the 2022 financial statements.Disposal of the Paris HeadquarterOn September 28  2022  the Accor Group announced that it had entered into exclusive negotiations with the Valesco Group on the sale of its headquarter office in Paris  Tour Sequana  for a total of €465 million.

19173,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4581337-tmx-group-is-a-fantastic-asset,TMX Group: A Fantastic Asset With An Upcoming Catalyst,TMX Group is an excellent business trading at a fair price. Here's what investors need to know about TMXXF.,mikeinlondon/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesTMX Group (OTCPK:TMXXF)(TSX:X:CA) is a high-quality  toll booth-like business with a massive competitive advantage  good growth potential  and an attractive potential short-term catalyst. Here's why I'm so bullish.Introduction(Note: All currency is in CAD unless otherwise noted.)TMX Group is the owner and operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX)  Canada's largest stock exchange and 10th-largest in the world. It also owns the TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV)  which lists smaller capitalization stocks  as well as the Montreal Exchange  Canada's home to derivative trading. The Toronto Stock Exchange has been around since 1861  with original trading volume consisting of just two or three transactions per day. The cost of membership was just $5.Things are a little more hectic today. There are a combined 3 500-plus issuers on both the TSX and TSXV exchanges  including 1 155 mining stocks  942 ETFs  and 249 technology companies. The total market cap for the two exchanges combined to exceed more than $4 trillion as of Jan. 31  2023.The company has been diversifying away from these main businesses  looking for ways to leverage its informational and technological expertise. This part of TMX Group has been a steady grower over the last decade  buoyed by both organic growth and acquisitions. The biggest acquisition was Trayport  which was purchased by TMX Group in 2017. Trayport's main asset is a platform used by most of Europe's energy traders and is responsible for some 75% of power and gas trading on the continent.As you can see  Trayport has delivered some pretty solid growth since it was acquired:TMX Group Investor BrochureOther recent acquisitions include a 21% stake in VettaFi  which is a U.S.-based data  analytics  indexing  digital distribution  and thought leadership company. TMX Group paid $234M for its stake. It also acquired Wall Street Horizon  a leading provider of global market-moving action and corporate event data. The financials on that deal were not released.The company is also leveraging its data in a few other ways. It sells real-time data to various sources  including brokerages. It sells feed data  like what you might see scrolling at the bottom of your TV screen. It even sells data to the various companies looking to create indexes and ETFs.Together  this part of TMX's business is approximately 32% of total revenue. Capital formation - fees paid by companies listing on the various exchanges - is 24% of revenue. Derivatives trading and clearing is 23% of revenue. Equity and fixed income trading is less important than ever  consisting of just 21% of total revenue.Here's a quick summary of the company's main divisions and their operating margins:Division % of total revenue Operating margins Global Solutions & Analytics 32% 64% Capital Formation 24% 42% Derivatives Trading & Clearing 23% 58% Equities & Fixed Income Trading 21% 50% Click to enlargeIt's pretty easy to see why the company is focused on the Global Solutions & Analytics division. It has delivered excellent growth in the past  with a target to increase revenue by high single digits annually going forward. Combine that with high operating margins and you have a winning strategy.Financial ResultsTMX Group has delivered consistently improving top- and bottom-line numbers  especially over the last handful of years. Let's start with the top line. Revenue has increased from $700 million in 2013 to $1.12 billion today. You'll see revenue growth really start to take off starting in 2017  after the company acquired Trayport and really started to focus on that part of its business.TMX Group revenue 2012-22 (Author using SA data)Earnings per share have followed a similar path  although various non-cash charges have made earnings much more volatile. The company posts adjusted profit numbers that exclude these non-cash charges  which are a more accurate representation of true profitability.Adjusted profits per share have grown nicely over the last decade  although that growth has been a little lumpy.TMX Group adjusted EPS 2012-22 (Author from annual filings)Consensus analyst projections peg TMX Group's 2023 earnings at $7.27 per share  a 3% increase compared to 2022's numbers. Growth could accelerate in 2024 with earnings expected to hit $7.86 per share.Giving Back to ShareholdersI'm a 39-year-old early retiree who depends on dividends to support my family. I'm looking for stocks with solid current yields that have potential to increase the payout over time. TMX Group checks off both of those boxes. After a recent dividend raise  the payout is $3.48 per share  which works out to a 2.6% yield. That's an acceptable starting point  at least for me.The company has increased its dividend each of the last seven years. The dividend growth rate over the last five years is 16.57% and the payout ratio is 46.63% of trailing earnings. The company targets a payout ratio of 40%-50% of adjusted earnings.One minor concern is the pace of raises. After increasing the payout by 6% in 2020  10% in 2021  and almost 8% in 2022  2023's dividend increase was just 4.8%. One likely reason for the disappointing dividend increase was somewhat flat growth in adjusted earnings from 2021 to 2022.Share buybacks are also an important way to give back to shareholders. While it's clear that TMX Group values acquisitions and dividends ahead of share buybacks  the company has reduced shares outstanding of late. Diluted outstanding shares peaked in December 2020 at 57 million shares. By the end of 2022 the company had repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares. There are currently 55.9 million shares outstanding.The company's share repurchase authorization expires in March  but it's likely to get renewed for another year. The current authorization gives the company permission to repurchase 1% of total shares outstanding  and I'd strongly suspect 2023's version will look very similar.ValuationTMX Group is an excellent business. It has grown the top and bottom lines consistently over the last decade. It boasts 90%-plus gross margins and 50%-plus operating margins. The company has an excellent moat as well. Long-term investors have done very well in this name. Shares are up 285% since 2008  plus dividends.Price Chart 2008-23 (SA)I'll be the first to admit this stock isn't truly cheap. It doesn't get to what I'd call value territory very often. But it's still an excellent stock trading at a reasonable price.The stock trades hands at just a hair over 18x analyst consensus forward earnings  or an earnings yield of 5.56%. This does seem a little expensive in a world where a 10-year U.S. treasury yields almost 4%.If we look at the stock from a different perspective it seems more reasonable. The current price-to-forward earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is just over 20x  giving the market a forward earnings yield that's a hair under 5%. TMX Group stacks up pretty well when compared to the S&P 500 on that metric.It's also cheaper compared to its exchange peers. Intercontinental Exchange  Inc. (NYSE:ICE)  the owner of the NYSE and Euronext exchanges  trades at 19x analyst consensus 2023 earnings. Nasdaq  Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) has an even higher forward P/E ratio  trading at 21.1x analyst consensus 2023 earnings.RisksOne big risk that could impact TMX Group in the short term is a recession. A prolonged downturn would impact most parts of the company's business. New issues and IPOs slow down during recessions. Trading volumes would most likely fall as well. Many investors choose to ignore their portfolios during turbulent times. Even the Global Insights and data divisions could be impacted by an overall slowdown.A longer-term risk is alternate trading platforms continuing to gain market share. Technology has made it easier for market participants to make trades among themselves without getting the exchange involved. According to the company's Q3 quarterly report  TMX Group handled approximately 60% of all domestic equity trades in Canada. Even though this is a higher market share than the previous year  there's no guarantee the bulk of Canadian equity trades will remain on the company's platform.One final long-term risk is private companies choosing to forego the listing process all together and remaining private. Being a publicly traded company opens an organization up to scrutiny  makes the financials public knowledge  and has a certain cost to it. Many companies might choose not to bother  especially if they can access growth capital from other sources.A Potential CatalystShortly after releasing 2022's full-year earnings in early February  TMX Group proposed a plan to split its stock on a 5-to-1 basis. Instead of owning a single share of a stock currency worth $135.56  investors would own five shares worth approximately $27.11 each. Shareholders must approve this plan at the company's annual meeting in May.I'll be the first to admit it shouldn't matter if investors own one share or five shares at a lower price. The only thing that should matter is the intrinsic value of each share. The rest is noise.But there's growing evidence that companies that split their stock actually outperform - over the short term  at least. According to research by Bank of America  the average newly split stock is up 25.4% a year later  compared to 9.1% for the S&P 500. This isn't just some bull market phenomenon  either. The research tracked stock split data since 1980.It's easy to dismiss these findings and say they don't matter for a stock that trades in Canada  since the data looked at U.S. stocks. But remember  a big portion of TMX Group's revenue is selling data to other market participants. It's extremely unlikely the company proposed the split without looking at what happened to previous splits. If the operator of the stock market thinks a split is prudent  then chances are it will work out.Final ThoughtsTMX Group is one of the highest quality stocks in Canada. It has a virtual monopoly over public markets in Canada  a similarly strong position in derivatives  and solid growth potential from growth in its Global Solutions & Analytics division. It also boasts a nice dividend with a history of increasing the payout. And it trades at a fair valuation of just over18x forward earnings  slightly cheaper than its peers.A potential catalyst could send shares higher  too. I recently added this name to my portfolio  and I'd be looking to buy more on any substantial pullbacks.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

As a result  the study has advanced from seeking pure basic clinical assessments to involving more quantitative data. This will allow for a superior significance analysis. This advance in the trial results assessment has been achieved through advances in radiographic procedures enabling increased clarity in statistical interpretation. As a result  BioSenic has decided  based on consultation with its external biostatistical advisors  that clinical investigators may now complete the recruitment of patients. The cohort of treated patients  amounting to 57 patients  is found to be sufficient for a sufficient level of significance.“BioSenic’s ALLOB represents a significant opportunity for clinical unmet medical needs in bone regeneration  namely difficult tibial fractures. These affect more than 300.000 patients per year in US and EU alone and can have a significant impact to the lives of those affected. As a result  there is a pressing demand to develop accelerated bone regeneration in these patients. The results of the modified Phase IIb clinical trial with our allogeneic bone cell therapy product will add to the positive results of the previous Phase I/IIa on delayed fractures  obtained and published after a recent successful open label  non-randomized study on long bones including tibia (NCT020205901). These previous clinical results have positively demonstrated good tolerability  evidence of increased bone formation and other clinical benefits ” said François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic. “As a result of these modifications to the current Phase IIb clinical trial  BioSenic will be able to quickly deliver the results expected from the original protocol  supported by the regulatory agencies. These results will be sufficient to define the next steps for further clinical evaluations of ALLOB  which could include a Phase III clinical trial required for market approval submission to regulatory agencies.”Results from ALLOB Phase IIb trial shall now be made three months after difficult fracture and infusion of the ALLOB cells in the wounded sites of the 57 patients recruited. BioSenic expects to deliver decisive key results from this Phase IIb trial in Q2  2023. The updated statistical analysis plan replaces the primary endpoint which now evaluates the difference between the placebo group and the experimental  ALLOB group in function of its compounded score from radiographic data collected after three months of treatment.BioSenic’s new statistical analysis plan leads to a more objective scoring for judging the result of its innovative cell repair treatment. A RUST score difference higher than 1.26 will be considered statistically relevant. A quantitative evaluation of the progress of the healing status of each patient will be given on a scale of a RUST score between 4 (no union) and 12 (complete healing)  through a careful radiographic evaluation by two independent specialists. BioSenic considers this new statistical analysis corresponds more appropriately to the general conditions of the trial  its overall timing and expected evaluation power. The actual cohort of patients is considered to be wide enough to reach significance for its new critical ALLOB efficacy primary endpoint.The ALLOB Phase IIb trial will also gather results on specific clinical evaluation criteria (secondary endpoints) and safety aspects  in accordance with the original study protocol. Treated patients will continue to be evaluated until full completion of the safety part of the study  as a follow-up of two years for each treated patient.Further to the decision to end recruitment and proceed towards a full set of meaningful results  the ALLOB subscription rights shall become exercisable based on the results at month three after patient treatment  if the difference in the mean RUST scores between the placebo's arm patient population and the treated ALLOB population is found higher than 1.26 in the new statistical analysis on the effectively recruited 57 patients. The BioSenic Board adopts the view that the new exercise criteria does not reduce the global advantages granted to the ALLOB subscription rights holders. The updated ALLOB subscription rights terms and ALLOB subscription rights Q&A are available on https://www.biosenic.com/investors.About BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company focused on (i) the development of innovative products to address high unmet needs in orthopedics and (ii) exploiting the possibilities offered by the therapeutic use of arsenic salts (mainly arsenic trioxide (ATO)) for patients with autoimmune diseases. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings an found d strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late delayed union .2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAPr.

As a result  the study has advanced from seeking pure basic clinical assessments to involving more quantitative data. This will allow for a superior significance analysis. This advance in the trial results assessment has been achieved through advances in radiographic procedures enabling increased clarity in statistical interpretation. As a result  BioSenic has decided  based on consultation with its external biostatistical advisors  that clinical investigators may now complete the recruitment of patients. The cohort of treated patients  amounting to 57 patients  is found to be sufficient for a sufficient level of significance.“BioSenic’s ALLOB represents a significant opportunity for clinical unmet medical needs in bone regeneration  namely difficult tibial fractures. These affect more than 300.000 patients per year in US and EU alone and can have a significant impact to the lives of those affected. As a result  there is a pressing demand to develop accelerated bone regeneration in these patients. The results of the modified Phase IIb clinical trial with our allogeneic bone cell therapy product will add to the positive results of the previous Phase I/IIa on delayed fractures  obtained and published after a recent successful open label  non-randomized study on long bones including tibia (NCT020205901). These previous clinical results have positively demonstrated good tolerability  evidence of increased bone formation and other clinical benefits ” said François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic. “As a result of these modifications to the current Phase IIb clinical trial  BioSenic will be able to quickly deliver the results expected from the original protocol  supported by the regulatory agencies. These results will be sufficient to define the next steps for further clinical evaluations of ALLOB  which could include a Phase III clinical trial required for market approval submission to regulatory agencies.”Results from ALLOB Phase IIb trial shall now be made three months after difficult fracture and infusion of the ALLOB cells in the wounded sites of the 57 patients recruited. BioSenic expects to deliver decisive key results from this Phase IIb trial in Q2  2023. The updated statistical analysis plan replaces the primary endpoint which now evaluates the difference between the placebo group and the experimental  ALLOB group in function of its compounded score from radiographic data collected after three months of treatment.BioSenic’s new statistical analysis plan leads to a more objective scoring for judging the result of its innovative cell repair treatment. A RUST score difference higher than 1.26 will be considered statistically relevant. A quantitative evaluation of the progress of the healing status of each patient will be given on a scale of a RUST score between 4 (no union) and 12 (complete healing)  through a careful radiographic evaluation by two independent specialists. BioSenic considers this new statistical analysis corresponds more appropriately to the general conditions of the trial  its overall timing and expected evaluation power. The actual cohort of patients is considered to be wide enough to reach significance for its new critical ALLOB efficacy primary endpoint.The ALLOB Phase IIb trial will also gather results on specific clinical evaluation criteria (secondary endpoints) and safety aspects  in accordance with the original study protocol. Treated patients will continue to be evaluated until full completion of the safety part of the study  as a follow-up of two years for each treated patient.Further to the decision to end recruitment and proceed towards a full set of meaningful results  the ALLOB subscription rights shall become exercisable based on the results at month three after patient treatment  if the difference in the mean RUST scores between the placebo's arm patient population and the treated ALLOB population is found higher than 1.26 in the new statistical analysis on the effectively recruited 57 patients.

This is improved from our previous target of 25 to 30% growth. This expectation is built primarily on orders already booked and  to a lesser extent  on our very promising pipeline of opportunities from existing and new customers. With this improved topline  EBITDA  EBIT and Cash flow are expected to be positive and net earnings are moving close to the break-even point.OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS AND STRATEGY UPDATEStrategy UpdateGeoJunxion’s strategy remains focused on creating “map agnostic” data products: digital geo-localized content  designed to be fully integrated into or overlaid on any commercial or open-source maps  or to be utilised in developing smart solutions for a large variety of use cases  in different industries and market sectors.This strategy has proven itself  as it delivered year-over-year growth of +40% during the last 36 months. We will therefore continue to diligently execute on this strategy and expand the scope of our existing product portfolio.In the second semester of the financial year  great attention and dedication will continue to be paid for the existing clients (Global Tech Companies) in executing custom Location Intelligence services and extending the scope of those project.GeoJunxion’s activities are directed towards establishing long-term relationships with our customers  through the creation of recurring business models rather than one-off opportunities. Although the relationship with clients frequently starts with a proof-of-concept or a custom one-off project  most of the Company’s efforts go into building value-added  dynamic content  requiring continuous and frequent updates to maintain and increase their value over time. This means that most of our proof-of-concept and one-off projects are a launch-pad for establishing a service or license contract  converting the initial activities into a recurring  more predictable and sustainable business model.When executing projects  GeoJunxion typically retains the Intellectual Property and ownership of the newly developed datasets and solutions  for licensing to other customers. Thereby  leveraging the initial investment and creating a virtuous business cycle.Our mission remains focused on improving road safety and contributing to a more sustainable world  reducing the impact on the environment  through intelligent solutions enabling more environmentally conscious decisions.Central to GeoJunxion’s strategy are:Cost effective research  sourcing  production  ingestion  and aggregation of geodata.Flexible licensing models at competitive pricing.Direct delivery of dynamic  up-to-date content via APIs.Highly customised solutions and content creation.Market DevelopmentsWhile clear signs of improvement were showing in some industry sectors  the conflict in Ukraine and its direct and indirect consequences continues to bring serious concerns in the market. Existing and prospect clients strictly monitor their expenditures and continue to be prudent in contracting projects.GeoJunxion has no direct business exposure to the events in Ukraine or Russia. We have no active customers  or deliveries due to  or to be received from Ukraine or Russia. GeoJunxion is however exposed to rising inflation rates  resulting from increased energy and other raw material prices. This is impacting salary & benefit expenses of our staff  costs for office rent and other services.At the same time  we see that demand for location-aware content is still increasing in various industries and markets  despite the concerns on the health of the global economy. While many big Companies are executing significant reductions in force  to cut costs  GeoJunxion remains positive and is actively re-enforcing the team with key profiles necessary to consolidate the current results and pave the way for continued growth.The largest market opportunity for GeoJunxion remains  by far  with big Tech Companies  making extensive use of geo-localized data for their business and end-user solutions. In this market segment  we are dedicating a sizable portion of our resources on project execution. We booked and executed sizable projects in Q1 and received project extensions and booked new opportunities also in the second quarter. There are additional new and interesting opportunities in the pipeline for the remaining part of the fiscal year.In the automotive industry we see growing opportunities derived from adoption of advanced driver-assistance systems  such as ISA (Intelligent Speed Assistance). We can also experience a growing demand for more cost-effective mapping solutions which have the most up-to-date and relevant data content. Premium data content towards safety on the road and environmental sustainability remains our major interest and focus for product development.GeoJunxion also remains active in identifying opportunities in more traditional markets  such as Transport & Logistics  Real Estate  Geo-Marketing  Business Analysis  Travel & Tourism  as well as with the Public Administration. For the next months  GeoJunxion is also re-enforcing the efforts for the Outdoor Venue Plans  our last mile customized maps  where other global map providers do not offer concrete solutions.Business DevelopmentIn 1H (July to December) 2022-23  the Location Intelligence Services have played a fundamental role in our business development. In Q1 we started and partly completed the execution of a newly won big project  which has been extended in scope during Q2 2022/23. In Q2 we have been also awarded for new Location Intelligence projects. These new contracts  which are in execution  will continue to convert into revenue during the third quarter of this Financial Year.During Q2  our Sales and Business development teams attended more events in person  meeting with partners and clients face to face  to promote GeoJunxion’s brand  its products and services.Product DevelopmentCustom project executionWe continue to put significant efforts in the development of custom location intelligence projects for a global Tech Company. The first project  announced in August ’22  has been extended in scope  and therefore prolonged into Q2. In the second quarter  other custom projects for global Tech Companies have been added to our workload. Their execution is in progress and is expected to be completed during the Q3 of F.Y. 2022/23.Automotive product developmentOn the R&D side  most of the product development was focused on the execution and refinement of the data for an important Infotainment System Manufacturer. This project  announced in April 2022  is close to the completion of the first phase: the completion of a market ready product  including field tests and quality controls.Eco Alert Zones and School Safety ZonesSmart Geofences are key products in the GeoJunxion’s portfolio. Eco Alert Zones and School Safety Zones have been kept up to date during the course of last quarter. They are increasing in number  geographical coverage and also in the type of areas. New School Streets have been analyzed and encoded. Having confirmed specific market interest for such geofences  we have decided to launch an innovative proof of concept project with the intent to develop deep learning methods in the field of satellite imagery  analysis and object recognition  applied to this specific use case. This activity will continue for the entire year 2023.ORDER INTAKEOrder intake confirmed the positive trend: following an exceptionally good Q1 2022/23  with an increase of more than 6 times compared with the same period of last year  Q2 order intake was 10% better than last year. The value of orders booked in this very remarkable first semester F.Y. 2022/23  was 4 times bigger than 1H 2021/22.REVENUEIn Q2 2022/23  revenue increased by +25%. Growth was realised in all our product lines  with recurring revenue growing by 45% and non-recurring service revenue growing by 17%. It is very encouraging to see the recurring products now showing the highest growth percentage.For 1H 2022/23  revenue increased by +63%. Also  during the entire first semester  the growth has been realized in all our product lines  with recurring revenue growing by 22% and non-recurring service revenue growing by 87%.GeoJunxion tracks its revenue by product type and by the nature of the underlying contract (recurring versus non-recurring). The main revenue growth has been realized in non-recurring location services  but also the recurring revenue from licenses and royalties showed an increase. The recurring service revenue showed a reduction  primarily due to the timing of the project execution. This will be caught up during Q2 2022-23. Recurring service revenue includes the updating services of our Eco Alert Zones product and other data products. The non-recurring service revenue includes tailored research and collection of data sets and creation of geo-located content.OPERATING RESULTThe Q2 2022-23 operating result shows a profit €153 K  compared to a loss of €60K during the same quarter last year. There are three main drivers for this year-over-year improvement:25% increase in revenue to €846K (€679K  PY).6% decrease in net operational expenses. This is remarkable considering the inflationary pressures and the 25% increase in revenue.Higher Capitalized development costs +€33K (+27%) due to ongoing investments in new products and coverage extension of existing products.The 1H 2022-23 operating result shows an operating profit €797 K  compared to a loss of €185 K during the same period last year. The main drivers for such a positive result are similar to those mentioned for the quarterly improvement:63% increase in revenue to €2.213 K (€1.354 K  PY).8% decrease in net operational expenses. This is remarkable considering the inflationary pressures and the 63% increase in revenue.Higher Capitalized development costs +€96K (+39%) due to ongoing investments in new products and coverage extension of existing products.ORGANIZATIONGeoJunxion has achieved Level 2 certification on Social Entrepreneurship: the Prestatieladder Socialer Ondernemen.

Based on our current outlook  the available cash on hand is estimated to be sufficient to cover our operational requirements for at least the next 12 months.APPOINTMENT OF EXTERNAL AUDITORIn the past few months  we have had extensive discussions with OOB/PIE licensed auditing companies. In spite of improved financial results  positive cash flows generated  improved governance & internal control processes  none of the auditing companies contacted was willing to provide a quotation for performing the audit work. The main reasons given by the auditing firms are the lack of internal staff capacity to execute the work and the limited size of the company and its market capitalization.With the end of the 24-months period given by Euronext Amsterdam approaching  we are actively reaching out to other companies in a comparable situation to formulate a joint position. At the same time  we continue to investigate alternative resolutions such as for example: the NBA route and alternative stock markets. Our thinking is however not limited to these 2 options. We are exploring all other options  in order to make the best decision if and when we are faced with this situation.RISK MANAGEMENTRisk management is an integral managerial task.

This is improved from our previous target of 25 to 30% growth. This expectation is built primarily on orders already booked and  to a lesser extent  on our very promising pipeline of opportunities from existing and new customers. With this improved topline  EBITDA  EBIT and Cash flow are expected to be positive and net earnings are moving close to the break-even point.OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS AND STRATEGY UPDATEStrategy UpdateGeoJunxion’s strategy remains focused on creating “map agnostic” data products: digital geo-localized content  designed to be fully integrated into or overlaid on any commercial or open-source maps  or to be utilised in developing smart solutions for a large variety of use cases  in different industries and market sectors.This strategy has proven itself  as it delivered year-over-year growth of +40% during the last 36 months. We will therefore continue to diligently execute on this strategy and expand the scope of our existing product portfolio.In the second semester of the financial year  great attention and dedication will continue to be paid for the existing clients (Global Tech Companies) in executing custom Location Intelligence services and extending the scope of those project.GeoJunxion’s activities are directed towards establishing long-term relationships with our customers  through the creation of recurring business models rather than one-off opportunities. Although the relationship with clients frequently starts with a proof-of-concept or a custom one-off project  most of the Company’s efforts go into building value-added  dynamic content  requiring continuous and frequent updates to maintain and increase their value over time. This means that most of our proof-of-concept and one-off projects are a launch-pad for establishing a service or license contract  converting the initial activities into a recurring  more predictable and sustainable business model.When executing projects  GeoJunxion typically retains the Intellectual Property and ownership of the newly developed datasets and solutions  for licensing to other customers. Thereby  leveraging the initial investment and creating a virtuous business cycle.Our mission remains focused on improving road safety and contributing to a more sustainable world  reducing the impact on the environment  through intelligent solutions enabling more environmentally conscious decisions.Central to GeoJunxion’s strategy are:Cost effective research  sourcing  production  ingestion  and aggregation of geodata.Flexible licensing models at competitive pricing.Direct delivery of dynamic  up-to-date content via APIs.Highly customised solutions and content creation.Market DevelopmentsWhile clear signs of improvement were showing in some industry sectors  the conflict in Ukraine and its direct and indirect consequences continues to bring serious concerns in the market. Existing and prospect clients strictly monitor their expenditures and continue to be prudent in contracting projects.GeoJunxion has no direct business exposure to the events in Ukraine or Russia. We have no active customers  or deliveries due to  or to be received from Ukraine or Russia. GeoJunxion is however exposed to rising inflation rates  resulting from increased energy and other raw material prices. This is impacting salary & benefit expenses of our staff  costs for office rent and other services.At the same time  we see that demand for location-aware content is still increasing in various industries and markets  despite the concerns on the health of the global economy. While many big Companies are executing significant reductions in force  to cut costs  GeoJunxion remains positive and is actively re-enforcing the team with key profiles necessary to consolidate the current results and pave the way for continued growth.The largest market opportunity for GeoJunxion remains  by far  with big Tech Companies  making extensive use of geo-localized data for their business and end-user solutions. In this market segment  we are dedicating a sizable portion of our resources on project execution. We booked and executed sizable projects in Q1 and received project extensions and booked new opportunities also in the second quarter. There are additional new and interesting opportunities in the pipeline for the remaining part of the fiscal year.In the automotive industry we see growing opportunities derived from adoption of advanced driver-assistance systems  such as ISA (Intelligent Speed Assistance). We can also experience a growing demand for more cost-effective mapping solutions which have the most up-to-date and relevant data content.

This is due to the ongoing emphasis on cutting back on environmental waste and carbon impact. It has a significant potential for energy savings  which is made possible by its inherent recyclable nature. The majority of well-known suppliers in the international market are striving to produce plastic pallets that are completely ecologically friendly.Prominent sellers distinguish their plastic container products and reduce their carbon impact by using 100% recyclable business plastic and domestic refuse plastics. During the production of plastic containers  the goal is to use less energy and emit as little carbon dioxide as possible. Thus  manufacturing plastic containers from 100% recyclable plastic contributes to environmental stewardship while also ensuring cost effectiveness.Key Plastic Pallets Market ChallengeRegulatory norms and standards on the use of plastic pallets is one of the factors limiting the market growth.Regulations are in place to control the use of plastic pallets in certain sectors to guarantee adherence to the necessary safety standards and environmental sustainability. These legal requirements are clearly visible in the food manufacturing and packing sectors.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US developed a number of guidelines for the management  processing  and shipping of food. A collection of rules called the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) aims to stop germs  chemicals  and other dangerous outside agents from contaminating food. This implies that those involved in the US food manufacturing business should use hygienic food transportation gear.To fully comprehend market sellers' impact on carbon footprint  it is crucial that they participate in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. Vendors should also make sure that the making of plastic pallets uses the least amount possible of dangerous chemicals like lead  mercury  cadmium  and polybrominated biphenyls. Such regulation requirements impose design and production limitations on market sellers  which serves as a market restraint.Plastic Pallet Market PlayersThe Plastic Pallet market key players include Agrico Plastiques Ltee  Allied Plastics Inc.

Already over 40% of portfolio compliant in 2050 on the 1.5°C decarbonization pathway (CRREM analysis)​.The VGP 2027  2029 and 2030 bonds have been affirmed as aligned with the Climate Bonds Taxonomy​.131.6MWp in photovoltaic projects installed or under construction with a further 75.0MWp in pipeline; once fully built  the PV projects will generate more renewable energy than all tenants’ energy consumption combined​.All VGP offices switched to renewable energy since 1 January 2022 through a PPA contract with our own 3.9MWp solar roof at VGP Park Roosendaal providing the energy.We introduced further steps to reduce embodied emissions within our developments – first projects completed with wooden load bearing structure and heat pumps included in the VGP building standard (replacing gas powered heating)  furthermore we have updated our building standard to implement water saving and retention techniques.Renewable Energy In total  there are 62 solar panel installations operational across the portfolio. The total installed renewable energy capacity of the Group’s assets in 2022 is 56.6 MWp (of which 15.1 MWp is third party operated) (+66% compared to Dec 2021) with a further 28 projects with a power of 75.0 MWp under construction  representing an investment of € 78 million once completed. Looking forward  another 60 projects with a total of 72.7 MWp contracted power are in the pipeline.Gross renewable energy income over 2022 was € 5.9 million (net € 5.6 million); compared to € 1.3 million in 2021. Gross renewable energy income over 2022 benefitted from significant increase in production capacity as well as higher energy prices.Operational solar production capacity should see exponential growth in the coming year.In 2022  new solar panels were installed across the portfolio. One of largest multi-site roof-top photovoltaic systems in the Netherlands is being built in VGP Park Nijmegen (Netherlands): the construction works started in 2020  with the installation of 4.8 MWp; in 2022 an additional 3.1 MWp has been installed and the project will be fully operational in 2023  when the installation will achieve a total output of around 17.61 MWp. The Group’s largest multi-site in Germany is at VGP Park München where an 11.55 MWp photovoltaic plant was installed and finished in December 2022  generating an estimated saving of energy purchased from the grid of 9 000 000KWh.In Germany  VGP Park München also uses geothermal energy to meet its heating and cooling needs. A solid pipeline of future projects is maintained throughout the Group  such as photovoltaic self-consumption plants. The renewable electricity produced by the Group is either self-consumed to meet our tenant’s energy needs or sold to the grid. Once the photovoltaic projects currently under construction are fully operational the solar power production capacity will surpass the total energy consumption of all tenants as measured over FY2021.Outlook 2023 Along with our strong balance sheet  healthy treasury position  well positioned portfolio and with a primary focus on the development of our existing and attractive land bank  we remain confident to deliver solid operational performance and further strengthen our cash recycling model.With the months of January and February having started well and despite an uncertain geopolitical and economic environment  VGP pursues prudently its margin-focused strategy  underpinned by technical competence and investment as well as a constant quest for high sustainability and quality in our warehouses and their locations.Given its annualized contracted rental income of € 303 million and recent deliveries of 1.1 million square meters to lessees  net rental income is expected to further record high double digit growth.Dividend 2022 The Board of Directors has decided to propose to the Annual Shareholder’s Meeting of 12 May 2023 to distribute a gross dividend of € 2.75 per share  corresponding to a total gross dividend amount of € 75 051 108.KEY FINANCIAL METRICS Operations and results 2022 2021 Change (%) Committed annualised rental income (€mm) 303.2 256.1 18.4% Gross Renewable Energy income (€mm) 5.9 1.3 353.8% Operating result before unrealized valuation adjustments (€mm) 177.5 45.4 291.0% IFRS net profit (€mm) (122.5) 650.1 n/a IFRS earnings per share (€ per share) (5.49) 31.41 n/a Dividend per share (€ per share) 2.7511 6.85 (59.9)% Portfolio and balance sheet 2022 2021 Change (%) Portfolio value  including Joint Ventures at 100% (€mm) 6 443 5 746 12.1% Portfolio value  including Joint Ventures at share (€mm) 4 605 4 084 12.8% Occupancy ratio of standing portfolio (%) 98.9 99.4 - EPRA NTA12 per share (€ per share) 103.17 106.93 (3.52)% IFRS NAV per share (€ per share) 98.70 99.65 (0.95)% Net financial debt (€mm) 1 669 1 159 44.0% Gearing13 (%) 34.4 29.8 - AUDIO WEBCAST FOR INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS VGP will host an audio webcast at 10:30 (CET) on 23 February 2023The conference call will be available on: Webcast link: https://channel.royalcast.com/landingpage/vgp/20230223_1/Click on the link above to attend the presentation from your laptop  tablet or mobile deviceThe presentation will stream through your selected devicePlease join the event audio webcast 5-10 minutes prior to the start time A presentation will be available on VGP website:https://www.vgpparks.eu/en/investors/publications/FINANCIAL CALENDAR Publication Annual Report 2022 11 April 2022 First quarter 2023 trading update 4 May 2022 General meeting of shareholders 12 May 2022 Dividend ex-date 24 May 2022 Dividend payment date 26 May 2022 Half year results 2023 24 August 2022 Third quarter 2023 trading update 3 November 2022 CONTACT DETAILS FOR INVESTORS AND MEDIA ENQUIRIES Investor RelationsTel: +32 (0)3 289 1433investor.relations@vgpparks.eu Karen Huybrechts(Head of Marketing)| Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1432 ABOUT VGP VGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

The total installed renewable energy capacity of the Group’s assets in 2022 is 56.6 MWp (of which 15.1 MWp is third party operated) (+66% compared to Dec 2021) with a further 28 projects with a power of 75.0 MWp under construction  representing an investment of € 78 million once completed. Looking forward  another 60 projects with a total of 72.7 MWp contracted power are in the pipeline.Gross renewable energy income over 2022 was € 5.9 million (net € 5.6 million); compared to € 1.3 million in 2021. Gross renewable energy income over 2022 benefitted from significant increase in production capacity as well as higher energy prices.Operational solar production capacity should see exponential growth in the coming year.In 2022  new solar panels were installed across the portfolio. One of largest multi-site roof-top photovoltaic systems in the Netherlands is being built in VGP Park Nijmegen (Netherlands): the construction works started in 2020  with the installation of 4.8 MWp; in 2022 an additional 3.1 MWp has been installed and the project will be fully operational in 2023  when the installation will achieve a total output of around 17.61 MWp. The Group’s largest multi-site in Germany is at VGP Park München where an 11.55 MWp photovoltaic plant was installed and finished in December 2022  generating an estimated saving of energy purchased from the grid of 9 000 000KWh.In Germany  VGP Park München also uses geothermal energy to meet its heating and cooling needs. A solid pipeline of future projects is maintained throughout the Group  such as photovoltaic self-consumption plants. The renewable electricity produced by the Group is either self-consumed to meet our tenant’s energy needs or sold to the grid. Once the photovoltaic projects currently under construction are fully operational the solar power production capacity will surpass the total energy consumption of all tenants as measured over FY2021.Outlook 2023 Along with our strong balance sheet  healthy treasury position  well positioned portfolio and with a primary focus on the development of our existing and attractive land bank  we remain confident to deliver solid operational performance and further strengthen our cash recycling model.With the months of January and February having started well and despite an uncertain geopolitical and economic environment  VGP pursues prudently its margin-focused strategy  underpinned by technical competence and investment as well as a constant quest for high sustainability and quality in our warehouses and their locations.Given its annualized contracted rental income of € 303 million and recent deliveries of 1.1 million square meters to lessees  net rental income is expected to further record high double digit growth.Dividend 2022 The Board of Directors has decided to propose to the Annual Shareholder’s Meeting of 12 May 2023 to distribute a gross dividend of € 2.75 per share  corresponding to a total gross dividend amount of € 75 051 108.KEY FINANCIAL METRICS Operations and results 2022 2021 Change (%) Committed annualised rental income (€mm) 303.2 256.1 18.4% Gross Renewable Energy income (€mm) 5.9 1.3 353.8% Operating result before unrealized valuation adjustments (€mm) 177.5 45.4 291.0% IFRS net profit (€mm) (122.5) 650.1 n/a IFRS earnings per share (€ per share) (5.49) 31.41 n/a Dividend per share (€ per share) 2.7511 6.85 (59.9)% Portfolio and balance sheet 2022 2021 Change (%) Portfolio value  including Joint Ventures at 100% (€mm) 6 443 5 746 12.1% Portfolio value  including Joint Ventures at share (€mm) 4 605 4 084 12.8% Occupancy ratio of standing portfolio (%) 98.9 99.4 - EPRA NTA12 per share (€ per share) 103.17 106.93 (3.52)% IFRS NAV per share (€ per share) 98.70 99.65 (0.95)% Net financial debt (€mm) 1 669 1 159 44.0% Gearing13 (%) 34.4 29.8 - AUDIO WEBCAST FOR INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS VGP will host an audio webcast at 10:30 (CET) on 23 February 2023The conference call will be available on: Webcast link: https://channel.royalcast.com/landingpage/vgp/20230223_1/Click on the link above to attend the presentation from your laptop  tablet or mobile deviceThe presentation will stream through your selected devicePlease join the event audio webcast 5-10 minutes prior to the start time A presentation will be available on VGP website:https://www.vgpparks.eu/en/investors/publications/FINANCIAL CALENDAR Publication Annual Report 2022 11 April 2022 First quarter 2023 trading update 4 May 2022 General meeting of shareholders 12 May 2022 Dividend ex-date 24 May 2022 Dividend payment date 26 May 2022 Half year results 2023 24 August 2022 Third quarter 2023 trading update 3 November 2022 CONTACT DETAILS FOR INVESTORS AND MEDIA ENQUIRIES Investor RelationsTel: +32 (0)3 289 1433investor.relations@vgpparks.eu Karen Huybrechts(Head of Marketing)| Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1432 ABOUT VGP VGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

The regulatory approval of the Idylla™ instrument in China and of the Idylla™ MSI Test as a companion diagnostic test (CDx1) in Japan will broaden our global commercial footprint. The extension of the collaboration with AstraZeneca aimed at developing a CDx for Tagrisso® and the commercialization of SkylineDx’s Merlin™ Assay and Ophiomics’ HepatoPredict show that partnerships are a powerful means to rapidly expand the menu of oncology tests and to make it available to any lab. Now that we also successfully recapitalized the company with EUR 66m of gross cash proceeds and a strengthened capital structure  we are in a strong position to take another significant step towards profitability. Several new regulatory approvals and new product launches are planned for 2023  including the launch of the Idylla™ IDH1-2 Mutation Assay Kit (RUO)  the first assay developed with our new Idylla™ FLEX technology that significantly shortens development times and that will allow us to bring more tests to the market faster. While we are likely to operate in a continued unstable economic climate  we took measures towards the end of 2022 to weather the impact of significant cost inflation  and we are confident that in 2023 we will continue to grow product related revenues  again improve the gross margin on product sales and further reduce the operating cash burn.”KEY MESSAGES 2022 RESULTSTotal operating income of EUR 58m (2021: EUR 54.9)  of which EUR 57.5m revenue  an increase of 19% from EUR 48.3m in 2021of EUR 58m (2021: EUR 54.9)  of which EUR 57.5m revenue  an increase of 19% from EUR 48.3m in 2021 Product revenue of EUR 45m (2021: EUR 40.5m)  of which EUR 35.9m from 334k cartridges sold and EUR 9.2m from instrument rentals and sales: EUR 31.3m cartridge revenue in oncology  a 30% year-on-year increase  double-digit growth across all regions  led by the US  both in cartridge volumes and in average selling price (ASP) COVID-19 testing needs were fading  decreasing the revenue contribution from SARS-CoV-2 tests to EUR 3.5m Continued increase of ASP per commercial cartridge to EUR 106 (2021: EUR 96).

Several new customers among the top 10 cancer centers adopted Idylla™ in 2022. The ASP in oncology  traditionally higher in the US than in our other markets  benefitted from a favorable product mix and a smaller proportion of free-of-charge cartridge volumes for market seeding and the initial validation of assays Strong performance of the distributor markets 5 supported by the commercial agreement with AstraZeneca aimed at increasing access to Idylla™ EGFR testing products for patients with non-small cell lung cancerTotal revenue from Idylla™ instruments increased by 3% to EUR 9.2m in 2022  including instruments sold to content partners 6 : Revenue generated from instrument placements at end customers increased by 36% year-on-year  against a 9% increase of the installed base of Idylla™ instruments  which is evenly split between sold and rented instruments Certain clinical trials that were planned to start in 2022 and requiring the sale of a significant number of Idylla™ instruments were delayed by our content partners in light of the uncertain economic environment Instrument revenue in the US more than doubled  even though several new customers deferred the investment decision and adopted Idylla™ through Biocartis’ free-of-charge evaluation program under which they can temporarily use the instrument while only paying for the cartridge consumption. Subject to the favorable outcome of the evaluation  revenues from the ultimate sale or rental of such instruments are therefore delayed by 6 months on average 173 net new instruments placed. Several instruments were reclaimed following a focused review of non-performing reagent rental agreements to eliminate non-profitable investments in capital expenditure:Idylla™ test menu  partnerships & publicationsTest menu: Launch of the fully automated  CE-marked IVD Idylla™ GeneFusion Panel on 20 June 2022 Launch of new SeptiCyte RAPID ® (CE-IVD) EDTA 7 blood compatible cartridges 8 by Biocartis’ partner Immunexpress on 23 August 2022 Start of the commercialization on 1 September 2022 in Europe of SkylineDx’s innovative Merlin Assay as a CE-IVD marked manual kit  ahead of the launch of an Idylla™ version of the AssayProduct registrations: Japan – On 29 August 2022  Nichirei Biosciences  Biocartis’ distribution partner in Japan  received approval by the Japanese regulatory authorities (Ministry of Health  Labor and Welfare) for the commercialization of the Idylla™ MSI Test in Japan. Nichirei Biosciences plans the commercial launch of the Idylla™ MSI Test as a CDx in Japan in Q1 2023 China – Regulatory approval of the Idylla™ instrument on 16 September 2022 by the Chinese regulatory authorities NMPA  an important step towards the further regulatory and commercialization of Idylla™ assays in ChinaPartnerships: Announcement of a new partnership on 8 February 2022 between Biocartis and Ophiomics  a Lisbon (Portugal) based biotech company with an initial focus on the commercialization of HepatoPredict 9 . The commercialization in Europe of the test as a CE-marked IVD kit started on 10 October 2022 Announcement of an extension of the collaboration with AstraZeneca on 22 June 2022 highlighting the development and planned premarket submission to the US FDA of a novel CDx test on the Idylla™ platform for AstraZeneca’s third-generation EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) treatmentPublications - During 2022  42 new papers with excellent data were published on several new Idylla™ studies  including: A study (announced 4 May 2022) by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (NY  US)  in the Journal of Molecular Diagnostics on the Idylla™ GeneFusion Assay (RUO 10 )  highlighting the quicker turnaround and the lower tissue requirements compared to immunohistochemistry and molecular methods  while also circumventing the infrastructure dependencies associated with NGS and fluorescence in situ hybridization. A large prospective study (announced 8 November 2022) demonstrating that the Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test (CE-IVD) leads to the significant reduction of the time-to-treatment by on average 16.8 days or 48% compared to NGS testing for EGFR positive patientsOrganizational and operational highlightsCommercial milestones – Double milestone announced on 15 June 2022 with the selling of the 1 000 000th commercial Idylla™ cartridge and the placement of the 2 000th Idylla™ instrument since commercial launchShareholders’ Meetings – All agenda items were approved during the ordinary shareholders’ meeting held 13 May 2022 and the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting held 14 November 2022 which approved the various components of the Company’s comprehensive recapitalizationCartridge manufacturing – Except for the Septicyte RAPID ® test  the transfer of all assays to the second cartridge manufacturing line (‘ML2’) was completed during 2022  further unlocking economies of scale and reducing manufacturing coststest  the transfer of all assays to the second cartridge manufacturing line (‘ML2’) was completed during 2022  further unlocking economies of scale and reducing manufacturing costs ISO 27001 certification – ISO 27001 certification of Biocartis announced on 24 August 2022 for the design  development  maintenance  service provision and support of the Idylla™ platform and associated customer-facing softwareManagement team – Biocartis aligned its organizational structure to deliver on its strategic priorities and has appointed  effective as from 1 September 2022: Global Head of Partnering: Madhushree (Madhu) Ghosh  PhD  MS  joined Biocartis as Global Head of Partnering. Dr. Ghosh brings a wealth of experience to successful commercial and strategic team leadership in global strategic alliance management  P/L business unit leadership and IVD and CDx product development for more than 20 years spent in molecular diagnostics and clinical assay development with a focus on Next Generation Sequencing  real-time PCR  multiplex PCR  oncology and infectious disease diagnostics. Previously  Dr. Ghosh held senior roles at Thermo Fisher Scientific  NeoGenomics Laboratories Inc.  QIAGEN  and AltheaDx. Global Head of Sales: David Dejans  previously Head of Sales Europe and Distributor markets  moved into the role of Global Head of SalesIn Q4 2022  the organization was streamlined across all areas of the business to withstand the impact of the significant cost inflation. Compared to 31 December 2021  the workforce decreased by 16%Financial highlightsTotal operating income – Total operating income amounted to EUR 58m  compared to EUR 54.9m in 2021  and included EUR 45m from product sales (2021: EUR 40.5m; +11%)  EUR 11.1m from various collaborations with partners (2021: EUR 6.1m; +83%)  EUR 1.4m from instrument servicing (2021: EUR 1.7m; -20%) and EUR 0.5m other income (2021: EUR 6.6m; -93%) Revenues from cartridge sales grew 13% year-on-year to EUR 35.9m. Cartridge sales in the core oncology business increased by 30%  while sales of the SARS-CoV-2 cartridges decreased by 49% and only represented 7.7% of total product revenues. 334k cartridges were sold in 2022 (2021: 326k) at an ASP of EUR 106 (2021: EUR 96). The strong 30% growth of oncology cartridge revenue resulted from growing cartridge volumes (+14% year-on-year) and an increased ASP of EUR 116  compared to EUR 105 in 2021. The ASP in oncology continues to develop favorably as the contribution from high value-adding assays such as the Idylla TM Genefusion Assay (RUO) continues to increase. A continued focus on pricing discipline and a gradually increasing contribution from sales in the US where prices are generally higher than in Europe and other parts of the world  also support the steady increase of the cartridge ASP. Conversely  the fading COVID-19 testing need resulted in 36% lower cartridge volumes in infectious diseases  while the ASP of EUR 63 also decreased 18% year-on-year Revenues from the sale and rental of the Idylla TM instrument amounted to EUR 9.2m  a 3% increase year-on-year. The installed base grew with 173 instruments to 2 085 instruments  net of conversions from instruments previously placed free-of-charge under short-term evaluation programs and returns of non-performing instruments under reagent rental agreements aimed at reducing non-profitable capital investments. As a direct result of the uncertain economic climate  the planned sale of a significant number of instruments was delayed following the decision by certain content partners to delay clinical trials that were planned to start in 2022 Income from collaborations amounted to EUR 11.1m compared to EUR 6.1m in 2021  and mainly included R&D services provided to our pharma and content partners  aimed at expanding the Idylla™ test menu and at developing companion diagnostic tests that will unlock additional market potential in the US and in other markets Other income of EUR 0.5m related to grants received in connection with the development of the new Idylla TM FLEX technology that is expected to facilitate the use of Idylla TM tests in therapy decisions and molecular surveillance. The first product that is based on this Idylla™ FLEX technology  the Idylla™ IDH1-2 Mutation Assay Kit (RUO)  was launched in 2023. In 2021  other income included an insurance claim of EUR 4.6m for damages caused by the fire in a warehouse in July 2021Cost of goods sold – Cost of goods sold decreased by 12% to EUR 29.8m  while cartridge volumes and the number of newly placed instruments remained comparable to 2021. Contrary to 2021  a year of disrupted reagent supply and the temporary unavailability of manufacturing capacity caused by the fire in one of Biocartis’ warehouses  most cartridges were produced on the high-throughput automated manufacturing line ML2 in 2022  unlocking significant economies of scale. The gross margin on product sales more than doubled from 16% in 2021 to 34% in 2022  as a direct result of lower manufacturing costs per cartridge and the lower contribution of low-priced SARS-CoV-2 tests. In the first quarter of 2023  more than 90% of the commercial cartridge production will have been transferred to ML2 and a plan to fully decommission ML1 will be implemented over the yearOPEX – Total operating expenses  excluding the cost of goods sold  decreased 10% year-on-year from EUR 83.6m to EUR 75.2m. Apart from the fire damages of EUR 3.2m incurred in 2021  operating expenses decreased by EUR 5.2m  despite the impact of global inflation. Investments in various R&D programs were cut back by EUR 9.7m. The increase of EUR 3.8m in sales & marketing reflected normalized commercial activities post the pandemic and the full year impact of the restructuring of the US commercial operations implemented at the end of 2021. General & administrative spending levels remained stable at EUR 16.2m  an increase of 4% year-on-year that merely reflected cost inflation. In Q4 of 2022  the organization was streamlined to offset the expected continued inflation of costs in 2023  including the mandatory indexation of salaries in Belgium of 11%  effective January 2023. Among others  the workforce was reduced by 16% across the entire organization since 31 December 2021Recapitalization – On 1 September 2022  Biocartis launched a comprehensive recapitalization  providing EUR 66m of gross proceeds and comprising: the amendment of the existing 4% convertible bonds of EUR 135m  including a.o. the mandatory conversion of 10% of these convertible bonds into common shares at the conversion rate of EUR 12.89 and the extension of the maturity date until 9 November 2027 a new first lien secured convertible term loan of EUR 30.1m  partly used for the buy-back of EUR 16.3m of existing 4% convertible bonds for EUR 13.7m in cash an exchange of the amended existing convertible bonds for new 4.5% second lien secured convertible bonds  subject to the subscription of EUR 25m of additional newly issued 4.5% convertible bonds  and a rights offering with extra-legal preferential rights for the existing shareholders of the Company of EUR 25.1mOn 31 December 2022  the recapitalization transactions were partly completed. Following the amendment  the buy-back and the exchange offer  EUR 14.8m of existing 4% convertible bonds remained outstanding and EUR 92.1m of the 4% convertible bonds had been exchanged for the new 4.5% convertible bonds. EUR 18.1m was drawn under the new convertible term loan and 33 476 932 new shares were issued on 2 December 2022 through a rights offering of EUR 25.1m. Post year-end  the recapitalization completed on 16 January 2023 with the second drawdown of EUR 12m under the new convertible term loan and the funding of the additional new 4.5% convertible bonds for EUR 25mFinancial results – The net financial expense of EUR 0.01m included the impact of the recapitalization. In accordance with IFRS  the amendment and the exchange were considered as an extinguishment of the existing 4% convertible bond and the issuance of the new 4.5% convertible bond. The difference between the derecognition of the existing convertible bond and the new convertible bond was recorded as a gain of EUR 10.5m in the income statement. The interest and debt appreciation expense associated with the convertible term loan and the two convertible bonds amounted to EUR 10.2mCash flows and cash balance – The cash flow from operating and investing activities amounted to EUR -50.3m  a significant reduction of EUR 19.2m compared to EUR 69.5m in 2021. The reduction resulted from a.o. (a) EUR 15.6m improvement of the operating result  (b) EUR 5.8m lower investments in working capital  (c) EUR 1.8m lower capital expenditure  offset by (d) investments in the Chinese joint venture Wondfo-Cartis (EUR 1m) and in a convertible note issued by SkylineDx (of which EUR 2.5m was already made available by Biocartis). The net proceeds from financing activities of EUR 22.5m reflected (a) a net new drawdown of EUR 9m on working capital facilities from KBC Bank  (b) EUR 18.1m proceeds from the first drawdown under the new convertible term loans  (c) the cash buy-back of existing convertible bonds for EUR 13.7m  (d) the scheduled reimbursement of EUR 6.6m of lease obligations  (e) EUR 25.1m proceeds of the rights issue  net of (f) EUR 9.6m fees associated with the recapitalization transactions. The cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2022 amounted to EUR 26.1m.Post year-end  the recapitalization transaction was completed on 16 January 2023  adding EUR 36.1m of net cash  from the second drawdown on the convertible term loan and the issuance of EUR 25m of additional 4.5% convertible bondsBalance sheet – In accordance with IFRS 9  the new 4.5% convertible bonds were partly recorded as a liability and partly as equity. Following the recapitalization transactions  the financial indebtedness at 31 December 2022 amounted to EUR 117.8m compared to EUR 154.2m at 31 December 2021. The shareholders’ equity increased by EUR 8.2m as a result of a.o. (a) the recognition of EUR 22.8m equity value attributed to the new convertible bond  (b) the issuance of new shares for EUR 23m  net of fees  following the rights offering and (c) the loss for the year of EUR 47.7mKEY FIGURES 2022The tables below show an overview of the key figures and a breakdown of operating income for 2022 and 2021.

In a troubled macroeconomic environment  we continued to scale our core oncology business and delivered on our financial objectives with strong 30% growth of oncology revenues  a doubling of the gross margin on product sales to 34%  and a sizeable EUR 18.1m or 32% reduction of our operating cash burn. Furthermore  we laid solid foundation for continued future growth. The regulatory approval of the Idylla™ instrument in China and of the Idylla™ MSI Test as a companion diagnostic test (CDx1) in Japan will broaden our global commercial footprint. The extension of the collaboration with AstraZeneca aimed at developing a CDx for Tagrisso® and the commercialization of SkylineDx’s Merlin™ Assay and Ophiomics’ HepatoPredict show that partnerships are a powerful means to rapidly expand the menu of oncology tests and to make it available to any lab. Now that we also successfully recapitalized the company with EUR 66m of gross cash proceeds and a strengthened capital structure  we are in a strong position to take another significant step towards profitability. Several new regulatory approvals and new product launches are planned for 2023  including the launch of the Idylla™ IDH1-2 Mutation Assay Kit (RUO)  the first assay developed with our new Idylla™ FLEX technology that significantly shortens development times and that will allow us to bring more tests to the market faster. While we are likely to operate in a continued unstable economic climate  we took measures towards the end of 2022 to weather the impact of significant cost inflation  and we are confident that in 2023 we will continue to grow product related revenues  again improve the gross margin on product sales and further reduce the operating cash burn.”KEY MESSAGES 2022 RESULTSTotal operating income of EUR 58m (2021: EUR 54.9)  of which EUR 57.5m revenue  an increase of 19% from EUR 48.3m in 2021of EUR 58m (2021: EUR 54.9)  of which EUR 57.5m revenue  an increase of 19% from EUR 48.3m in 2021 Product revenue of EUR 45m (2021: EUR 40.5m)  of which EUR 35.9m from 334k cartridges sold and EUR 9.2m from instrument rentals and sales: EUR 31.3m cartridge revenue in oncology  a 30% year-on-year increase  double-digit growth across all regions  led by the US  both in cartridge volumes and in average selling price (ASP) COVID-19 testing needs were fading  decreasing the revenue contribution from SARS-CoV-2 tests to EUR 3.5m Continued increase of ASP per commercial cartridge to EUR 106 (2021: EUR 96).

Several new customers among the top 10 cancer centers adopted Idylla™ in 2022. The ASP in oncology  traditionally higher in the US than in our other markets  benefitted from a favorable product mix and a smaller proportion of free-of-charge cartridge volumes for market seeding and the initial validation of assays Strong performance of the distributor markets 5 supported by the commercial agreement with AstraZeneca aimed at increasing access to Idylla™ EGFR testing products for patients with non-small cell lung cancerTotal revenue from Idylla™ instruments increased by 3% to EUR 9.2m in 2022  including instruments sold to content partners 6 : Revenue generated from instrument placements at end customers increased by 36% year-on-year  against a 9% increase of the installed base of Idylla™ instruments  which is evenly split between sold and rented instruments Certain clinical trials that were planned to start in 2022 and requiring the sale of a significant number of Idylla™ instruments were delayed by our content partners in light of the uncertain economic environment Instrument revenue in the US more than doubled  even though several new customers deferred the investment decision and adopted Idylla™ through Biocartis’ free-of-charge evaluation program under which they can temporarily use the instrument while only paying for the cartridge consumption. Subject to the favorable outcome of the evaluation  revenues from the ultimate sale or rental of such instruments are therefore delayed by 6 months on average 173 net new instruments placed. Several instruments were reclaimed following a focused review of non-performing reagent rental agreements to eliminate non-profitable investments in capital expenditure:Idylla™ test menu  partnerships & publicationsTest menu: Launch of the fully automated  CE-marked IVD Idylla™ GeneFusion Panel on 20 June 2022 Launch of new SeptiCyte RAPID ® (CE-IVD) EDTA 7 blood compatible cartridges 8 by Biocartis’ partner Immunexpress on 23 August 2022 Start of the commercialization on 1 September 2022 in Europe of SkylineDx’s innovative Merlin Assay as a CE-IVD marked manual kit  ahead of the launch of an Idylla™ version of the AssayProduct registrations: Japan – On 29 August 2022  Nichirei Biosciences  Biocartis’ distribution partner in Japan  received approval by the Japanese regulatory authorities (Ministry of Health  Labor and Welfare) for the commercialization of the Idylla™ MSI Test in Japan. Nichirei Biosciences plans the commercial launch of the Idylla™ MSI Test as a CDx in Japan in Q1 2023 China – Regulatory approval of the Idylla™ instrument on 16 September 2022 by the Chinese regulatory authorities NMPA  an important step towards the further regulatory and commercialization of Idylla™ assays in ChinaPartnerships: Announcement of a new partnership on 8 February 2022 between Biocartis and Ophiomics  a Lisbon (Portugal) based biotech company with an initial focus on the commercialization of HepatoPredict 9 . The commercialization in Europe of the test as a CE-marked IVD kit started on 10 October 2022 Announcement of an extension of the collaboration with AstraZeneca on 22 June 2022 highlighting the development and planned premarket submission to the US FDA of a novel CDx test on the Idylla™ platform for AstraZeneca’s third-generation EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) treatmentPublications - During 2022  42 new papers with excellent data were published on several new Idylla™ studies  including: A study (announced 4 May 2022) by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (NY  US)  in the Journal of Molecular Diagnostics on the Idylla™ GeneFusion Assay (RUO 10 )  highlighting the quicker turnaround and the lower tissue requirements compared to immunohistochemistry and molecular methods  while also circumventing the infrastructure dependencies associated with NGS and fluorescence in situ hybridization. A large prospective study (announced 8 November 2022) demonstrating that the Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test (CE-IVD) leads to the significant reduction of the time-to-treatment by on average 16.8 days or 48% compared to NGS testing for EGFR positive patientsOrganizational and operational highlightsCommercial milestones – Double milestone announced on 15 June 2022 with the selling of the 1 000 000th commercial Idylla™ cartridge and the placement of the 2 000th Idylla™ instrument since commercial launchShareholders’ Meetings – All agenda items were approved during the ordinary shareholders’ meeting held 13 May 2022 and the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting held 14 November 2022 which approved the various components of the Company’s comprehensive recapitalizationCartridge manufacturing – Except for the Septicyte RAPID ® test  the transfer of all assays to the second cartridge manufacturing line (‘ML2’) was completed during 2022  further unlocking economies of scale and reducing manufacturing coststest  the transfer of all assays to the second cartridge manufacturing line (‘ML2’) was completed during 2022  further unlocking economies of scale and reducing manufacturing costs ISO 27001 certification – ISO 27001 certification of Biocartis announced on 24 August 2022 for the design  development  maintenance  service provision and support of the Idylla™ platform and associated customer-facing softwareManagement team – Biocartis aligned its organizational structure to deliver on its strategic priorities and has appointed  effective as from 1 September 2022: Global Head of Partnering: Madhushree (Madhu) Ghosh  PhD  MS  joined Biocartis as Global Head of Partnering. Dr. Ghosh brings a wealth of experience to successful commercial and strategic team leadership in global strategic alliance management  P/L business unit leadership and IVD and CDx product development for more than 20 years spent in molecular diagnostics and clinical assay development with a focus on Next Generation Sequencing  real-time PCR  multiplex PCR  oncology and infectious disease diagnostics. Previously  Dr. Ghosh held senior roles at Thermo Fisher Scientific  NeoGenomics Laboratories Inc.  QIAGEN  and AltheaDx. Global Head of Sales: David Dejans  previously Head of Sales Europe and Distributor markets  moved into the role of Global Head of SalesIn Q4 2022  the organization was streamlined across all areas of the business to withstand the impact of the significant cost inflation. Compared to 31 December 2021  the workforce decreased by 16%Financial highlightsTotal operating income – Total operating income amounted to EUR 58m  compared to EUR 54.9m in 2021  and included EUR 45m from product sales (2021: EUR 40.5m; +11%)  EUR 11.1m from various collaborations with partners (2021: EUR 6.1m; +83%)  EUR 1.4m from instrument servicing (2021: EUR 1.7m; -20%) and EUR 0.5m other income (2021: EUR 6.6m; -93%) Revenues from cartridge sales grew 13% year-on-year to EUR 35.9m. Cartridge sales in the core oncology business increased by 30%  while sales of the SARS-CoV-2 cartridges decreased by 49% and only represented 7.7% of total product revenues. 334k cartridges were sold in 2022 (2021: 326k) at an ASP of EUR 106 (2021: EUR 96). The strong 30% growth of oncology cartridge revenue resulted from growing cartridge volumes (+14% year-on-year) and an increased ASP of EUR 116  compared to EUR 105 in 2021. The ASP in oncology continues to develop favorably as the contribution from high value-adding assays such as the Idylla TM Genefusion Assay (RUO) continues to increase. A continued focus on pricing discipline and a gradually increasing contribution from sales in the US where prices are generally higher than in Europe and other parts of the world  also support the steady increase of the cartridge ASP. Conversely  the fading COVID-19 testing need resulted in 36% lower cartridge volumes in infectious diseases  while the ASP of EUR 63 also decreased 18% year-on-year Revenues from the sale and rental of the Idylla TM instrument amounted to EUR 9.2m  a 3% increase year-on-year. The installed base grew with 173 instruments to 2 085 instruments  net of conversions from instruments previously placed free-of-charge under short-term evaluation programs and returns of non-performing instruments under reagent rental agreements aimed at reducing non-profitable capital investments. As a direct result of the uncertain economic climate  the planned sale of a significant number of instruments was delayed following the decision by certain content partners to delay clinical trials that were planned to start in 2022 Income from collaborations amounted to EUR 11.1m compared to EUR 6.1m in 2021  and mainly included R&D services provided to our pharma and content partners  aimed at expanding the Idylla™ test menu and at developing companion diagnostic tests that will unlock additional market potential in the US and in other markets Other income of EUR 0.5m related to grants received in connection with the development of the new Idylla TM FLEX technology that is expected to facilitate the use of Idylla TM tests in therapy decisions and molecular surveillance. The first product that is based on this Idylla™ FLEX technology  the Idylla™ IDH1-2 Mutation Assay Kit (RUO)  was launched in 2023. In 2021  other income included an insurance claim of EUR 4.6m for damages caused by the fire in a warehouse in July 2021Cost of goods sold – Cost of goods sold decreased by 12% to EUR 29.8m  while cartridge volumes and the number of newly placed instruments remained comparable to 2021. Contrary to 2021  a year of disrupted reagent supply and the temporary unavailability of manufacturing capacity caused by the fire in one of Biocartis’ warehouses  most cartridges were produced on the high-throughput automated manufacturing line ML2 in 2022  unlocking significant economies of scale. The gross margin on product sales more than doubled from 16% in 2021 to 34% in 2022  as a direct result of lower manufacturing costs per cartridge and the lower contribution of low-priced SARS-CoV-2 tests. In the first quarter of 2023  more than 90% of the commercial cartridge production will have been transferred to ML2 and a plan to fully decommission ML1 will be implemented over the yearOPEX – Total operating expenses  excluding the cost of goods sold  decreased 10% year-on-year from EUR 83.6m to EUR 75.2m. Apart from the fire damages of EUR 3.2m incurred in 2021  operating expenses decreased by EUR 5.2m  despite the impact of global inflation. Investments in various R&D programs were cut back by EUR 9.7m. The increase of EUR 3.8m in sales & marketing reflected normalized commercial activities post the pandemic and the full year impact of the restructuring of the US commercial operations implemented at the end of 2021. General & administrative spending levels remained stable at EUR 16.2m  an increase of 4% year-on-year that merely reflected cost inflation. In Q4 of 2022  the organization was streamlined to offset the expected continued inflation of costs in 2023  including the mandatory indexation of salaries in Belgium of 11%  effective January 2023. Among others  the workforce was reduced by 16% across the entire organization since 31 December 2021Recapitalization – On 1 September 2022  Biocartis launched a comprehensive recapitalization  providing EUR 66m of gross proceeds and comprising: the amendment of the existing 4% convertible bonds of EUR 135m  including a.o. the mandatory conversion of 10% of these convertible bonds into common shares at the conversion rate of EUR 12.89 and the extension of the maturity date until 9 November 2027 a new first lien secured convertible term loan of EUR 30.1m  partly used for the buy-back of EUR 16.3m of existing 4% convertible bonds for EUR 13.7m in cash an exchange of the amended existing convertible bonds for new 4.5% second lien secured convertible bonds  subject to the subscription of EUR 25m of additional newly issued 4.5% convertible bonds  and a rights offering with extra-legal preferential rights for the existing shareholders of the Company of EUR 25.1mOn 31 December 2022  the recapitalization transactions were partly completed. Following the amendment  the buy-back and the exchange offer  EUR 14.8m of existing 4% convertible bonds remained outstanding and EUR 92.1m of the 4% convertible bonds had been exchanged for the new 4.5% convertible bonds.

Through the acquisitions of CellPoint and AboundBio  we gained access to a breakthrough  point-of-care CAR-T manufacturing platform  a clinical-stage CAR-T oncology pipeline and a research engine for novel  differentiated CAR-T constructs  that together have the potential to deliver life-saving medicines to more patients  faster and more efficiently.In addition  we remain fully committed to immunology  an area where there is still significant unmet patient need and for which we have built deep scientific know-how and expertise since our founding. With our programs targeting multiple modes-of-action and drug modalities  most recently including CAR-T  we have a differentiated portfolio of preclinical through to commercial assets.”Bart Filius  President  COO and CFO of Galapagos  added: “We are very proud that our first marketed medicine  Jyseleca®  an orally administered JAK1 preferential inhibitor  continued to deliver solid in-market performance with a growing European base and €87.6 million in net sales for the year 2022  reaching 18 000 patients with RA and UC across Europe. Based on the topline results from the Phase 3 DIVERSITY study of filgotinib in Crohn’s disease  Galapagos decided not to submit a Marketing Authorization Application in Europe in this indication. On the other hand  following the positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use on the Type II variation application based on the safety data on semen parameters from the MANTA and MANTA-RAy studies  the European label for RA and UC has been updated  potentially broadening access for European patients who may benefit from this treatment. For 2023  we anticipate net Jyseleca® sales in a range between €140 and €160 million. For the longer term  we believe Jyseleca® can reach €400 million peak sales in RA  UC and axial spondyloarthritis.Financially  we ended 2022 with a strong balance sheet of €4.1 billion in cash and current financial investments  which provides us with the necessary means to look for additional external innovation to accelerate our R&D portfolio while progressing our internal programs. As part of our company transformation  we have meaningfully reduced our cost base. We anticipate our full year 2023 operating cash burn to decline to a range of €380 to €420 million.”2022 operational review and post-period eventsJyseleca® commercial & regulatory progressAdoption across Europe with reimbursement for RA in 15 countries and for UC in 11 countriesSobi  our distribution and commercialization partner in Eastern and Central Europe  Portugal  Greece  and the Baltic countries  launched Jyseleca ® in RA in the Czech Republic and Portugal  resulting in €2.0 million milestone payments to Galapagosin RA in the Czech Republic and Portugal  resulting in €2.0 million milestone payments to Galapagos The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in Great Britain and the Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan approved filgotinib 200mg for the treatment of moderate to severe UCThe European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  adopted the recommendation of the PRAC to add measures to minimize risk of serious side effects with JAK inhibitors used for chronic inflammatory disordersPositive opinion issued by the CHMP for Jyseleca’s® European label update based on testicular function safety data from MANTA/RAy semen parameter studiesPipeline updateStarted preparations to initiate a Phase 2 program with TYK2 inhibitor GLPG3667 in dermatomyositis (DM) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)Discontinued our activities in fibrosis and kidney disease as a result of our new strategic therapy area focusPhase 2 study with GLPG2737 in polycystic kidney disease is ongoing with topline results expected in the first half of 2023.

The revenue recognition linked to the upfront consideration and milestone payments in the scope of the collaboration with Gilead for filgotinib  amounted to €174.4 million in 2022 (compared to €235.7 million in 2021). This decrease was due to a lower increase in the percentage of completion  slightly offset by higher revenue recognition of milestone payments  strongly influenced by the milestone achieved in 2022 related to the regulatory approval in Japan for UC.On 8 February 2023 we announced topline results from the Phase 3 DIVERSITY trial of filgotinib in Crohn’s disease and  based on these topline data  decided not to submit a Marketing Authorization Application in Europe. While this recent event will not have an impact on our financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022  we will provide further information in our 2022 annual report on the potential revenue recognition impact on our financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.The revenue recognition related to the exclusive access rights granted to Gilead for our drug discovery platform amounted to €230.4 million in 2022 (compared to €230.6 million in 2021). We also recognized royalty income from Gilead for Jyseleca® for €10.7 million in 2022 (compared to €3.8 million in 2021). Additionally  we recorded in 2022 milestone payments of €2.0 million triggered by the inital sales of Jyseleca® in Czech Republic and Portugal by our distribution and commercialization partner Sobi.Our deferred income balance at 31 December 2022 includes €1.5 billion allocated to our drug discovery platform that is recognized linearly over the remaining period of our 10-year collaboration  and €0.5 billion allocated to the development of filgotinib which is recognized over time until the end of filgotinib’s development period.Our R&D expenditure in 2022 amounted to €515.1 million  compared to €491.7 million in 2021. Depreciation and impairment costs in 2022 amounted to €54.5 million (compared to €17.5 million in 2021). This increase was primarily due to an impairment of €26.7 million of previously capitalized upfront fees related to our collaboration with Molecure on the dual chitinase inhibitor OATD-01 (GLPG4716) and impairments of intangible assets related to other discontinued projects recorded in 2022. Personnel costs increased from €165.2 million in 2021 to €190.1 million in 2022 primarily related to increases in restructuring costs and accelerated non-cash cost recognition for subscription right plans related to good leavers. This was partly offset by a decrease in subcontracting costs from €251.1 million in 2021 to €214.9 million in 2022 following the evolution of our programs.Our G&A and S&M expenses amounted to €292.5 million in 2022  compared to €210.9 million in 2021. This increase was primarily due to the termination of our 50/50 filgotinib co-commercialization cost sharing agreement with Gilead for filgotinib in 2022 which explains €59.7 million of the variance. The cost increase was also explained by an increase in personnel costs of €26.6 million in 2022 compared to 2021  which are related to an increase in our commercial work force driven by the commercial launch of filgotinib in Europe  accelerated non-cash cost recognition for subscription right plans related to good leavers and restructuring costs.Other operating income (€46.8 million in 2022 compared to €53.7 million in 2021) decreased  mainly driven by lower grant and R&D incentives income.We reported an operating loss amounting to €267.5 million in 2022  compared to an operating loss of €165.6 million in 2021.Net financial income in 2022 amounted to €52.4 million  compared to €42.6 million in 2021. Net financial income in 2022 was primarily attributable to €41.3 million of unrealized currency exchange gains on our cash and cash equivalents and current financial investments at amortized cost in U.S. dollars  and to €6.9 million of positive changes in the (fair) value of our current financial investments. The other financial expenses also had the effect of discounting our non-current deferred income of €7.7 million. Net interest income amounted to €11.1 million in 2022 compared to €8.8 million of net interest expense in 2021.We reported a group net loss in 2022 of €218.0 million  compared to a group net loss of €103.2 million in 2021.Cash positionCurrent financial investments and cash and cash equivalents totaled €4 094.1 million on 31 December 2022  as compared to €4 703.2 million on 31 December 2021.Total net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and current financial investments amounted to €609.1 million in 2022  compared to a net decrease of €466.1 million in 2021. This net decrease was composed of (i) €513.8 million of operational cash burn  offset by (ii) €6.9 million positive changes in (fair) value of current financial investments and €44.5 million of mainly positive exchange rate differences  (iii) €6.7 million of cash proceeds from capital and share premium increase from exercise of subscription rights in 2022  and (iv) €153.4 million cash out from the acquisitions of CellPoint and AboundBio  net of cash acquired.Acquisition of CellPoint and AboundBioWe have completed the initial accounting of the acquisitions of Cellpoint and AboundBio  including the purchase price allocations. Disclosures on the business combinations will be included in our full year 2022 annual report.Outlook 2023Immunology franchiseThis year  we expect additional reimbursement decisions for Jyseleca® in UC in Europe  and we anticipate that Sobi will further progress with reimbursement discussions in RA and UC in Eastern and Central Europe  Greece  and the Baltic countries. We also expect the final decision from the European Commission following CHMP’s adoption of the recommendation of the PRAC to harmonize the EU labels of all approved JAK inhibitors. We plan to start a Phase 3 study in axial spondyloarthritis  and anticipate announcing the initial results from the FILOSOPHY Real-World Evidence Phase 4 study in RA.We aim to recruit the first patients in the Phase 2 programs with our TYK2 inhibitor product candidate  GLPG3667  in DM in the first quarter of 2023  followed by the start of a study in SLE later this year.To accelerate time-to-patients  we are diversifying our drug modality capabilities in immunology and recently announced that we aim to start clinical development with the CD19 CAR-T candidate  GLPG5101  in refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (rSLE).Oncology portfolioPatient recruitment in the European sites of the ATALANTA-1 Phase 1/2 study with CD19 CAR-T candidate  GLPG5101  in rrNHL as well as in the EUPLAGIA-1 study with CD19 CAR-T candidate GLPG5201 in rrCLL/SLL is progressing. We aim to provide Phase 1 topline results from both studies around mid-2023 and aim to include US patients in 2023.We aim to expand the CAR-T portfolio with a BCMA CAR-T product candidate  GLPG5301  in refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma (rrMM) and aim to start enrolling patients in the PAPILIO-1 Phase 1/2 study in Europe in the second quarter of 2023.Financial guidanceFor the full year 2023  we anticipate further reduction of our cash burn and anticipate landing between €380 and €420 million (compared to €514 million for the full year 2022)  including the acceleration in oncology. We also anticipate between €140 and €160 million net sales of Jyseleca® for the full year 2023.Taking into account multiple factors  we have revised our estimates of the peak sales potential for Jyseleca® in RA  UC and axial spondyloarthritis and expect this to reach €400 million by the end of the decade.Annual report 2022We are currently finalizing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.

In the fourth quarter  organic growth achieved a strong 9.3%.This is reflected as follows by business:More than half of the portfolio (Marine & Offshore  Buildings & Infrastructure and Agri-Food & Commodities) achieved high single digit revenue growth  up 8.5% organically on average. Marine & Offshore (up 9.4% organically) was amongst the best performing activities  led by both in-service and new build activity and essentially fueled by decarbonization trends. Agri-Food & Commodities (up 9.3% organically) outperformed the Group average and was supported by very favorable market conditions in Metals & Minerals  improving Oil & Petrochemical markets and strong growth for Government services. Buildings & Infrastructure growth (+7.6% organic) benefited from strong momentum across its Americas platforms but was impacted by lockdowns in China;A fifth of the portfolio (Industry) delivered double digit organic revenue growth  up 11.4% during the year with strong business activity for the energy segment and in particular Renewables and Oil & Gas;Another fifth of the portfolio (Consumer Products and Certification) grew low to mid-single digit organically  up 2.6% on average. Certification (up 5.5%) benefited from the rising demand for Sustainability and ESG-driven services  despite challenging comparables. Conversely  Consumer Products Services’ growth was subdued by the multiple disruptions in China and weaker consumer spending overall which impacted the business.Hinda Gharbi joined Bureau Veritas in May 2022On February 24  2022  the Board of Directors of Bureau Veritas announced the renewal of the term of office of the Chief Executive Officer  Didier Michaud-Daniel  until the Annual General Meeting in June 2023  which will be called to approve the financial statements for the year 2022.As of May 1  2022  Hinda Gharbi joined Bureau Veritas as Chief Operating Officer and became a member of the Group’s Executive Committee.

The Board of Directors will appoint her as Chief Executive Officer at the end of the 2023 Annual General Meeting which will be held on June 22  2023.With a degree in Electrical Engineering from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Ingénieurs Electriciens de Grenoble  and a Master of Science in signal processing from the Institut Polytechnique de Grenoble  in 1996  Hinda joined Schlumberger  a global technology leader in the energy sector.During her 26 years with the Group  Hinda held a variety of general management positions in operations for Schlumberger's core business activities at a global and regional level.

It is built upon three strategic axes: “Shaping a Better Workplace”  “Shaping a Better Environment” and “Shaping Better Business Practices”; and three Sustainability pillars: “Social & Human capital”  “Natural capital” and “Governance”.The Group tracks and reports its CSR performance annually through 19 selected key performance indicators. In 2022  Bureau Veritas made good progress towards the 2025 CSR ambitions  as reflected by the following figures:Corporate Social Responsibility key indicators and performanceUNSDGs FY2022 FY2021 FY 2020 FY2019 2025TARGET SOCIAL & HUMAN CAPITAL Total Accident Rate (TAR)5 #3 0.26 0.27 0.26 0.38 0.26 Proportion of women in leadership positions6 #5 29.1% 26.5% 27.5% 24.4% 35% Number of training hours per employee (per year) #8 32.5 29.9 23.9 19.0 35.0 NATURAL CAPITAL CO 2 emissions per employee (tons per year)7 #13 2.31 2.49 2.44 2.85 2.00 GOVERNANCE Proportion of employees trained to the Code of Ethics8 #16 97.1% 95.8% 98.5% 97.1% 99%DISCIPLINED AND SELECTIVE BOLT-ON M&A IN 2022During the year 2022  Bureau Veritas continued to pursue its bolt-on M&A  completing four transactions in strategic areas  representing c.EUR 74 million in annualized revenue (or 1.3% of 2022 Group revenue). This is added to the acquisition of PreScience completed on December 29  2021 (c.

Founded in 1989  it has earned a reputation for providing reliable services  from complex code compliance to implementing cutting-edge technology for electronic plan reviews. This helps Florida’s local governments operate more efficiently and keep the public safe. This acquisition of a majority stake in C.A.P is another milestone in the execution of Bureau Veritas’ strategic roadmap; it complements the acquisition of PreScience made in December 2021  a US-based leader of Project Management/Construction management services for Transportation Infrastructure projects.Consumer Product ServicesGalbraith Laboratories Inc.Headquartered in Knoxville  Tennessee  Galbraith Laboratories Inc. is a US expert in healthcare analytical testing solutions. It provides services to a wide range of industry segments and will strengthen further Bureau Veritas’ position in the Consumer Healthcare  Personal Care and Industrial Chemical supply chains.Advanced Testing Laboratory (ATL)Headquartered in Cincinnati  Ohio  Advanced Testing Laboratory (ATL) is a US leader in scientific sourcing services for the North American Consumer Healthcare Products  Cosmetics & Personal Care and Medical Device markets. With this acquisition  Bureau Veritas increases the diversification of the Consumer Products Services division by expanding its footprint in North America and enters the fast-growing Consumer Healthcare market.AMSfashionBased in Spain  AMSfashion is an expert in Sustainability  quality and conformity services for the fashion industry. This acquisition strengthens Bureau Veritas’ presence in Iberia  a key hub for the expansion of its Consumer Products Services business  supporting the continuing growth in near shoring from South Europe and Africa.The pipeline of opportunities is healthy  and the Group will continue to deploy its very selective bolt-on acquisitions strategy in targeted areas (notably Buildings & Infrastructure  Consumer Products Services  Sustainability Assurance  Renewable Energy and Cybersecurity) and geographies (North America notably).IMPACT OF THE CHINESE LOCKDOWNS IN THE YEAR 2022Following the Chinese government’s “zero Covid policy”  the Group faced selective lockdowns in several cities across the country since the end of March 2022.Given its exposure to China (16% of total revenue in FY 2022)  the lockdown measures had a material impact on performance since the second quarter of 2022. The impact varied however by business:In Consumer Products Services  which makes up around half of the Group’s Chinese revenue  Bureau Veritas showed resilience and ability to adapt during the lockdowns. In the second quarter  the impact was thereby contained as the teams were able to divert samples from one location to another across the country or outside of China to the Group’s South Asia testing capabilities (Vietnam  Bangladesh  India and Sri Lanka). In the fourth quarter  the business was impacted by localized lockdowns and increased level of absenteeism due to the spread of the pandemic;In Buildings & Infrastructure (representing around a quarter of China’s revenue  and solely focused on infrastructure assets in the transportation field and energy)  the business was impacted by site closures. Consequently  organic revenue declined by 9.2% in 2022. This was notably the case in the second quarter due to mobility restrictions imposed in many areas (Shanghai and Shenzhen notably). Once the mobility restrictions had been removed  the Group operated under “stop & go” rules with sites required to shut down as soon as the slightest suspicion of Covid-19 arose. Since Q3  the construction sites have gradually recovered  but remained disrupted by positive cases and the resulting absenteeism;In Certification  remote audits enabled to deliver services and 7.2% organic revenue growth was achieved in 2022  primarily led by ESG related services;In Marine & Offshore  the business remained well oriented (+8.1% organic growth in FY22) and faced very limited disruption.Excluding the impact from the Chinese lockdowns  the full-year 2022 Group margin would have been up c.10 basis points to 16.2% compared to the level of 2021.LIMITED IMPACT AND EXPOSURE TO THE RUSSIA / UKRAINE WARThe Group generated c.1% of its consolidated revenue in 2022 with Russia and Ukraine together  mainly related to commodities markets.In Ukraine (0.2% of Group revenue)  the Group has put its people’s safety at the heart of crisis management. Since the beginning of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine  Bureau Veritas regularly assess and monitor its position in Russia according to international sanctions. In application of the latter  the Group has reduced its activities.A GOOD PRICE DISCIPLINEThe Group has overall good traction on pricing with variations across sectors and geographies. Price realization is more favorable in the mass market and in highly regulated activities  but more complex with a delayed impact for multi-year and large contracts. At the end of 2022 Group price increases had a 1.5- 2.0% positive impact on revenue. For 2023  the pricing benefit is expected to be higher.Throughout the year  Bureau Veritas  as a service company  has been mainly impacted by wage inflation. It has adapted its pricing strategy consequently and maintained its cost management discipline.STRONG FINANCIAL POSITIONAt the end of December 2022  the Group's adjusted net financial debt decreased compared with the level at December 31  2021. Bureau Veritas has a solid financial structure with the bulk of its maturities beyond 2024 and 100% at fixed interest rates. The Group had EUR 1.7 billion in available cash and cash equivalents and EUR 600 million in undrawn committed credit lines.At December 31  2022  the adjusted net financial debt/EBITDA ratio9 was further reduced to 0.97x (from 1.10x as of December 31  2021) and the EBITDA/consolidated net financial expense ratio was 18.25x. As of December 31  2022  the ratio of adjusted net financial debt to EBITDA had to be less than 3.5x and  only for the US Private Placement  the ratio of EBITDA to consolidated net financial expense had to be greater than 5.5x.On September 30  2022  Bureau Veritas successfully raised EUR 200 million on the US Private Placement market through a bilateral 10-year issuance at 3.6%. Bureau Veritas is a repeat issuer on this market since 2008. With this issuance  the Group seized attractive market conditions to partially refinance in advance its 2023 Bond. It also lengthened the average maturity of the Group’s financial debt to 3.9 years with a blended average cost of funds over the year of 2.1% excluding the impact of IFRS 16 (compared with 2.3% in 2021 excluding the impact of IFRS 16).PROPOSED DIVIDENDThe Board of Directors of Bureau Veritas is proposing a dividend of EUR 0.77 per share for 2022  up 45.3% compared to the prior year. This corresponds to an increase of the payout ratio to around 65% of its adjusted net profit (from 50% previously)  a level which the Group expects to maintain moving forward. Bureau Veritas has significant financial flexibility to make acquisitions to capture long-term growth opportunities.This is subject to the approval of the Shareholders’ Meeting to be held on June 22  2023 at 3:00pm at Bureau Veritas Headquarters  Immeuble Newtime  40-52 Boulevard du Parc  92200  Neuilly-sur-Seine  France. The dividend will be paid in cash on July 6  2023 (shareholders on the register on July 5  2023 will be entitled to the dividend and the share will go ex-dividend on July 4  2023).2023 OUTLOOKBased on a healthy sales pipeline and the significant growth opportunities related to Sustainability  and taking into account the current macro uncertainties  Bureau Veritas expects for the full year 2023 to deliver:Mid-single-digit organic revenue growth;A stable adjusted operating margin;A strong cash flow  with a cash conversion10 above 90%.BUREAU VERITAS’ CSR EVOLUTION IN 2022Bureau Veritas helps companies  governments and public authorities reduce their risks in terms of health  quality  safety  environmental protection and social responsibility. Those challenges are central to societal aspirations. Being a Business to Business to Society company comes with a duty: to be exemplary in terms of sustainability internally  and to be a role model for industry in terms of positive impact on people and the planet.Bureau Veritas’ CSR commitment recognized by non-financial ratingsThe Group’s commitment is to act responsibly in order to Shape a Better World.

These include:EUR 65.7 million in amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions (EUR 64.1 million in 2021);EUR 10.2 million in write-offs of non-current assets related to laboratory consolidations (EUR 4.9 million in 2021);EUR 31.2 million in restructuring costs (EUR 6.9 million in 2021);EUR 4.3 million in net gains on disposals and acquisitions (net losses of EUR 7.1 million in 2021).Operating profit totaled EUR 799.3 million  up 11.2% from EUR 718.8 million in 2021.Adjusted EPS reached EUR 1.18  up 10.7% year on yearNet finance costs decreased to EUR 72.4 million (vs. EUR 74.7 million in 2021)  reflecting mainly the increase in the income from cash and cash equivalents as a result of the interest rates hikes in 2022.The foreign exchange impact is a positive EUR 4.6 million (vs. a positive EUR 6.6 million in 2021) due to the appreciation of the US dollar against the Euro and the appreciation of the US dollar and the Euro against most emerging market currencies.Other items (including interest cost on pension plans and other financial expenses) stood ata negative EUR 13.6 million  up from a negative EUR 5.2 million in 2021.As a result  net financial expenses increased to EUR 81.4 million in full-year 2022 compared with EUR 73.3 million in 2021.Income tax expense totaled EUR 233.4 million in 2022  compared with EUR 199.3 million in 2021.This represents an effective tax rate (ETR - income tax expense divided by profit before tax) of 32.5% for the period  compared with 30.9% in 2021. The adjusted ETR is up 150 basis points at 31.6%  compared with 2021. The increase is due to the rise in tax losses over the period without recognition of deferred tax assets and tax costs  such as withholding taxes  that are not directly calculated by reference to taxable income.Attributable net profit in 2022 was EUR 466.7 million  vs. a EUR 420.9 million profit in 2021.Earnings per share (EPS) stood at EUR 1.03 vs. EUR 0.93 in 2021.Adjusted attributable net profit totaled EUR 533.9 million  up 11.0% vs. EUR 480.8 million in 2021.Adjusted EPS stood at EUR 1.18  a 10.7% increase vs. EUR 1.07 in 2021.Strong free cash flow at EUR 657 million driven by operating performanceFull year 2022 operating cash flow increased by 5.6% to EUR 834.9 million vs. EUR 790.7 million in 2021. It benefited from the increase in profit before income tax  largely offset by higher income taxes  restructuring charges and higher capex. Despite the strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter  the working capital requirement outflow remained under control (at EUR 12.5 million  compared to a EUR 13.6. million outflow the previous year).Working capital requirement (WCR) stood at EUR 341.1 million at December 31  2022  compared to EUR 313.3 million at December 31  2021. As a percentage of revenue  WCR slightly decreased by 30 basis points to 6.0%  compared to 6.3% in 2021  which was a record low in a context of limited revenue growth. This showed the continued strong focus of the entire organization on cash metrics  with key initiatives implemented under the Move For Cash program (optimizing the “invoice to cash” process  accelerating billing and cash collection processes throughout the Group reinforced by a central task force  and daily monitoring cash inflows).Purchases of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  net of disposals (Net Capex)  amounted to EUR 125.4 million in 2022  an increase compared to EUR 114.5 million in 2021. This showed disciplined control over the Group’s net capex-to-revenue ratio of 2.2%  broadly stable compared to the level in 2021.Free cash flow (operating cash flow after tax  interest expenses and capex) wasEUR 657.0 million  compared to EUR 603.0 million in 2021  up 9.0% year on year  notably led by currency moves  a reversing trend versus 2021.

In the fourth quarter  organic revenue achieved an exceptional 15.8%  a reflection of a very high growth for the Core In-service activity. The full year organic growth performance results were fueled by:High single-digit growth in New Construction (39% of divisional revenue)  which benefited from the momentum of new order intake in the prior year  notably in Asia  and for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) fueled ships;(39% of divisional revenue)  which benefited from the momentum of new order intake in the prior year  notably in Asia  and for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) fueled ships; Low double-digit growth in the Core In-service activity (46% of divisional revenue)  a reflection of several positive factors: i) exceptional level of activity for occasional surveys due to postponement of periodical surveys  notably in the last quarter  following the Covid-19 lockdowns in China; ii) one-off regulatory benefit with water ballast management services (with a December 2022 deadline to carry out water ballast survey for some ships) iii) solid pricing management; iv) the fleet’s modest growth. The fleet classed by Bureau Veritas continued to grow in 2022 (up 0.7% on a yearly basis)  led by all sectors. At year end  it comprised 11 609 ships  representing 143.6 million of Gross Register Tonnage (GRT);activity (46% of divisional revenue)  a reflection of several positive factors: i) exceptional level of activity for occasional surveys due to postponement of periodical surveys  notably in the last quarter  following the Covid-19 lockdowns in China; ii) one-off regulatory benefit with water ballast management services (with a December 2022 deadline to carry out water ballast survey for some ships) iii) solid pricing management; iv) the fleet’s modest growth. The fleet classed by Bureau Veritas continued to grow in 2022 (up 0.7% on a yearly basis)  led by all sectors. At year end  it comprised 11 609 ships  representing 143.6 million of Gross Register Tonnage (GRT); Mid-single-digit growth for Services (15% of divisional revenue  including Offshore)  benefiting from the diversification of services and strong commercial development for non-classification services including consulting services related to energy efficiency. During 2022  the Group strengthened its business development teams and opened branches in Australia and Korea. Conversely  the demand for risk assessment services in the Offshore Oil & Gas market was mixed while the year confirmed a significant increase in investments by oil players in offshore wind projects  both land-based and floating.The shipping market maintained a very positive momentum in 2022 with a level in worldwide new orders (in GRT) slightly above the average over the past 25 years. It was driven by a massive investment in LNG carriers and container ships. At year end  more than 60% of orders for new ships were based on dual fuel systems  which benefited to Bureau Veritas given its leadership position in the field. As a result  the Group’s new orders totaled 9.0 million gross tons in 2022  up 12.5% from 8.0 million gross tons in the prior-year period. The order book  which remains very diversified  stood at 20.1 million gross tons at the end of the year  up 23.3% year on year and compared to 16.3 million gross tons in 2021.Adjusted operating margin for the year improved by 166 basis points to 24.1% compared to 2021. Organically  it rose by 130 basis points  led by operating leverage and a positive mix.Sustainability achievementsIn a constantly evolving technological and regulatory landscape  Bureau Veritas continued to address the challenges of Sustainability and the energy transition by providing rules and guidelines for the safety  risk and performance requirements for innovation in future fuels and propulsion systems. The Group helped its clients comply with environmental regulations  implement Sustainable solutions on board  and measure progress in decarbonization.Amongst services and solutions delivered in 2022  the Group continued to support the deployment of offshore wind farms by developing a protocol  leading to certification  to help derisk for Subsea Power cables. Bureau Veritas Marine & Offshore also published a white paper detailing alternative fuels for the shipping industry  taking into account technology maturity  availability  safety  emissions and regulations.The Group estimates that decarbonization of shipping will continue to drive many market opportunities in 2023.AGRI-FOOD & COMMODITIESIN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 1 224.8 1 065.2 +15.0% +9.3% (0.2)% +5.9% Adjusted operating profit 176.0 142.5 +23.5% Adjusted operating margin 14.4% 13.4% +98bps +103bps +1bps (6)bpsThe Agri-Food & Commodities business delivered organic revenue growth of 9.3% in 2022  with strong trends for all activities apart Agri-Food. Q4 recorded 10.2% organic growth.The Oil & Petrochemicals segment (O&P  31% of divisional revenue) showed a steady recovery in the year  which was confirmed in the last quarter. The O&P Trade market achieved a high-single-digit organic revenue growth and benefited from increased testing volumes due to higher fuel consumption  notably for aviation fuel/gasoline  and price increase initiatives. Growth was particularly strong in the US (market share gains)  Europe and in the Middle East (new services). Both locations benefited from the trade flow route changes triggered by the Russia/Ukraine war. Double digit organic revenue growth was maintained for non-trade related services and value-added segments  an area where the Group continued to further reposition its portfolio: Oil Condition Monitoring  fuel marking program  biofuels (made from animal oil or cooking oil for instance)  Sustainable Aviation Fuel or Liquefied Natural Gas.Metals & Minerals (M&M  33% of divisional revenue) achieved double-digit organic growth overall  across the entire value chain. Upstream (circa two-thirds of M&M) continued to record strong growth  across the Group’s key hubs (Latin America  Canada and Australia). In mining related testing  the growth outlook remained solid driven by demand for metals to support the energy transition. The slowdown in demand for geochemistry services was triggered by tightening financial conditions for junior ‘greenfields’ explorers (notably for gold) although the situation eased in the last quarter. The Group continued to successfully develop its on-site labs business with key wins in all the main mining geographies. This contributed to the growth and an increase in revenue predictability. Trade activities reported double-digit organic revenue growth led by Asia  Latin America and Middle East & Africa. It was fueled by the main metals and coal which remained in high demand as a substitute for natural gas. The mega trends for electrification in many economies also continued to support a high demand for copper and base metals.The Agri-Food segment (21% of divisional revenue) recorded a low single-digit organic revenue growth in the year  led by Agricultural products. The Agricultural inspection activities grew strongly  primarily led by Brazil  which notably benefited from a record level of export of soybean and corn crops. It was also led by Asia (strong activity level for sugar and rice notably) and by Middle East. In Europe  business improved in the second half of the year although it remained disrupted by the impact of the Russia/Ukraine war on Black Sea exports. Conversely  the Agri Upstream business  including fertilizer services  was impacted in the Black Sea region on the back of continuous tension since the outbreak of the war. The Food business slightly decreased organically  reflecting a contrasted geographic situation: strong performance in the Middle East  Africa and the US (new greenfield labs opening)  while weak in the Group’s key hubs  Canada (contract terminations partly offset by new location) and Australia (Covid-19 related disruption).Government services (15% of divisional revenue) delivered a strong double-digit organic growth in the year (including a 20.2% increase in the fourth quarter) across most geographies. Strong activity level on existing contracts (benefiting from the increased value of inspected goods) as well as the ramp-up of several new contracts fueled the growth. This included the strong development of Verification of Conformity in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)  Nigeria  Zimbabwe  Tanzania  and Single Window contracts in DRC. In the Middle East  the activity also improved with the ramp-up of a contract in Iraq.Adjusted operating margin for the year jumped by c. 100 basis points to 14.4% from 13.4% in 2021. This was due to strong operational leverage  fueled by the growth recovery  the benefit of better operational excellence and a positive mix.Sustainability achievementsThe Group is building transparency and promoting Sustainability from farm to fork with its global  end-to-end expertise covering inspection  audit & certification  and testing services. It is committed to supporting responsible use of natural resources and animal welfare  as well as ensuring the reliability of complex supply chains  enabling end consumers to make informed decisions.INDUSTRYIN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 1 181.0 1 013.5 +16.5% +11.4% (0.6) % +5.7% Adjusted operating profit 139.1 126.6 +9.9% Adjusted operating margin 11.8% 12.5% (71)bps (102)bps +16bps +15bpsIndustry was amongst the best performing businesses within the Group’s portfolio in the full year with organic growth of 11.4%  across the board. In Q4  Industry organic revenue increased by 13.2%.By geography  most regions delivered strong growth in the year  with Latin America leading the way alongside Asia  and North America. Growth was less pronounced in Europe  in Africa and in Middle East.By market  Power & Utilities (13% of divisional revenue) delivered steady growth in 2022  supported by both Opex and Capex services. The activity was solid in Latin America (Argentina and Colombia) with the continued ramp-up of contract wins with various Power Distribution clients (power grid maintenance and domestic meters readings)  although the Group has been more selective on contracts profitability. In Europe  growth was primarily fueled by France and the UK (with high activity levels in nuclear power plants)  and Spain (power generation). In the current context of energy crisis  nuclear power generation has regained traction and provides mid-term attractive growth Capex opportunities for the Group.Renewable Power Generation (solar  wind  hydrogen) saw accelerating trends given the energy crisis  with a double-digit organic performance in 2022. The growth opportunities continued to be focused on Capex projects  with numerous offshore and onshore Wind and Battery Energy Storage projects. In the US  Bradley Construction Management (solar energy construction projects)  has shown an improving sales pipeline with easing supply chain difficulties related to shortage of components and benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act bill (tax incentives) in H2. The Group’s low carbon power generation business (renewable energies and nuclear) now largely exceeds revenues from Oil & Gas capex projects.In Oil & Gas (33% of divisional revenue)  the activity remained well oriented and grew double digit organically throughout the year. Two-thirds of the business rely on Opex-related activities which delivered 22.4% growth as they benefited from the conversion of a solid sales pipeline as well as a catch-up effect of projects which were put on hold or delayed in 2021. This was triggered by the companies’ willingness to manage their assets in a more Sustainable manner (low carbon strategy towards net zero target). Large contracts ramped up in Asia (China led)  Middle East (outsourcing monitoring activities) and Latin America  in particular  Brazil (market share gains) and Argentina (volume and price led). In Canada  the site assessment and remediation activities contributed to the growth (favorable weather in most regions).Oil & Gas investment accelerated during the year  triggered by rising oil prices. The Group’s Capex-related activities  including Procurement Services (c. 2% of Group revenue) achieved high single-digit organic revenue growth  thanks to multiple medium-sized contracts wins with international energy companies. It was primarily led by Asia Pacific (China essentially) and Latin America. In the US  the drilling activity was supported by the increase in the number of rigs.Elsewhere  the aerospace business saw a revenue stream decline following the decision to exit the business in Russia  and the automotive business grew little  still impacted by supply chain disruption.Adjusted operating margin for the year was 11.8%  down 71 basis points from 12.5% in 2021. It is attributable to the termination of low margin Opex contracts and the exit of the aerospace unit in Russia.Sustainability achievementsBureau Veritas is an important player in the energy transition  present at key stages of the renewable and alternative energy production chain. In 2022  the Group was selected to undertake many projects. This includes the project certification of Bada Energy’s Gray Whale 3  a major floating offshore wind farm project in Ulsan  Republic of Korea (capacity of approx. 500 MW)  in which the Group  in partnership with the Korean Register  will provide project certification services (conformity assessment related to design  manufacturing  transportation  installation  and operation). In the last quarter  the Group was also awarded a contract with Woodfibre LNG LTD in Canada to provide the quality control support for the whole LNG project bringing single window solution for all of the clients’ quality needs overseeing the EPC and vendors.BUILDINGS & INFRASTRUCTUREIN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 1 664.0 1 458.4 +14.1% +7.6% +2.2% +4.3% Adjusted operating profit 228.7 208.7 +9.6% Adjusted operating margin 13.7% 14.3% (56)bps (65)bps (2)bps +11bpsThe Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) business achieved strong organic growth of 7.6% in the year  primarily fueled by the Americas and by the Middle East. In the fourth quarter  revenue rose 11.5% organically.Double-digit organic revenue growth was achieved in Construction-related activities (Capex; 55% of divisional revenue) and mid-single-digit growth in Buildings In-service activities (45% of divisional revenue).The Americas region (27% of divisional revenue) experienced very strong double-digit growth  primarily led by the US and Brazil. In the United States  a strong dynamic was maintained throughout the year (up 18.4% organically) across the Group’s diversified portfolio of activities: data center commissioning services (up 21.8%)  where the Group has a leading expertise and benefits from the verticalization of the business and its international deployment; project management assistance for Opex-related services  with large contracts ramp-up in the Retail market; technical control and station product conformity services for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations  still benefiting from successful wins with many operators in North America. The integration of the latest acquisitions  PreScience and C.A.P  focusing on transportation infrastructure  are progressing as planned and both benefit from a growing pipeline. In Latin America  the Group delivered a very strong growth with Brazil leading the way thanks to the ramp-up of large capex contracts for industrial and steel facilities alongside infrastructure projects. Argentina also contributed to the growth  benefiting notably from a large project for the domestic water grid pipelines installation.In Asia Pacific (20% of divisional revenue)  the business activity suffered from the Covid-19-related disruption in China. The Group’s Chinese operations declined 9.2% organically in the year  with the impact of the lockdown measures in the second quarter and the “stop and go” policy in the second half with sites required to shut down as soon as the slightest suspicion of Covid-19 arose. This included a 11.7% decrease in Q4 due to positive cases and the resulting high level of absenteeism. While the short-term visibility is limited  the Group remains confident for the medium term and still expects to benefit from the Chinese government’s support to the domestic economy through long-term infrastructure spending. Elsewhere  the activity grew strongly in Japan (led by code compliance services) and in India (up 26.1% organically).In Europe (50% of divisional revenue)  growth was moderate overall. A strong performance was delivered in Italy (ramp-up of large contract wins on the motorway network)  the Netherlands (Opex led) and Spain (regulatory driven). France  the region’s largest contributor  grew 2.7% organically. Momentum remained solid in the In-service activity (around three quarters of the French operations)  mostly regulatory driven and reflected the delivery of a healthy backlog. A double-digit organic revenue growth for Bureau Veritas Solutions (technical assistance; consulting services) was triggered by the increase in headcount and a sustained momentum in energy efficiency program services (including the white certificates for eligible projects). The Group’s Capex-related work slightly rebounded  in an improving new build market and benefiting from a higher weighting towards infrastructure and public works. The pipeline of sales related to the numerous investment programs in the European Union (including the Green Deal and the upcoming 2024 Olympic Games in France) continued to grow and add to the revenue visibility.Lastly  in the Middle East & Africa region (3% of divisional revenue)  the Group achieved very strong growth as it continued to benefit from the development of numerous projects as oil prices rebounded (Saudi Arabia).Adjusted operating margin for the year declined by 56 basis points to 13.7% from 14.3% in 2021. This was attributed to the impact from the Chinese lockdown measures during the year and portfolio mix effect.Sustainability achievementsDuring the year  the Group has been the partner of a major transport infrastructure project in France (with SGP for the Paris Metro Line 18 project Phase 2) with environmental control  execution of sampling & analysis campaign (several pollutants) for the Project Manager to control the conformity of works to its environmental policy. In the last quarter  the Group was awarded several EVCS contracts with pilot sites across the US and Canada in the automotive sector for dealership program  site surveys and engineering.CERTIFICATIONIN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 428.3 398.2 +7.6% +5.5% +0.1% +2.0% Adjusted operating profit 81.4 75.5 +7.9% Adjusted operating margin 19.0% 19.0% +6bps (2)bps (3)bps +11bpsThe Certification business delivered an organic revenue growth of 5.5% in the year including 7.0% in the last quarter. The growth was supported by both volume and robust price increases across most geographies and schemes. Strong activity levels were notably achieved in Sustainability-driven solutions.All geographies grew organically. Latin America  Africa  the Middle East and Asia Pacific performed above the divisional average  led by a solid commercial development and strong traction for Sustainability-driven services. The Group capitalized on its diversification strategy with the strongest growth recorded in countries where the business mix has been significantly diversified in recent years (shift from traditional QHSE schemes towards new services). This was illustrated by Brazil (second party audits)  Australia  Vietnam  India (ESG driven)  Thailand and the UK (Sustainability driven)  which all saw double-digit organic growth in the year. North America and Europe (Germany notably)  more geared to QHSE and Transportation schemes  performed below the average  notably impacted by challenging comparables following several recertification schemes in 2021.During the year  the Certification business continued to be led by the increased client demand for more brand protection  traceability  and social responsibility commitments all along the supply chain. Within the Group’s portfolio  double-digit growth was recorded in Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability  Enterprise Risks (led by Cybersecurity) and Training & Personnel services; and high single-digit growth was achieved in Food certification (fueled by Organic Food Products and Food Safety) across most geographies. In Q4  the Group won the inspection food safety contract for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.Bureau Veritas’ Sustainability-related services for Certification delivered strong growth throughout the year  up 18% organically  a reflection of a strong demand for verification of carbon emissions  supply chain audits on ESG topics  Assurance of Sustainability Reporting and Wood Management Systems Certification. While the market is mainly driven by voluntary checks from companies  the regulation will soon play a more important role in the future (European directive  German Supply Chain Act  etc.). In Latin America  very strong growth was delivered as the Group benefited from the build-up of dedicated local sales teams and the development of local schemes (BV ESG 360 in Brazil  Casa Colombia in Colombia) and the leverage of international ones (Energy and Forest management system certification).The benefits for portfolio diversification continued to drive growth. A particularly strong momentum was achieved in high value  mission-critical solutions dedicated to Anti-bribery  Asset Management  IT Service Management Information Security  and Business Continuity  in all geographies. In 2022  the Cybersecurity offering achieved a 30% organic revenue growth  primarily led by Europe and by increasing demand for transparency and control of IT and security systems.Adjusted operating margin for the year was maintained at a healthy 19.0%  up 6 basis points compared to the prior year. This reflects operational leverage  tight cost control and the benefit of some remote audits (in China essentially).Sustainability achievementsThrough Clarity  the first solution to help companies manage their ESG strategy  measure its performance and track its implementation  Bureau Veritas enables companies to bring transparency and credibility to their ESG commitments and put their Sustainability strategy in motion.In the last quarter of 2022  Bureau Veritas was awarded a pre-audit contract by Teleperformance in seven countries (including Colombia)  after the opening of an investigation into the company’s moderation activities. Bureau Veritas acted as a third-party to deliver an independent assurance about the use and inclusion of International Standard ISO 26000 – Guidance on Social Responsibility. The Group has also been renewed by Nestlé to provide independent assurance of Sustainability reporting. In Austria  the Group was selected by the market leader in the refractory industry to conduct on-site supplier ESG audits.CONSUMER PRODUCTSIN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 734.2 670.6 +9.5% +1.0% +3.2% +5.3% Adjusted operating profit 176.2 164.4 +7.2% Adjusted operating margin 24.0% 24.5% (52)bps +3bps (49)bps (6)bpsAfter being the best performing division within the Group’s portfolio in 2021  Consumer Products faced significant challenges in 2022 due to the mobility restrictions in China (57% of divisional revenue) in Q2 and Q3. As a result  organic growth was 1.0% being impacted by regional mobility restrictions in China and the surge in Covid-19 cases in Q4  as well as by the economic downturn leading to less product launches and high inventory from clients. In the last quarter  organic revenue decreased by 4.4%.By geography  the Middle East was the best performer  while Americas and Europe delivered mid-single digit growth performances over the year. Posting double digit and mid-single digit growths  Southern and Southeastern Asia benefited from the diversification strategy leveraging sourcing shift implemented by the Group  notably in Vietnam  Bangladesh  India and Sri Lanka.Softlines (34% of divisional revenue) performed better than the divisional average in the year  demonstrating the agility of the business model induced by the diversification strategy. China suffered from strong Covid-19-related disruptions caused by the lockdown measures as well as by the surge of new cases at the end of the year. But growth was primarily fueled by the Southern and Southeastern Asian countries which continued to benefit from a structural sourcing shift out of China and by the more conjunctural diversion of samples from the regions of China impacted by mobility restrictions during some parts of the year. Western Europe outperformed whilst benefiting from the near shoring sourcing trends from retailers as well as from solid dynamics from luxury brands  notably in Germany and Italy.Hardlines (10% of divisional revenue) and Cosmetics  Health & Beauty (4% of divisional revenue) underperformed the divisional average  with mid-single digit decline over the year  as a result of the global slowdown in consumer demand impacting mostly the Chinese activities. Toys (7% of divisional revenue) displayed an almost stable performance over the year.Inspection and Audit services (12% of divisional revenue) performed well with high-single digit organic growth led mainly by strong momentum on CSR audits revolving around Sustainability solutions such as green textile  across all countries.Lastly  Technology11 (33% of divisional revenue) performed roughly in line with the divisional average  with a double-digit organic growth in Automotive  on the back of a good traction on new mobility (testing on electric vehicle engines  dashboards or charging stations) especially in China  Western Europe and North America. Wireless Testing (wireless technologies/Internet of Things (IoT) products) underperformed the divisional average due to project delays and Covid-19-related disruptions mainly impacting some of the Asian countries.The integration of the three companies acquired this year (ATL  AMSfashion and Galbraith Laboratories) as part of the diversification strategy is still ongoing  with performances ramping up in line with expectations. The Group will strive to pursue its acquisition strategy in a disciplined and selective approach to take full advantage of the development opportunities linked to near shoring trends and to the extension of its global footprint in new fast-growing markets.Adjusted operating margin for the Consumer Products division was maintained at a strong 24.0% level  showing stability organically despite a weak topline growth and the negative impact from the Chinese Covid-19 disruption. On a reported basis  it declined by 52 basis points due to the dilutive effect from acquisitions.Sustainability achievementsIn 2022  one of the world’s leading athleisure brands has joined Bureau Veritas’ Sustainable Chemical Management program and is leveraging BVE3 for their environmental emissions management. BVE3 Environmental Emissions Evaluator is a Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) recognized digital solution and a digital chemical inventory management tool  which is uniquely designed for the textile  apparel and footwear industry. It allows factories to add the chemical inventory details and enables companies to understand chemical controls and helps in the mission towards Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals.PRESENTATION Full year 2022 results will be presented on Thursday  February 23  2023  at 3:00 p.m. (Paris time) A video conference will be webcast live.

RECONCILIATION WITH IFRSThe management process used by Bureau Veritas is based on a series of alternative performance indicators  as presented below. These indicators were defined for the purposes of preparing the Group’s budgets and internal and external reporting. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators provide additional useful information to financial statement users  enabling them to better understand the Group’s performance  especially its operating performance. Some of these indicators represent benchmarks in the testing  inspection and certification (TIC) business and are commonly used and tracked by the financial community. These alternative performance indicators should be seen as a complement to IFRS-compliant indicators and the resulting changes.GROWTHTotal revenue growthThe total revenue growth percentage measures changes in consolidated revenue between the previous year and the current year. Total revenue growth has three components:organic growth;impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (scope effect);impact of changes in exchange rates (currency effect).Organic growthThe Group internally monitors and publishes “organic” revenue growth  which it considers to be more representative of the Group’s operating performance in each of its business sectors.The main measure used to manage and track consolidated revenue growth is like-for-like  or organic growth. Determining organic growth enables the Group to monitor trends in its business excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control  as well as scope effects  which concern new businesses or businesses that no longer form part of the business portfolio. Organic growth is used to monitor the Group’s performance internally.Bureau Veritas considers that organic growth provides management and investors with a more comprehensive understanding of its underlying operating performance and current business trends  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestments (outright divestments as well as the unplanned suspension of operations – in the event of international sanctions  for example) and changes in exchange rates for businesses exposed to foreign exchange volatility  which can mask underlying trends.The Group also considers that separately presenting organic revenue generated by its businesses provides management and investors with useful information on trends in its industrial businesses  and enables a more direct comparison with other companies in its industry.Organic revenue growth represents the percentage of revenue growth  presented at Group level and for each business  based on constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods:constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation over a 12-month period;constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.Scope effectTo establish a meaningful comparison between reporting periods  the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation is determined:for acquisitions carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the current year;for acquisitions carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the months in the previous year in which they were not consolidated;for disposals and divestments carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year in the months of the current year in which they were not part of the Group;for disposals and divestments carried out in the previous year  by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year prior to their disposal/divestment.Currency effectThe currency effect is calculated by translating revenue for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT AND ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGINAdjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin are key indicators used to measure the performance of the business  excluding material items that cannot be considered inherent to the Group’s underlying intrinsic performance owing to their nature. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators  presented at Group level and for each business  are more representative of the operating performance in its industry.Adjusted operating profitAdjusted operating profit represents operating profit prior to adjustments for the following:amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions;impairment of goodwill;impairment and retirement of non-current assets;gains and losses on disposals of businesses and other income and expenses relating to acquisitions (fees and costs on acquisitions of businesses  contingent consideration on acquisitions of businesses);restructuring costs.When an acquisition is carried out during the financial year  the amortization of the related intangible assets is calculated on a time proportion basis.Since a measurement period of 12 months is allowed for determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  amortization of intangible assets in the year of acquisition may  in some cases  be based on a temporary measurement and be subject to minor adjustments in the subsequent reporting period  once the definitive value of the intangible assets is known.Organic adjusted operating profit represents operating profit adjusted for scope and currency effects over comparable periods:at constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period;at constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of operating profit and adjusted operating profit.Adjusted operating marginAdjusted operating margin expressed as a percentage represents adjusted operating profit divided by revenue. Adjusted operating margin can be presented on an organic basis or at constant exchange rates  thereby  in the latter case  providing a view of the Group’s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control.ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATEThe effective tax rate (ETR) represents income tax expense divided by the amount of pre-tax profit.The adjusted effective tax rate (adjusted ETR) represents income tax expense adjusted for the tax effect on adjustment items divided by pre-tax profit before taking into account the adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition).ADJUSTED NET PROFITAdjusted attributable net profitAdjusted attributable net profit is defined as attributable net profit adjusted for adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition) and for the tax effect on adjustment items. Adjusted attributable net profit excludes non-controlling interests in adjustment items and only concerns continuing operations.Adjusted attributable net profit can be presented at constant exchange rates  thereby providing a view of the Group’s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control. The currency effect is calculated by translating the various income statement items for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.Adjusted attributable net profit per shareAdjusted attributable net profit per share (adjusted EPS or earnings per share) is defined as adjusted attributable net profit divided by the weighted average number of shares in the period.FREE CASH FLOWFree cash flow represents net cash generated from operating activities (operating cash flow)  adjusted for the following items:purchases of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets;proceeds from disposals of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets;interest paid.Net cash generated from operating activities is shown after income tax paid.Organic free cash flow represents free cash flow at constant scope and exchange rates over comparable periods:at constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period;at constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of net cash generated from operating activities and free cash flow.FINANCIAL DEBTGross debtGross debt (or gross finance costs/financial debt) represents bank loans and borrowings plus bank overdrafts.Net debtNet debt (or net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Group represents gross debt less cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents comprise marketable securities and similar receivables as well as cash at bank and on hand.Adjusted net debtAdjusted net debt (or adjusted net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Group represents net debt taking into account currency and interest rate hedging instruments.CONSOLIDATED EBITDAConsolidated EBITDA represents net profit before interest  tax  depreciation  amortization and provisions  adjusted for any entities acquired over the last 12 months. Consolidated EBITDA is used by the Group to track its bank covenants.1 Alternative performance indicators are presented  defined and reconciled with IFRS in appendices 6 and 7 of this press release.2 Ratio of adjusted net financial debt divided by consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest  tax  depreciation  amortization and provisions)  adjusted for any entities acquired over the last 12 months.3 Proposed dividend  subject to Shareholders’ Meeting approval on June 22  2023.4 Net cash generated from operating activities/Adjusted Operating Profit.5 TAR: Total Accident Rate (number of accidents with and without lost time x 200 000/number of hours worked).6 Proportion of women from the Executive Committee to Band II (internal grade corresponding to a management or executive management position) in the Group (number of women on a full-time equivalent basis in a leadership position/total number of full-time equivalents in leadership positions).7 Greenhouse gas emissions from offices and laboratories  tons of CO 2 equivalent net emissions per employee and per year corresponding to scopes 1  2 and 3 (emissions related to business travel).8 A new training  following the update of the Code of Ethics  was rolled out in the second half of 2021.

In the fourth quarter  organic growth achieved a strong 9.3%. This is reflected as follows by business: More than half of the portfolio (Marine & Offshore  Buildings & Infrastructure and Agri-Food & Commodities) achieved high single digit revenue growth  up 8.5% organically on average. Marine & Offshore (up 9.4% organically) was amongst the best performing activities  led by both in-service and new build activity and essentially fueled by decarbonization trends. Agri-Food & Commodities (up 9.3% organically) outperformed the Group average and was supported by very favorable market conditions in Metals & Minerals  improving Oil & Petrochemical markets and strong growth for Government services. Buildings & Infrastructure growth (+7.6% organic) benefited from strong momentum across its Americas platforms but was impacted by lockdowns in China;A fifth of the portfolio (Industry) delivered double digit organic revenue growth  up 11.4% during the year with strong business activity for the energy segment and in particular Renewables and Oil & Gas;Another fifth of the portfolio (Consumer Products and Certification) grew low to mid-single digit organically  up 2.6% on average. Certification (up 5.5%) benefited from the rising demand for Sustainability and ESG-driven services  despite challenging comparables. Conversely  Consumer Products Services’ growth was subdued by the multiple disruptions in China and weaker consumer spending overall which impacted the business.Hinda Gharbi joined Bureau Veritas in May 2022 On February 24  2022  the Board of Directors of Bureau Veritas announced the renewal of the term of office of the Chief Executive Officer  Didier Michaud-Daniel  until the Annual General Meeting in June 2023  which will be called to approve the financial statements for the year 2022. As of May 1  2022  Hinda Gharbi joined Bureau Veritas as Chief Operating Officer and became a member of the Group’s Executive Committee. The Board of Directors' decision was the result of a rigorous selection and recruitment process  as part of succession planning for the Chief Executive Officer  led jointly by the Nomination & Compensation Committee and Didier Michaud-Daniel. On January 1  2023  Hinda Gharbi became Deputy CEO of Bureau Veritas. The Board of Directors will appoint her as Chief Executive Officer at the end of the 2023 Annual General Meeting which will be held on June 22  2023. With a degree in Electrical Engineering from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Ingénieurs Electriciens de Grenoble  and a Master of Science in signal processing from the Institut Polytechnique de Grenoble  in 1996  Hinda joined Schlumberger  a global technology leader in the energy sector.

She has also assumed cross-functional responsibilities including Human Resources  Technology Development  and Health  Safety and Environment.

BUREAU VERITAS IS COMMITTED TO ITS EXTRA-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEBureau Veritas’ CSR strategy up to 2025  which is aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals  aims at “Shaping a Better World”. It is built upon three strategic axes: “Shaping a Better Workplace”  “Shaping a Better Environment” and “Shaping Better Business Practices”; and three Sustainability pillars: “Social & Human capital”  “Natural capital” and “Governance”.The Group tracks and reports its CSR performance annually through 19 selected key performance indicators. In 2022  Bureau Veritas made good progress towards the 2025 CSR ambitions  as reflected by the following figures: Corporate Social Responsibility key indicators and performance UNSDGs FY2022 FY2021 FY 2020 FY2019 2025TARGET SOCIAL & HUMAN CAPITAL Total Accident Rate (TAR)5 #3 0.26 0.27 0.26 0.38 0.26 Proportion of women in leadership positions6 #5 29.1% 26.5% 27.5% 24.4% 35% Number of training hours per employee (per year) #8 32.5 29.9 23.9 19.0 35.0 NATURAL CAPITAL CO 2 emissions per employee (tons per year)7 #13 2.31 2.49 2.44 2.85 2.00 GOVERNANCE Proportion of employees trained to the Code of Ethics8 #16 97.1% 95.8% 98.5% 97.1% 99% DISCIPLINED AND SELECTIVE BOLT-ON M&A IN 2022 During the year 2022  Bureau Veritas continued to pursue its bolt-on M&A  completing four transactions in strategic areas  representing c.EUR 74 million in annualized revenue (or 1.3% of 2022 Group revenue). This is added to the acquisition of PreScience completed on December 29  2021 (c. EUR 25 million of annualized revenue).

(C.A.P)C.A.P. Government  Inc. is a US-based company of high-quality building department services across Florida. Founded in 1989  it has earned a reputation for providing reliable services  from complex code compliance to implementing cutting-edge technology for electronic plan reviews. This helps Florida’s local governments operate more efficiently and keep the public safe. This acquisition of a majority stake in C.A.P is another milestone in the execution of Bureau Veritas’ strategic roadmap; it complements the acquisition of PreScience made in December 2021  a US-based leader of Project Management/Construction management services for Transportation Infrastructure projects. Consumer Product Services Galbraith Laboratories Inc.Headquartered in Knoxville  Tennessee  Galbraith Laboratories Inc. is a US expert in healthcare analytical testing solutions. It provides services to a wide range of industry segments and will strengthen further Bureau Veritas’ position in the Consumer Healthcare  Personal Care and Industrial Chemical supply chains. Advanced Testing Laboratory (ATL)Headquartered in Cincinnati  Ohio  Advanced Testing Laboratory (ATL) is a US leader in scientific sourcing services for the North American Consumer Healthcare Products  Cosmetics & Personal Care and Medical Device markets. With this acquisition  Bureau Veritas increases the diversification of the Consumer Products Services division by expanding its footprint in North America and enters the fast-growing Consumer Healthcare market. AMSfashionBased in Spain  AMSfashion is an expert in Sustainability  quality and conformity services for the fashion industry. This acquisition strengthens Bureau Veritas’ presence in Iberia  a key hub for the expansion of its Consumer Products Services business  supporting the continuing growth in near shoring from South Europe and Africa. The pipeline of opportunities is healthy  and the Group will continue to deploy its very selective bolt-on acquisitions strategy in targeted areas (notably Buildings & Infrastructure  Consumer Products Services  Sustainability Assurance  Renewable Energy and Cybersecurity) and geographies (North America notably). IMPACT OF THE CHINESE LOCKDOWNS IN THE YEAR 2022Following the Chinese government’s “zero Covid policy”  the Group faced selective lockdowns in several cities across the country since the end of March 2022. Given its exposure to China (16% of total revenue in FY 2022)  the lockdown measures had a material impact on performance since the second quarter of 2022. The impact varied however by business: In Consumer Products Services  which makes up around half of the Group’s Chinese revenue  Bureau Veritas showed resilience and ability to adapt during the lockdowns. In the second quarter  the impact was thereby contained as the teams were able to divert samples from one location to another across the country or outside of China to the Group’s South Asia testing capabilities (Vietnam  Bangladesh  India and Sri Lanka). In the fourth quarter  the business was impacted by localized lockdowns and increased level of absenteeism due to the spread of the pandemic;In Buildings & Infrastructure (representing around a quarter of China’s revenue  and solely focused on infrastructure assets in the transportation field and energy)  the business was impacted by site closures. Consequently  organic revenue declined by 9.2% in 2022. This was notably the case in the second quarter due to mobility restrictions imposed in many areas (Shanghai and Shenzhen notably). Once the mobility restrictions had been removed  the Group operated under “stop & go” rules with sites required to shut down as soon as the slightest suspicion of Covid-19 arose. Since Q3  the construction sites have gradually recovered  but remained disrupted by positive cases and the resulting absenteeism;In Certification  remote audits enabled to deliver services and 7.2% organic revenue growth was achieved in 2022  primarily led by ESG related services;In Marine & Offshore  the business remained well oriented (+8.1% organic growth in FY22) and faced very limited disruption. Excluding the impact from the Chinese lockdowns  the full-year 2022 Group margin would have been up c.10 basis points to 16.2% compared to the level of 2021. LIMITED IMPACT AND EXPOSURE TO THE RUSSIA / UKRAINE WARThe Group generated c.1% of its consolidated revenue in 2022 with Russia and Ukraine together  mainly related to commodities markets. In Ukraine (0.2% of Group revenue)  the Group has put its people’s safety at the heart of crisis management. Since the beginning of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine  Bureau Veritas regularly assess and monitor its position in Russia according to international sanctions. In application of the latter  the Group has reduced its activities. A GOOD PRICE DISCIPLINEThe Group has overall good traction on pricing with variations across sectors and geographies. Price realization is more favorable in the mass market and in highly regulated activities  but more complex with a delayed impact for multi-year and large contracts. At the end of 2022 Group price increases had a 1.5- 2.0% positive impact on revenue. For 2023  the pricing benefit is expected to be higher. Throughout the year  Bureau Veritas  as a service company  has been mainly impacted by wage inflation. It has adapted its pricing strategy consequently and maintained its cost management discipline. STRONG FINANCIAL POSITIONAt the end of December 2022  the Group's adjusted net financial debt decreased compared with the level at December 31  2021. Bureau Veritas has a solid financial structure with the bulk of its maturities beyond 2024 and 100% at fixed interest rates. The Group had EUR 1.7 billion in available cash and cash equivalents and EUR 600 million in undrawn committed credit lines. At December 31  2022  the adjusted net financial debt/EBITDA ratio9 was further reduced to 0.97x (from 1.10x as of December 31  2021) and the EBITDA/consolidated net financial expense ratio was 18.25x. As of December 31  2022  the ratio of adjusted net financial debt to EBITDA had to be less than 3.5x and  only for the US Private Placement  the ratio of EBITDA to consolidated net financial expense had to be greater than 5.5x.On September 30  2022  Bureau Veritas successfully raised EUR 200 million on the US Private Placement market through a bilateral 10-year issuance at 3.6%. Bureau Veritas is a repeat issuer on this market since 2008. With this issuance  the Group seized attractive market conditions to partially refinance in advance its 2023 Bond. It also lengthened the average maturity of the Group’s financial debt to 3.9 years with a blended average cost of funds over the year of 2.1% excluding the impact of IFRS 16 (compared with 2.3% in 2021 excluding the impact of IFRS 16). PROPOSED DIVIDENDThe Board of Directors of Bureau Veritas is proposing a dividend of EUR 0.77 per share for 2022  up 45.3% compared to the prior year. This corresponds to an increase of the payout ratio to around 65% of its adjusted net profit (from 50% previously)  a level which the Group expects to maintain moving forward. Bureau Veritas has significant financial flexibility to make acquisitions to capture long-term growth opportunities.This is subject to the approval of the Shareholders’ Meeting to be held on June 22  2023 at 3:00pm at Bureau Veritas Headquarters  Immeuble Newtime  40-52 Boulevard du Parc  92200  Neuilly-sur-Seine  France. The dividend will be paid in cash on July 6  2023 (shareholders on the register on July 5  2023 will be entitled to the dividend and the share will go ex-dividend on July 4  2023). 2023 OUTLOOKBased on a healthy sales pipeline and the significant growth opportunities related to Sustainability  and taking into account the current macro uncertainties  Bureau Veritas expects for the full year 2023 to deliver: Mid-single-digit organic revenue growth;A stable adjusted operating margin;A strong cash flow  with a cash conversion10 above 90%. BUREAU VERITAS’ CSR EVOLUTION IN 2022 Bureau Veritas helps companies  governments and public authorities reduce their risks in terms of health  quality  safety  environmental protection and social responsibility. Those challenges are central to societal aspirations. Being a Business to Business to Society company comes with a duty: to be exemplary in terms of sustainability internally  and to be a role model for industry in terms of positive impact on people and the planet. Bureau Veritas’ CSR commitment recognized by non-financial ratings The Group’s commitment is to act responsibly in order to Shape a Better World.

ANALYSIS OF THE GROUP'S RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITIONRevenue up 13.4% year on year (7.8% on an organic basis) Revenue in 2022 amounted to EUR 5 650.6 million  a 13.4% increase compared with 2021. The organic increase was 7.8%  benefiting from solid trends across most businesses and most geographies. Four businesses delivered high single-digit to low double-digit organic revenue growth  with Industry up 11.4%  Marine & Offshore 9.4%  Agri-Food & Commodities 9.3% and Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) 7.6%. The remainder of the portfolio saw low to mid organic revenue growth with Certification  up 5.5% and Consumer Products  up 1.0%. By geography  activities in the Americas strongly outperformed the rest of the Group (27% of revenue; up 17.4% organically)  led by a 11.8% increase in North America (B&I driven) and by a 27.8% increase in Latin America (Brazil driven). Europe (34% of revenue; up 4.8% organically) was primarily led by strong activity levels in Southern Europe and in the Netherlands. The activity in Asia Pacific (30% of revenue; up 2.2% organically) benefited from robust growth in Australia as well as strong growth in South-East Asian countries (notably Vietnam and India) while was impacted by the several lockdowns which occurred in China. Finally  in Africa and Middle East (9% of revenue)  business increased by 14.5% on an organic basis  essentially driven by B&I and energy projects in the Middle East. The scope effect was a positive 0.9% (including 1.6% in the last quarter)  reflecting the four bolt-on acquisitions realized in the year 2022  alongside those of the prior year. Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of 4.7% (including a positive impact of 3.0% in Q4 2022)  mainly due to the strong appreciation of the USD and pegged currencies against the euro  which was partly offset by the depreciation of some emerging countries’ currencies. Adjusted operating profit up 12.5% to EUR 902.1 million Adjusted operating profit increased by 12.5% to EUR 902.1 million; the 2022 adjusted operating margin decreased by 13 basis points to 16.0%  including a 6 basis-point positive foreign exchange impact and a 1-basis point negative scope impact. Excluding the Chinese impact  it progressed by c.10 basis points to 16.2%. CHANGE IN ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN IN PERCENTAGE AND BASIS POINTS 2021 adjusted operating margin 16.1% Organic change (18)bps Organic adjusted operating margin 15.9% Scope (1)bps Adjusted operating margin at constant currency 15.9% Currency +6bps 2022 adjusted operating margin 16.0% Two businesses experienced higher organic margins thanks to operational leverage in a context of revenue recovery and positive mix effect: Marine & Offshore (24.1%  margin up 166 basis point) and Agri-Food & Commodities (14.4%  margin up 98 basis point). Two other businesses maintained their healthy margin  Consumer Products and Certification. Two businesses saw margin decline  namely Buildings & Infrastructure and Industry  as they were impacted by lockdown measures in China  contract terminations and portfolio mix effect. Adjustment items increased to EUR 102.8 million versus EUR 83.0 million in 2021. These include: EUR 65.7 million in amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions (EUR 64.1 million in 2021);EUR 10.2 million in write-offs of non-current assets related to laboratory consolidations (EUR 4.9 million in 2021);EUR 31.2 million in restructuring costs (EUR 6.9 million in 2021);EUR 4.3 million in net gains on disposals and acquisitions (net losses of EUR 7.1 million in 2021). Operating profit totaled EUR 799.3 million  up 11.2% from EUR 718.8 million in 2021. Adjusted EPS reached EUR 1.18  up 10.7% year on year Net finance costs decreased to EUR 72.4 million (vs. EUR 74.7 million in 2021)  reflecting mainly the increase in the income from cash and cash equivalents as a result of the interest rates hikes in 2022. The foreign exchange impact is a positive EUR 4.6 million (vs. a positive EUR 6.6 million in 2021) due to the appreciation of the US dollar against the Euro and the appreciation of the US dollar and the Euro against most emerging market currencies. Other items (including interest cost on pension plans and other financial expenses) stood ata negative EUR 13.6 million  up from a negative EUR 5.2 million in 2021. As a result  net financial expenses increased to EUR 81.4 million in full-year 2022 compared with EUR 73.3 million in 2021. Income tax expense totaled EUR 233.4 million in 2022  compared with EUR 199.3 million in 2021. This represents an effective tax rate (ETR - income tax expense divided by profit before tax) of 32.5% for the period  compared with 30.9% in 2021. The adjusted ETR is up 150 basis points at 31.6%  compared with 2021. The increase is due to the rise in tax losses over the period without recognition of deferred tax assets and tax costs  such as withholding taxes  that are not directly calculated by reference to taxable income. Attributable net profit in 2022 was EUR 466.7 million  vs. a EUR 420.9 million profit in 2021. Earnings per share (EPS) stood at EUR 1.03 vs. EUR 0.93 in 2021. Adjusted attributable net profit totaled EUR 533.9 million  up 11.0% vs. EUR 480.8 million in 2021. Adjusted EPS stood at EUR 1.18  a 10.7% increase vs. EUR 1.07 in 2021. Strong free cash flow at EUR 657 million driven by operating performance Full year 2022 operating cash flow increased by 5.6% to EUR 834.9 million vs. EUR 790.7 million in 2021. It benefited from the increase in profit before income tax  largely offset by higher income taxes  restructuring charges and higher capex. Despite the strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter  the working capital requirement outflow remained under control (at EUR 12.5 million  compared to a EUR 13.6. million outflow the previous year). Working capital requirement (WCR) stood at EUR 341.1 million at December 31  2022  compared to EUR 313.3 million at December 31  2021. As a percentage of revenue  WCR slightly decreased by 30 basis points to 6.0%  compared to 6.3% in 2021  which was a record low in a context of limited revenue growth. This showed the continued strong focus of the entire organization on cash metrics  with key initiatives implemented under the Move For Cash program (optimizing the “invoice to cash” process  accelerating billing and cash collection processes throughout the Group reinforced by a central task force  and daily monitoring cash inflows). Purchases of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  net of disposals (Net Capex)  amounted to EUR 125.4 million in 2022  an increase compared to EUR 114.5 million in 2021. This showed disciplined control over the Group’s net capex-to-revenue ratio of 2.2%  broadly stable compared to the level in 2021. Free cash flow (operating cash flow after tax  interest expenses and capex) wasEUR 657.0 million  compared to EUR 603.0 million in 2021  up 9.0% year on year  notably led by currency moves  a reversing trend versus 2021. On an organic basis  free cash flow was up 2.6% year on year.

The decrease in adjusted net financial debt of EUR 76.1 million versusDecember 31  2021 (EUR 1 051.4 million) reflects: Free cash flow of EUR 657.0 million;Dividend payments totaling EUR 280.9 million;Acquisitions (net) and repayment of amounts owed to shareholders  accounting for EUR 95.1 million;Lease payments (related to the application of IFRS 16)  accounting for EUR 139.0 million;Other items that increased the Group's debt by EUR 65.9 million (including foreign exchange and share buybacks).2022 BUSINESS REVIEW MARINE & OFFSHORE IN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 418.3 375.2 +11.5% +9.4% - +2.1% Adjusted operating profit 100.7 84.1 +19.7% Adjusted operating margin 24.1% 22.4% +166bps +130bps - +36bps Marine & Offshore activity recorded strong 9.4% growth on an organic basis in 2022. In the fourth quarter  organic revenue achieved an exceptional 15.8%  a reflection of a very high growth for the Core In-service activity. The full year organic growth performance results were fueled by: High single-digit growth in New Construction (39% of divisional revenue)  which benefited from the momentum of new order intake in the prior year  notably in Asia  and for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) fueled ships;(39% of divisional revenue)  which benefited from the momentum of new order intake in the prior year  notably in Asia  and for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) fueled ships; Low double-digit growth in the Core In-service activity (46% of divisional revenue)  a reflection of several positive factors: i) exceptional level of activity for occasional surveys due to postponement of periodical surveys  notably in the last quarter  following the Covid-19 lockdowns in China; ii) one-off regulatory benefit with water ballast management services (with a December 2022 deadline to carry out water ballast survey for some ships) iii) solid pricing management; iv) the fleet’s modest growth. The fleet classed by Bureau Veritas continued to grow in 2022 (up 0.7% on a yearly basis)  led by all sectors. At year end  it comprised 11 609 ships  representing 143.6 million of Gross Register Tonnage (GRT);activity (46% of divisional revenue)  a reflection of several positive factors: i) exceptional level of activity for occasional surveys due to postponement of periodical surveys  notably in the last quarter  following the Covid-19 lockdowns in China; ii) one-off regulatory benefit with water ballast management services (with a December 2022 deadline to carry out water ballast survey for some ships) iii) solid pricing management; iv) the fleet’s modest growth. The fleet classed by Bureau Veritas continued to grow in 2022 (up 0.7% on a yearly basis)  led by all sectors. At year end  it comprised 11 609 ships  representing 143.6 million of Gross Register Tonnage (GRT); Mid-single-digit growth for Services (15% of divisional revenue  including Offshore)  benefiting from the diversification of services and strong commercial development for non-classification services including consulting services related to energy efficiency. During 2022  the Group strengthened its business development teams and opened branches in Australia and Korea. Conversely  the demand for risk assessment services in the Offshore Oil & Gas market was mixed while the year confirmed a significant increase in investments by oil players in offshore wind projects  both land-based and floating.The shipping market maintained a very positive momentum in 2022 with a level in worldwide new orders (in GRT) slightly above the average over the past 25 years. It was driven by a massive investment in LNG carriers and container ships. At year end  more than 60% of orders for new ships were based on dual fuel systems  which benefited to Bureau Veritas given its leadership position in the field. As a result  the Group’s new orders totaled 9.0 million gross tons in 2022  up 12.5% from 8.0 million gross tons in the prior-year period. The order book  which remains very diversified  stood at 20.1 million gross tons at the end of the year  up 23.3% year on year and compared to 16.3 million gross tons in 2021. Adjusted operating margin for the year improved by 166 basis points to 24.1% compared to 2021. Organically  it rose by 130 basis points  led by operating leverage and a positive mix. Sustainability achievements In a constantly evolving technological and regulatory landscape  Bureau Veritas continued to address the challenges of Sustainability and the energy transition by providing rules and guidelines for the safety  risk and performance requirements for innovation in future fuels and propulsion systems. The Group helped its clients comply with environmental regulations  implement Sustainable solutions on board  and measure progress in decarbonization. Amongst services and solutions delivered in 2022  the Group continued to support the deployment of offshore wind farms by developing a protocol  leading to certification  to help derisk for Subsea Power cables. Bureau Veritas Marine & Offshore also published a white paper detailing alternative fuels for the shipping industry  taking into account technology maturity  availability  safety  emissions and regulations. The Group estimates that decarbonization of shipping will continue to drive many market opportunities in 2023.AGRI-FOOD & COMMODITIES IN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 1 224.8 1 065.2 +15.0% +9.3% (0.2)% +5.9% Adjusted operating profit 176.0 142.5 +23.5% Adjusted operating margin 14.4% 13.4% +98bps +103bps +1bps (6)bps The Agri-Food & Commodities business delivered organic revenue growth of 9.3% in 2022  with strong trends for all activities apart Agri-Food. Q4 recorded 10.2% organic growth. The Oil & Petrochemicals segment (O&P  31% of divisional revenue) showed a steady recovery in the year  which was confirmed in the last quarter. The O&P Trade market achieved a high-single-digit organic revenue growth and benefited from increased testing volumes due to higher fuel consumption  notably for aviation fuel/gasoline  and price increase initiatives. Growth was particularly strong in the US (market share gains)  Europe and in the Middle East (new services). Both locations benefited from the trade flow route changes triggered by the Russia/Ukraine war. Double digit organic revenue growth was maintained for non-trade related services and value-added segments  an area where the Group continued to further reposition its portfolio: Oil Condition Monitoring  fuel marking program  biofuels (made from animal oil or cooking oil for instance)  Sustainable Aviation Fuel or Liquefied Natural Gas. Metals & Minerals (M&M  33% of divisional revenue) achieved double-digit organic growth overall  across the entire value chain. Upstream (circa two-thirds of M&M) continued to record strong growth  across the Group’s key hubs (Latin America  Canada and Australia). In mining related testing  the growth outlook remained solid driven by demand for metals to support the energy transition. The slowdown in demand for geochemistry services was triggered by tightening financial conditions for junior ‘greenfields’ explorers (notably for gold) although the situation eased in the last quarter. The Group continued to successfully develop its on-site labs business with key wins in all the main mining geographies. This contributed to the growth and an increase in revenue predictability. Trade activities reported double-digit organic revenue growth led by Asia  Latin America and Middle East & Africa. It was fueled by the main metals and coal which remained in high demand as a substitute for natural gas. The mega trends for electrification in many economies also continued to support a high demand for copper and base metals.The Agri-Food segment (21% of divisional revenue) recorded a low single-digit organic revenue growth in the year  led by Agricultural products. The Agricultural inspection activities grew strongly  primarily led by Brazil  which notably benefited from a record level of export of soybean and corn crops. It was also led by Asia (strong activity level for sugar and rice notably) and by Middle East. In Europe  business improved in the second half of the year although it remained disrupted by the impact of the Russia/Ukraine war on Black Sea exports. Conversely  the Agri Upstream business  including fertilizer services  was impacted in the Black Sea region on the back of continuous tension since the outbreak of the war. The Food business slightly decreased organically  reflecting a contrasted geographic situation: strong performance in the Middle East  Africa and the US (new greenfield labs opening)  while weak in the Group’s key hubs  Canada (contract terminations partly offset by new location) and Australia (Covid-19 related disruption). Government services (15% of divisional revenue) delivered a strong double-digit organic growth in the year (including a 20.2% increase in the fourth quarter) across most geographies. Strong activity level on existing contracts (benefiting from the increased value of inspected goods) as well as the ramp-up of several new contracts fueled the growth. This included the strong development of Verification of Conformity in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)  Nigeria  Zimbabwe  Tanzania  and Single Window contracts in DRC. In the Middle East  the activity also improved with the ramp-up of a contract in Iraq. Adjusted operating margin for the year jumped by c. 100 basis points to 14.4% from 13.4% in 2021. This was due to strong operational leverage  fueled by the growth recovery  the benefit of better operational excellence and a positive mix. Sustainability achievements The Group is building transparency and promoting Sustainability from farm to fork with its global  end-to-end expertise covering inspection  audit & certification  and testing services. It is committed to supporting responsible use of natural resources and animal welfare  as well as ensuring the reliability of complex supply chains  enabling end consumers to make informed decisions.INDUSTRY IN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 1 181.0 1 013.5 +16.5% +11.4% (0.6) % +5.7% Adjusted operating profit 139.1 126.6 +9.9% Adjusted operating margin 11.8% 12.5% (71)bps (102)bps +16bps +15bps Industry was amongst the best performing businesses within the Group’s portfolio in the full year with organic growth of 11.4%  across the board. In Q4  Industry organic revenue increased by 13.2%. By geography  most regions delivered strong growth in the year  with Latin America leading the way alongside Asia  and North America. Growth was less pronounced in Europe  in Africa and in Middle East. By market  Power & Utilities (13% of divisional revenue) delivered steady growth in 2022  supported by both Opex and Capex services. The activity was solid in Latin America (Argentina and Colombia) with the continued ramp-up of contract wins with various Power Distribution clients (power grid maintenance and domestic meters readings)  although the Group has been more selective on contracts profitability. In Europe  growth was primarily fueled by France and the UK (with high activity levels in nuclear power plants)  and Spain (power generation). In the current context of energy crisis  nuclear power generation has regained traction and provides mid-term attractive growth Capex opportunities for the Group. Renewable Power Generation (solar  wind  hydrogen) saw accelerating trends given the energy crisis  with a double-digit organic performance in 2022. The growth opportunities continued to be focused on Capex projects  with numerous offshore and onshore Wind and Battery Energy Storage projects. In the US  Bradley Construction Management (solar energy construction projects)  has shown an improving sales pipeline with easing supply chain difficulties related to shortage of components and benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act bill (tax incentives) in H2. The Group’s low carbon power generation business (renewable energies and nuclear) now largely exceeds revenues from Oil & Gas capex projects. In Oil & Gas (33% of divisional revenue)  the activity remained well oriented and grew double digit organically throughout the year. Two-thirds of the business rely on Opex-related activities which delivered 22.4% growth as they benefited from the conversion of a solid sales pipeline as well as a catch-up effect of projects which were put on hold or delayed in 2021. This was triggered by the companies’ willingness to manage their assets in a more Sustainable manner (low carbon strategy towards net zero target). Large contracts ramped up in Asia (China led)  Middle East (outsourcing monitoring activities) and Latin America  in particular  Brazil (market share gains) and Argentina (volume and price led). In Canada  the site assessment and remediation activities contributed to the growth (favorable weather in most regions). Oil & Gas investment accelerated during the year  triggered by rising oil prices. The Group’s Capex-related activities  including Procurement Services (c. 2% of Group revenue) achieved high single-digit organic revenue growth  thanks to multiple medium-sized contracts wins with international energy companies. It was primarily led by Asia Pacific (China essentially) and Latin America. In the US  the drilling activity was supported by the increase in the number of rigs. Elsewhere  the aerospace business saw a revenue stream decline following the decision to exit the business in Russia  and the automotive business grew little  still impacted by supply chain disruption. Adjusted operating margin for the year was 11.8%  down 71 basis points from 12.5% in 2021. It is attributable to the termination of low margin Opex contracts and the exit of the aerospace unit in Russia. Sustainability achievements Bureau Veritas is an important player in the energy transition  present at key stages of the renewable and alternative energy production chain. In 2022  the Group was selected to undertake many projects. This includes the project certification of Bada Energy’s Gray Whale 3  a major floating offshore wind farm project in Ulsan  Republic of Korea (capacity of approx. 500 MW)  in which the Group  in partnership with the Korean Register  will provide project certification services (conformity assessment related to design  manufacturing  transportation  installation  and operation). In the last quarter  the Group was also awarded a contract with Woodfibre LNG LTD in Canada to provide the quality control support for the whole LNG project bringing single window solution for all of the clients’ quality needs overseeing the EPC and vendors. BUILDINGS & INFRASTRUCTURE IN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 1 664.0 1 458.4 +14.1% +7.6% +2.2% +4.3% Adjusted operating profit 228.7 208.7 +9.6% Adjusted operating margin 13.7% 14.3% (56)bps (65)bps (2)bps +11bps The Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) business achieved strong organic growth of 7.6% in the year  primarily fueled by the Americas and by the Middle East. In the fourth quarter  revenue rose 11.5% organically. Double-digit organic revenue growth was achieved in Construction-related activities (Capex; 55% of divisional revenue) and mid-single-digit growth in Buildings In-service activities (45% of divisional revenue). The Americas region (27% of divisional revenue) experienced very strong double-digit growth  primarily led by the US and Brazil. In the United States  a strong dynamic was maintained throughout the year (up 18.4% organically) across the Group’s diversified portfolio of activities: data center commissioning services (up 21.8%)  where the Group has a leading expertise and benefits from the verticalization of the business and its international deployment; project management assistance for Opex-related services  with large contracts ramp-up in the Retail market; technical control and station product conformity services for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations  still benefiting from successful wins with many operators in North America. The integration of the latest acquisitions  PreScience and C.A.P  focusing on transportation infrastructure  are progressing as planned and both benefit from a growing pipeline. In Latin America  the Group delivered a very strong growth with Brazil leading the way thanks to the ramp-up of large capex contracts for industrial and steel facilities alongside infrastructure projects. Argentina also contributed to the growth  benefiting notably from a large project for the domestic water grid pipelines installation. In Asia Pacific (20% of divisional revenue)  the business activity suffered from the Covid-19-related disruption in China. The Group’s Chinese operations declined 9.2% organically in the year  with the impact of the lockdown measures in the second quarter and the “stop and go” policy in the second half with sites required to shut down as soon as the slightest suspicion of Covid-19 arose. This included a 11.7% decrease in Q4 due to positive cases and the resulting high level of absenteeism. While the short-term visibility is limited  the Group remains confident for the medium term and still expects to benefit from the Chinese government’s support to the domestic economy through long-term infrastructure spending. Elsewhere  the activity grew strongly in Japan (led by code compliance services) and in India (up 26.1% organically). In Europe (50% of divisional revenue)  growth was moderate overall. A strong performance was delivered in Italy (ramp-up of large contract wins on the motorway network)  the Netherlands (Opex led) and Spain (regulatory driven). France  the region’s largest contributor  grew 2.7% organically. Momentum remained solid in the In-service activity (around three quarters of the French operations)  mostly regulatory driven and reflected the delivery of a healthy backlog. A double-digit organic revenue growth for Bureau Veritas Solutions (technical assistance; consulting services) was triggered by the increase in headcount and a sustained momentum in energy efficiency program services (including the white certificates for eligible projects). The Group’s Capex-related work slightly rebounded  in an improving new build market and benefiting from a higher weighting towards infrastructure and public works. The pipeline of sales related to the numerous investment programs in the European Union (including the Green Deal and the upcoming 2024 Olympic Games in France) continued to grow and add to the revenue visibility. Lastly  in the Middle East & Africa region (3% of divisional revenue)  the Group achieved very strong growth as it continued to benefit from the development of numerous projects as oil prices rebounded (Saudi Arabia). Adjusted operating margin for the year declined by 56 basis points to 13.7% from 14.3% in 2021. This was attributed to the impact from the Chinese lockdown measures during the year and portfolio mix effect. Sustainability achievements During the year  the Group has been the partner of a major transport infrastructure project in France (with SGP for the Paris Metro Line 18 project Phase 2) with environmental control  execution of sampling & analysis campaign (several pollutants) for the Project Manager to control the conformity of works to its environmental policy. In the last quarter  the Group was awarded several EVCS contracts with pilot sites across the US and Canada in the automotive sector for dealership program  site surveys and engineering. CERTIFICATION IN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 428.3 398.2 +7.6% +5.5% +0.1% +2.0% Adjusted operating profit 81.4 75.5 +7.9% Adjusted operating margin 19.0% 19.0% +6bps (2)bps (3)bps +11bps The Certification business delivered an organic revenue growth of 5.5% in the year including 7.0% in the last quarter. The growth was supported by both volume and robust price increases across most geographies and schemes. Strong activity levels were notably achieved in Sustainability-driven solutions. All geographies grew organically. Latin America  Africa  the Middle East and Asia Pacific performed above the divisional average  led by a solid commercial development and strong traction for Sustainability-driven services. The Group capitalized on its diversification strategy with the strongest growth recorded in countries where the business mix has been significantly diversified in recent years (shift from traditional QHSE schemes towards new services). This was illustrated by Brazil (second party audits)  Australia  Vietnam  India (ESG driven)  Thailand and the UK (Sustainability driven)  which all saw double-digit organic growth in the year. North America and Europe (Germany notably)  more geared to QHSE and Transportation schemes  performed below the average  notably impacted by challenging comparables following several recertification schemes in 2021. During the year  the Certification business continued to be led by the increased client demand for more brand protection  traceability  and social responsibility commitments all along the supply chain. Within the Group’s portfolio  double-digit growth was recorded in Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability  Enterprise Risks (led by Cybersecurity) and Training & Personnel services; and high single-digit growth was achieved in Food certification (fueled by Organic Food Products and Food Safety) across most geographies. In Q4  the Group won the inspection food safety contract for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Bureau Veritas’ Sustainability-related services for Certification delivered strong growth throughout the year  up 18% organically  a reflection of a strong demand for verification of carbon emissions  supply chain audits on ESG topics  Assurance of Sustainability Reporting and Wood Management Systems Certification. While the market is mainly driven by voluntary checks from companies  the regulation will soon play a more important role in the future (European directive  German Supply Chain Act  etc.). In Latin America  very strong growth was delivered as the Group benefited from the build-up of dedicated local sales teams and the development of local schemes (BV ESG 360 in Brazil  Casa Colombia in Colombia) and the leverage of international ones (Energy and Forest management system certification). The benefits for portfolio diversification continued to drive growth. A particularly strong momentum was achieved in high value  mission-critical solutions dedicated to Anti-bribery  Asset Management  IT Service Management Information Security  and Business Continuity  in all geographies. In 2022  the Cybersecurity offering achieved a 30% organic revenue growth  primarily led by Europe and by increasing demand for transparency and control of IT and security systems. Adjusted operating margin for the year was maintained at a healthy 19.0%  up 6 basis points compared to the prior year. This reflects operational leverage  tight cost control and the benefit of some remote audits (in China essentially). Sustainability achievements Through Clarity  the first solution to help companies manage their ESG strategy  measure its performance and track its implementation  Bureau Veritas enables companies to bring transparency and credibility to their ESG commitments and put their Sustainability strategy in motion. In the last quarter of 2022  Bureau Veritas was awarded a pre-audit contract by Teleperformance in seven countries (including Colombia)  after the opening of an investigation into the company’s moderation activities. Bureau Veritas acted as a third-party to deliver an independent assurance about the use and inclusion of International Standard ISO 26000 – Guidance on Social Responsibility. The Group has also been renewed by Nestlé to provide independent assurance of Sustainability reporting. In Austria  the Group was selected by the market leader in the refractory industry to conduct on-site supplier ESG audits.CONSUMER PRODUCTS IN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 734.2 670.6 +9.5% +1.0% +3.2% +5.3% Adjusted operating profit 176.2 164.4 +7.2% Adjusted operating margin 24.0% 24.5% (52)bps +3bps (49)bps (6)bps After being the best performing division within the Group’s portfolio in 2021  Consumer Products faced significant challenges in 2022 due to the mobility restrictions in China (57% of divisional revenue) in Q2 and Q3. As a result  organic growth was 1.0% being impacted by regional mobility restrictions in China and the surge in Covid-19 cases in Q4  as well as by the economic downturn leading to less product launches and high inventory from clients. In the last quarter  organic revenue decreased by 4.4%. By geography  the Middle East was the best performer  while Americas and Europe delivered mid-single digit growth performances over the year. Posting double digit and mid-single digit growths  Southern and Southeastern Asia benefited from the diversification strategy leveraging sourcing shift implemented by the Group  notably in Vietnam  Bangladesh  India and Sri Lanka. Softlines (34% of divisional revenue) performed better than the divisional average in the year  demonstrating the agility of the business model induced by the diversification strategy. China suffered from strong Covid-19-related disruptions caused by the lockdown measures as well as by the surge of new cases at the end of the year. But growth was primarily fueled by the Southern and Southeastern Asian countries which continued to benefit from a structural sourcing shift out of China and by the more conjunctural diversion of samples from the regions of China impacted by mobility restrictions during some parts of the year. Western Europe outperformed whilst benefiting from the near shoring sourcing trends from retailers as well as from solid dynamics from luxury brands  notably in Germany and Italy. Hardlines (10% of divisional revenue) and Cosmetics  Health & Beauty (4% of divisional revenue) underperformed the divisional average  with mid-single digit decline over the year  as a result of the global slowdown in consumer demand impacting mostly the Chinese activities. Toys (7% of divisional revenue) displayed an almost stable performance over the year. Inspection and Audit services (12% of divisional revenue) performed well with high-single digit organic growth led mainly by strong momentum on CSR audits revolving around Sustainability solutions such as green textile  across all countries. Lastly  Technology11 (33% of divisional revenue) performed roughly in line with the divisional average  with a double-digit organic growth in Automotive  on the back of a good traction on new mobility (testing on electric vehicle engines  dashboards or charging stations) especially in China  Western Europe and North America. Wireless Testing (wireless technologies/Internet of Things (IoT) products) underperformed the divisional average due to project delays and Covid-19-related disruptions mainly impacting some of the Asian countries. The integration of the three companies acquired this year (ATL  AMSfashion and Galbraith Laboratories) as part of the diversification strategy is still ongoing  with performances ramping up in line with expectations. The Group will strive to pursue its acquisition strategy in a disciplined and selective approach to take full advantage of the development opportunities linked to near shoring trends and to the extension of its global footprint in new fast-growing markets. Adjusted operating margin for the Consumer Products division was maintained at a strong 24.0% level  showing stability organically despite a weak topline growth and the negative impact from the Chinese Covid-19 disruption. On a reported basis  it declined by 52 basis points due to the dilutive effect from acquisitions. Sustainability achievements In 2022  one of the world’s leading athleisure brands has joined Bureau Veritas’ Sustainable Chemical Management program and is leveraging BVE3 for their environmental emissions management. BVE3 Environmental Emissions Evaluator is a Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) recognized digital solution and a digital chemical inventory management tool  which is uniquely designed for the textile  apparel and footwear industry. It allows factories to add the chemical inventory details and enables companies to understand chemical controls and helps in the mission towards Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals.PRESENTATION Full year 2022 results will be presented on Thursday  February 23  2023  at 3:00 p.m. (Paris time) A video conference will be webcast live.

based on a series of alternative performance indicators  as presented below. These indicators were defined for the purposes of preparing the Group’s budgets and internal and external reporting. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators provide additional useful information to financial statement users  enabling them to better understand the Group’s performance  especially its operating performance. Some of these indicators represent benchmarks in the testing  inspection and certification (TIC) business and are commonly used and tracked by the financial community. These alternative performance indicators should be seen as a complement to IFRS-compliant indicators and the resulting changes. GROWTH Total revenue growth The total revenue growth percentage measures changes in consolidated revenue between the previous year and the current year. Total revenue growth has three components: organic growth;impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (scope effect);impact of changes in exchange rates (currency effect).Organic growth The Group internally monitors and publishes “organic” revenue growth  which it considers to be more representative of the Group’s operating performance in each of its business sectors. The main measure used to manage and track consolidated revenue growth is like-for-like  or organic growth. Determining organic growth enables the Group to monitor trends in its business excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control  as well as scope effects  which concern new businesses or businesses that no longer form part of the business portfolio. Organic growth is used to monitor the Group’s performance internally. Bureau Veritas considers that organic growth provides management and investors with a more comprehensive understanding of its underlying operating performance and current business trends  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestments (outright divestments as well as the unplanned suspension of operations – in the event of international sanctions  for example) and changes in exchange rates for businesses exposed to foreign exchange volatility  which can mask underlying trends. The Group also considers that separately presenting organic revenue generated by its businesses provides management and investors with useful information on trends in its industrial businesses  and enables a more direct comparison with other companies in its industry. Organic revenue growth represents the percentage of revenue growth  presented at Group level and for each business  based on constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods: constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation over a 12-month period;constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year. Scope effect To establish a meaningful comparison between reporting periods  the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation is determined: for acquisitions carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the current year;for acquisitions carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the months in the previous year in which they were not consolidated;for disposals and divestments carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year in the months of the current year in which they were not part of the Group;for disposals and divestments carried out in the previous year  by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year prior to their disposal/divestment. Currency effect The currency effect is calculated by translating revenue for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year. ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT AND ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN Adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin are key indicators used to measure the performance of the business  excluding material items that cannot be considered inherent to the Group’s underlying intrinsic performance owing to their nature. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators  presented at Group level and for each business  are more representative of the operating performance in its industry. Adjusted operating profit Adjusted operating profit represents operating profit prior to adjustments for the following: amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions;impairment of goodwill;impairment and retirement of non-current assets;gains and losses on disposals of businesses and other income and expenses relating to acquisitions (fees and costs on acquisitions of businesses  contingent consideration on acquisitions of businesses);restructuring costs.When an acquisition is carried out during the financial year  the amortization of the related intangible assets is calculated on a time proportion basis. Since a measurement period of 12 months is allowed for determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  amortization of intangible assets in the year of acquisition may  in some cases  be based on a temporary measurement and be subject to minor adjustments in the subsequent reporting period  once the definitive value of the intangible assets is known. Organic adjusted operating profit represents operating profit adjusted for scope and currency effects over comparable periods: at constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period;at constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year. The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of operating profit and adjusted operating profit. Adjusted operating margin Adjusted operating margin expressed as a percentage represents adjusted operating profit divided by revenue. Adjusted operating margin can be presented on an organic basis or at constant exchange rates  thereby  in the latter case  providing a view of the Group’s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control. ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE The effective tax rate (ETR) represents income tax expense divided by the amount of pre-tax profit. The adjusted effective tax rate (adjusted ETR) represents income tax expense adjusted for the tax effect on adjustment items divided by pre-tax profit before taking into account the adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition). ADJUSTED NET PROFIT Adjusted attributable net profit Adjusted attributable net profit is defined as attributable net profit adjusted for adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition) and for the tax effect on adjustment items. Adjusted attributable net profit excludes non-controlling interests in adjustment items and only concerns continuing operations. Adjusted attributable net profit can be presented at constant exchange rates  thereby providing a view of the Group’s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control. The currency effect is calculated by translating the various income statement items for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year. Adjusted attributable net profit per share Adjusted attributable net profit per share (adjusted EPS or earnings per share) is defined as adjusted attributable net profit divided by the weighted average number of shares in the period. FREE CASH FLOW Free cash flow represents net cash generated from operating activities (operating cash flow)  adjusted for the following items: purchases of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets;proceeds from disposals of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets;interest paid.Net cash generated from operating activities is shown after income tax paid. Organic free cash flow represents free cash flow at constant scope and exchange rates over comparable periods: at constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period;at constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year. The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of net cash generated from operating activities and free cash flow. FINANCIAL DEBT Gross debt Gross debt (or gross finance costs/financial debt) represents bank loans and borrowings plus bank overdrafts. Net debt Net debt (or net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Group represents gross debt less cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents comprise marketable securities and similar receivables as well as cash at bank and on hand. Adjusted net debt Adjusted net debt (or adjusted net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Group represents net debt taking into account currency and interest rate hedging instruments. CONSOLIDATED EBITDA Consolidated EBITDA represents net profit before interest  tax  depreciation  amortization and provisions  adjusted for any entities acquired over the last 12 months. Consolidated EBITDA is used by the Group to track its bank covenants. 1 Alternative performance indicators are presented  defined and reconciled with IFRS in appendices 6 and 7 of this press release. 2 Ratio of adjusted net financial debt divided by consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest  tax  depreciation  amortization and provisions)  adjusted for any entities acquired over the last 12 months. 3 Proposed dividend  subject to Shareholders’ Meeting approval on June 22  2023. 4 Net cash generated from operating activities/Adjusted Operating Profit. 5 TAR: Total Accident Rate (number of accidents with and without lost time x 200 000/number of hours worked). 6 Proportion of women from the Executive Committee to Band II (internal grade corresponding to a management or executive management position) in the Group (number of women on a full-time equivalent basis in a leadership position/total number of full-time equivalents in leadership positions). 7 Greenhouse gas emissions from offices and laboratories  tons of CO 2 equivalent net emissions per employee and per year corresponding to scopes 1  2 and 3 (emissions related to business travel). 8 A new training  following the update of the Code of Ethics  was rolled out in the second half of 2021. The calculation of the indicator became more demanding since 2021. It is no longer limited to measuring the training of only new employees recruited during the year but focuses on measuring the percentage of employees trained  regardless of their length of service. 9 Ratio of adjusted net financial debt divided by consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest  tax  depreciation  amortization and provisions)  adjusted for any entities acquired over the last 12 months 10 Net cash generated from operating activities/Adjusted Operating Profit. 11 Technology segment comprises Electrical & Electronics  Wireless testing activities and Automotive connectivity testing activities.

Its subscription period will run from 27 March to 12 April 2023.,"PARIS  February 24  2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Sopra Steria Group (SOP  Euronext Paris [Compartment A] – ISIN: FR0000050809) (Paris:SOP) today announced the launch of We Share 2023  a new employee share ownership plan. Its subscription period will run from 27 March to 12 April 2023.We Share 2023 is being offered to approximately 96% of Sopra Steria Group employees  in 14 countries: Belgium  Denmark  France  Germany  India  Italy  Luxembourg  the Netherlands  Norway  Poland  Spain  Sweden  Switzerland and the United Kingdom*. At 31 December 2022  investments managed on behalf of Group employees** represented 6.4% of the share capital and 8.1% of voting rights  positioning Sopra Steria as one of the leading listed French companies when it comes to employee share ownership. At the date of this press release  after adding the shares held directly in registered form by current and former Group employees  these proportions amount to nearly 10% of the share capital and 13% of voting rights.This new plan is in keeping with Sopra Steria’s continuing aim to give employees the opportunity to share in the success of the Group’s corporate plan and performance over the long term. ""With this new plan  we want to recognise the commitment of our employees to the business and reaffirm our aim of being an independent Group  combining our entrepreneurial DNA with our collective force "" said Pierre Pasquier  Chairman of Sopra Steria Group’s Board of Directors.At its meeting of 11 January 2023  the Board of Directors decided to implement this new employee share ownership plan under the same conditions as the previous plans  given their success. The plan involves the transfer of existing shares.Under We Share 2023  employees will receive a matching employer contribution of one free share per share purchased  with the individual employee contribution capped at €3 000. Depending on their country of residence  employees will be able to acquire Sopra Steria shares either through an employee mutual investment fund (FCPE) or directly.Story continuesThe purchase price will be equal to the average of weighted average prices for Sopra Steria shares on the Euronext Paris market over the 20 trading days preceding the date of the decision by the Chief Executive Officer  scheduled for 24 March 2023  setting this purchase price as well as the start date for the subscription period.The plan is limited to a total of 200 000 shares: 100 000 shares purchased by employees and 100 000 free shares granted as the matching employer contribution. If subscriptions by employees exceed this overall limit  the share purchase order amounts will be reduced according to a capping method  i.e. starting with the highest purchase order amounts  by successive iterations  until a level is reached at which the total number of available shares can be distributed. According to the provisional timetable  the settlement-delivery of shares will occur on 10 May 2023.* Including employees eligible for the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) in the United Kingdom.** Investments managed on behalf of employees include shares held through company mutual funds (FCPEs)  SIPs and UK trusts.About Sopra SteriaSopra Steria  a European tech leader recognised for its consulting  digital services and software development  helps its clients drive their digital transformation to obtain tangible and sustainable benefits.
