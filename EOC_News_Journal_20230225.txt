During the autumn months  we continued to refine production lines and processes  while finalizing production validation procedures  ensuring the ability to produce products consistently for the upcoming launch.The CE marking procedure involves two key streams: quality system approval and product approval. With regards to the first  significant progress was made in the latter half of the year. In November  the Notified Body conducted a successful audit  and no critical non-conformities were reported regarding the quality system. The final audit for the quality system is scheduled for early March.It is also noteworthy that the Notified Body has already submitted the initial questions and supplemental requests regarding product approval  and there were no critical non-conformities in these submissions.Obtaining product approval requires close collaboration between the Notified Body and the Medicines Agency. So far  the process has progressed at a slower pace  and cooperation has yet to commence. Given the current backlog of application processing  as reported in public surveys  the company announced in December that it was unlikely to receive the final CE marking approval by the end of March 2023. Despite the delays in the regulatory process  the company still believes that receiving the approval is achievable in 2023.The product approval process for medical devices can be time-consuming and requires patience. Although progress has been slow  the company's financial situation remains stable until July-August. The management team is able to adjust the allocation of funds based on its decisions. Currently  the company is exploring multiple options for additional funding to secure the continuation of development work and well as preparations for commercial operations during the congested approval process..We are steadfastly advancing towards our objective: to bring a new generation of safe bone fillers to a thriving market  improving patients' lives and streamlining the overburdened healthcare system.EVENTS AFTER PERIOD-ENDThe company has on 13 February 2023 applied for The Delisting of Secondary Listing on Nasdaq First North Growth Market Sweden.

The Remuneration Report is available on the company's website  www.fortnox.se. Item 15 - Resolution on long-term share savings program as well as acquisition and transfer of shares under the program The Board of Directors of Fortnox AB (publ) (""Fortnox"" or the ""Company"") proposes that the AGM resolves to implement a long-term share savings plan for current and future permanent employees (""Employees"") within the Fortnox Group (Fortnox Employee Share Saving Program  ""ESSP 2023""). 1. Background and reasons An Extraordinary General Meeting held on 21 October 2022 resolved  in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal  to implement a long-term share savings program ""ESSP 2022"" to all Employees of the Group. The program was well received and more than 60 percent of the Employees chose to participate in the program. The Board of Directors has evaluated the participation in and the initial impact of the share savings program and proposes that the AGM resolves on a new share savings program with similar conditions. The purpose of ESSP 2023 is to create shareholder value and strengthen the community of interest between the participants in the program and Fortnox's other shareholders. ESSP 2023  together with previous programs  is further expected to increase Fortnox's ability to retain and recruit qualified personnel to the Fortnox Group  as well as Employees' interest and commitment to Fortnox's operations and development. Against this background  the Board of Directors believes that ESSP 2023 will have a positive impact on the future development of the Fortnox Group and thus benefit both the shareholders and the Employees of Fortnox. 4 (10) Fortnox AB (publ) 556469-6291 After evaluating the participation in and the effect of the share saving programs  the Board of Directors will consider whether to propose new share savings programs with similar terms and conditions. The Board of Directors also intends  if necessary  to return to subsequent annual general meetings with a proposal that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to resolve on further acquisitions of own shares for transfer to the participants in both ESSP 2022 and ESSP 2023 and any additional share savings programs and related acquisitions and transfers of shares for hedging social security contributions for such programs. 2. Preparation of the proposal The Board of Directors' proposal to the AGM regarding ESSP 2023 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee together with external advisors  in accordance with the Board of Directors' guidelines and following discussions with major shareholders. The Board of Directors has resolved  following the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee  to propose ESSP 2023 to the AGM for decision in accordance with the proposal below. 3. The Board of Directors' proposed resolution Therefore  in order to maintain the maximum flexibility  the Board of Directors therefore proposes  in accordance with the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee  that the AGM resolves: on a long-term share savings plan (ESSP 2023) in accordance with the conditions set out in section A. below; to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on the acquisition of own shares in Fortnox on Nasdaq Stockholm and that acquired own shares may be i) transferred free of charge to participants in ESSP 2023 and ESSP 2022  and ii) transferred to secure thereto connected costs for social security contributions in accordance with the conditions set out in sections B.-D. below; and in the event that the required majority according to sections B.-D. below cannot be reached  that Fortnox may enter into share swap agreements with third parties in accordance with the conditions in section E. below. Resolution on long-term share savings plan (ESSP 2023) ESSP 2023 is addressed to Employees of the Fortnox Group  which is estimated to consist of approximately 764 employees. ESSP 2023 offers Employees the opportunity  subject to their own investment in Fortnox shares ("" Savings Shares "") during a period of twelve (12) months (the "" Savings Period "")  to receive from Fortnox or from another company within the Fortnox Group  or from a designated third party  an allotment of Fortnox shares free of charge. For each Savings Share  Employees participating in ESSP 2023 will have the opportunity  after a three-year holding period from the time the Savings Shares are acquired on behalf of the participants (the "" Holding Period "")  to receive an allocation of one share in Fortnox (the "" Matching Share ""). The maximum amount that each Employee participating in ESSP 2023 may invest on a monthly basis  normally through monthly savings  has been differentiated according to position  responsibility and work performance within the group and the participants have thus been divided into five different categories:Category A - EmployeesCategory B - Managers and key employees Category C - Members of group management 5 (10) Fortnox AB (publ) 556469-6291 Attachments Original LinkOriginal DocumentPermalink Disclaimer Fortnox AB published this content on 24 February 2023 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

During the autumn months  we continued to refine production lines and processes  while finalizing production validation procedures  ensuring the ability to produce products consistently for the upcoming launch.The CE marking procedure involves two key streams: quality system approval and product approval. With regards to the first  significant progress was made in the latter half of the year. In November  the Notified Body conducted a successful audit  and no critical non-conformities were reported regarding the quality system. The final audit for the quality system is scheduled for early March.It is also noteworthy that the Notified Body has already submitted the initial questions and supplemental requests regarding product approval  and there were no critical non-conformities in these submissions.Obtaining product approval requires close collaboration between the Notified Body and the Medicines Agency. So far  the process has progressed at a slower pace  and cooperation has yet to commence. Given the current backlog of application processing  as reported in public surveys  the company announced in December that it was unlikely to receive the final CE marking approval by the end of March 2023. Despite the delays in the regulatory process  the company still believes that receiving the approval is achievable in 2023.The product approval process for medical devices can be time-consuming and requires patience. Although progress has been slow  the company's financial situation remains stable until July-August. The management team is able to adjust the allocation of funds based on its decisions. Currently  the company is exploring multiple options for additional funding to secure the continuation of development work and well as preparations for commercial operations during the congested approval process..We are steadfastly advancing towards our objective: to bring a new generation of safe bone fillers to a thriving market  improving patients' lives and streamlining the overburdened healthcare system.EVENTS AFTER PERIOD-ENDThe company has on 13 February 2023 applied for The Delisting of Secondary Listing on Nasdaq First North Growth Market Sweden.

During the autumn months  we continued to refine production lines and processes  while finalizing production validation procedures  ensuring the ability to produce products consistently for the upcoming launch.The CE marking procedure involves two key streams: quality system approval and product approval. With regards to the first  significant progress was made in the latter half of the year. In November  the Notified Body conducted a successful audit  and no critical non-conformities were reported regarding the quality system. The final audit for the quality system is scheduled for early March.It is also noteworthy that the Notified Body has already submitted the initial questions and supplemental requests regarding product approval  and there were no critical non-conformities in these submissions.Obtaining product approval requires close collaboration between the Notified Body and the Medicines Agency. So far  the process has progressed at a slower pace  and cooperation has yet to commence. Given the current backlog of application processing  as reported in public surveys  the company announced in December that it was unlikely to receive the final CE marking approval by the end of March 2023. Despite the delays in the regulatory process  the company still believes that receiving the approval is achievable in 2023.The product approval process for medical devices can be time-consuming and requires patience. Although progress has been slow  the company's financial situation remains stable until July-August. The management team is able to adjust the allocation of funds based on its decisions. Currently  the company is exploring multiple options for additional funding to secure the continuation of development work and well as preparations for commercial operations during the congested approval process..We are steadfastly advancing towards our objective: to bring a new generation of safe bone fillers to a thriving market  improving patients' lives and streamlining the overburdened healthcare system.EVENTS AFTER PERIOD-ENDThe company has on 13 February 2023 applied for The Delisting of Secondary Listing on Nasdaq First North Growth Market Sweden.

Due to expected inventory adjustments for the next quarters in the value chain after us as well as short-term postponement of delivery volumes of some customers in H1 2023  the Executive Board assumes that sales in Q1 2023 will be approximately 15 percent below Q4 2022. The EBITDA margin in Q1 2023 is expected to be between 30 and 33 percent. For the entire year  the Executive Board anticipates the following development: Sales significantly below previous year due to lower volumes and exchange rate effects; an average exchange rate of the Euro against the US dollar of 1.10 instead of 1.05 (average for the year 2022) would have a negative impact on sales of around EUR 65 million. On the other hand  there is a positive effect from slightly rising prices.EBITDA margin significantly below previous year; in addition to the above-mentioned influences  inflation-related increases in unit costs of around EUR 50 million contributed to the declineDepreciation and amortization due to investments at approximately EUR 220 millionSignificant decline in EBITTax rate in the mid-single-digit percentage rangeCapital expenditure slightly above previous year. Projects that have already started are to be completed on schedule. The capital expenditures in 2024 will materially decrease in comparison to the ongoing year.Net cash flow significantly below previous yearEarnings per share will be significantly lower The complete and audited Annual Report 2022 will be published on March 9  2023.

19232,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-approves-once-weekly-efanesoctocog-063000288.html,FDA approves once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa  a new class of high-sustained factor VIII therapy for haemophilia A: Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB,Sobi® today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved efanesoctocog alfa [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion...,"STOCKHOLM  Feb. 24  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Sobi® today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved efanesoctocog alfa [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein-ehtl]  a first-in-class  high-sustained factor VIII replacement therapy for adults and children with haemophilia A. Efanesoctocog alfa is the first and only haemophilia A treatment that provides patients with normal to near-normal factor VIII activity levels for a significant part of the week with once-weekly dosing  resulting in superior protection from bleeds compared to existing factor VIII prophylaxis.Haemophilia A is a rare  genetic disorder in which the ability of a person's blood to clot is impaired due to a lack of factor VIII. Haemophilia A occurs in about one in 5 000 male births annually  and more rarely in females. People with haemophilia can experience bleeding episodes that can cause pain  irreversible joint damage and life-threatening haemorrhages. Despite advancements in treatment made in recent years  a large unmet medical need still exists and requires further improvement in the standard of care.""This approval marks an important clinical advancement for the haemophilia community because we have an option that can achieve higher levels of factor activity with a single weekly dose "" said Lynn Malec  MD  Medical Director of Comprehensive Center for Bleeding Disorders and Associate Investigator at Versiti Blood Research Institute  and Associate Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics at The Medical College of Wisconsin  US. ""By maintaining high levels of factor activity throughout the week  patients can be confident in the bleed protection efanesoctocog alfa offers.""""On behalf of Sobi I'd like to congratulate our co-development partner Sanofi on this great achievement "" said Anders Ullman  Head of Research & Development and Medical Affairs  Chief Medical Officer at Sobi. ""This is a major milestone in our collaboration as we work towards providing access to this important new treatment for people living with haemophilia A around the world.""The FDA approval is primarily based on data from the pivotal XTEND-1 phase 3 study recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa met the primary endpoint  providing significant improvements in bleed protection for people with severe haemophilia A with median and mean annualised bleeding rates (ABR) of 0.00 (interquartile range: 0.00-1.04) and 0.71 (95% confidence interval: 0.52-0.97)  respectively. Efanesoctocog alfa met the key secondary endpoint with a significant reduction of 77% in ABR versus prior factor prophylaxis based on an intra-patient comparison. Efanesoctocog alfa prophylaxis with 50IU/kg/week provided mean factor VIII activity greater than 40% for the majority of the week with a trough activity of 15% on day seven  and these levels were associated with a low bleed risk.Additional data showed prevention of joint bleeds with a median annualised joint bleeding rate of 0 (Q1  Q3: 0.0  1.0). Treatment with efanesoctocog alfa provided 100% resolution of target joints  which are joints that have recurrent bleeds (e.g.  knee  ankle  or elbow). In adults and adolescents  efanesoctocog alfa had a favourable safety profile and there were no signs of factor VIII inhibitor development.Efanesoctocog alfa is indicated in the US for routine prophylaxis  on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes  and perioperative management of bleeding. The recommended weekly dose of 50 IU/kg is intended for prophylaxis in patients of all ages and the same dose can be administered according to needs in different clinical settings. Efanesoctocog alfa is expected to be commercially available in the US starting in the second quarter of 2023 and will be marketed as ALTUVIIIO™ in Sanofi territories.The FDA evaluated the application under Priority Review  which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of serious conditions.Regulatory submission in the EU will follow the availability of final data from the XTEND-Kids paediatric study in the first half of 2023. The European Commission granted orphan designation in June 2019.About efanesoctocog alfaEfanesoctocog alfa (formerly BIVV001) is a novel and investigational recombinant factor VIII therapy with the potential to deliver near-normal factor activity levels for most of the week  extending bleed protection in a once-weekly dose for people with haemophilia A. Efanesoctocog alfa builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN® polypeptides to potentially extend its time in circulation. It is the only therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which is believed to impose a half-life limitation on current factor VIII therapies. It is approved as ALTUVIIIO [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein-ehtl] by Sanofi in the US. It is not approved in any country outside the US.About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialisation of Alprolix® and Elocta®/Eloctate®. The companies also collaborate on the development and commercialisation of efanesoctocog alfa or ALTUVIIIO in the US. Sobi has final development and commercialisation rights in the Sobi territory (essentially Europe  North Africa  Russia and most Middle Eastern markets).

(Euronext Growth Paris: ALTME)  a biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of cancer by targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME)  released today a message from Aram Mangasarian  CEO of TME Pharma  to its shareholders with the following key highlights: Exceptional clinical results generated in brain cancer trial evaluating NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy and bevacizumabNOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy and bevacizumab Maturing brain cancer survival data confirmed 83% of patients still alive at 10 months12-month median follow-up survival data expected in early Q2 2023median follow-up survival data expected in early Q2 2023 Intensified partnering and financing discussions to secure future clinical development of NOX-A12 without reliance on convertible debt financingNOX-A12 without reliance on convertible debt financing Cash runway projected into September 2023 Dear Shareholders  I would like to take a moment to both look back at 2022 and to look ahead to the 2023 catalysts that can move TME Pharma forward. With the exceptional clinical results emerging from our brain cancer program throughout last year  it was time to make our transformation into an oncology biotech with a focus on therapeutics altering the tumor microenvironment - TME - visible with our new name. Our current strategy focuses all facets of our and collaborators' expertise on the development of our lead asset NOX-A12 in brain cancer as the opportunity with the fastest path to approval. Indeed  recent work has revealed a potential biomarker that may predict clinical response of brain cancer patients to NOX-A12-based therapy. Being able to select patients who will benefit most strongly from our therapy should increase chances of regulatory approval and commercial success while at the same time reducing cost and duration of associated trials. At TME Pharma we pride ourselves on taking on one of the most difficult to treat and underserved cancer indications - brain cancer (glioblastoma multiforme  GBM). GBM is one of the most aggressive forms of brain cancer and the most common malignant central nervous system tumor in adults. Patients with this devastating orphan disease are faced with extremely poor prognosis and a staggering 95% of them will not survive beyond 5 years. There is a huge unmet medical need for an effective approach to treat GBM where the standard of care - a combination treatment including surgery  radiotherapy and chemotherapy - unfortunately is not curative  and provides only a minimal survival benefit despite its heavy toll on the last few months of the patients' and their families' lives. Moreover  not all patients will benefit clinically from the chemotherapy  which limits the efficacy of the treatment while adding side effects for patients. Our approach  built on research into the tumor microenvironment  has delivered a series of highly encouraging results in the clinic and demonstratesthat NOX-A12 combinations  granted orphan drug designation in the US and Europe  have the potential to considerably improve therapy of this disease. Although we were confident that NOX-A12 could generate clinical benefit for patients  the data generated from the GLORIA study in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients surpassed our expectations  in particular the interim results in the expansion arm evaluating the triple combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab  the antibody also known as Avastin® from Roche. These results were reported in November at the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) Annual Meeting in Tampa  US and showed that almost all patients responded to the NOX-A12 triple combination in an impressive manner: 100% of targeted lesions treated with the NOX-A12 combination shrank by more than 50% with 83% of patients achieving durable partial responses lasting longer than six months. Two of the six patients experienced tumor size reduction greater than 99%. These are exceptionally positive treatment outcomes for this patient group: a matched historical cohort treated with the standard of care showed only 25% of patients with tumor size reduction and 10% of patients with a reduction of 50% or more in tumor size. The GLORIA study continues to generate important data  and we have not yet reached median overall survival (mOS). We recently reported that 83% of patients are still alive with the median time on study of 10 months. The 10-month timepoint is an important landmark for assessment since this is the expected median survival for our patient population with chemorefractory tumors and incomplete surgical removal. We are now keenly awaiting the 12-month median follow-up survival data which are due in early Q2 2023. More mature survival data will allow us to initiate discussions with the regulators and design the optimal regulatory path forward for NOX-A12. As announced in June 2022  in response to the emerging positive data we have decided to focus our strategy so that our capabilities and resources advance the glioblastoma program. Over the last months we have been considering different options to maximize availability of mature data from the GLORIA brain cancer trial with available funds and we have now made the decision to pause the recruitment of additional patients in the other expansion arms. These changes provide additional cash runway with funding of TME Pharma projected into early September 2023. As such  to execute on its plans and meet its future financial obligations  the company will need to access additional financing in May 2023. The goal of these actions is to enable us to deliver the datapoints needed to attract an industry partner or long-term investors. Throughout the last year  the TME Pharma team has participated in a range of industry events and conferences. Key clinical readouts were accepted for presentation at two of the most high-profile congresses related to novel cancer therapies  the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) annual meetings. This was a welcome validation of the importance of our research and development and contributed to raising awareness of the work we are doing in brain cancer among the wider scientific community. However  despite the recognition of our promising data  glioblastoma is generally perceived as one of the riskiest indications both by industrial partners and investors. Reluctance to invest in this particularly challenging indication has left patients without effective therapies for decades and made the pursuit for a new treatment so much more critical. Advancing and financing of the glioblastoma program remains our priority for as long as data continues to show positive efficacy signals and generates interest among potential partners. In order to drive clinical development into the next phase we need long-term support from a strategic or financialpartner. Prospective partners and investors would like to wait though for more mature survival data and feedback from the regulatory agencies to advance the discussions. The agreement put in place with Atlas Special Opportunities (ASO) in 2020 has served the company for more than 2.5 years as a predominant source of financing  however it is dilutive for our shareholders and puts downward pressure on the share price. It is our goal to bring long-term investors on board and to end reliance of the company on convertible debt financing. We are actively pursuing multiple alternatives to secure funding for TME Pharma and our clinical programs. We are optimistic that with more mature data and the potential to select patients that will respond to treatment with NOX-A12 we will be able to attract needed financial support to our program. Although I am writing to you during a challenging time for the biotech industry  especially for a small company such as ours  I remain proud of our achievements at TME Pharma and convinced that investors and partners will ultimately see significant value in our NOX-A12 program. I would like to thank the entire TME Pharma team for their diligence and dedication. I know they share my excitement and expectations for the year ahead. I would also like to express my gratitude to our shareholders for their belief in the company and I look forward to updating you on our progress in 2023. We have entered 2023 with enthusiasm and determination for the busy time ahead of us  which contains a great promise for TME Pharma.

The company's oncology-focusedpipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma's approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-linedata from the NOX-A12three dose-escalationcohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12 radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy has received orphan drug designation for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-linedata with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX- A12 combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in combination with Merck's Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-linetherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in France and Spain and is in discussion with regulatory authorities in the United States. The company's second clinical-stagedrug candidate  NOX-E36 is designed to target the innate immune system. TME Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

Today  at WORLDSymposiumTM  data from the Phase 3 COMET study long-term extension showed sustained treatment effect of Nexviazyme® (avalglucosidase alfa) over nearly three years in late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) patients who were treatment-naïve as well as those who switched from long-time standard of care  alglucosidase alfa  during the 96-week extension period. Additionally  a separate analysis of respiratory function showed clinical benefit over two years for patients who switched to Nexviazyme regardless of prior response to alglucosidase alfa.Priya S. Kishnani  MDC.L. and Su Chen Professor of Pediatrics; Medical Director  YT and Alice Chen Pediatrics Genetics and Genomics Center; and Division Chief  Medical Genetics  Duke University Medical Center“The results presented at the 2023 WORLDSymposium continue to build on the data from the clinical trials on the value and long-term impact Nexviazyme may provide for a wide variety of people living with late-onset Pompe disease  from newly diagnosed patients to those who have been previously treated with alglucosidase alfa. Further  when examining patients treated with Nexviazyme who switched from using alglucosidase alfa  these data show clinical benefit both for patients who were stable on alglucosidase alfa and those who experienced sub-optimal response or decline.”Bill SiboldGlobal Head of Specialty Care  Sanofi“These long-term data over nearly three years add to the robust body of evidence that consistently shows the clinical benefit and durability of effect of treatment with Nexviazyme for both treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve people living with late-onset Pompe disease. We continue to learn from our 20 years of experience in Pompe disease and build on our findings in an effort to advance the standard of care.”Story continuesNexviazyme is a monotherapy approved in the US and other markets for the treatment of LOPD. It is also approved for infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) in certain markets outside of the US.Nexviazyme maintained treatment effect at 145 weeksThe Phase 3 COMET trial enrolled 100 previously untreated LOPD patients who were randomized to receive either Nexviazyme (20 mg/kg) or alglucosidase alfa (20 mg/kg) every two weeks for 49 weeks during the double-blind primary analysis period. During the open-label extension period  long-term efficacy and safety outcomes were assessed up to 145 weeks in patients who continued their treatment with Nexviazyme (n=51)  as well as those who switched to treatment with Nexviazyme from alglucosidase alfa (n=44) at the conclusion of the primary analysis period (Week 49).After nearly three years (145 weeks)  changes from baseline (least squares mean [standard error]) showed:Patients who received continuous Nexviazyme treatment for 145 weeks experienced sustained improvements in respiratory and motor function  showing a 1.40 (1.21) point improvement in forced vital capacity (FVC) percent-predicted and an average increase of 20.65 (9.60) meters in walking distance as measured by the six-minute walk test (6MWT)  respectively  compared to baseline.Patients who switched from alglucosidase alfa to Nexviazyme treatment during the extension period experienced stabilization of treatment effect  showing a 1.18 (1.32) point improvement in FVC percent-predicted and an average increase of 0.29 (10.42) meters in walking distance (6MWT)  compared to baseline.The safety profile during treatment with Nexviazyme was comparable between both study groups (those who started Nexviazyme in the primary analysis period and those who switched to Nexviazyme during the extension period). No new safety signals were observed in patients who switched from alglucosidase alfa to Nexviazyme during the extension period. Across both Nexviazyme treatment groups  five patients discontinued treatment during the extension period due to six adverse events (AEs); four were treatment-related (ocular hyperemia  erythema  urticaria  respiratory distress)  and two were non-treatment-related (acute myocardial infarction  pancreatic adenocarcinoma).Clinical benefits seen over two years for patients who switched to NexviazymeSubgroup analyses were also performed to assess respiratory function outcomes for the 44 patients who switched to Nexviazyme in the long-term extension period of the Phase 3 COMET study. Patients were divided into two subgroups  responders (n=14) and non-responders (n=30) based on individual responses to initial treatment with alglucosidase alfa  as measured by the change in FVC percent-predicted (ΔFVC %predicted/year) pre- (baseline-week 49) and post-switch (week 49-week 145). Findings showed clinical benefits over two years following switch to Nexviazyme regardless of prior response to alglucosidase alfa:Patients who responded to alglucosidase alfa treatment in the primary analysis period had increased respiratory function (ΔFVC slope  4.67±1.28%/yr  p<0.001)  which was maintained throughout the extension period with Nexviazyme treatment (ΔFVC slope  0.14±0.94%/yr  p=0.88).Patients who did not respond to alglucosidase alfa treatment in the primary analysis period had reduced respiratory function while taking alglucosidase alfa (ΔFVC slope  -2.12±0.87%/yr  p=0.016); however  switching to Nexviazyme halted this decline in the extension period (ΔFVC slope  0.15±0.61%/yr  p=0.81).About Pompe diseasePeople living with Pompe disease have low levels of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA)  which results in build-up of glycogen in muscle cells throughout the body  leading to irreversible damage to skeletal and cardiac muscles.Pompe disease can present as infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD)  the most severe form of the disease with rapid onset in infancy  or late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD)  which progressively damages muscles over time. If left untreated  IOPD can lead to heart failure and death within the first year of life  while people living with LOPD may require mechanical ventilation to help with breathing or a wheelchair to assist with mobility as the disease progresses.About Nexviazyme (avalglucosidase alfa)Nexviazyme (avalglucosidase alfa) is an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) designed to target the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor  the key pathway for uptake and transport of ERT. Nexviazyme aims to help improve uptake and enhance glycogen clearance in target tissues with an average 15-fold higher level of M6P moieties as compared to alglucosidase alfa  the comparator therapy in the pivotal study. Nexviazyme is approved in multiple markets around the world for the treatment of people living with Pompe disease  including the United States  the European Union  Japan  Canada  Switzerland  Australia  Brazil  Argentina  Taiwan  the United Arab Emirates  South Korea and the United Kingdom  with specific indications varying by country. In Europe  the medicine is marketed under the brand name Nexviadyme.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

These new offerings support learning wherever and whenever it is convenient – building on Lippincott’s full suite of essential medical products  from books and journals to digital solutions.Assignability  feedback  and insights becomes easier for faculty and studentsLippincott Connect Courseware provides faculty – teaching anatomy  physiotherapy  occupational therapy  exercise science  and Intro clinical courses – with better insights on what students are mastering or misunderstanding in their course by tracking performance across proficiency quizzes and adaptive learning questions. Additionally  faculty can create assignments containing a variety of engaging videos  images  and media that generate instant feedback and remediation for students to optimize their learning journey.Students can test their learning with quizzes  highlight and take notes on key passages of the textbook  and view engaging videos and media. Lippincott Connect Courseware also gives students access to and improves learning practices with the most trusted educational content  helping them transition to the workplace more smoothly. Key titles in the digital learning solution include Motor Control: Translating Research into Clinical Practice; Exercise Physiology: For Health  Fitness  and Performance; Bates’ Guide to Physical Examination and History Taking; and Moore’s Clinically Oriented Anatomy.Students and residents get real-world ready by safely mastering common medical proceduresBased on research conducted with hundreds of program directors  clinical department chairs  attending physicians  and residents  Lippincott Medical Procedures is an easy-to-use  comprehensive  evidence-based resource that supports procedural training in internal medicine rotations  Physician Assistant programs  and residency programs. Program directors must ensure that residents can perform core procedures  such as point-of-care ultrasounds  line insertions  and wound care. Additionally  institutions can track usage for streamlined reporting to educational accrediting bodies.This new solution provides a comprehensive procedural training collection with step-by-step techniques for over 60 core medical procedures performed in a hospital or ambulatory setting. Presenting engaging  just-in-time content that shares the “how” and “why” behind specific procedures allows for additional learning moments beyond the time spent in clinicals. Being able to access video tutorials  alongside “pearls” and “pitfalls” helps build confidence and provides practical insight that better prepares novice clinicians to perform procedures safely. Mastering common medical procedures prior to residency can help with a smooth transition into practice.“As caseloads for medical professionals continue to grow and become more complex  the need for new clinicians to be as practice ready as possible is more important than ever.

Representing a major technological and industrial breakthrough  the plant  which has been pre-notified as an IPCEI[1]  will supply the French domestic and international markets in heavy marine and rail mobility and electricity generation for energy grids. Located on the site of the former Ford factory in Blanquefort near Bordeaux  the new plant will contribute to the reindustrialisation of France and Europe  the creation of local jobs and the exportation of French technology.The foundation stone ceremony for the high-power fuel cell plant took place on Friday  24 February 2023 in Blanquefort near Bordeaux (France) in the presence of Damien Havard  CEO and founder of HDF Energy  Hanane El Hamraoui  VP Industry  and local public authorities.A bold industrial projectHDF Energy is building its 7 000 m² plant on a four-hectare plot of land located on the site of the former Ford factory. Delivery of the building is scheduled for late 2023  after which the Company's headquarters will be transferred to Blanquefort.When production begins in 2024  HDF initially plans to manufacture 1.5 MW fuel cells before gradually ramping their unit capacity up to 10 MW. Blanquefort will be the world's first mass production plant for high-power hydrogen fuel cells. 80% of production volume will be exported.In 2024  production capacity will reach 100 MW of fuel cells per year  representing over 100 direct jobs. HDF plans to establish 70% of its supply chain at regional  national and European level. As such  the HDF Energy plant will contribute to the industrial renewal of this regional landmark by installing cutting-edge technology.The high-power fuel cells manufactured here will serve the markets in heavy marine and rail mobility and electricity generation for energy grids. The Company has already signed a number of strategic partnerships for projects involving hydrogen-powered freight locomotives and large vessel propulsion and auxiliary power systems.To coincide with this occasion  HDF Energy also signed a memorandum of understanding with Teréga Solutions and Hype to cooperate on the development of hydrogen mobility in the Bordeaux region. Under the agreement  the parties will review the possibility of launching a joint venture tasked with deploying green hydrogen distribution stations in order to accelerate and scale up the use of heavy and light hydrogen mobility in the region.Project pre-notified as an IPCEI (Important Project of Common European Interest)In October 2022  after two years of cooperation with government departments  the French government selected the HDF Energy project as an IPCEI and pre-notified the application to the European Commission. The Company is awaiting the Commission's approval due this summer in order to step up its industrial project and transform the plant into a gigafactory  thereby generating over 500 jobs in this regional industrial area.Moreover  HDF Energy has received since 2018 significant financial support from the Regional Council of Aquitaine which allowed the Company to start its industrial activity.An environmentally sustainable plantFor its construction and operation  the plant is subject to BREEAM certification  an international standard for assessing the environmental impact of a building in order to promote greener architecture. The following criteria will be monitored during plant operation: energy management  water management  waste recovery  access to sustainable transport and occupants' health and well-being.Moreover  the fuel cell is a clean technology whose sole emission is steam. Fuel cells have a 20-year lifespan and the Company has already provided for their future recycling.ABOUT HDF ENERGYHDF Energy is a global pioneer in high-power hydrogen power plants.

Ltd. (the ""Manager"")  is pleased to report the financial results for the second half year and financial year ended 31 December 2022 (""2H2022"" and ""FY2022""  respectively). Gross revenue for 2H2022 increased by 10.7% year-on-year to €31.6 million  while net property income rose by 5.2% to €24.4 million over the same period. The increase was mainly due to the contribution from the acquisitions of the French portfolio and Parc Cugat in 3Q2021  step-up rents and CPI indexation. Income available for distribution was impacted mainly by higher property operating expenses related to higher portfolio vacancy  higher tax costs  and management fees payable 100% in cash (versus 50% in cash for FY2021).

(as Manager of IREIT Global) 1 Wallich Street #15-03 Guoco Tower Singapore 078881 Main (65) 6718 0590 www.ireitglobal.com Media Release result  income available for distribution for 2H2022 decreased by 14.7% year-on-year to €16.4 million  while the distribution per unit (""DPU"") amounted to 1.28 € cents  down 14.7% year-on-year. For FY2022  gross revenue came in at €61.7 million  up 18.2% year-on-year  whereas net property income was 14.9% higher at €48.8 million. In addition  income available for distribution was largely flat at €34.6 million and DPU for the full-year registered 2.69 € cents  representing a decrease of 8.2% year-on-year. Based on the closing unit price of S$0.505 as at 30 December 2022  the FY2022 DPU translates to a healthy distribution yield of 7.6%. (1) Portfolio occupancy was down to 88.3% as at 31 December 2022 from 95.7% a year ago  due mainly to Darmstadt Campus being vacant since December 2022 with the departure of its sole tenant  Deutsche Telekom. This contributed partially to the 2.5% year-on-year decline in IREIT's portfolio valuation to €950.5 million as at 31 December 2022  and may have some impact on IREIT's future distributions. Mr Louis d'Estienne d'Orves  Chief Executive Officer of the Manager  said  ""We are pleased to grow the gross revenue of IREIT's portfolio  delivering growth of 18.2% year-on-year. We will continue to proactively engage our existing tenants to retain them  as well as focus on filling up the vacant spaces at IREIT's portfolio assets in 2023. At the same time  on the environmental  social and governance (""ESG"") front  we are working to improve the energy efficiency and marketability of IREIT's portfolio. To this end  we have successfully attained green certifications for 15 properties under IREIT's French portfolio  with the remaining 12 properties on track to receive their certifications by the first quarter of 2023. We will continue to strive to make a positive impact on the communities that IREIT operates in while creating long-term value for Unitholders."" IREIT's weighted average lease expiry (""WALE"") improved to 5.0 years as at 31 December 2022 from 3.8 years a year ago  as a result of the six-year lease extension for 100% of Bonn Campus and the 12-year major new lease for approximately 5 300 sqm data centre space at Sant Cugat Green during the year. In addition  IREIT will continue to benefit from higher rents due to rising inflation as its portfolio leases have rental escalation clauses pegged to CPI  while the high level of hedging on its existing bank borrowings will cushion IREIT from any impact due to rising interest rates. Notably  IREIT's aggregate leverage as at 31 December 2022 remained low at 32.0%  with substantially all of the bank borrowings hedged and no (1) Based on S$1.4331 per € as at 30 December 2022 as extracted from MAS website Joint Sponsors of IREIT Global: Page 2 of 6IREIT Global Group Pte.

Efanesoctocog alfa is the first and only haemophilia A treatment that provides patients with normal to near-normal factor VIII activity levels for a significant part of the week with once-weekly dosing  resulting in superior protection from bleeds compared to existing factor VIII prophylaxis.Haemophilia A is a rare  genetic disorder in which the ability of a person's blood to clot is impaired due to a lack of factor VIII. Haemophilia A occurs in about one in 5 000 male births annually  and more rarely in females. People with haemophilia can experience bleeding episodes that can cause pain  irreversible joint damage and life-threatening haemorrhages. Despite advancements in treatment made in recent years  a large unmet medical need still exists and requires further improvement in the standard of care.""This approval marks an important clinical advancement for the haemophilia community because we have an option that can achieve higher levels of factor activity with a single weekly dose "" said Lynn Malec  MD  Medical Director of Comprehensive Center for Bleeding Disorders and Associate Investigator at Versiti Blood Research Institute  and Associate Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics at The Medical College of Wisconsin  US. ""By maintaining high levels of factor activity throughout the week  patients can be confident in the bleed protection efanesoctocog alfa offers.""""On behalf of Sobi I'd like to congratulate our co-development partner Sanofi on this great achievement "" said Anders Ullman  Head of Research & Development and Medical Affairs  Chief Medical Officer at Sobi. ""This is a major milestone in our collaboration as we work towards providing access to this important new treatment for people living with haemophilia A around the world.""The FDA approval is primarily based on data from the pivotal XTEND-1 phase 3 study recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa met the primary endpoint  providing significant improvements in bleed protection for people with severe haemophilia A with median and mean annualised bleeding rates (ABR) of 0.00 (interquartile range: 0.00-1.04) and 0.71 (95% confidence interval: 0.52-0.97)  respectively. Efanesoctocog alfa met the key secondary endpoint with a significant reduction of 77% in ABR versus prior factor prophylaxis based on an intra-patient comparison. Efanesoctocog alfa prophylaxis with 50IU/kg/week provided mean factor VIII activity greater than 40% for the majority of the week with a trough activity of 15% on day seven  and these levels were associated with a low bleed risk.Additional data showed prevention of joint bleeds with a median annualised joint bleeding rate of 0 (Q1  Q3: 0.0  1.0). Treatment with efanesoctocog alfa provided 100% resolution of target joints  which are joints that have recurrent bleeds (e.g.  knee  ankle  or elbow). In adults and adolescents  efanesoctocog alfa had a favourable safety profile and there were no signs of factor VIII inhibitor development.Efanesoctocog alfa is indicated in the US for routine prophylaxis  on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes  and perioperative management of bleeding. The recommended weekly dose of 50 IU/kg is intended for prophylaxis in patients of all ages and the same dose can be administered according to needs in different clinical settings. Efanesoctocog alfa is expected to be commercially available in the US starting in the second quarter of 2023 and will be marketed as ALTUVIIIO™ in Sanofi territories.The FDA evaluated the application under Priority Review  which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of serious conditions.Regulatory submission in the EU will follow the availability of final data from the XTEND-Kids paediatric study in the first half of 2023. The European Commission granted orphan designation in June 2019.About efanesoctocog alfaEfanesoctocog alfa (formerly BIVV001) is a novel and investigational recombinant factor VIII therapy with the potential to deliver near-normal factor activity levels for most of the week  extending bleed protection in a once-weekly dose for people with haemophilia A. Efanesoctocog alfa builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN® polypeptides to potentially extend its time in circulation. It is the only therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which is believed to impose a half-life limitation on current factor VIII therapies. It is approved as ALTUVIIIO [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein-ehtl] by Sanofi in the US. It is not approved in any country outside the US.About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialisation of Alprolix® and Elocta®/Eloctate®.

Today  at WORLDSymposiumTM  data from the Phase 3 COMET study long-term extension showed sustained treatment effect of Nexviazyme® (avalglucosidase alfa) over nearly three years in late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) patients who were treatment-naïve as well as those who switched from long-time standard of care  alglucosidase alfa  during the 96-week extension period. Additionally  a separate analysis of respiratory function showed clinical benefit over two years for patients who switched to Nexviazyme regardless of prior response to alglucosidase alfa.Priya S. Kishnani  MDC.L. and Su Chen Professor of Pediatrics; Medical Director  YT and Alice Chen Pediatrics Genetics and Genomics Center; and Division Chief  Medical Genetics  Duke University Medical Center“The results presented at the 2023 WORLDSymposium continue to build on the data from the clinical trials on the value and long-term impact Nexviazyme may provide for a wide variety of people living with late-onset Pompe disease  from newly diagnosed patients to those who have been previously treated with alglucosidase alfa. Further  when examining patients treated with Nexviazyme who switched from using alglucosidase alfa  these data show clinical benefit both for patients who were stable on alglucosidase alfa and those who experienced sub-optimal response or decline.”Bill SiboldGlobal Head of Specialty Care  Sanofi“These long-term data over nearly three years add to the robust body of evidence that consistently shows the clinical benefit and durability of effect of treatment with Nexviazyme for both treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve people living with late-onset Pompe disease. We continue to learn from our 20 years of experience in Pompe disease and build on our findings in an effort to advance the standard of care.”Nexviazyme is a monotherapy approved in the US and other markets for the treatment of LOPD. It is also approved for infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) in certain markets outside of the US.Nexviazyme maintained treatment effect at 145 weeksThe Phase 3 COMET trial enrolled 100 previously untreated LOPD patients who were randomized to receive either Nexviazyme (20 mg/kg) or alglucosidase alfa (20 mg/kg) every two weeks for 49 weeks during the double-blind primary analysis period. During the open-label extension period  long-term efficacy and safety outcomes were assessed up to 145 weeks in patients who continued their treatment with Nexviazyme (n=51)  as well as those who switched to treatment with Nexviazyme from alglucosidase alfa (n=44) at the conclusion of the primary analysis period (Week 49).After nearly three years (145 weeks)  changes from baseline (least squares mean [standard error]) showed:Patients who received continuous Nexviazyme treatment for 145 weeks experienced sustained improvements in respiratory and motor function  showing a 1.40 (1.21) point improvement in forced vital capacity (FVC) percent-predicted and an average increase of 20.65 (9.60) meters in walking distance as measured by the six-minute walk test (6MWT)  respectively  compared to baseline.Patients who switched from alglucosidase alfa to Nexviazyme treatment during the extension period experienced stabilization of treatment effect  showing a 1.18 (1.32) point improvement in FVC percent-predicted and an average increase of 0.29 (10.42) meters in walking distance (6MWT)  compared to baseline.The safety profile during treatment with Nexviazyme was comparable between both study groups (those who started Nexviazyme in the primary analysis period and those who switched to Nexviazyme during the extension period). No new safety signals were observed in patients who switched from alglucosidase alfa to Nexviazyme during the extension period. Across both Nexviazyme treatment groups  five patients discontinued treatment during the extension period due to six adverse events (AEs); four were treatment-related (ocular hyperemia  erythema  urticaria  respiratory distress)  and two were non-treatment-related (acute myocardial infarction  pancreatic adenocarcinoma).Clinical benefits seen over two years for patients who switched to NexviazymeSubgroup analyses were also performed to assess respiratory function outcomes for the 44 patients who switched to Nexviazyme in the long-term extension period of the Phase 3 COMET study. Patients were divided into two subgroups  responders (n=14) and non-responders (n=30) based on individual responses to initial treatment with alglucosidase alfa  as measured by the change in FVC percent-predicted (ΔFVC %predicted/year) pre- (baseline-week 49) and post-switch (week 49-week 145). Findings showed clinical benefits over two years following switch to Nexviazyme regardless of prior response to alglucosidase alfa:Patients who responded to alglucosidase alfa treatment in the primary analysis period had increased respiratory function (ΔFVC slope  4.67±1.28%/yr  p<0.001)  which was maintained throughout the extension period with Nexviazyme treatment (ΔFVC slope  0.14±0.94%/yr  p=0.88).Patients who did not respond to alglucosidase alfa treatment in the primary analysis period had reduced respiratory function while taking alglucosidase alfa (ΔFVC slope  -2.12±0.87%/yr  p=0.016); however  switching to Nexviazyme halted this decline in the extension period (ΔFVC slope  0.15±0.61%/yr  p=0.81).About Pompe diseasePeople living with Pompe disease have low levels of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA)  which results in build-up of glycogen in muscle cells throughout the body  leading to irreversible damage to skeletal and cardiac muscles.Pompe disease can present as infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD)  the most severe form of the disease with rapid onset in infancy  or late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD)  which progressively damages muscles over time. If left untreated  IOPD can lead to heart failure and death within the first year of life  while people living with LOPD may require mechanical ventilation to help with breathing or a wheelchair to assist with mobility as the disease progresses.About Nexviazyme (avalglucosidase alfa)Nexviazyme (avalglucosidase alfa) is an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) designed to target the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor  the key pathway for uptake and transport of ERT. Nexviazyme aims to help improve uptake and enhance glycogen clearance in target tissues with an average 15-fold higher level of M6P moieties as compared to alglucosidase alfa  the comparator therapy in the pivotal study. Nexviazyme is approved in multiple markets around the world for the treatment of people living with Pompe disease  including the United States  the European Union  Japan  Canada  Switzerland  Australia  Brazil  Argentina  Taiwan  the United Arab Emirates  South Korea and the United Kingdom  with specific indications varying by country. In Europe  the medicine is marketed under the brand name Nexviadyme.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Today  at WORLDSymposiumTM  data from the Phase 3 COMET st…,New Phase 3 data presented at WORLDSymposium™ reinforce Nexviazyme® (avalglucosidase alfa) as potential new standard of care for all people living with late-onset Pompe diseaseParis  February 24  2023. Today  at WORLDSymposiumTM  data from the Phase 3 COMET study long-term extension showed sustained treatment effect of Nexviazyme® (avalglucosidase alfa) over nearly three years in late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) patients who were treatment-naïve as well as those who switched from long-time standard of care  alglucosidase alfa  during the 96-week extension period. Additionally  a separate analysis of respiratory function showed clinical benefit over two years for patients who switched to Nexviazyme regardless of prior response to alglucosidase alfa.Priya S. Kishnani  MDC.L. and Su Chen Professor of Pediatrics; Medical Director  YT and Alice Chen Pediatrics Genetics and Genomics Center; and Division Chief  Medical Genetics  Duke University Medical Center“The results presented at the 2023 WORLDSymposium continue to build on the data from the clinical trials on the value and long-term impact Nexviazyme may provide for a wide variety of people living with late-onset Pompe disease  from newly diagnosed patients to those who have been previously treated with alglucosidase alfa. Further  when examining patients treated with Nexviazyme who switched from using alglucosidase alfa  these data show clinical benefit both for patients who were stable on alglucosidase alfa and those who experienced sub-optimal response or decline.”Bill SiboldGlobal Head of Specialty Care  Sanofi“These long-term data over nearly three years add to the robust body of evidence that consistently shows the clinical benefit and durability of effect of treatment with Nexviazyme for both treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve people living with late-onset Pompe disease. We continue to learn from our 20 years of experience in Pompe disease and build on our findings in an effort to advance the standard of care.”Nexviazyme is a monotherapy approved in the US and other markets for the treatment of LOPD. It is also approved for infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) in certain markets outside of the US.Nexviazyme maintained treatment effect at 145 weeksThe Phase 3 COMET trial enrolled 100 previously untreated LOPD patients who were randomized to receive either Nexviazyme (20 mg/kg) or alglucosidase alfa (20 mg/kg) every two weeks for 49 weeks during the double-blind primary analysis period. During the open-label extension period  long-term efficacy and safety outcomes were assessed up to 145 weeks in patients who continued their treatment with Nexviazyme (n=51)  as well as those who switched to treatment with Nexviazyme from alglucosidase alfa (n=44) at the conclusion of the primary analysis period (Week 49).After nearly three years (145 weeks)  changes from baseline (least squares mean [standard error]) showed:Patients who received continuous Nexviazyme treatment for 145 weeks experienced sustained improvements in respiratory and motor function  showing a 1.40 (1.21) point improvement in forced vital capacity (FVC) percent-predicted and an average increase of 20.65 (9.60) meters in walking distance as measured by the six-minute walk test (6MWT)  respectively  compared to baseline.Patients who switched from alglucosidase alfa to Nexviazyme treatment during the extension period experienced stabilization of treatment effect  showing a 1.18 (1.32) point improvement in FVC percent-predicted and an average increase of 0.29 (10.42) meters in walking distance (6MWT)  compared to baseline.The safety profile during treatment with Nexviazyme was comparable between both study groups (those who started Nexviazyme in the primary analysis period and those who switched to Nexviazyme during the extension period). No new safety signals were observed in patients who switched from alglucosidase alfa to Nexviazyme during the extension period. Across both Nexviazyme treatment groups  five patients discontinued treatment during the extension period due to six adverse events (AEs); four were treatment-related (ocular hyperemia  erythema  urticaria  respiratory distress)  and two were non-treatment-related (acute myocardial infarction  pancreatic adenocarcinoma).Clinical benefits seen over two years for patients who switched to NexviazymeSubgroup analyses were also performed to assess respiratory function outcomes for the 44 patients who switched to Nexviazyme in the long-term extension period of the Phase 3 COMET study. Patients were divided into two subgroups  responders (n=14) and non-responders (n=30) based on individual responses to initial treatment with alglucosidase alfa  as measured by the change in FVC percent-predicted (ΔFVC %predicted/year) pre- (baseline-week 49) and post-switch (week 49-week 145). Findings showed clinical benefits over two years following switch to Nexviazyme regardless of prior response to alglucosidase alfa:Patients who responded to alglucosidase alfa treatment in the primary analysis period had increased respiratory function (ΔFVC slope  4.67±1.28%/yr  p<0.001)  which was maintained throughout the extension period with Nexviazyme treatment (ΔFVC slope  0.14±0.94%/yr  p=0.88).Patients who did not respond to alglucosidase alfa treatment in the primary analysis period had reduced respiratory function while taking alglucosidase alfa (ΔFVC slope  -2.12±0.87%/yr  p=0.016); however  switching to Nexviazyme halted this decline in the extension period (ΔFVC slope  0.15±0.61%/yr  p=0.81).About Pompe diseasePeople living with Pompe disease have low levels of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA)  which results in build-up of glycogen in muscle cells throughout the body  leading to irreversible damage to skeletal and cardiac muscles.Pompe disease can present as infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD)  the most severe form of the disease with rapid onset in infancy  or late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD)  which progressively damages muscles over time. If left untreated  IOPD can lead to heart failure and death within the first year of life  while people living with LOPD may require mechanical ventilation to help with breathing or a wheelchair to assist with mobility as the disease progresses.About Nexviazyme (avalglucosidase alfa)Nexviazyme (avalglucosidase alfa) is an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) designed to target the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor  the key pathway for uptake and transport of ERT. Nexviazyme aims to help improve uptake and enhance glycogen clearance in target tissues with an average 15-fold higher level of M6P moieties as compared to alglucosidase alfa  the comparator therapy in the pivotal study. Nexviazyme is approved in multiple markets around the world for the treatment of people living with Pompe disease  including the United States  the European Union  Japan  Canada  Switzerland  Australia  Brazil  Argentina  Taiwan  the United Arab Emirates  South Korea and the United Kingdom  with specific indications varying by country. In Europe  the medicine is marketed under the brand name Nexviadyme.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Efanesoctocog alfa is the first and only haemophilia A treatment that provides patients with normal to near-normal factor VIII activity levels for a significant part of the week with once-weekly dosing  resulting in superior protection from bleeds compared to existing factor VIII prophylaxis.Haemophilia A is a rare  genetic disorder in which the ability of a person's blood to clot is impaired due to a lack of factor VIII. Haemophilia A occurs in about one in 5 000 male births annually  and more rarely in females. People with haemophilia can experience bleeding episodes that can cause pain  irreversible joint damage and life-threatening haemorrhages. Despite advancements in treatment made in recent years  a large unmet medical need still exists and requires further improvement in the standard of care.""This approval marks an important clinical advancement for the haemophilia community because we have an option that can achieve higher levels of factor activity with a single weekly dose "" said Lynn Malec  MD  Medical Director of Comprehensive Center for Bleeding Disorders and Associate Investigator at Versiti Blood Research Institute  and Associate Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics at The Medical College of Wisconsin  US. ""By maintaining high levels of factor activity throughout the week  patients can be confident in the bleed protection efanesoctocog alfa offers.""""On behalf of Sobi I'd like to congratulate our co-development partner Sanofi on this great achievement "" said Anders Ullman  Head of Research & Development and Medical Affairs  Chief Medical Officer at Sobi. ""This is a major milestone in our collaboration as we work towards providing access to this important new treatment for people living with haemophilia A around the world.""The FDA approval is primarily based on data from the pivotal XTEND-1 phase 3 study recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa met the primary endpoint  providing significant improvements in bleed protection for people with severe haemophilia A with median and mean annualised bleeding rates (ABR) of 0.00 (interquartile range: 0.00-1.04) and 0.71 (95% confidence interval: 0.52-0.97)  respectively. Efanesoctocog alfa met the key secondary endpoint with a significant reduction of 77% in ABR versus prior factor prophylaxis based on an intra-patient comparison. Efanesoctocog alfa prophylaxis with 50IU/kg/week provided mean factor VIII activity greater than 40% for the majority of the week with a trough activity of 15% on day seven  and these levels were associated with a low bleed risk.Additional data showed prevention of joint bleeds with a median annualised joint bleeding rate of 0 (Q1  Q3: 0.0  1.0). Treatment with efanesoctocog alfa provided 100% resolution of target joints  which are joints that have recurrent bleeds (e.g.  knee  ankle  or elbow). In adults and adolescents  efanesoctocog alfa had a favourable safety profile and there were no signs of factor VIII inhibitor development.Efanesoctocog alfa is indicated in the US for routine prophylaxis  on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes  and perioperative management of bleeding. The recommended weekly dose of 50 IU/kg is intended for prophylaxis in patients of all ages and the same dose can be administered according to needs in different clinical settings. Efanesoctocog alfa is expected to be commercially available in the US starting in the second quarter of 2023 and will be marketed as ALTUVIIIO™ in Sanofi territories.The FDA evaluated the application under Priority Review  which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of serious conditions.Regulatory submission in the EU will follow the availability of final data from the XTEND-Kids paediatric study in the first half of 2023. The European Commission granted orphan designation in June 2019.About efanesoctocog alfaEfanesoctocog alfa (formerly BIVV001) is a novel and investigational recombinant factor VIII therapy with the potential to deliver near-normal factor activity levels for most of the week  extending bleed protection in a once-weekly dose for people with haemophilia A. Efanesoctocog alfa builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN® polypeptides to potentially extend its time in circulation. It is the only therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which is believed to impose a half-life limitation on current factor VIII therapies. It is approved as ALTUVIIIO [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein-ehtl] by Sanofi in the US. It is not approved in any country outside the US.About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialisation of Alprolix® and Elocta®/Eloctate®. The companies also collaborate on the development and commercialisation of efanesoctocog alfa or ALTUVIIIO in the US. Sobi has final development and commercialisation rights in the Sobi territory (essentially Europe  North Africa  Russia and most Middle Eastern markets).

The maximum purchase price per share is set at €140. The maximum number of shares purchased by virtue of this authorisation shall not exceed 10% of the share capital. This limit is calculated at the time of the purchases and the maximum amount of shares thus purchased shall not exceed €4 billion. The share purchase price shall be adjusted by the Board of Directors in the event of transactions involving the Company’s capital in compliance with the conditions provided for by the applicable regulations. In particular  in the event of a capital increase through the capitalisation of reserves and the allotment of performance shares  the price specified above shall be adjusted by a multiplier equal to the ratio of the number of shares making up the share capital before the transaction to the number of shares after the transaction. The acquisition  disposal  transfer  allotment or exchange of these shares may be carried out by any means that are authorised or that may become authorised by regulations in force  either on-market or off-market  including block transactions or through the use of derivatives  in particular through share purchase options in accordance with the regulations in force. There is no restriction on the proportion of the share buy-back programme that may be carried out through block transactions. These transactions may be carried out at any time in compliance with the current regulations  except during a public offering period. The Shareholders’ General Meeting grants full powers to the Board of Directors  including the ability to delegate such powers  so that  in compliance with the applicable legal and regulatory provisions  including those on stock exchange disclosure requirements  it may proceed with the authorised reallocations of the shares purchased in view of one of the programme’s objectives to one or more of its other objectives  or sell them on-market or off-market  it being specified that these reallocations and disposals may concern shares purchased pursuant to previously authorised share buy-back programmes. The Shareholders’ General Meeting grants full powers to the Board of Directors  including the ability to delegate such powers  for the purpose of placing stock market orders  signing any deed of purchase  sale or transfer  entering into any agreement  carrying out any necessary adjustments  making all declarations and completing all formalities. This authorisation is granted for a period of 18 months from the date of this Shareholders’ General Meeting. It renders ineffective and replaces the authorisation granted by the Shareholders’ General Meeting on 12 April 2022 in its tenth resolution. Fifteenth resolution Renewal of the authorisation granted to the Board of Directors in view of the reduction of the share capital through cancellation of VINCI shares held in treasury The Shareholders’ General Meeting  voting under the quorum and majority conditions required for Extraordinary Shareholders’ General Meetings  having considered the Report of the Board of Directors and the Special Report of the Statutory Auditors  in accordance with the provisions of Article L.22-10-62 of the French Commercial Code  authorises the Board of Directors to cancel  at its sole discretion  on one or more occasions  within the limit of 10% of the number of shares making up the share capital on the date when the Board of Directors takes a decision to cancel and over successive periods of 24 months for the determination of this limit  the shares purchased by virtue of the authorisations granted to the Company to purchase its own shares  and to proceed with a reduction in share capital equivalent to that amount. The Shareholders’ General Meeting establishes the validity of this authorisation at 26 months as from the date of the present Meeting and grants full powers to the Board of Directors  including the powers to delegate such powers  to take all decisions necessary for the cancellation of shares and reduction of the share capital  to recognise the difference between the purchase price and the nominal value of the shares in the reserve account of its choice  including the account for “share premiums arising on contributions or mergers”  to perform all actions  formalities or declarations to finalise the reductions in capital which may be carried out by virtue of this authorisation  and to amend the Company’s Articles of Association accordingly. This authorisation renders ineffective and replaces the authorisation granted by the Shareholders’ General Meeting on 12 April 2022 in its fifteenth resolution. IV-Arrangements 1. Maximum proportion of the share capital that may be acquired and maximum amount payable by VINCI The maximum proportion of the share capital that VINCI may acquire is 10% of the share capital on the date of the Combined Shareholders’ General Meeting. However  in the event of a change in the share capital after that date  the authorisation granted by the General Meeting would apply to 10% of the new share capital. The maximum purchase price per share is set at €140. The maximum total amount of capital that may be allocated to share purchases by virtue of this programme amounts to €4 billion. This maximum amount shall apply for all transactions carried out from 13 April 2023 over the duration of the programme: purchases of treasury shares  acquisitions of derivatives on treasury shares  treasury share subscriptions through the exercise of derivatives previously put in place  additional amounts that may be allocated to the liquidity agreement. The Company reserves the right to use the entire programme. VINCI shall ensure that it does not directly or indirectly exceed the buy-back ceiling of 10% of the share capital authorised by the Shareholders’ General Meeting over the programme’s 18-month term. It shall furthermore ensure that it does not own at any time  directly or indirectly  more than 10% of its share capital. Moreover  the share buy-back programme shall not have any significant impact on VINCI’s free float  which amounted to 82.4% of the share capital on 31 December 2022. The amount of the Company’s available reserves  which was €29 144 million at 31 December 2022  is  as required by law  higher than the amount of the share buy-back programme. 2. Share buy-back arrangements Shares may be purchased fully or partly by any means that are authorised or that may become authorised by regulations in force  either on-market or off-market  including block transactions or through the use of derivatives  including through share purchase options in accordance with regulations in force. The Company shall be careful not to increase the volatility of its share price if it uses derivatives. These transactions may be carried out at any time in compliance with the current regulations  except during a public offering period. The proposed authorisation submitted to the General Meeting does not restrict the proportion of the programme that may be carried out through the acquisition of blocks of shares. 3. Duration and timeframe of the share purchase and cancellation programme Share purchases may be carried out over a period of 18 months following the date of the Shareholders’ General Meeting  i.e. from 13 April 2023 until 12 October 2024. Pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article L.22-10-62 of the French Commercial Code  the shares purchased can only be cancelled up to a limit of 10% of the share capital over successive rolling periods of 24 months. 4. Use of derivatives VINCI reserves the right to use derivatives for the implementation of this programme in order to cover  under current regulations  option positions that it has taken separately (such as share subscription or purchase options granted or issued debt securities giving access to the share capital). Information on the use of derivatives on treasury shares is systematically provided to the Board of Directors.

Biop…,"BiopharmaceuticalsFDANews Release - February 24  2023FDA approves once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa  a new class of high-sustained factor VIII therapy for haemophilia A: Swedish Orphan Biovitrum ABSTOCKHOLM  Feb. 24  2023 -- (Healthcare Sales & Marketing Network) -- Sobi® today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved efanesoctocog alfa [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein-ehtl]  a first-in-class  high-sustained factor VIII replacement therapy for adults and children with haemophilia A. Efanesoctocog alfa is the first and only haemophilia A treatment that provides patients with normal to near-normal factor VIII activity levels for a significant part of the week with once-weekly dosing  resulting in superior protection from bleeds compared to existing factor VIII prophylaxis.Haemophilia A is a rare  genetic disorder in which the ability of a person's blood to clot is impaired due to a lack of factor VIII. Haemophilia A occurs in about one in 5 000 male births annually  and more rarely in females. People with haemophilia can experience bleeding episodes that can cause pain  irreversible joint damage and life-threatening haemorrhages. Despite advancements in treatment made in recent years  a large unmet medical need still exists and requires further improvement in the standard of care.""This approval marks an important clinical advancement for the haemophilia community because we have an option that can achieve higher levels of factor activity with a single weekly dose "" said Lynn Malec  MD  Medical Director of Comprehensive Center for Bleeding Disorders and Associate Investigator at Versiti Blood Research Institute  and Associate Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics at The Medical College of Wisconsin  US. ""By maintaining high levels of factor activity throughout the week  patients can be confident in the bleed protection efanesoctocog alfa offers.""""On behalf of Sobi I'd like to congratulate our co-development partner Sanofi on this great achievement "" said Anders Ullman  Head of Research & Development and Medical Affairs  Chief Medical Officer at Sobi. ""This is a major milestone in our collaboration as we work towards providing access to this important new treatment for people living with haemophilia A around the world.""The FDA approval is primarily based on data from the pivotal XTEND-1 phase 3 study recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa met the primary endpoint  providing significant improvements in bleed protection for people with severe haemophilia A with median and mean annualised bleeding rates (ABR) of 0.00 (interquartile range: 0.00-1.04) and 0.71 (95% confidence interval: 0.52-0.97)  respectively. Efanesoctocog alfa met the key secondary endpoint with a significant reduction of 77% in ABR versus prior factor prophylaxis based on an intra-patient comparison. Efanesoctocog alfa prophylaxis with 50IU/kg/week provided mean factor VIII activity greater than 40% for the majority of the week with a trough activity of 15% on day seven  and these levels were associated with a low bleed risk.Additional data showed prevention of joint bleeds with a median annualised joint bleeding rate of 0 (Q1  Q3: 0.0  1.0). Treatment with efanesoctocog alfa provided 100% resolution of target joints  which are joints that have recurrent bleeds (e.g.  knee  ankle  or elbow). In adults and adolescents  efanesoctocog alfa had a favourable safety profile and there were no signs of factor VIII inhibitor development.Efanesoctocog alfa is indicated in the US for routine prophylaxis  on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes  and perioperative management of bleeding. The recommended weekly dose of 50 IU/kg is intended for prophylaxis in patients of all ages and the same dose can be administered according to needs in different clinical settings. Efanesoctocog alfa is expected to be commercially available in the US starting in the second quarter of 2023 and will be marketed as ALTUVIIIO in Sanofi territories.The FDA evaluated the application under Priority Review  which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of serious conditions.Regulatory submission in the EU will follow the availability of final data from the XTEND-Kids paediatric study in the first half of 2023. The European Commission granted orphan designation in June 2019.About efanesoctocog alfaEfanesoctocog alfa (formerly BIVV001) is a novel and investigational recombinant factor VIII therapy with the potential to deliver near-normal factor activity levels for most of the week  extending bleed protection in a once-weekly dose for people with haemophilia A. Efanesoctocog alfa builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN® polypeptides to potentially extend its time in circulation. It is the only therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which is believed to impose a half-life limitation on current factor VIII therapies. It is approved as ALTUVIIIO [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein-ehtl] by Sanofi in the US. It is not approved in any country outside the US.About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialisation of Alprolix® and Elocta®/Eloctate®.
