JEAN-FRANCOIS MONIER / AFPEric Thirouin  president of the Association GÃ©nÃ©rale des Producteurs de BlÃ© (AGPB  an association of wheat growers)  recognized it straight away: ""2022 will remain an exceptional year."" It's hard to prove the grain farmer wrong  given the figures published in December 2022 by the Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques (INSEE  France's National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies). According to its estimates  French agricultural production should approach the symbolic â‚¬100 billion mark  reaching â‚¬95.8 billion  showing a spectacular leap of 17.4%.The surge in commodity prices  from wheat to barley  canola  sugar and corn  not to mention butter and milk powder  created a windfall effect for French agriculture in 2022. The backlash on grain and oilseed prices was already underway in 2021. The end of the Covid-19 crisis and China's shopping spree  as it was eager to build up its food stocks  created strong supply tensions. The invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops just one year ago has further increased speculative pressure on agricultural commodities.Prices reached a peak in May 2022. At its highest point in history  a ton of milling wheat was trading at â‚¬438 on Euronext.
