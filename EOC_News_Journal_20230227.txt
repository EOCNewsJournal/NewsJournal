A grand prize of £30 000 (around $36 ,"The Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize has just announced the four shortlisted photographers that will appear in the 2023 exhibition. Taking place at The Photographer’s Gallery in London from March 3 - June 11  the prize celebrates photographers who redefine genres  push the boundaries and explore themes of race  identity  gender and traditions.This year’s shortlist includes Belgian photographer Bieke Depoorter for her exhibition A Chance Encounter at CO Berlin. Blurring the lines between photographer and subject  Depoorter’s nominated project explores two chance encounters through the series Michael  and Agata. While Michael examines the disappearance of a man she met on a street in Portland  Agata explores a first meeting in a Parisian strip-club evolving with the constantly changing narrative.Malcolm X (Image credit: Samuel Fosso)Cameroonian/Nigerian photographer Samuel Fosso was also selected for his self-named series which was exhibited at the Maison Européenne de la Photographie in Paris from November 2021 to March 2022. Through a series of self-portraits that Fosso first started taking in the 1970s  he takes on the role of key historical figures and social archetypes as a way of exploring African identity and how African people exist in the world.Artist and filmmaker Arthur Jafa was recognized for his largest exhibition to date  Live Evil at Luma Arles  France. Using clever juxtaposition and lyrical editing Jafa creates thought-provoking pieces containing resonant cultural artifacts. He examines the black experience through an eschewing linear narrative which allows the viewer to consider `'the power  beauty and alienation of Black music"" in Jafa's own words.A photo from the series  Michael (Image credit: Bieke Depoorter)The final photographer to be shorted is Frida Orubano for her series of sculptural collages and digital works. I have seen a million pictures of my face and still I have no idea exhibited at Fotomusei  Winterthur and explorea questions of race  sexuality and identity through striking black and white  abstract imagery.Orupabo's work is complex  multi-dimensional and delivers a poetic maneuver that criticizes single-view depictions of Black lives. Orupabo hopes to spark interest in how photography has contributed to the formation and reputation of colonial relations and violence and how the story of Black people is almost entirely absent.Batwoman (Image credit: Frida Orupabo)The winner of the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation exhibition will be  announced at an awards ceremony held at The Photographers' Gallery (opens in new tab)in London on 11 May 2023.

Click here to read more about the long-term prospects of Valeo.,"DarthArt/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionCar parts suppliers are tough to invest in. I thought Faurecia (now Forvia) was cheap when I invested  but the stock continued to go down before finally catching a bid at the end of last year. Valeo (OTCPK:VLEEF) (OTCPK:VLEEY)  another French company active in the car parts supply chain  optically looks cheap  but there are no real catalysts to push the share price higher. As Valeo dropped by almost 10% on its earnings report (and was trading at a loss of in excess of 10% during the trading day)  I wanted to have a quick look under the hood to see if the market is overreacting or if a short-term hiccup is creating a long-term opportunity. Valeo focuses on the powertrain systems  comfort and driving assistance systems (with for instance the LiDAR systems detecting crossing pedestrians or cyclists) and the thermal and visibility systems.Valeo Investor RelationsValeo’s primary listing in France has FR as ticker symbol. The volume on Euronext Paris is substantially higher (almost 1 million shares) than anywhere else so I would strongly recommend to trade in Valeo’s shares using its Paris listing. There also are options available.Yahoo FinanceA healthy amount of free cash flow was generated in 2022 - thanks to a working capital release2022 wasn’t a bad year for Valeo. The total revenue increased to in excess of 20B EUR but the company clearly experienced pressure on its margins as the operating margin decreased from 4% to just 3.2%.Valeo Investor RelationsThat being said  the contribution from equity-accounted companies improved dramatically: whereas Valeo had to confess a 243M EUR loss in 2021  this was converted into a 115M EUR contribution in 2022 which helped to boost the operating income including the contribution from these equity-accounted companies by almost 2/3rds. The net income came in at 295M EUR of which 230M EUR was attributable to the shareholders of Valeo and 65M EUR was attributable to non-controlling interests. This means the EPS was 0.95 EUR  an increase from the 0.73 EUR in FY 2021 despite the operating margin pressure and the higher finance expenses (131M EUR versus just 60M EUR).Valeo Investor RelationsAs Valeo has a relatively high net debt level (see later)  I'm more interested in seeing if the company is actually generating a positive free cash flow  which will help to keep the debt levels under control.The company reported an operating cash flow of 1.91B EUR in FY 2022 but this includes a nice contribution of 231M EUR from working capital changes which would have to be deduct again. I also see the company paid 291M in cash taxes but only owed 214M EUR based on the income statement. We should also deduct the 59M EUR in dividends paid to non-controlling interests and the net interest payments of 100M EUR.Valeo Investor RelationsThis means the adjusted operating cash flow in FY 2022 was approximately 1.6B EUR.We also see the total capex was 1.5B EUR  resulting in an underlying free cash flow of just 100M EUR. That’s hardly worth talking about but let’s not forget Valeo is in an ""investment modus"" as it has ambitious growth plans for 2025. Valeo expects to reach a total revenue of 24B EUR in 2025  and this should be combined with higher margins.Valeo Investor RelationsIt wants to achieve a 14.5% EBITDA margin (which basically means Valeo is implying the 2025 EBITDA result will reach 3.5B EUR). But even more important is the guidance for a 6.5% EBIT margin.Valeo Investor RelationsBased on a revenue of 24B EUR  Valeo’s 2025 guidance implies an EBIT result of approximately 1.55B EUR. But while Valeo was guiding for an 800M-1B EUR free cash flow result  I’m a bit more cautious. The 2022-2025 projections were published in Q1 2022  before interest rates started to increase pretty dramatically.And with in excess of 6B EUR in gross debt (see below)  increasing interest rates will become an important factor. Earlier this year  a 500M EUR bond with a 0.625% coupon matured and later this year another (much smaller) debt issue of 115M EUR with a 0.95% coupon has to be refinanced as well.Valeo Investor RelationsIf I would assume an average interest rate of 4.25% on the 6B EUR in gross debt  the interest expenses will increase to almost 260M EUR. Deducting this from the 1.55B EUR EBIT guidance would result in a pre-tax income of 1.3B EUR and a net income of approximately 950M EUR of which I estimate about 100-125M EUR would be attributable to non-controlling interests. The net income attributable to the Valeo shareholders would then be around 825-850M EUR. This represents an EPS of approximately 3.5 EUR per share.Investment thesisI’m only lukewarm when I see Valeo’s financial results for 2022 and although the guidance for 2023 looks encouraging with an anticipated 10% revenue increase and slight EBITDA margin increase I remain on the sidelines here until I see Valeo has indeed turned a corner.The 2025 targets are very enticing so I will keep an eye on Valeo as it works toward those targets but it's clear this now is an execution story. And Valeo will for sure have to keep an eye on its debt level and interest expenses while advancing its strategic plan.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

19289,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4582181-6-european-reits-to-consider,6 European REITs To Consider,In this article  I've highlighted six under-the-radar European REITs. Check out the comparison of the REITs and the ones I like the most.,Andrii YalanskyiIntroductionIn this article I will start with short company highlights of under the radar European REITs and compare them at the end. Some are focused on only one type of real estate  while others have exposure to several sectors. In terms of size  they range from 1.3 to 17.4 billion EUR in assets.CovivioCovivio (OTCPK:GSEFF) runs a highly diversified business model. The company has 55% of its assets in offices  30% in residential real estate and 15% in hotels:Covivio Q4 2022 Results PresentationThe average debt maturity is 6.3 years with a 1.24% cost of debt. Cost of debt expected to increase to only 2.5% in 2026 thanks to hedging. Occupancy is 94.4% for offices  99.2% for residential and 100% for hotels.Overall  the current strategy is to focus on debt reduction via share dividend  as well as divestments. Some offices are to be converted to residential use.NSINSI (NSI on Euronext) is focused only on office real estate in the Netherlands:NSI Q4 2022 Results PresentationThe average debt maturity is 4.7 years with a cost of debt of 2%. The occupancy of 93.8% is slightly worse than Covivio's office portfolio (-0.6%). The main headwind facing the company are changes to the Dutch REIT legislation expected to take effect into 2025  which may negatively impact earnings.MercialysMercialys (OTCPK:MEIYF) is focused on retail assets in France but strives to diversify tenants via mixed use such as co-working spaces where possible.Mercialys Q4 2022 Results PresentationThe average debt maturity is 4.9 years and cost of debt is 2%. When accessing growth opportunities  the company will focus on mixed use properties with good development margins (at minimum 2.5% above financing cost).WereldhaveWereldhave (OTCPK:WRDEF) is focused on retail assets in the Netherlands  France and Belgium  where it operates some offices as well:Wereldhave Q4 2022 Results PresentationJust as Mercialys  the company is striving to increase the mixed use element in its retail portfolio. The average debt maturity is 3.5 years with an average cost of debt of 2.5%. The main differentiator for the company are residential development projects to be delivered in 2023-2025+. Just as NSI  it will likely take a hit from changes to Dutch REIT regime to take effect in 2025  which it estimates at 5% of net income.VastnedVastned (VASTN on Euronext) is focused on retail properties in several countries  primarily the Netherlands  France and Belgium:Vastned Q4 2022 Results PresentationThe average cost of debt is 1.91% with an average maturity of just 2.2 years. The company is somewhat unique in not issuing a direct result (FFO) guidance for 2023 due to rising interest rates and economic uncertainty.CofinimmoCofinimmo (OTC:CFMOF) is active in three sectors - healthcare (70%)  offices (22%) and distribution networks (8%) in 9 countries  with a total portfolio of 6.2 billion EUR:Cofinimmo Q4 2022 Results PresentationThe average cost of debt is 1.2% with an average debt maturity of 5 years. The company has a relatively elevated debt to assets ratio of 45.6% compared to the other REITs in the overview. Thus it offers the option to receive the dividend in shares in order to reduce leverage. A key differentiator is the long average residual lease length of 13 years thanks to its focus on healthcare.Comparison TableFor all companies in the below comparison I will use the market price in EUR. I will also implement this approach to estimate the market-implied net initial yield:Market-implied net initial yield = Valuation net initial yield / Division factor where:Division factor = Price/NDV Ratio * (1 - Loan-to-value ratio) + Loan-to-value ratioNDV stands for Net Disposal Value  a common metric reported by European REITs as a proxy for Net asset value.Also where available  I will adjust the NDV to account for the market value of fixed interest debt (for some REITs the NDV is artificially inflated due to low prices of bonds they have issued). Where possible  I will generally use the EPRA net initial yield for valuation net initial yield.Here is the calculation for Covivio as an example:1. EPRA NDV = 97.4 EUR/share (107.8 EUR/share reported minus 10.4 EUR/share mark-to-market of fixed rate debt)2. Loan-to-value = 39.5%3. Valuation net initial yield = 3.6%4. Price at the time of writing = 60 EURYou get a P/NDV Ratio of 60 / 97.4 = 0.616  a division factor of 0.77 (0.616 * (1-0.395) + 0.395). The EPRA NIY is 3.6% which divided by out unrounded division factor of 0.7678 gives us a market-implied net initial yield of roughly 4.69%:Company\Metric LTV Valuation NIY Market NIY Occupancy Covivio 39.5% 3.6% 4.69% 96.6% NSI 28.7% 4.6% 7.04% 93.8% Mercialys 35.3% 5.29% 7.27% 95.6% Wereldhave 42.4% 6.4% 7.91% 95.8% Vastned 43.4% 4.2% 5.73% 98.6% Cofinimmo 45.6% 5.3% 6.01% 98.7% Click to enlargeSource: Author calculations based on company disclosures.ConclusionsThere are several ways to group the six REITs. One approach is to look for the difference between the valuation NIY and market NIY. It is the largest at NSI - over 2% - and Mercialys.For NSI the explanation to me is a combination of low demand for office space coupled with changes to Dutch REIT legislation. The real positive is the low loan-to-value.Mercialys looks really appealing as it offers the second highest market-implied yield after Wereldhave and does not operate in the Netherlands. The loan-to-value is also the second-lowest among the group.Covivio looks unattractive to me as it has a very large office exposure of 55%  coupled with low yields. The residential portion is appealing in an economic downturn however.Wereldhave is the standout in terms of both valuation NIY and market NIY. The expected residential gains will likely offset changes in the Dutch REIT regime.Vastned looks unattractive compared to Mercialys and Wereldhave as the market yield is some 1.5-2% lower. It boasts a strong occupancy but low average debt maturity.Cofinimmo is the only healthcare player in the group with a predictable cash flow thanks to long term ageing trends. Thus despite its high leverage it is an attractive recession option.Overall  of the six REITs I would consider complementing my Wereldhave position with Mercialys  NSI and Cofinimmo.Thank you for reading.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Across Europe an estimated 2.5 - 3 million people2 are affected by IBD  which includes UC and Crohn's disease (CD). UC is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by periods of flare ups followed by remission. In addition to the physical impact from flare ups  there is also a psychological impact associated with UC. It causes significant impairments on quality of life and a poor prognosis is often seen in patients with symptoms of moderate to severe UC at diagnosis.About the SELECTION clinical programThe SELECTION program comprised of SELECTION and the associated long-term extension study (SELECTIONLTE).The SELECTION Phase 3 study was a multi-center  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the preferential JAK1 inhibitor filgotinib in adult patients with moderate to severe active UC. The SELECTION study (NCT02914522) comprised of two induction trials and a maintenance trial. Induction Study A enrolled biologic-naïve patients and Induction Study B enrolled biologic-experienced patients. A majority of the patients included in the SELECTION study (n=1348) had a pMCS of 9 or higher at baseline  and 43% of biologic-experienced patients (n=297/689) had an insufficient response to a TNF antagonist and vedolizumab as well.3The primary objectives of the SELECTION clinical program were to evaluate the efficacy of filgotinib compared with a placebo in establishing clinical remission as determined by the Mayo endoscopic sub-score  rectal bleeding sub-score  and decrease in stool frequency from baseline. Patients who completed the induction and maintenance studies  patients who were not responders at Week 10  and patients with disease worsening during the maintenance study were enrolled in the ongoing SELECTIONLTE study (NCT02914535) to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of filgotinib in patients suffering from UC. An interim report of SELECTIONLTE assessed the safety and efficacy of open-label filgotinib through to Week 144 in completers and through to Week 192 in non-responders  respectively.About filgotinibFilgotinib is marketed as Jyseleca® in Europe and Japan for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe active RA who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs.

These include new analysis from the long-term extension study evaluating the safety and efficacy of filgotinib in UC for nearly four years; an analysis of the prolonged benefit of filgotinib in UC; an analysis exploring factors associated with the partial Mayo Clinic Score (pMCS) over time; and analysis of the effect of filgotinib on anaemia in UC patients.Additionally  Galapagos will present pooled data from five Phase 2/3 trials  and two long-term extension trials of filgotinib designed to further understand the safety profile of filgotinib in UC and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).“We are excited to present data from multiple studies of filgotinib in UC  including results from the SELECTIONLTE study  which has been selected amongst the top 11 oral abstracts at ECCO ” said Daniele D’Ambrosio  MD  PhD  Therapeutic Area Head  of Immunology  at Galapagos. “These presentations capture our broad range of research and commitment to the IBD community and underscore our mission to improve patients’ lives by targeting diseases with high unmet needs.”Data from the SELECTIONLTE study showed that filgotinib 200mg maintained symptomatic remission and HRQoL for up to approximately four years. Amongst subjects who completed the study  the reduction in mean pMCS in SELECTION was maintained up to LTE Week 144. In non-responders  mean pMCS decreased from LTE baseline to Week 192. The results also showed that a high proportion of completers (>80% of patients) and non-responders (>70% of patients) achieved remission according to the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire1.Story continuesThe safety profile of filgotinib 200mg in the SELECTIONLTE study was generally consistent with the safety profile observed in previous SELECTION studies  with no new safety signals observed.“For healthcare professionals treating patients with this debilitating disease  the results from the SELECTION studies provide an understanding of filgotinib’s long-term outcomes and help make the most appropriate choices for their patients ” said Dr. Brian G. Feagan  MD  FRCPC  Professor of Medicine  Epidemiology and Biostatistics  Western University  London  Ontario  Canada and lead investigator of the SELECTION trial. “This latest data reinforces the positive long-term safety and efficacy profile of filgotinib  indicating its potential to be an important treatment option for people living with moderate to severe UC.”Galapagos is also hosting a hybrid symposium: ‘Journey to comprehensive disease control in UC’ on Thursday 2 March 2023 from 18:45-19:45 CET  which will feature experts’ perspectives on what matters most to patients  and how to raise the bar when treating patients with UC. The symposium will include a mix of classical plenary lectures  including tackling challenges and misconceptions  sharing of real-world practical experience in the management of patients with UC  and the place of JAK inhibition in clinical practice.Key Abstracts:Abstract title Authors Presentation date/time Efficacy and safety outcomes up to ~4 years of treatment with filgotinib 200mg among patients with Ulcerative Colitis: Results from the SELECTION LTE study Brian Feagan   Katsuyoshi Matsuoka  Gerhard Rogler  Margaux Faes  Alessandra Oortwijn  Angela de Haas  Christine Rudolph and Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet Oral presentationPresentation number: OP35Presentation date  time & location: Saturday 4 March 2023  09:50-10:00  Plenary HallSession name: Sequencing in IBD - Scientific Session 10: Evolving goals Prolonged benefit of filgotinib in patients with Ulcerative Colitis in SELECTION David Laharie   Andreas Sturm  Taku Kobayashi  Takayuki Matsumoto  Alessandra Oortwijn  Corinne Jamoul  Margaux Faes  Angela de Haas and Séverine Vermeire Poster presentationPresentation number: P690Presentation date  time & location: Friday 3 March 2023  12:30-13:30  Poster Exhibition  Hall B5&6 Factors associated with partial Mayo Clinic Score over time in patients with Ulcerative Colitis treated with filgotinib in the phase 2b/3 SELECTION trial Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet   Edouard Louis  Tadakazu Hisamatsu  Corinne Jamoul  Eva Santermans  Kristina Harris  Angela de Haas  Alessandra Oortwijn and Brian Feagan Poster presentationPresentation number: P736Presentation date  time & location: Friday 3 March 2023  12:30-13:30  Poster Exhibition  Hall B5&6 Effect of filgotinib on anaemia in patients with Ulcerative Colitis in SELECTION Roberta Loveikyte   Angela de Haas  Alessandra Oortwijn  Bart Eskens  Corinne Jamoul  Karine Muller and Andrea E. van der Meulen-de Jong Poster presentationPresentation number: P393Presentation date  time & location: Friday 3 March 2023  12:30-13:30  Poster Exhibition  Hall B5&6 Thromboembolic and major adverse cardiovascular events among patients in the filgotinib clinical trial programme C Janneke van der Woude   Stefan Schreiber  Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet  Zoltán Szekanecz  Ernest HS Choy  Pieter-Jan Stiers  Paul Van Hoek  Katrien Van Beneden  Angela de Haas  Christine Rudolph and Hugo ten Cate Poster presentationPresentation number: P520Presentation date  time & location: Friday 3 March 2023  12:30-13:30  Poster Exhibition  Hall B5&6 Investigating the symptom burden among European patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease using a real-world survey Johan Burisch  Ailsa Hart  Andreas Sturm   Hannah Knight  Christine Rudolph  Rachael Meadows  Alessandra Oortwijn  Sarah Weatherby  Roger Rolph  Fatima Dawod and Alessandro Armuzzi Poster presentationPresentation number: P624Presentation date  time & location: Friday 3 March 2023  12:30-13:30  Poster Exhibition  Hall B5&6About ulcerative colitisUC is a debilitating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that occurs as a result of an abnormal immune system response. Across Europe an estimated 2.5 - 3 million people2 are affected by IBD  which includes UC and Crohn’s disease (CD). UC is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by periods of flare ups followed by remission. In addition to the physical impact from flare ups  there is also a psychological impact associated with UC. It causes significant impairments on quality of life and a poor prognosis is often seen in patients with symptoms of moderate to severe UC at diagnosis.About the SELECTION clinical programThe SELECTION program comprised of SELECTION and the associated long-term extension study (SELECTIONLTE).The SELECTION Phase 3 study was a multi-center  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the preferential JAK1 inhibitor filgotinib in adult patients with moderate to severe active UC. The SELECTION study (NCT02914522) comprised of two induction trials and a maintenance trial. Induction Study A enrolled biologic-naïve patients and Induction Study B enrolled biologic-experienced patients. A majority of the patients included in the SELECTION study (n=1348) had a pMCS of 9 or higher at baseline  and 43% of biologic-experienced patients (n=297/689) had an insufficient response to a TNF antagonist and vedolizumab as well.3The primary objectives of the SELECTION clinical program were to evaluate the efficacy of filgotinib compared with a placebo in establishing clinical remission as determined by the Mayo endoscopic sub-score  rectal bleeding sub-score  and decrease in stool frequency from baseline.

In addition to the founding partners Pascal Klein and Michael Kapf  the chemical group and cooperation partner BASF is also among the major shareholders with a current share of 7.9%. In addition  the tyre manufacturer Continental  among others  also participated in the IPO.The relevant notifications of Pyrum Innovations AG on directors' dealings pursuant to Art. 19 of the Market Abuse Regulation are available on the company's website at https://www.pyrum.net/en/investors/financial-releases/regulatory-announcements/.About Pyrum Innovations AGPyrum Innovations AG is active in the attractive recycling market for end-of-life tyres with its patented pyrolysis technology. Pyrum's pyrolysis process is energy self-sufficient and  according to the Fraunhofer Institute  saves significantly more CO 2 emissions than today's standard recycling processes for end-of-life tyres - especially compared to incineration in cement plants - and produces new raw materials such as pyrolysis oil  gas and recovered carbon black from the waste used as input materials. In this way  Pyrum closes the recyclable material loop and pursues a completely sustainable business model. As a pioneer  Pyrum Innovations AG was the first company in the end-of-life tyre recycling sector to receive REACH registration from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for the pyrolysis oil it produces. This means that the oil is recognised as an official raw material that can be used in production processes. In addition  Pyrum has received ISCC PLUS certification for the pyrolysis oil and the recovered carbon black. Both products are thus considered sustainable and renewable raw materials. These achievements have also been recognised by international experts in the tyre industry. For example  Pyrum won the Best Tyre Recycling Innovation category at the inaugural Recircle Awards and has been nominated for the Grand Prix Mittelstand (Großer Preis des Mittelstandes) from the German state of Saarland.https://www.pyrum.net/enContactIR.on AGFrederic HilkePhone: +49 221 9140 970Email: pyrum@ir-on.comPyrum Innovations AGDieselstr. 866763 Dillingen / SaarEmail: presse@pyrum.net,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.98,0.02,0.0,True,English,"['Pyrum Innovations AG', 'Supervisory Board', 'EQS-News', 'Chairman', 'shareholding', 'company', 'Best Tyre Recycling Innovation category', 'last five trading days', 'Euronext Growth market segment', 'life tyre recycling sector', 'Pyrum Innovations AG Dieselstr.', 'Scale market segment', 'attractive recycling market', 'IR.on AG', 'largest single shareholder', 'Oslo Stock Exchange', 'Frankfurt Stock Exchange', 'Market Abuse Regulation', 'recyclable material loop', 'European Chemicals Agency', 'ISCC PLUS certification', 'inaugural Recircle Awards', 'Grand Prix Mittelstand', 'Großer Preis', 'standard recycling processes', 'sustainable circular economy', 'official raw material', 'new raw materials', 'sustainable business model', 'sustainable recycling', 'tight market', 'production processes', 'life tyres', 'input materials', 'pyrum.net', 'Key word', 'Supervisory Board', 'Alf Schmidt', 'Pascal Klein', 'purchase price', 'average value', 'financial commitment', 'firm belief', 'huge potential', 'pyrolysis technology', 'founding partners', 'Michael Kapf', 'chemical group', 'cooperation partner', 'major shareholders', 'relevant notifications', 'pyrolysis process', 'Fraunhofer Institute', 'CO 2 emissions', 'cement plants', 'carbon black', 'REACH registration', 'international experts', 'German state', 'Frederic Hilke', 'pyrolysis oil', 'OTC transaction', 'current share', 'Pyrum shares', 'long-time Chairman', 'first company', '1,667 shares', 'EQS-News', 'Miscellaneous', 'shareholding', '19:00 CET', 'CEST', 'issuer', 'content', 'announcement', 'Dillingen', 'Saar', 'ISIN', 'CEO', 'holdings', 'purpose', 'Xetra', 'respected', 'end', 'pioneer', '30 September', '30 March', 'addition', 'BASF', 'manufacturer', 'Continental', 'others', 'IPO', 'directors', 'dealings', 'Art.', 'website', 'investors', 'financial-releases', 'incineration', 'gas', 'waste', 'way', 'ECHA', 'products', 'achievements', 'industry', 'example', 'Mittelstandes', 'Contact', 'Phone', 'Email', 'presse']",2023-02-27,2023-02-27,markets.businessinsider.com

The deployment of strong teams comprising 48 developers across all target regions (versus 23 at 31 December 2021) has allowed the Company to build a solid portfolio of large-scale projects and partnerships at 31 December 2022. As a result  the capacity of power plants in development phase in the portfolio was up by more than 25% compared with December 31  2021.Portfolio monitoring provides the earliest indicator of HDF's value creation for both the Group and all project stakeholders. HDF estimates that it is able to generate revenues representing between 12% and 17% of the cost of construction during the development and construction phases  including provision of engineering services and supply of fuel cells during the power plant construction phase.Strong revenue growth in 2022Consolidated revenues for 2022 totalled €3.5 million versus €0.9 million in 2021.This includes €3.0 million recognised under the development contract for the Renewstable Barbados (RSB) project since February 2022  when the Rubis Group became RSB's majority shareholder.Invoicing issued by HDF in 2022 for project management assistance services for projects over which the Group retains control as of end of 2022  the impact of which is eliminated in the consolidated financial statements  amounted to €3.0 million in 2022. This value creation initially eliminated in the consolidated financial statements will be recognised indirectly through gains or losses on disposal of the investments when control is lost.Continuation of the development planThe Group reached a new milestone on 24 February 2023 by officially launching the construction of the Blanquefort plant for the mass production of high-power fuel cells. The plant is expected to start operating in 2024 and to contribute towards achieving the Group's ambitions.Damien Havard  Chairman and CEO of Hydrogène de France  said:“In line with our strategic plan  in 2022 we stepped up the drive to strengthen and structure our teams across all our regions. Having 48 experienced developers worldwide gives HDF the ability to implement its action plan. We have also made very concrete and material progress in all our regions this year. We are extremely keen and proud to see our projects supported at all levels and to make a tangible contribution to the energy transition.”ABOUT HDF ENERGYHDF Energy is a global pioneer in high-power hydrogen power plants.
