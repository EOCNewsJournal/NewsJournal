The bank is also “widely seen as an arm of the Russian secret service ” according to nine US senators in 2019.Without its funds  frozen under sanctions imposed in the wake of the Russian-Ukrainian war  “the bank is at risk of insolvency or will be forced to restructure its bonds as early as May 2023 ” EURACTIV’s partner Telex reports.“I don’t know if it is possible to save the bank ” which is “in an extremely difficult situation ” Gergely Gulyás  Minister of the Prime Minister’s Office  said during a press conference on February 25.A senior bank executive sent a letter to the management in mid-December declaring that the Belgian financial firm Euroclear blocked IIB’s funds after the EU sanctions packages and predicted “such a severe shortfall for the first quarter of this year that even the sale of the loan portfolio would not be enough to make up for it.”In October 2022  the Belgian Finance Ministry blocked the release of funds  arguing that several members of the bank’s board of directors ‘have links with the Russian government  which has a controlling influence on IIB’.A letter retrieved during a cyber-attack on the bank on 17 February revealed that Hungarian Minister of Economic Development Márton Nagy lobbied the Belgian Minister of Finance to unblock IBB’s funds  with no success.Neither Márton Nagy nor the Belgian Finance Ministry commented on the letter by the time of publication.

(""FCTec"") to establish a new manufacturing facility for hydrogen and methanol fuel cells and further market development in India. The signing took place during the meeting between the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi and fulfills the strategic framework of the ""National Green Hydrogen Mission"" initiated by Prime Minister Modi  which envisages a clean energy supply and CO 2 reduction in India.In order to meet the legal and regulatory requirements of the ""Make in India"" legislation  SFC Energy establishes the subsidiary SFC Energy India Ltd. In the future  it will be responsible for the manufacturing of EFOY Hydrogen and EFOY Methanol fuel cells and quality assurance  while FCTec will continue to be SFC's ""Go To Market"" partner. In this role  FCTec will be responsible for the design  development  installation  and integration of custom fuel cell solutions  as well as the development of other key peripheral system components for such solutions and after-sales service. SFC Energy India will be located in Udyog Vihar  Gurgaon  in the high-tech zone of the Indian capital region Greater Delhi. There  the new subsidiary  together with FCTec  will move into a 35 000-square-meter state-of-the-art manufacturing and assembly center becoming one of the first and most advanced production facilities for fuel cells in India. This makes SFC Energy and FCTec pioneers for this technology nationwide. The construction of the manufacturing facility will take place in several phases.To underline the strategic importance of the partnership  SFC Energy India and FCTec have agreed on a mutual equity participation of the local companies. The corporate integration as well as the joint plans for the future are thus intended to meet the requirements of the ""Make in India"" initiative  which aims to stimulate investment in India  promote innovation  build competencies  protect intellectual property  and create a first-class production infrastructure in the Indian market  which is highly interesting for both partners.India has formulated ambitious climate protection targets and wants to reduce its CO 2 emissions by 45% by 2030 compared with 2005. The country aims to become climate neutral by 2070. At the same time  the Indian government wants to ensure an independent and sustainable energy supply and guarantee the protection of public health. In order to consistently achieve these goals  the (diesel/gasoline) generators currently in use are to be replaced by fuel cells in the transportation  military and critical infrastructure sectors  including telecommunications  among others. In perspective  decentralized fuel supply with green hydrogen and methanol is decisive and planned for all projects in India. The Indian government's ""National Green Hydrogen Mission""  for example  is a broad-based support program with an estimated investment of USD 44 billion by 2030. Similarly  low-end methanol fuel cells are ideal for numerous mission-critical energy applications in the core target markets of video surveillance  telecommunications  defense  homeland security  and oil  gas and mining.""We have been active in the Indian market since 2016  are familiar with the local requirements and needs  and are working successfully and trustfully with FCTec there. For us  India has enormous growth potential and is therefore of great strategic importance for SFC Energy's expansion. The step to open a site in the most populous country in the world is therefore only logical and with FCTec we have the right partner at our side at the right time. With this important step for our company  we want to further expand our business in Asia with India as our core market and to better exploit the potential through customer proximity. We are also benefiting from the clear political will of the Indian government to massively promote the production of clean energy and the reduction of CO 2 emissions. We can contribute to this with our fuel cells  for example  to replace the diesel generators that are widely used in India. The opening in Gurgaon is therefore also a strong signal in the global Race-to-Zero "" says Dr. Peter Podesser  CEO of SFC Energy AG.""We have been developing and marketing methanol fuel cells based power solutions for more than seven years  making us one of the first fuel cell companies in India. In 2022  we added hydrogen fuel cells to our portfolio. Manufacturing energy solutions including fuel cells in India is part of our long-term strategy that will position us as one of the market leaders in the fuel cell segment in India. Our Prime Minister  Narendra Modi  and the Indian government have set a goal to significantly reduce carbon emissions through technological innovation. This  along with recent policies and initiatives  has given a huge boost to small startups like FCTec. Hydrogen fuel cells will be one of the key components of India's hydrogen economy  and we are very excited to be part of the upcoming clean energy revolution. This is because our fuel cells can be used as solution components to replace the diesel/gasoline generators that are widely used in India "" says Colonel Karandeep Singh (retired)  the founding Director of FCTec.For more information on SFC Energy's Clean Energy and Clean Power Management solutions  visit sfc.com.About SFC Energy AGSFC Energy AG is a leading provider of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions.

These include new analysis from the long-term extension study evaluating the safety and efficacy of filgotinib in UC for nearly four years; an analysis of the prolonged benefit of filgotinib in UC; an analysis exploring factors associated with the partial Mayo Clinic Score (pMCS) over time; and analysis of the effect of filgotinib on anaemia in UC patients.Additionally  Galapagos will present pooled data from five Phase 2/3 trials  and two long-term extension trials of filgotinib designed to further understand the safety profile of filgotinib in UC and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).“We are excited to present data from multiple studies of filgotinib in UC  including results from the SELECTIONLTE study  which has been selected amongst the top 11 oral abstracts at ECCO ” said Daniele D’Ambrosio  MD  PhD  Therapeutic Area Head  of Immunology  at Galapagos. “These presentations capture our broad range of research and commitment to the IBD community and underscore our mission to improve patients’ lives by targeting diseases with high unmet needs.”Data from the SELECTIONLTE study showed that filgotinib 200mg maintained symptomatic remission and HRQoL for up to approximately four years. Amongst subjects who completed the study  the reduction in mean pMCS in SELECTION was maintained up to LTE Week 144. In non-responders  mean pMCS decreased from LTE baseline to Week 192. The results also showed that a high proportion of completers (>80% of patients) and non-responders (>70% of patients) achieved remission according to the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire1.The safety profile of filgotinib 200mg in the SELECTIONLTE study was generally consistent with the safety profile observed in previous SELECTION studies  with no new safety signals observed.“For healthcare professionals treating patients with this debilitating disease  the results from the SELECTION studies provide an understanding of filgotinib’s long-term outcomes and help make the most appropriate choices for their patients ” said Dr. Brian G. Feagan  MD  FRCPC  Professor of Medicine  Epidemiology and Biostatistics  Western University  London  Ontario  Canada and lead investigator of the SELECTION trial. “This latest data reinforces the positive long-term safety and efficacy profile of filgotinib  indicating its potential to be an important treatment option for people living with moderate to severe UC.”Galapagos is also hosting a hybrid symposium: ‘Journey to comprehensive disease control in UC’ on Thursday 2 March 2023 from 18:45-19:45 CET  which will feature experts’ perspectives on what matters most to patients  and how to raise the bar when treating patients with UC. The symposium will include a mix of classical plenary lectures  including tackling challenges and misconceptions  sharing of real-world practical experience in the management of patients with UC  and the place of JAK inhibition in clinical practice.Key Abstracts:Abstract title Authors Presentation date/time Efficacy and safety outcomes up to ~4 years of treatment with filgotinib 200mg among patients with Ulcerative Colitis: Results from the SELECTION LTE study Brian Feagan   Katsuyoshi Matsuoka  Gerhard Rogler  Margaux Faes  Alessandra Oortwijn  Angela de Haas  Christine Rudolph and Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet Oral presentationPresentation number: OP35Presentation date  time & location: Saturday 4 March 2023  09:50-10:00  Plenary HallSession name: Sequencing in IBD - Scientific Session 10: Evolving goals Prolonged benefit of filgotinib in patients with Ulcerative Colitis in SELECTION David Laharie   Andreas Sturm  Taku Kobayashi  Takayuki Matsumoto  Alessandra Oortwijn  Corinne Jamoul  Margaux Faes  Angela de Haas and Séverine Vermeire Poster presentationPresentation number: P690Presentation date  time & location: Friday 3 March 2023  12:30-13:30  Poster Exhibition  Hall B5&6 Factors associated with partial Mayo Clinic Score over time in patients with Ulcerative Colitis treated with filgotinib in the phase 2b/3 SELECTION trial Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet   Edouard Louis  Tadakazu Hisamatsu  Corinne Jamoul  Eva Santermans  Kristina Harris  Angela de Haas  Alessandra Oortwijn and Brian Feagan Poster presentationPresentation number: P736Presentation date  time & location: Friday 3 March 2023  12:30-13:30  Poster Exhibition  Hall B5&6 Effect of filgotinib on anaemia in patients with Ulcerative Colitis in SELECTION Roberta Loveikyte   Angela de Haas  Alessandra Oortwijn  Bart Eskens  Corinne Jamoul  Karine Muller and Andrea E. van der Meulen-de Jong Poster presentationPresentation number: P393Presentation date  time & location: Friday 3 March 2023  12:30-13:30  Poster Exhibition  Hall B5&6 Thromboembolic and major adverse cardiovascular events among patients in the filgotinib clinical trial programme C Janneke van der Woude   Stefan Schreiber  Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet  Zoltán Szekanecz  Ernest HS Choy  Pieter-Jan Stiers  Paul Van Hoek  Katrien Van Beneden  Angela de Haas  Christine Rudolph and Hugo ten Cate Poster presentationPresentation number: P520Presentation date  time & location: Friday 3 March 2023  12:30-13:30  Poster Exhibition  Hall B5&6 Investigating the symptom burden among European patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease using a real-world survey Johan Burisch  Ailsa Hart  Andreas Sturm   Hannah Knight  Christine Rudolph  Rachael Meadows  Alessandra Oortwijn  Sarah Weatherby  Roger Rolph  Fatima Dawod and Alessandro Armuzzi Poster presentationPresentation number: P624Presentation date  time & location: Friday 3 March 2023  12:30-13:30  Poster Exhibition  Hall B5&6About ulcerative colitisUC is a debilitating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that occurs as a result of an abnormal immune system response. Across Europe an estimated 2.5 - 3 million people2 are affected by IBD  which includes UC and Crohn’s disease (CD). UC is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by periods of flare ups followed by remission. In addition to the physical impact from flare ups  there is also a psychological impact associated with UC. It causes significant impairments on quality of life and a poor prognosis is often seen in patients with symptoms of moderate to severe UC at diagnosis.About the SELECTION clinical programThe SELECTION program comprised of SELECTION and the associated long-term extension study (SELECTIONLTE).The SELECTION Phase 3 study was a multi-center  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the preferential JAK1 inhibitor filgotinib in adult patients with moderate to severe active UC. The SELECTION study (NCT02914522) comprised of two induction trials and a maintenance trial. Induction Study A enrolled biologic-naïve patients and Induction Study B enrolled biologic-experienced patients. A majority of the patients included in the SELECTION study (n=1348) had a pMCS of 9 or higher at baseline  and 43% of biologic-experienced patients (n=297/689) had an insufficient response to a TNF antagonist and vedolizumab as well.3The primary objectives of the SELECTION clinical program were to evaluate the efficacy of filgotinib compared with a placebo in establishing clinical remission as determined by the Mayo endoscopic sub-score  rectal bleeding sub-score  and decrease in stool frequency from baseline. Patients who completed the induction and maintenance studies  patients who were not responders at Week 10  and patients with disease worsening during the maintenance study were enrolled in the ongoing SELECTIONLTE study (NCT02914535) to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of filgotinib in patients suffering from UC. An interim report of SELECTIONLTE assessed the safety and efficacy of open-label filgotinib through to Week 144 in completers and through to Week 192 in non-responders  respectively.About filgotinibFilgotinib is marketed as Jyseleca® in Europe and Japan for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe active RA who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs.

19337,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4582219-vopak-still-trading-at-fcf-yield-of-almost-10-percent,Vopak: Still Trading At A FCF Yield Of Almost 10% (OTCMKTS:VOPKF),Vopak's (VOPKF) second half of 2022 was stronger than I had anticipated  and it is guiding for further growth. See why I'm bullish on the stock.,VanderWolf-Images/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionBack in August  I was very surprised to see the market punishing Vopak (OTCPK:VOPKF) (OTCPK:VOPKY) for what I thought was a robust set of results for the first semester of the year. I was scratching my head to understand the market’s reaction as the underlying sustaining free cash flow (the free cash flow excluding growth investments) was still pretty strong and for sure didn't warrant the weak share price.We are now just over six months later and the stock is up about 30% (in Euro. It’s up almost 40% in USD but as Vopak’s primary listing is in Euro  it’s only fair to use that as the base currency) thanks to a gradual share price increase in the second half of last year. Vopak recently released its financial results for 2022 and that gives me a good excuse to fine-tune my thesis.Yahoo FinanceVopak is a Dutch company and its listing on Euronext Amsterdam is a better option than its OTC listing. The ticker symbol in Amsterdam is VPK  and with an average daily volume of approximately 250 000 shares  the Amsterdam listing clearly offers the most liquid listing. Additionally  there are options available.The full-year results are now in  and they compare favorable to my expectationsAs this article is meant as an update to previous articles  feel free to check the older articles to get a better understanding of how the storage and terminal company works.Vopak reported a total revenue of 1.43B EUR in the financial year 2022  which is an increase of more than 10% compared to the preceding year. While the operating expenses increased by in excess of 45%  it’s important to note this is mainly related to the impairment charges which increased from 71M EUR to 449M EUR. Excluding these impairment charges  the 2021 operating expenses would have come in at around 960M EUR versus the 1.06B EUR in FY 2022. This actually means the underlying margins were very stable as the adjusted EBIT margin  which was almost 38% in FY 2021 came in at 37% in 2022 and that difference was attributable to the slightly lower result from joint ventures and associates.Vopak Investor RelationsI discussed the reason for those impairment charges in my previous article so I’d recommend you to read up on this element there. I was also a bit worried to see the ‘other operating expenses’ increase from 286M EUR in FY 2021 to 356M EUR in FY 2022 (an increase of almost 25%) but according to the footnotes this was mainly related to higher energy expenses. As the cost of energy has come down  I expect Vopak to be able to reduce its ‘other operating expenses’ this year.Vopak Investor RelationsIn the August article  I focused on Vopak’s free cash flow performance. Not in the least because the impairment charges are obviously hiding the underlying strength of the company. That also is why you shouldn’t be too worried about the reported net loss of 138M EUR and a net loss of 168M EUR attributable to the shareholders of Vopak. The EPS of a negative 1.34 EUR is irrelevant due to that impairment charge as the company even had to include a tax bill on a negative pre-tax income. This was related to some non-deductible expenses but mainly to the derecognition of tax losses and tax credits.The cash flow statement paints a more clear picture. The starting point of the cash flow statement (see later) was the ‘cash flows from operating activities’ of 872M EUR  but I first wanted to see the details on that.And as you can see below  the 872M EUR includes the dividends received from JVs and associates  but excludes the net finance expenses and the tax payments.Vopak Investor RelationsThat doesn’t have to be an issue as those are subsequently deducted from the 898M EUR. After deducting the amount of taxes that were actually paid and adding the total amount of interest received  Vopak posted an operating cash flow of 825M EUR.Vopak Investor RelationsSounds great  but from that amount we still need to deduct the lease payments (41M EUR)  the interest and finance payments (129M EUR) and the 33M EUR dividend payment to non-controlling interests. The underlying operating cash flow was 622M EUR.The investing cash flows show a total capex of 386M EUR but Vopak does a great job in dividing the total capex in sustaining capex and growth capex. We see Vopak spent about 95M EUR on growth  and the sustaining capex was just 273M EUR. I will also include the intangible capex and will thus use 291M EUR as sustaining capex. That’s in line with the total depreciation and amortization expenses. The underlying free cash flow was 331M EUR. Divided over 125.4M shares outstanding  the free cash flow result was approximately 2.64 EUR per share. Which means that even at the current share price and after the recent share price increase  Vopak is still trading at a free cash flow yield of 9% which is pretty attractive.Meanwhile  the company continues to invest in non-oil applications. As you can see below  the percentage of the capital employed in oil-related services continues to decrease.Vopak Investor RelationsAdditionally  Vopak has steadily been increasing the average contract duration rate. Right now  about a third of the revenue is locked in with contracts that last for at least 10 years and about 45% of the revenue comes from contracts with a remaining term of at least five years.Vopak Investor RelationsOne of the main risks I see is the interest rate risk. Fortunately Vopak has a strongly diversified debt repayment schedule.Vopak Investor RelationsI’m not too worried about the interest rate risk though. As you can see below  the vast majority of the debt has a fixed interest rate and there’s just a relatively small portion of floating rate debt. And sure  fixed rate debt will have to be refinanced one day but considering Vopak’s average cost of debt is already almost 4%  I think the total impact will be pretty benign. Even if Vopak needs to start paying 6% (which I don’t think will happen)  the free cash flow will be impacted by just 40M EUR per year (assuming an average tax rate of 20%).Vopak Investor RelationsIt's all looking pretty good and for 2023 Vopak is guiding for an EBITDA of 910-950M EUR. Considering the FY 2022 EBITDA was ‘just’ 887M EUR  Vopak expects its EBITDA to increase by 3-7%. And considering the interest expenses won’t increase by much  the operating cash flow will likely increase by 20-25M EUR  using the midpoint of the EBITDA guidance.Vopak Investor RelationsInvestment thesisI put forward 30 EUR as initial target when my August article was published and I sold my entire position for an average profit of around 30% in six months. I was happy with that performance but I do have to admit Vopak performed better than I had expected while its guidance for FY2023 is better than expected as well. Using the midpoint of the EBITDA guidance  I expect the sustaining free cash flow (excluding growth investments) to increase to 2.85 EUR per share and that makes the current share price still reasonable. And in hindsight  I should have held on to the stock as the increased dividend of 1.30 EUR per share offered a 6%+ dividend yield on my average purchase price in the low-20s.I won’t buy at these levels (despite the implied 9.5% free cash flow yield). But I may write a fresh series of out of the money put options in an attempt to establish a position at a lower share price again. And I would for sure be a buyer on any weakness.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

19338,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4582512-proximus-is-a-hold-for-now,Proximus Is A Hold For Now (OTCMKTS:BGAOF),Revenue has started to grow again for Proximus and its balance sheet is relatively strong. Click here to read my analysis of BGAOF stock and why it's a hold.,energyyRecently I was given the assignment to provide a valuation for Proximus (OTCPK:BGAOF) (OTCPK:BGAOY) for University. After doing due diligence I think that the company is a hold. In this article  I lay down the case for Belgium’s largest Telco.The companyProximus is a digital company that is active in the telecom  network  and digital services industry. The company’s primary market is Belgium from which it generates approximately 75% of its revenue through the Proximus  Mobile Vikings  and Scarlet brands. It has a market share of approximately 45% in the broadband market and 30% in the post-paid mobile market. Proximus also has an international division operating under two brands: BICS and Telesign.BICS is active in digital communications  cloud communications  roaming  and IOT among others  and is aimed at telco operators  xVNOs  enterprise software providers  and global enterprises. It acquired 100% ownership in BICS in 2021 and since then has grown its margin in Euros by approximately 18%. The company expects this part of the business to continue to grow significantly due to enterprise digitalization (cloud communication)  alternative roaming services (such as eSim)  and the internet of things.BICS business overview (Proximus)Telesign is active in digital identity (which includes fraud prevention  and financial risk) and programmable communication (which includes two-factor authentication  and reminders). The company acquired full ownership together with BICS and has since then increased its margin by 40%.Telesign & BICS margin improvement (Proximus)The acquisitions of BICS and Telesign were made to make the business more asset-light and in the case of Telesign to profit from the strong growth trend. Due to the lower capital intensity  the international segment should become a larger percentage of the company’s EBITDA. The acquisition  in combination with the improvements made in its original business  has reversed the downtrend in the company’s revenue.Proximus revenue growth (Tikr.com)This hasn’t led to an increase in free cash flow as the company has spent a significant amount of money on CAPEX. During its latest capital markets day the company said that it expects CAPEX expenses to remain elevated until 2024. During the capital markets day  the company also mentioned that it will cut its dividend by 50% in 2024  which probably makes the company less interesting for dividend investors.The company did this to lower its net debt to EBITDA ratio  which it expects to be between 2.5 and 3x in 2024. The current net debt to EBITDA ratio is around 1.8x  but as a result of the aforementioned EBITDA will be lower and thus the ratio will be higher. Nevertheless  I am not worried about the company as peers have similar ratios.Proximus net debt to EBITDA (Tikr.com)ValuationBefore investing in a stock  it is critical to have a general idea of its valuation. Although a company's valuation should not be the only reason investors invest in something  it can serve as a guideline for when to invest in or sell shares of the company. I prefer to use a combination of methods  including a DCF model with a perpetual growth rate and an exit multiple  as well as a multiples analysis.Discounted cash flowsI like to use multiple scenarios when creating a DCF. I use scenarios because creating a DCF involves many assumptions. You can see how the inputs affect the share price by running multiple scenarios. I use analyst-estimated revenue growth (data from TIKR) and COGS based on COGS over the previous three years  slightly adjusted based on my expectations. For Proximus this leads to the following assumptions:Assumptions revenue and COGS (author)To calculate the present value  we must discount future cash flows to today. To do so  I use the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) method  which is based on the company's beta  my minimum required rate of return  a risk-free rate (in this case  treasury rates)  the company's cost of equity (based on the CAPM)  and cost of debt (based on interest payments and value of debt). For Proximus this leads to the following WACC. Do note that I use a mixture between current interest rates (5.81% for BBB+) and previous rates which leads to a cost of debt of 5%.WACC calculation Proximus (author)For the perpetuity growth method  I use a growth rate of 0%. I use this to err on the side of caution. Telecom operators haven't shown much growth in the past few years and I don't expect this to change. This leads to a price target of €13.62.For the exit multiple  I like to use the average EV/EBITDA of the company. For Proximus  I used a multiple of 3 which is less than the mean over the past 5 years. The reason for this is that a lot of people buy defensive companies such as telecom operators for their dividends  something Proximus is planning to cut significantly. This leads to an estimate of €12.23.MultiplesFor the multiples  I used the price-to-sales multiple  the EV/Revenue  and dividend yield multiples. For the price-to-sales  I used a multiple of 0.8 based on the past 5 years but adjusted downwards given the current environment of high rates  and the upcoming dividend cut. This leads to a price target of €14.67.For the EV/Revenue I used a multiple of 1. This is close to what it is currently trading for but lower than the average over the past five years. Here the same argument applies as to the other multiples. This leads to a price target of €8.30.For the dividend yield multiple I have adjusted the dividend to the new dividend which is €0.60 per share or 50% lower than the current. The average dividend multiple of the company over the past 5 years was 7.72%  but currently  it is almost double that. I expect the company to trade at a slightly lower rate once the dividend has been cut and use a multiple of 7.5%. This leads to a price target of €8.If all the price targets are combined this leads to a price target of €11.36 or approximately 30% above the current share price of €8.66. Do note that I have used a very conservative forecast and that valuation is an art and not a science  your price target might differ significantly from mine.CatalystsIncreased use of softwareOne of the things the company is working on is increasing its reliance on software. One of the steps it has taken is acquiring full ownership of Telesign as mentioned before  but it has also created a Neobank  a telehealth app  and a parking app  among other things. If the company is able to grow these segments its revenue could see additional growth and the business will likely be rerated higher. These software developments are still in their early innings so this catalyst will need some time to come to fruition.CapabilityAnother thing that the company has been working on is increasing its technology and capabilities. In the most recent spectrum auction in Belgium  the company acquired half of the available spectrum for a total consideration of €600 million. The company will have the rights for the spectrum for the next 20 years  which could lead to better service for its customer and could allow the company to increase its market share.Besides the increase in spectrum  the company has also worked on increasing its fiber network and surpassing the competition in terms of technology. The company has done this very well and is the first company in Belgium to offer fiber networks whereas other companies still offer coax networks. This means that it is the only company in Belgium to currently offer speeds to up to 10 GB. This could further increase the market share as people that work from home or like to play games  might opt for the faster connection.RisksAs with any investment  there are risks to consider when investing in Proximus. Underneath I will elaborate on two risks but it is important to also conduct your own due diligenceMajority ownership by the Belgian GovernmentProximus is majority owned by the Belgian government which can both be beneficial and risky. The huge ownership can be bad news for other shareholders as the government will always have a majority and can push through certain agenda items that are not beneficial for the other shareholders  but might be beneficial for the country. Additionally  last year the Belgian government talked about changing legislation to make it easier to elect a board member of their choosing. This came after a failed election in another state-owned company bpost (OTCPK:BPOSF)(OTCPK:BPOSY).FX RiskProximus' main listing is on Euronext Brussels and is traded in Euros. A depreciating Euro could have a significant impact on your stock returns. Recently the USD has lost some ground compared to the Euro and from an FX perspective investing in Euro-denominated stocks is less attractive than it was a few months ago  but it is still near its 5-year high. If an investor is interested in buying Proximus  it is important to take into account the FX rate and  if deemed necessary  hedge against the depreciation of the Euro against the USD.Data by YChartsConclusionProximus is the largest telecom operator in Belgium with a market share between 35 to 45% depending on the market. The company has diversified its revenue streams in the past few years by acquiring full ownership of BICS & Telesign. Due to the acquisitions and improvements in the business revenue has reversed a downtrend in recent years. The company also has a relatively strong balance sheet compared to peers.In terms of valuation  the company currently trades at a discount of 30%. The increased focus on software  recent purchase of additional spectrum  and leadership in broadband should serve as catalysts moving forward  while large ownership stake of the Belgian government and FX risks might make the company less attractive.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

This transaction  which was carried out following a decision by the Company's shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on December 16  2022  took effect today.This consolidation will allow the Company to support a new stock market dynamic and reduce the volatility of the Safe share price  which is caused by its current low value.The 1 415 236 918 old Safe shares with a par value of €0.10 each (ISIN code: FR0013467123) were delisted from the Euronext Growth market on February 27  2023 before the opening of the market (their last day of trading being February 24  2023) and were replaced on the same day by 382 496 new Safe shares with a par value of €37 each (ISIN code: FR001400F1V2). The mnemonic code (ALSAF) remains unchanged.Shareholders holding a multiple of 3 700 old shares do not need to take any action or complete any formalities. These shares have been automatically consolidated by their financial intermediary  at the rate of one (1) new share for three thousand seven hundred (3 700) old shares.

The Board of Directors has again authorized the exercise of these securities  which had been suspended by the Board of Directors for the duration of the reverse split  with effect from February 28  2023.In addition  the Board of Directors meeting today also decided to adjust the number of shares allocated free of charge under the 2021 bonus share plan No. 2  so that as from March 1  2023  1 000 AGAs will give the right to 0.02703 new shares of the Company allocated free of charge.Reduction of the share capitalFollowing the reverse stock split  the Board of Directors of the Company decided today to proceed with a reduction of the share capital by reducing the par value of the Company's shares (the unit par value of each share is thus reduced from 37 euros to 0.10 euros and the share capital to 38 249.60 euros). This purely technical operation has no impact on the value of the Company's share price  nor on the number of outstanding shares. Thus  at the end of this operation  the Company's share capital is still composed of 384 496 ordinary shares  i.e. the number of shares making up the share capital following the above-mentioned reverse stock split.About Safe GroupSafe Group is a French medical technology group that brings together Safe Orthopaedics  a pioneer in ready-to-use technologies for spine pathologies  and Safe Medical (formerly LCI Medical)  a medical device subcontractor for orthopaedic surgery.

As a result  the capacity of power plants in development phase in the portfolio was up by more than 25% compared with December 31  2021.Portfolio monitoring provides the earliest indicator of HDF's value creation for both the Group and all project stakeholders. HDF estimates that it is able to generate revenues representing between 12% and 17% of the cost of construction during the development and construction phases  including provision of engineering services and supply of fuel cells during the power plant construction phase.Strong revenue growth in 2022Consolidated revenues for 2022 totalled €3.5 million versus €0.9 million in 2021.This includes €3.0 million recognised under the development contract for the Renewstable Barbados (RSB) project since February 2022  when the Rubis Group became RSB's majority shareholder.Invoicing issued by HDF in 2022 for project management assistance services for projects over which the Group retains control as of end of 2022  the impact of which is eliminated in the consolidated financial statements  amounted to €3.0 million in 2022. This value creation initially eliminated in the consolidated financial statements will be recognised indirectly through gains or losses on disposal of the investments when control is lost.Continuation of the development planThe Group reached a new milestone on 24 February 2023 by officially launching the construction of the Blanquefort plant for the mass production of high-power fuel cells. The plant is expected to start operating in 2024 and to contribute towards achieving the Group's ambitions.Damien Havard  Chairman and CEO of Hydrogène de France  said:“In line with our strategic plan  in 2022 we stepped up the drive to strengthen and structure our teams across all our regions. Having 48 experienced developers worldwide gives HDF the ability to implement its action plan. We have also made very concrete and material progress in all our regions this year. We are extremely keen and proud to see our projects supported at all levels and to make a tangible contribution to the energy transition.”ABOUT HDF ENERGYHDF Energy is a global pioneer in high-power hydrogen power plants.

A pre-submission meeting with the HAS is scheduled for March and the application for early access authorisation should be submitted shortly after with the aim of obtaining authorisation in the second quarter of 2023. This programme would allow patients hospitalised in France with a severe form of COVID-19 to access treatment with Sarconeos (BIO101)  which has been shown to reduce the risk of respiratory failure and early death by 44% in the positive phase 2-3 COVA clinical trial. Biophytis continues to prepare conditional marketing authorisation applications in Europe and in the US due to the health emergency.Stanislas Veillet  CEO of Biophytis  said: ""We aim to accelerate the availability of Sarconeos (BIO101) to hospitalized patients in France with severe forms of COVID-19 through an early access program that we will present to the HAS in the coming weeks. Sarconeos (BIO101) is a drug candidate that has been shown in the positive phase 2-3 COVA clinical trial to reduce the risk of respiratory failure and early death in these patients by 44%. We plan to file the application formally shortly after with the objective of obtaining approval to start this programme in the second quarter of 2023. In parallel  we are also preparing a conditional approval application due to the health emergency in Europe and the US.”The early access in France is granted by the HAS after the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) has given its opinion on the presumption of efficacy and safety. This is a system that allows the provision and early financial coverage  on an exceptional and derogatory basis  of certain medicinal products that meet an unmet medical need  that are likely to be innovative but have not yet been authorised in a therapeutic indication.About BIOPHYTISBiophytis SA is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the development of therapeutics aimed at slowing the degenerative processes associated with aging and improving functional outcomes in patients suffering from age-related diseases  including severe respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19.

Due to the tight market for Pyrum shares  Pascal Klein  CEO and largest single shareholder of the company  provided shares from his holdings for this purpose. The transaction was executed as an OTC transaction at a purchase price of EUR 60.00 per share and thus around 3% above the average value of the last five trading days on Xetra (EUR 58.05).Pascal Klein  CEO of Pyrum Innovations AG: “We are delighted that our very respected Chairman of the Supervisory Board has become even more invested in Pyrum. Alf Schmidt's financial commitment of around EUR 100 000 once again illustrates his firm belief in our business model and our huge potential to establish a sustainable circular economy for end-of-life tyres.”Pyrum Innovations AG  a pioneer in the sustainable recycling of end-of-life tyres based on its patented pyrolysis technology  has been listed on the Euronext Growth market segment of the Oslo Stock Exchange since 30 September 2021 and on the Scale market segment of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange since 30 March 2022. In addition to the founding partners Pascal Klein and Michael Kapf  the chemical group and cooperation partner BASF is also among the major shareholders with a current share of 7.9%. In addition  the tyre manufacturer Continental  among others  also participated in the IPO.The relevant notifications of Pyrum Innovations AG on directors' dealings pursuant to Art. 19 of the Market Abuse Regulation are available on the company's website at https://www.pyrum.net/en/investors/financial-releases/regulatory-announcements/.About Pyrum Innovations AGPyrum Innovations AG is active in the attractive recycling market for end-of-life tyres with its patented pyrolysis technology. Pyrum's pyrolysis process is energy self-sufficient and  according to the Fraunhofer Institute  saves significantly more CO 2 emissions than today's standard recycling processes for end-of-life tyres - especially compared to incineration in cement plants - and produces new raw materials such as pyrolysis oil  gas and recovered carbon black from the waste used as input materials. In this way  Pyrum closes the recyclable material loop and pursues a completely sustainable business model. As a pioneer  Pyrum Innovations AG was the first company in the end-of-life tyre recycling sector to receive REACH registration from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for the pyrolysis oil it produces. This means that the oil is recognised as an official raw material that can be used in production processes. In addition  Pyrum has received ISCC PLUS certification for the pyrolysis oil and the recovered carbon black. Both products are thus considered sustainable and renewable raw materials. These achievements have also been recognised by international experts in the tyre industry. For example  Pyrum won the Best Tyre Recycling Innovation category at the inaugural Recircle Awards and has been nominated for the “Grand Prix Mittelstand” (“Großer Preis des Mittelstandes”) from the German state of Saarland.https://www.pyrum.net/enContactIR.on AGFrederic HilkePhone: +49 221 9140 970Email: pyrum@ir-on.comPyrum Innovations AGDieselstr. 866763 Dillingen / SaarEmail: presse@pyrum.net,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.99,0.01,0.0,True,English,"['Pyrum Innovations AG', 'Supervisory Board', 'Chairman', 'shareholding', 'company', 'Best Tyre Recycling Innovation category', 'last five trading days', 'Euronext Growth market segment', 'life tyre recycling sector', 'Pyrum Innovations AG Dieselstr.', 'Scale market segment', 'attractive recycling market', 'IR.on AG', 'largest single shareholder', 'Oslo Stock Exchange', 'Frankfurt Stock Exchange', 'Market Abuse Regulation', 'recyclable material loop', 'European Chemicals Agency', 'ISCC PLUS certification', 'inaugural Recircle Awards', 'Grand Prix Mittelstand', 'Großer Preis', 'standard recycling processes', 'sustainable circular economy', 'official raw material', 'new raw materials', 'sustainable business model', 'sustainable recycling', 'tight market', 'production processes', 'life tyres', 'input materials', 'pyrum.net', 'Key word', 'Supervisory Board', 'Alf Schmidt', 'Pascal Klein', 'purchase price', 'average value', 'financial commitment', 'firm belief', 'huge potential', 'pyrolysis technology', 'founding partners', 'Michael Kapf', 'chemical group', 'cooperation partner', 'major shareholders', 'relevant notifications', 'pyrolysis process', 'Fraunhofer Institute', 'CO 2 emissions', 'cement plants', 'carbon black', 'REACH registration', 'international experts', 'German state', 'Frederic Hilke', 'pyrolysis oil', 'OTC transaction', 'current share', 'Pyrum shares', 'long-time Chairman', 'first company', '1,667 shares', 'EQS-News', 'Miscellaneous', 'shareholding', '19:00 CET', 'CEST', 'issuer', 'content', 'announcement', 'Dillingen', 'Saar', 'ISIN', 'CEO', 'holdings', 'purpose', 'Xetra', 'respected', 'end', 'pioneer', '30 September', '30 March', 'addition', 'BASF', 'manufacturer', 'Continental', 'others', 'IPO', 'directors', 'dealings', 'Art.', 'website', 'investors', 'financial-releases', 'incineration', 'gas', 'waste', 'way', 'ECHA', 'products', 'achievements', 'industry', 'example', 'Mittelstandes', 'Contact', 'Phone', 'Email', 'presse', '27']",2023-02-27,2023-02-28,marketscreener.com

Stefano Felici  Group Chief Executive Officer  said: ""The results achieved in 2022  confirm our competitive advantage  as result of our technological leadership and sharp focus on our customers  two pillars that will continue to be our priorities even in a particularly challenging year as 2023."" Consolidated Financial results as at December 31  2022 Consolidated revenues as at December 31  2022 were €549 million  up 40% compared to the same period of 2021  as result of a robust order backlog that confirmed the Group's leadership in its reference market. Consolidated EBITDA was €245 million  up 40% as a result of higher volumes with a margin of 45%. Margins  in line with the previous year  were affected by an increase in the cost of sales resulting from the inflationary pressure that impacted the cost of raw materials and research and development expenses. As at December 31  2022  the consolidated net financial position was positive for €403 million  compared to December 31  2021  when a positive consolidated net financial position of €135 million was recorded. This increase is mainly attributable to the cash generated from operating activities amounted to €207 million and to the proceeds from the listing amounted to €139 million. As at December 31  2022  capitalised capital expenditure amounted to €78 million and were related to the upgrading  modernisation and updating of production lines to meet the ever-increasing demand of the reference market  both in Italy and abroad  as well as research and development projects still in progress.

Via Cavalieri di Vittorio Veneto  2 23870  Cernusco Lombardone (LC) - Italy www.technoprobe.com On January 27  2023 the Board of Directors confirmed its intention to start the process of listing the Company's shares on Euronext Milan which is expected to be finalized by the end of 2023.In February 2023  due to the expected market contraction in 2023  a production capacity efficiency plan was launched at the subsidiary Microfabrica Inc.. The plan  already communicated to the social partners according to current local legislation  foresees a downsizing of around 100 units starting from the second quarter of 2023  both in the production and in the administrative/commercial sectors. According to the company  this plan will not lead to a contraction in production capacity which will be absorbed by other production sites as a result of the increase in processes automation. Business outlook The challenging macroeconomic context  significantly affected by international geopolitical tensions  fosters uncertainty  and remains critical with reference to main raw materials price increase and their availability  transport logistics and procurement. The geopolitical tensions between the United States and China relating to the trade restrictions on technological exports in Asia represent a further factor of instability in the semiconductor sector which will impact mainly in the first part of the current year  both by a general contraction in demand for consumers of devices such as smartphones and computers  as well as high inventory levels at major players in the industry. On the other hand  the automotive and industrial applications segments are expected to grow. Taking into account the results achieved as at December 31  2022  the Company expects a contraction in volumes in the first half of 2023 compared to the same period of the previous year; the entire semiconductor supply chain pick up is expected in the second half of 2023  driven by a general recovery in consumption and by the conclusion of the aforementioned de-stocking processes currently in progress. Therefore  the Board of Directors was decided to propose to the Shareholders' Meeting  to carry forward the profit for the year once the unavailable reserves have been adjusted. The decision to not distribute dividends is aimed at supporting the company's growth strategy. Rescheduling of Financial Calendar 2023 and notice of Shareholders' Meeting Rescheduling of Financial Calendar 2023 published on January 27  2023  the Company notifies that the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting which shall resolve on the approval of (i) the draft Statutory as at December 31  2022 and (ii) the Consolidated Annual Report as at December 31  2022 will be held on April 6  2023 instead of April 7  2023.

At this meeting  the shareholders were asked to vote on:- The implementation of a new legal structure with the transformation of the Company  previously incorporated as a public limited company  into a limited partnership with shares (S.C.A.) and  consequently  new governance;- Various customary resolutions for the purpose of carrying out possible financial transactions.Thanks to the mobilization of shareholders  the quorum was reached on the first call with 26.695% of voting rights present  represented or by correspondence. All the resolutions submitted to the vote were adopted.Thus  in order to legally reflect the commitment of its new management to the proper execution of its 2023 roadmap and to protect its activity in a crucial period of value creation  the transformation of the Company into a limited partnership with shares was decided and the new articles of association adopted. Pharnext Développement  a simplified joint-stock company controlled by Néovacs S.A. (FR00140077X1 - ALNEV)  will become the sole general partner of the Company and will be jointly and severally liable for the Company's debts.In terms of governance  Néovacs (represented by Hugo Brugière  CEO of Néovacs and current CEO of Pharnext) will become Chairman of Pharnext Développement  which will in turn become the managing partner of Pharnext. The supervisory board of Pharnext (incorporated as an S.C.A.) will be composed of the current members of the board of directors (with the exception of Hugo Brugière)  namely Joshua Schafer  Lawrence Steinman and James Kuo.In addition  following the delegation of powers granted by the general meeting of February 24  2023 under the terms of its 8th resolution  Pharnext Développement  as manager of the Company  has decided to reduce the capital due to losses by reducing the par value of the shares. Thus the Company's capital is reduced by an amount of 8 664 945.7851 euros  by reducing the par value of the 875 247 049 shares making up the capital from 0.01 euros to 0.0001 euros each  thus reducing the share capital to 87 524.7049 euros.Hugo Brugière said: ""Thanks to the shareholders present or represented  whom we would like to thank  we are now finalizing the legal organization that will allow us to serenely engage discussions with future financial  pharmaceutical or industrial partners. The fact that Pharnext is now a limited partnership is a guarantee of stability for these future partners. We will soon provide an update on the ongoing discussions with potential partners who were waiting to be confirmed on the governance level.The new Supervisory Board and I are now fully mobilized on the finalization of our Phase III clinical study  the results of which  if positive  should allow the launch of marketing operations as soon as the marketing authorization is obtained.""About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently without satisfactory therapeutic solutions. Pharnext has a first-in-class drug candidate  PXT3003  in development for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A)  a rare  debilitating  inherited peripheral neuropathy. PXT3003 benefits from orphan drug status in Europe and the United States. In 2018  PXT3003 completed a Phase III clinical trial  the PLEO-CMT trial  with encouraging topline results. This trial was followed by an open-label extension study  the PLEO-CMT-FU trial  with 120 patients continuing treatment with PXT3003. Long-term data suggest a sustained benefit  safety  and efficacy  after 5 years of total trial time. An international pivotal Phase III study of PXT3003  the PREMIER trial  is currently ongoing with 387 CMT1A patients enrolled. PREMIER topline results are expected in Q4 2023.

This transaction  which was carried out following a decision by the Company's shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on December 16  2022  took effect today.This consolidation will allow the Company to support a new stock market dynamic and reduce the volatility of the Safe share price  which is caused by its current low value.The 1 415 236 918 old Safe shares with a par value of €0.10 each (ISIN code: FR0013467123) were delisted from the Euronext Growth market on February 27  2023 before the opening of the market (their last day of trading being February 24  2023) and were replaced on the same day by 382 496 new Safe shares with a par value of €37 each (ISIN code: FR001400F1V2). The mnemonic code (ALSAF) remains unchanged.Shareholders holding a multiple of 3 700 old shares do not need to take any action or complete any formalities. These shares have been automatically consolidated by their financial intermediary  at the rate of one (1) new share for three thousand seven hundred (3 700) old shares. Shareholders who do not hold a number of old shares forming a multiple of 3 700 will automatically receive from their financial intermediary an indemnity corresponding to the fractional shares within thirty (30) days as from March 1  2023  i.e. at the latest on March 30  2023.For more information on the reverse split  shareholders are invited to consult the notice of reverse split published in the BALO N°5 of January 11  2023 and available on the Company's website (www.safeorthopaedics.com) and the press release published on January 12  2023 also available on the Company's website.Reminder of schedule of operations:Reverse stock split transactions End of the reverse stock split February 24  2023 First listing of the new shares February 24  2023 Record date for the delivery of the new shares February 28  2023 Allocation of the new shares March 1  2023 Management of the old shares forming fractional shares Start date of the compensation of fractional shares by the financial March 1  2023 Deadline for the indemnification of fractional shares by the financial intermediaries March 30  2023(included)Adjustment of the characteristics of the securitiesThe Board of Directors meeting today decided to adjust the exercise parity of the securities giving access to the Company's capital (BSA  BSPCE and OCA) by dividing it by 3 700 for all the securities. The Board of Directors has again authorized the exercise of these securities  which had been suspended by the Board of Directors for the duration of the reverse split  with effect from February 28  2023.In addition  the Board of Directors meeting today also decided to adjust the number of shares allocated free of charge under the 2021 bonus share plan No. 2  so that as from March 1  2023  1 000 AGAs will give the right to 0.02703 new shares of the Company allocated free of charge.Reduction of the share capitalFollowing the reverse stock split  the Board of Directors of the Company decided today to proceed with a reduction of the share capital by reducing the par value of the Company's shares (the unit par value of each share is thus reduced from 37 euros to 0.10 euros and the share capital to 38 249.60 euros). This purely technical operation has no impact on the value of the Company's share price  nor on the number of outstanding shares. Thus  at the end of this operation  the Company's share capital is still composed of 384 496 ordinary shares  i.e. the number of shares making up the share capital following the above-mentioned reverse stock split.About Safe GroupSafe Group is a French medical technology group that brings together Safe Orthopaedics  a pioneer in ready-to-use technologies for spine pathologies  and Safe Medical (formerly LCI Medical)  a medical device subcontractor for orthopaedic surgery.

The increase in new orders is partly driven by the acquisition of LPE  which experienced exceptionally strong orders in Q4  partially for delivery in the second half of 2023.Year-on-year revenue growth for the fourth quarter 2022 was 42% at constant currencies (48% as reported).Normalized gross profit margin of 46.9%  excluding PPA expenses in the fourth quarter 2022  was similar to 47.0% in the same quarter last year. Including PPA expenses  gross margin was 46.4% in Q4 2022.Normalized operating result for the fourth quarter 2022  excluding PPA expenses  improved from €131 million last year to €190 million this year driven again by strong revenue growth  which was partly offset by an increase in operating expenses.Net earnings included a non-cash reversal of €106 million of the Q3 impairment of ASMPT  to account for the partial recovery market valuation of the stake in ASMPT.Net earnings include a negative impact of €8 million (net of tax) relating to PPA expenses. Normalized net earnings for the fourth quarter 2022 were €142 million  up from €138 million in Q4 last year  and included a translation loss of €36 million compared to a translation gain of €7 million in Q4 2021 and a translation gain of €25 million in Q3 2022.Details of (estimated) amortization and earn-out expenses (PPA expenses) relating to the acquisition of LPE are found in Annex 2.Story continuesCOMMENT“ASM delivered a strong performance yet again in 2022. Revenue increased 33% at constant currency  our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Our ASM team went again the extra mile to meet customer requirements despite the challenging supply chain conditions in 2022 ” said Benjamin Loh  President and CEO of ASM. “In the fourth quarter  we realized revenue of €725 million  including record-high sales in the logic/foundry segment. As already announced on January 17  2023  Q4 revenue exceeded earlier expectations. This was driven by a further improvement in supply chain conditions  even though we continue to experience constraints in certain areas.Q4 bookings amounted to €829 million  driven by steady logic/foundry demand  and also record-high power/analog bookings. The latter included a solid contribution from LPE  which has been consolidated since October 3  2022. Supported by strong demand in the silicon carbide market  and taking into account persistent supply constraints  we expect LPE to generate revenue in excess of €130 million in 2023  up from our previous forecast of more than €100 million.For the full year  our revenue increased to a new record high of €2 411 million  led by strong growth in our ALD and Epi product lines. Operating profit increased by 29% to €632 million  even with significantly higher investment in R&D and SG&A. Excluding €314 million in cash spent on acquisitions  we generated free cash flow of €381 million  up 43% from 2021. In 2022  we continued with our focus on sustainability and we took important next steps by submitting our GHG measurements and targets for validation to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in Q4 2022.OUTLOOKASM started the year with a record-high order backlog of €1.7 billion. On a currency comparable level  we expect revenue for Q1 of €660 - 700 million  with a slight increase in Q2 revenue compared to this level. Based on the current visibility  we expect revenue in the second half of 2023 to remain at a healthy level  albeit somewhat lower than in the first half of 2023. Looking at the wafer fab equipment (WFE) market in 2023  logic/foundry spending on the most advanced nodes and automotive-related power/analog demand is expected to remain resilient. The reduction in memory spending is expected to continue in 2023  while demand for trailing-edge nodes in logic/foundry  especially consumer related is expected to soften. In total  the WFE market is forecasted to drop by a mid to high teens percentage in 2023  a level that we expect to outperform  supported by our strong positions in the leading-edge logic/foundry market  and also by the momentum of newly introduced product and applications.Taking into account ASM’s strong growth in the last years  in combination with continued solid growth opportunities  we need to further expand our capacity around the world  including the recently announced expansion of our innovation and manufacturing infrastructure in South Korea. As a result  we have decided to step up CapEx to a level of €150-200 million in 2023.LPE ACQUISITIONOn July 18  2022  ASM entered into a definitive agreement under which it would at closing acquire all of the outstanding shares of LPE  an Italian based manufacturer of epitaxial reactors for silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon. As announced in our press release of July 18  2022  the transaction was financed with a combination of cash  a conditional earn out  and 631 154 ASM shares (a combination of 580 000 treasury shares and 51 154 newly issued shares).The acquisition was completed on October 3  2022  and LPE is now a fully owned subsidiary and operates as a product unit under ASM’s Global Products organization.DIVIDEND PROPOSALASM will propose to the forthcoming 2023 Annual General Meeting on May 15 2023  to declare a regular dividend of €2.50 per common share over 2022  maintaining the same level of regular dividend paid over 2021 (€2.50 per common share).REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (RCF)In 2023  ASM converted its revolving facility into a Sustainability-Linked RCF aligned with the Sustainability-Linked Loan Principles by the Loan Market Association.Under the terms of the facility  the interest rate is linked to the achievement of long-term sustainability goals targeting gender diversity  net zero and value chain packaging reuse which are in line with ASM’s sustainability strategic focus. Achievement of these targets will impact the interest rate as the lenders will apply a discount on the existing margin or add a penalty to the existing margin depending on the sustainability achievement against the target.About ASM InternationalASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.
