The development bank has been previously described as “Putin…,The Budapest-based International Investment Bank (IIB)  which has almost 50% Russian and 25.27% Hungarian ownership  has used up nearly all of its liquidity reserves after being hit by EU sanctions.The development bank has been previously described as “Putin’s Trojan Horse” by the Hungarian opposition and has raised concerns domestically and internationally  especially in the United States. The bank is also “widely seen as an arm of the Russian secret service ” according to nine US senators in 2019.Without its funds  frozen under sanctions imposed in the wake of the Russian-Ukrainian war  “the bank is at risk of insolvency or will be forced to restructure its bonds as early as May 2023 ” EURACTIV’s partner Telex reports.“I don’t know if it is possible to save the bank ” which is “in an extremely difficult situation ” Gergely Gulyás  Minister of the Prime Minister’s Office  said during a press conference on February 25.A senior bank executive sent a letter to the management in mid-December declaring that the Belgian financial firm Euroclear blocked IIB’s funds after the EU sanctions packages and predicted “such a severe shortfall for the first quarter of this year that even the sale of the loan portfolio would not be enough to make up for it.”In October 2022  the Belgian Finance Ministry blocked the release of funds  arguing that several members of the bank’s board of directors ‘have links with the Russian government  which has a controlling influence on IIB’.A letter retrieved during a cyber-attack on the bank on 17 February revealed that Hungarian Minister of Economic Development Márton Nagy lobbied the Belgian Minister of Finance to unblock IBB’s funds  with no success.Neither Márton Nagy nor the Belgian Finance Ministry commented on the letter by the time of publication. Another document made public by the cyber-attack envisages the inclusion of Serbia and an increase in the Hungarian stake.The bank’s financial hardship is of concern for the Hungarian government  which  after Bulgaria withdrew from it in February  is now the only EU member state owner  next to Russia  Cuba  Mongolia  and Vietnam.(Max Griera with Telex | EURACTIV.com),negative,0.0,0.24,0.75,negative,0.0,0.09,0.91,True,English,"['Budapest-based Russian ‘spy bank', 'bankruptcy', 'The Budapest-based International Investment Bank', 'EU member state owner', 'nine US senators', 'Gergely Gulyás', 'Márton Nagy', 'Belgian financial firm', 'Belgian Finance Ministry', 'Russian secret service', 'EU sanctions packages', 'senior bank executive', 'Belgian Minister', 'financial hardship', '25.27% Hungarian ownership', 'liquidity reserves', 'Trojan Horse', 'Hungarian opposition', 'United States', 'Russian-Ukrainian war', 'difficult situation', 'press conference', 'severe shortfall', 'first quarter', 'loan portfolio', 'several members', 'Russian government', 'controlling influence', 'Economic Development', 'Hungarian stake', 'Hungarian government', 'Max Griera', 'development bank', 'Prime Minister', 'Hungarian Minister', '50% Russian', 'IIB', 'Putin', 'concerns', 'arm', 'funds', 'wake', 'risk', 'insolvency', 'bonds', 'May', 'EURACTIV', 'partner', 'Telex', 'Office', 'February', 'letter', 'management', 'mid-December', 'Euroclear', 'year', 'sale', 'October', 'release', 'board', 'directors', 'links', 'cyber-attack', 'IBB', 'success', 'time', 'publication', 'document', 'inclusion', 'Serbia', 'increase', 'Bulgaria', 'Cuba', 'Mongolia', 'Vietnam']",2023-02-28,2023-03-01,euractiv.com

(""Africa Oil""  ""AOC"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce its operating and consolidated financial results for the three months and the year ended December 31  2022  together with its 2023 Management Guidance. The Company is also pleased to provide a drilling update on its offshore interests in Namibia and Nigeria. View PDF version.HighlightsAnnounced in February 2022 that Venus 1-X well made a major light oil discovery  offshore Namibia. The Company has a 6.2% indirect interest through its shareholding in Impact Oil & Gas Limited and is the only publicly listed independent E&P company with an interest in Venus.Multi-well program in Namibia due to commence imminently  targeting up to four wells  to appraise the Venus discovery and to investigate a potential westerly extension of Venus on Block 2912.Multi-well infill drilling program on the Egina oil field  offshore Nigeria  has commenced.The Company received five dividends 1 totaling $250.0 million in 2022 from its shareholding in Prime  including one dividend of $37.5 million in Q4 2022.Cash balance at December 31  2022 of $199.7 million (end 2021: $58.9 million).During 2022 the Company returned $63.3 million to its shareholders through the share buyback program and the dividend policy.Africa Oil will maintain its primary focus on its Nigerian and Namibian Orange Basin assets and continues to work on optimizing and unlocking shareholder value in its other assets.Selected Prime's results net to Africa Oil's 50% shareholding*:Africa Oil President and CEO Keith Hill commented: ""2022 was a very positive year for Africa Oil with two notable achievements. The Venus oil discovery  offshore Namibia  has opened up a world-class petroleum basin. We are at the forefront of this exciting play through our interest in Venus and its possible westerly extension  as the only publicly listed Independent E&P company presenting investors with exposure to its potentially transformational upside; as well as through our twenty percent operated interest in Block 3B/4B that is on trend with Venus  and our indirect interest in the Orange Basin Deep block. The second notable milestone was the introduction of our base dividend policy and our first share buyback program. I am proud that on the back of a strong debt-free balance sheet and robust cash flows from Nigeria  we delivered on our promises and returned $63.3 million to our shareholders during 2022. We now have a busy and exciting period ahead of us and we can look forward to the upcoming transformational catalysts with three offshore rigs actively drilling on our assets.""Story continues__________________________________ * Important information: Africa Oil's interest in Prime is accounted for as an investment in joint venture.

The Company's consolidated financial statements  notes to the financial statements  management's discussion and analysis for the year ended December 31  2022 and 2021 have been filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) and are available on the Company's website (www.africaoilcorp.com).FINANCIAL POSITION AND EARNINGSThe operating income and loss primarily relates to the Company's share of profit from its investments in Prime amounting to $2.9 million for Q4 2022 and $146.6 million for 2022. These compare to share of profit from Prime during Q4 2021 of $56.1 million and during 2021 of $224.4 million.The Company recognized a net loss of $(182.2) million for Q4 2022 and a net loss of $(60.3) million for 2022  mostly due to non-cash impairments recognized by the Company and Prime during Q4 2022.Africa Oil recognized a non-cash impairment to its Kenyan intangible exploration assets of $170.6 million (2021: nil) due to continuing delays and uncertainties to the farm out process and the path to the final investment decision (""FID"") for Project Oil Kenya.The share of profit from the 50% investment in Prime for Q4 2022 was impacted by a non-cash impairment of $41.2 million net to AOC  recognized by Prime but partly offset by a deferred tax release of $20.6 million net to AOC. This resulted from the delay in the infill drilling program in OML 130 due to the late arrival of the rig and a reduction in the expected ultimate recovery of the Egina field following the incorporation of the results of the 4D seismic acquired in late 2021 and processed during 2022. Excluding these impairments  Africa Oil's adjusted net income for 2022 is $151.5 million or $0.32 per share.The Company ended Q4 2022 with cash of $199.7 million and a zero debt balance in comparison to cash of $58.9 million and a zero debt balance at the end of 2021. During the Q4 2022  Prime paid one dividend for $75.0 million with net payment to Africa Oil of $37.5 million  related to its 50% shareholding interest. The Company received five dividends from Prime during 2022 for a total amount of $250.0 million net to Africa Oil. Since the acquisition of a 50% shareholding in Prime in January 2020 for $519.5 million  the Company has received 15 dividends from Prime for a total amount of $650.0 million net to Africa Oil.On October 20  2022  the Company agreed amendments with its lending group  which will become effective on the renewal of OML 130 license. The undrawn standby corporate facility amount will be increased from $100.0 million to $200.0 million and can be drawn until October 20  2023. The maturity date has been extended to October 20  2025  from May 13  2024.PRIME'S Q4 2022 AND FULL-YEAR 2022 PERFORMANCEPrime's Q4 2022 average daily W.I. production was 21 300 boepd and economic entitlement production was 23 500 boepd (81% light and medium crude oil and 19% conventional natural gas)  net to Africa Oil's 50% shareholding in Prime. Its full-year 2022 average working interest production was 23 500 boepd and economic entitlement production was 25 600 boepd (82% light and medium crude oil and 18% conventional natural gas)  net to Africa Oil's 50% shareholding in Prime.

In Q4 2022 and 2022  Prime also recorded cash generated from operating activities before working capital of $58.5 million and $250.5 million respectively (Q4 2021 and 2021 - $74.4 million and $536.2 million respectively). 2022 has decreased primarily from additional tax payments of $148.5 million and in 2021 a net $152.5 million was received by Prime relating to the Agbami Securitization Agreement deposit.Prime's 2022 capital expenditure of $28.4 million (net to the Company's 50% shareholding) is about 48% lower than the 2022 Management Guidance midpoint of $55.0 million. The reduction is mostly due to the delay in the OML 130 drilling campaign  which has now commenced.2023 MANAGEMENT GUIDANCEThe Company's 2023 production will be contributed solely by its 50% shareholding in Prime. The 2023 Management Guidance includes W.I. production guidance range of 18 500-21 500 boepd and net entitlement production range of 20 500-23 500 boepd with approximately 82% expected to be light and medium crude oil and 18% conventional natural gas.Net entitlement production estimate is based on a 2023 Brent price of $80.9/bbl being the average of the Brent forward curves between November 15  2022  and January 15  2023. Net entitlement production is calculated using the economic interest methodology and includes cost recovery oil  tax oil and profit oil and is different from W.I. production that is calculated based on project volumes multiplied by Prime's effective W.I.Prime is expected to sell three cargoes during Q1 2023. The first cargo of the year was sold at spot with the second and third cargoes sold with an average fixed Dated Brent price of $76.1/bbl. Prime has 6 cargoes  scheduled between April and September 2023 with an average trigger price of $70.0/bbl. None of these triggers have been reached.Based on the above production and cargo lifting ranges and Prime's current 2023 forward sales program  the Company's management estimate Prime to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $250.0-$330.0 million net to the Company's 50% shareholding  before working capital adjustments.Any dividends received by the Company from Prime's operating cash flows and cash on hand will be subject to Prime's capital investment and financing cashflows  including Prime's RBL and PXF interest payments and principal amortization. Net to the Company's 50% shareholding  Prime's 2023 capital investment is expected to be in the range of $80.0-$100.0.Prime  net to AOC's 50% shareholding: 2023 Guidance 2022 Actuals WI production (boepd) 18 500-21 500 23 500 Economic entitlement production (boepd) 20 500-23 500 25 600 Cash flow from operations before working capital (million) $250.0-$330.0 $250.5 Expenditure on oil and gas properties (million) $80.0-$100.0 $28.42023 OUTLOOKManagement believe that the most impactful catalysts for the Company in 2023 are the Venus appraisal drilling results from Block 2913B and follow-on exploration on Block 2912  both located offshore Namibia. A multi-well program in Namibia is expected to commence imminently  targeting up to four wells (including the re-entry and side-track of the Venus-1X discovery well  in Block 2913B)  to appraise the Venus discovery and to investigate a potential westerly extension of Venus  the Nara prospect (previously referred to as West Venus) on Block 2912. AOC has an interest in this program through its 30.9% shareholding in Impact.Appraisal of Venus Discovery in Block 2913B (PEL 56)Drilling of Venus-1A  the first appraisal well on the Venus discovery  located approximately 13km to the north of the Venus-1X discovery well  is expected to spud imminently  using the Tungsten Explorer drillship. The Deepsea Mira semi-submersible drilling rig will then be used to conduct a drill stem test at this location. The Deepsea Mira will then re-enter the Venus-1X well and conduct a flow test. The objective of this program is to further evaluate reservoir and deliver dynamic data.Impact holds a 20% W.I. in PEL 56  which is operated by TotalEnergies who holds a 40% W.I. QatarEnergy and NAMCOR respectively hold a 30% and 10% W.I. in PEL 56. The Company's effective interest is 6.2%.Exploration and Potential Appraisal of Block 2912 (PEL 91)Block 2912 may contain a highly material extension of the Venus field. Operations by TotalEnergies during 2023  on behalf of the JV  are designed to drill an exploration well and  if successful  test this potential extension of the Venus accumulation into Block 2912 and provide an understanding of the structure and reservoir quality.TotalEnergies is expected to commence drilling operations in Block 2912 during mid-2023. Exploration well Nara-1X will be drilled and flow tested by the Tungsten Explorer and  if successful  an appraisal well  Nara-1A  will then be drilled and flow tested.Impact holds an 18.89% WI in PEL 91  which is also operated by TotalEnergies who holds a 37.78% WI. QatarEnergy and NAMCOR respectively hold 28.33% and 15% WI in PEL 91. The Company's effective interest is 5.8%.NigeriaOML 130 drilling campaign for 2023 has commenced with the spud of the first well on the Egina oil field. This is the first in a multi-well program that is planned for 2023 and it is the first major work program since AOC acquired a 50% shareholding in Prime. This is aimed at arresting the production decline.Prime and its upstream partners are currently working on the early conversion to the new Petroleum Industry Act (""PIA"") terms of OML 127 license. It is expected that the early renewal of OML 130   which accounts for most of the reserves  production and value in Prime's portfolio can be delivered this year. It is further expected that a successful early renewal of OML 130 could provide the basis for concurrent refinancing of Prime's RBL and PXF debt  that in turn could support Prime increasing cash available for distributions to its shareholders or re-investments in the near term.Early renewal of OML 130 could also facilitate the final investment decision for the Preowei oil discovery development project. Preowei oil field is to the north of Egina FPSO and is a low-risk development opportunity through a satellite subsea tie-back project to the Egina FPSO.Block 3B/4B  South AfricaThe Company has a 20% operated interest in Block 3B/4B offshore South Africa. This block is on trend with Venus and Graff oil discoveries (the Company has no interest in Graff) in the Orange Basin. The application to extend the Block 3B/4B license and to move into the first extension period of 2 years was approved on October 27  2022.The Company and its JV partners are progressing plans to conduct a two-well campaign on Block 3B/4B and are in discussions with various potential partners to farm out up to a 55% gross working interest in the Block. The JV Partners have selected a leading South African environmental consulting firm to conduct a comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment process in preparation for permitting and drilling activity on the Block.Equatorial GuineaThe Company announced on February 20  2023  that it has signed two production sharing contracts (""PSCs"") with the Republic of Equatorial Guinea for offshore Blocks EG-18 and EG-31. These PSCs are subject to ratification by the country's government. Africa Oil will hold eighty per cent (80%) operated interests in each block with the balance to be held by GEPetrol  the national oil company of Equatorial Guinea. GEPetrol has the option of acquiring an additional fifteen percent (15%) participating interest in each block. Both blocks are covered by 3D seismic data and the total minimum work commitment for both blocks in the initial exploration periods is a combined total of USD 7 million  with no drilling commitment.In Block EG-31 the Company has identified several gas-prone prospects in shallow water depths of less than 80 meters and close to existing infrastructure  including the offshore Alba gas field and the onshore Punta Europa Liquefied Natural Gas (""LNG"") Terminal.In Block EG-18 the Company has identified a potentially large and highly prospective basin floor fan prospect of Cretaceous age  that is similar to those within the Company's exploration portfolio in Namibia and South Africa.The Company will be focused on maturing the identified exploration targets with the aim of attracting strategic partners ahead of exploration drilling in the next few years.KenyaIn 2021  the Company and its partners initiated a farmout process for Project Oil Kenya. A successful farmout is viewed by the Company as a critical step towards the FID for Project Oil Kenya being achieved and is viewed as a condition to FID. Discussions with the interested parties have taken longer than expected and there is no guarantee that the Company can successfully conclude a farmout to new strategic partner(s) on favorable terms. As a result of this delay the Company has recognized an impairment to its carrying value for Project Oil Kenya.DividendsThe Company is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has declared the distribution of the Company's semi-annual cash dividend of $0.025 per common share. The dividend will be payable on March 31  2023  to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 13  2023. This dividend qualifies as an 'eligible dividend' for Canadian income tax purposes.Dividends for shares traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (""TSX"") will be paid in Canadian dollars on March 31  2023 however  all US and foreign shareholders will receive USD funds. Dividends for shares traded on Nasdaq Stockholm will be paid in Swedish kronor in accordance with Euroclear principles on April 4  2023. To execute the payment of the dividend  a temporary administrative cross-border transfer closure will be applied by Euroclear from March 9  2023  up to and including March 13  2023  during which period shares of the Company cannot be transferred between the TSX and Nasdaq Stockholm. Payment to shareholders who are not residents of Canada will be net of any Canadian withholding taxes that may be applicable.

Previous number of dividends and their amounts should not be taken as a guide for future dividends to be received by Africa Oil. Any dividends received by Africa Oil from Prime's operating cash flows will be subject to Prime's capital investment and financing cashflows  including payments of Prime's Reserve Based Lending (""RBL"") principal amortization  which are subject to semi-annual RBL redeterminations. The 50% shareholding in Prime is accounted for using the equity method and presented as an investment in joint venture in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Africa Oil's 50% share of Prime's net profit or loss will be shown in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income/Loss and Comprehensive Income/Loss. Any dividends received by Africa Oil from Prime are recorded as Cash flow from Investing Activities. The guidance presented here is for information only. Aggregate oil equivalent production data comprised of light and medium crude oil and conventional natural gas production net to Prime's W.I. in Agbami  Akpo and Egina fields. These production rates only include sold gas volumes and not those volumes used for fuel  reinjected or flared. Net entitlement production is calculated using the economic interest methodology and includes cost recovery oil  tax oil and profit oil and is different from working interest production that is calculated based on project volumes multiplied by Prime's effective working interest in each license. Earnings Before Interest  Tax  Impairment  Depreciation  Amortization and Exploration Expenses (""EBITDAX"") is not a generally accepted accounting measure under International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") and does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and  therefore  may not be comparable with definitions of EBITDAX that may be used by other public companies. This is used by management as a performance measure to understand the financial performance from Prime's business operations without including the effects of the capital structure  tax rates  DD&A  impairment and exploration expenses. Non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. A reconciliation from total profit (a GAAP measure) to EBITDAX (a non-GAAP measure) can be found on page 14 of the MD&A.

The information was submitted for publication  through the agency of the contact persons set out above  at 10:00 p.m. EDT on February 27  2023.Advisory Regarding Oil and Gas InformationThe terms boe (barrel of oil equivalent) is used throughout this press release. Such terms may be misleading  particularly if used in isolation. Production data are based on a conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet per barrel (6 Mcf: 1bbl). This conversion ratio is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1  utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value. Petroleum references in this press release are to light and medium gravity crude oil and conventional natural gas.Forward-Looking InformationCertain statements and information contained herein constitute ""forward-looking information"" (within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation).

To help you navigate in this virtual world  and at a time when the MoMA in New York  the LACMA in Los Angeles  and the Center Pompidou in Paris are opening their collections to digital art  Artprice suggests five ways to discover art that can be transferred from owner to owner in the form of NFTs.Weekly NFT Auction Proceeds Vs Ethereum Price Top 10 artists by NFT auction turnover (2021-2022)Weekly NFT Auction Proceeds Vs Ethereum PriceInfographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2010704/Weekly_NFT_Auction_Infographic.jpgTop 10 artists by NFT auction turnover (2021–2022)Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2010705/Top_10_artists_Infographic.jpg""Crypto-art is gradually entering museums and art history  but  for the time being  it is a form of artistic creation that is still very freely experienced on the Internet "" says Thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and founder of Artprice.""The crypto-art sphere is often described as operating like a 'community'; the more you invest in a project  the more qualitative information you receive.

The continuous way: following artists on TwitterDespite the many criticisms made of Twitter  Elon Musk's platform remains the royal road of Web3. Not only do digital artists use this channel to present their works as and when they are created  but they also relay the posts in which they – and all those they like – are quoted. Each page  therefore  contains countless dynamic links to other artists and other works  but also to collectors  curators  marketplaces  etc.To start with  one can follow any of the top performing NFT artists at auction that Artprice lists in its annual reports. The major auction houses are indeed doing valuable work by selecting NFT works that meet the same requirements as the traditional art market. But  as one thing leads to another in the digital world  and one artist leads to another  Twitter then makes it possible to continuously discover new works and new creators  but also to be the first to know about upcoming projects.Robbie Barrett:https://twitter.com/videodromeIX SHELLS: https://twitter.com/ix_shells2. The studious way: reading articles and interviewsThe decisions by Christie's  Sotheby's  Phillips  Bonhams but also Fauve  Van Ham  Millon  and many other auction operators to amply include NFT lots in their sales proves – even if it no longer needs to be proved – the seriousness of NFT technology and the artistic creation it allows. The most prestigious galleries  like Pace and Gagosian  have also understood this  yet few media dare to offer any real artistic critique of NFT projects. This work (art criticism)  so crucial to art history  would undoubtedly make a better appreciation of the approaches taken by digital artists and of their relationships to Blockchain technology  and to the 'communities' that support them.Faced with the multiplication of marketplaces  crypto-art needs space and time for reflection  to understand and digest innovative practices at the frontier of technology  as the projects of these artists gain in depth and intensity. Artprice offers two articles that capture the work of key digital artists in the NFT universe.Artforum : Hack the Planet  Hans Ulrich Obrist talks with Pak : www.artforum.com/print/202207/hans-ulrich-obrist-talks-with-pak-88907Right Click And Save: An Interview with XCOPY :www.rightclicksave.com/article/an-interview-with-xcopy3. The prospective way: surveying major collectionsTransparency is one of the main credos of the Blockchain and as such  it is possible to consult the collection to which each work belongs  to discover other works that the same entity collects... and so on. True  the real identity of collectors often remains anonymous or hides behind a pseudonym  and yes  NFTs can be transferred from one wallet to another to increase security and cover their tracks  but there is always a way to reconstitute their history.The most dynamic collectors have also become the true tutelary figures of crypto-art. Until museums and galleries become active in this universe  the major collectors of NFTs still have a very substantial influence  whether by sharing their favorites on social media  collaborating with artists  or exhibiting their collections in virtual universes or physical places as the prestigious Art Basel Miami or by offering them for sale via traditional auction houses.Cozomo di Medici: ""For over 700 years  we have loved the jpegs"":https://opensea.io/Cozomo_de_MediciMax Stealth: ""A Timeless Collection"":www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2022/inside-the-world-of-maxstealth-a-timeless-collection4. The traditional way: visiting physical eventsCrypto-art is now coming to public places  galleries  and museums. From the great hall of the MoMA to Times Square  digital art is gradually investing some of the biggest screens on the planet and some of the most prestigious museums. Advertising spaces and exhibition halls are coming together for the first time in history  no doubt  to show a new type of work  at the crossroads of art and technology  which sometimes looks a whole lot better on a big screen than on a smartphone or a laptop screen.At the same time  almost everywhere in the world  art fairs offer to investigate this universe more deeply and to experiment with digital creation in the best possible conditions. These events provide opportunities to meet the different players who form a real 'ecosystem' and to meet the 'community' which allows digital artists to largely bypass art galleries  and which brings together entrepreneurs  developers  collectors  and enthusiasts.NFT New York  April 12-14  2023 at Times Square and Hudson Yards:www.nft.nycPompidou Center: Presentation of the first NFT acquisitions on April 8  2023: www.centrepompidou.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/CP_NFT_Acquisition_fevrier_2023__1_.pdf5. The safe way: collect a first NFT workHowever… nothing replaces the experience of a first NFT acquisition. Not only does it force you to find a work that deserves to be purchased among the millions offered on platforms like opensea.io or objkt.com  but this process also requires you to complete an unusual transaction  to say the least. Although some platforms now offer payment in euros or dollars  the vast majority of them require the creation of a (free) electronic wallet  powered by cryptocurrency. This operation may seem complicated  but it is an integral part of the universe on which crypto-art is based and therefore of the experience it offers.In the absence of galleries  artists organize their own markets  choosing what  when  and how to put their works on sale  at what price  and in what quantity. Unique digital works (1/1) are the most sought-after  but larger editions offer a more affordable opportunity to collect pieces. Among the novelties of the NFT market  the Open Editions are particularly exciting  since these projects put an unlimited number of tokens on sale at a fixed price  but for only a few days or even a few hours...The information and econometric studies produced by Artmarket.com are presented uniquely for the purpose of analyzing and understanding the statistical realities of the art market and should in no way be considered as advice or a suggestion or a solicitation to invest in the art market.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image1-weekly-nft-auction-proceeds-vs-ethereum-price.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image2-artmarket-top-10-artists-by-nft-auction-turnover-2021-2022.png]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Not only does it force you to find a work that deserves to be purchased among the millions offered on platforms like opensea.io or objkt.com  but this process also requires you to complete an unusual transaction  to say the least.

Unique digital works (1/1) are the most sought-after  but larger editions offer a more affordable opportunity to collect pieces.

To help you navigate in this virtual world  and at a time when the MoMA in New York  the LACMA in Los Angeles  and the Center Pompidou in Paris are opening their collections to digital art  Artprice suggests five ways to discover art that can be transferred from owner to owner in the form of NFTs.Weekly NFT Auction Proceeds Vs Ethereum Price Top 10 artists by NFT auction turnover (2021–2022)Weekly NFT Auction Proceeds Vs Ethereum PriceInfographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2010704/Weekly_NFT_Auction_Infographic.jpgTop 10 artists by NFT auction turnover (2021–2022)Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2010705/Top_10_artists_Infographic.jpg""Crypto-art is gradually entering museums and art history  but  for the time being  it is a form of artistic creation that is still very freely experienced on the Internet "" says Thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and founder of Artprice.""The crypto-art sphere is often described as operating like a 'community'; the more you invest in a project  the more qualitative information you receive. This is how the Discord platform works  for example  which offers to create different more or less private chat rooms for each project. Some allow everyone to participate in the discussions  but the most interesting chat rooms are those reserved for collectors or founding members.""To give you the desire and the means to take part in this new artistic experience  which aims to bring together artists  collectors  graphic designers  developers  and many others  Artprice recommends five ways to dive into this universe and start your adventure.1. The continuous way: following artists on TwitterDespite the many criticisms made of Twitter  Elon Musk's platform remains the royal road of Web3. Not only do digital artists use this channel to present their works as and when they are created  but they also relay the posts in which they – and all those they like – are quoted. Each page  therefore  contains countless dynamic links to other artists and other works  but also to collectors  curators  marketplaces  etc.To start with  one can follow any of the top performing NFT artists at auction that Artprice lists in its annual reports. The major auction houses are indeed doing valuable work by selecting NFT works that meet the same requirements as the traditional art market. But  as one thing leads to another in the digital world  and one artist leads to another  Twitter then makes it possible to continuously discover new works and new creators  but also to be the first to know about upcoming projects.Robbie Barrett:https://twitter.com/videodromeIX SHELLS: https://twitter.com/ix_shells2. The studious way: reading articles and interviewsThe decisions by Christie's  Sotheby's  Phillips  Bonhams but also Fauve  Van Ham  Millon  and many other auction operators to amply include NFT lots in their sales proves – even if it no longer needs to be proved – the seriousness of NFT technology and the artistic creation it allows. The most prestigious galleries  like Pace and Gagosian  have also understood this  yet few media dare to offer any real artistic critique of NFT projects. This work (art criticism)  so crucial to art history  would undoubtedly make a better appreciation of the approaches taken by digital artists and of their relationships to Blockchain technology  and to the 'communities' that support them.Faced with the multiplication of marketplaces  crypto-art needs space and time for reflection  to understand and digest innovative practices at the frontier of technology  as the projects of these artists gain in depth and intensity. Artprice offers two articles that capture the work of key digital artists in the NFT universe.Artforum : Hack the Planet  Hans Ulrich Obrist talks with Pak : www.artforum.com/print/202207/hans-ulrich-obrist-talks-with-pak-88907Right Click And Save: An Interview with XCOPY :www.rightclicksave.com/article/an-interview-with-xcopy3. The prospective way: surveying major collectionsTransparency is one of the main credos of the Blockchain and as such  it is possible to consult the collection to which each work belongs  to discover other works that the same entity collects... and so on. True  the real identity of collectors often remains anonymous or hides behind a pseudonym  and yes  NFTs can be transferred from one wallet to another to increase security and cover their tracks  but there is always a way to reconstitute their history.The most dynamic collectors have also become the true tutelary figures of crypto-art. Until museums and galleries become active in this universe  the major collectors of NFTs still have a very substantial influence  whether by sharing their favorites on social media  collaborating with artists  or exhibiting their collections in virtual universes or physical places as the prestigious Art Basel Miami or by offering them for sale via traditional auction houses.Cozomo di Medici: ""For over 700 years  we have loved the jpegs"":https://opensea.io/Cozomo_de_MediciMax Stealth: ""A Timeless Collection"":www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2022/inside-the-world-of-maxstealth-a-timeless-collection4. The traditional way: visiting physical eventsCrypto-art is now coming to public places  galleries  and museums. From the great hall of the MoMA to Times Square  digital art is gradually investing some of the biggest screens on the planet and some of the most prestigious museums. Advertising spaces and exhibition halls are coming together for the first time in history  no doubt  to show a new type of work  at the crossroads of art and technology  which sometimes looks a whole lot better on a big screen than on a smartphone or a laptop screen.At the same time  almost everywhere in the world  art fairs offer to investigate this universe more deeply and to experiment with digital creation in the best possible conditions. These events provide opportunities to meet the different players who form a real 'ecosystem' and to meet the 'community' which allows digital artists to largely bypass art galleries  and which brings together entrepreneurs  developers  collectors  and enthusiasts.NFT New York  April 12-14  2023 at Times Square and Hudson Yards:www.nft.nycPompidou Center: Presentation of the first NFT acquisitions on April 8  2023: www.centrepompidou.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/CP_NFT_Acquisition_fevrier_2023__1_.pdf5.

A deal ""could yet come back for Allfunds  but there is no obvious time imperative.""A Deutsche Boerse spokeswoman declined to comment.RARE REVERSALEuronext had so far focused on snapping up national exchanges  most recently Borsa Italiana  to become a pan-European stock exchange  with bourses in Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon  Oslo and Paris.There are few European exchanges left for Euronext to buy  and further acquisitions could run up against competition constraints.ING analysts considered Euronext's indicative offer as too low.

The annual report  including the full financial report  will be published on the Company’s website on 24 March 2023.Patrice Sellès  Chief Executive Officer of Biotalys  stated: “Despite 2022 being a tumultuous year globally and across the agricultural industry  Biotalys achieved important milestones demonstrating the ability of its AGROBODY™ technology platform to develop innovative biocontrols at scale. We believe Biotalys’ strategy and focus are fully aligned with the dawn of a new crop and food protection era  addressing both European Green Deal targets for chemical pesticide reduction and the global need to safely and sustainably feed our world.”“The regulatory procedure for our first biofungicide Evoca is still ongoing. During our dialogue with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  we have learned that additional time is required to review all submitted data. We will continue to work closely with the Agency as it completes its review  now expected for Q3 2023  to bring this innovative technology into the hands of the growers.”Story continues2022 Ope rational H ighlights (including post-period r egulatory u pdate for Evoca)Throughout the year  Biotalys made significant headway in key areas to further develop its platform and pipeline.Biotalys solidified strategic partnerships with global leaders to prepare for the market calibration of Evoca  the Company’s first biofungicide:At the start of 2022  Biotalys partnered with Olon  a world-leading bioactive manufacturing organization  to significantly scale-up the production of the active ingredient of Evoca.Biotalys appointed Kwizda Agro  an established crop protection manufacturer  as formulator of its protein-based biocontrols – critical in the supply chain for high quality products  starting with Evoca.After entering into a partnership with Novozymes  a world leader in biotech solutions  to explore additional routes to scale efficient production of the bioactive protein of Evoca  Biotalys announced the results of its successful feasibility study in H2. The study identified new  cost-effective ways to further scale the Evoca active ingredient.Evoca continued to demonstrate its efficacy in our field trial program as future valuable tool for growers seeking more sustainable solutions to control devastating fungal diseases:The field trial results based on data from grapes across vineyards in diverse climates throughout California and New York demonstrated excellent preventative control of Botrytis bunch rot in grapevines.Evoca significantly outperformed a leading chemical product when positioned at the flowering stage of grapes in a fungicide rotation program.Wine grape juice quality  vinification and wine characteristics exhibited no differences for Evoca-treated vineyards compared to non-Evoca treated vineyards.Biotalys also achieved additional technology milestones for Evoca in 2022  including:Regulatory update for EvocaBiotalys submitted its regulatory dossier to the relevant authorities in both the U.S. (in December 2020) and the E.U. (in March 2021). In view of the progress made by these authorities as communicated to the Company  Biotalys is providing the following update: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is actively reviewing the regulatory dossier  and Biotalys has addressed all requests received by the EPA to date. The Company acknowledges the breakthrough nature of the protein-based biocontrol product requires more time than originally anticipated. The Company now expects to obtain the registration for Evoca in Q3 2023. As soon as obtained  the registration will allow the use of the product in selected fruit and vegetable crops. As a reminder  the first generation of Evoca represents a market calibration product that will not generate positive cashflow margins  but will enable the Company to create market demand and introduce growers to the new product in anticipation of a commercial  profit-generating version in 2026. In the E.U.  the Board for Authorisation of Plant Protection Products (College voor Toelating van Gewasbeschermingsmiddelen or Ctgb) in The Netherlands as Rapporteur Member State is currently reviewing the regulatory dossier that Biotalys submitted for the active ingredient of Evoca. Biotalys expects to obtain the first registration in the E.U. in 2025  opening a path to launching the commercial version of Evoca in Europe in 2026.The status of Biotalys’ current pipeline of product candidates  which includes novel biofungicides  biobactericides and bio-insecticides  is as follows:The next generation of Evoca (containing the same bioactive protein  with optimized manufacturing and formulation) has progressed into the development stage and is currently expected to enter both the U.S. and the E.U. markets by 2026  subject to regulatory approval. The Company expects this next generation of Evoca to generate positive cashflow margins as production efficiency improves and market potential further develops.BioFun-6 continues to progress according to plan and moved into in-depth in vitro characterization in 2022  with the goal of obtaining a novel mode of action differentiating it from Evoca  opening up the new product to a wider range of crops and regions. The Company expects to move this product candidate into development stage by the end of 2023  on track to bring an additional and complementary solution to fruit and vegetables growers by 2028.BioFun-7   in partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation  was initiated at the beginning of 2022 and is progressing as per plan with the identification of candidate molecules now ongoing.BioFun-4 was initiated by Biotalys in the beginning of 2023 with the development of the project plan and target product profile  in collaboration with key opinion leaders  including members of the newly established Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC).BioIns-1 made progress with the discovery of potential binders to insect targets  creating prospects for potential development of a product candidate by the Company or in collaboration with partners.BioBac-1 and BioFun-2 are expected to continue to provide valuable IP and know-how  strengthening the Company’s AGROBODY Foundry platform  and could form the basis of further R&D collaborations.Actively strengthening its team  Biotalys made important appointments throughout the year:* Evoca™: Pending Registration. This product is not currently registered for sale or use in the United States  the European Union  or elsewhere and is not being offered for sale.Detailed financial review for 2022In € thousand 2022 2021 Other operating income 2 949 1 995 Research and development expenses (18 813) (13 880) General and administration expenses (5 081) (4 905) Marketing expenses (1 586) (1 289) Operating loss (22 531) (18 079) Financial income 320 1 510 Financial expenses (557) (343) Loss before taxes (22 769) (16 913) Income taxes 38 (16) Loss for the period (22 731) (16 929) Remeasurement gains (losses) on defined benefit plans (43) 5 Exchange differences on translating foreign operations 4 5 Total comprehensive loss for the period (22 770) (16 919) Basic and diluted loss per share (in EUR) (0.74) (1.10) Profit/(loss) for the period attributable to the owners of the company (22 731) (16 929) Total comprehensive income for the period attributable to the owners of the company (22 770) (16 919) Cash and cash equivalents 34 096 56 107 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (22 017) 33 005Consolidated statements of profit and lossOther operating income amounted to €2.9 million and relates to R&D tax incentives received and grants awarded to support R&D activities. The primary increase relates to the grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation  for which the activities started in 2022. R&D tax incentives increased by €0.4 million  while income from government grants decreased slightly by €0.2 million compared to 2021.Research and development expenses amounted to €18.8 million for 2022  an increase of €4.9 million compared to 2021. This increase is mainly driven by external spending for the production of Evoca in preparation of the market calibration planned for later this year and field trials for further product testing. Other increases in the R&D expenses include the indexation of salary costs and non-cash expenses for the stock options.General and administrative expenses amounted to €5.1 million for 2022  compared to €4.9 million in 2021  mainly driven by a limited increase in expenses for employee benefits and technical systems. There was a decrease in professional services as there was a one-time charge of €0.5 million in 2021 related to the preparation for the initial public offering in July 2021.Marketing expenses rose from €1.3 million in 2021 to €1.6 million in 2022 as a result of further developing the sales and marketing team in support of the expanded market calibration of Evoca planned for 2023 and beyond.Financial income amounted to €0.3 million in 2022  compared to €1.5 million in 2021  and related primarily to foreign exchange gains in 2022  while the figure for 2021 was impacted by the full release of the remaining derivative liability of the Anti-Dilution warrants as they were cancelled upon the IPO.Financial expenses amounted to €0.6 million and related primarily to interest expenses for the leases and bank loans and foreign exchange losses.Income taxes expense show the impact of the creation of a deferred tax asset related to the R&D expenses in our U.S. subsidiary.Loss of the period was €22.8 million  compared to €16.9 million in 2021.Basic and diluted loss per share for 2022 amounted to €0.74 compared to €1.10 in 2021. There was a lower average number of shares outstanding in 2021 versus 2022 as the shares issued at the time of the initial public offering were only outstanding for approximately half of 2021.Cash and cash equivalents at year-end amounted to €34.1 million in 2022 (compared to €56.1 million in 2021)  slightly higher than expected as a result of a combination of savings and timing differences for certain cash payments for manufacturing.Outlook for 2023Biotalys expects to initiate the market calibration of Evoca with Biobest in select U.S. states  subject to regulatory approval. As the field trial program for the first generation of Evoca has been completed  the Company will now focus on testing improved product formulations and the next generation product  both in the U.S. and the E.U. In addition  Biotalys plans to test Evoca with a broader number of potential commercial partners for Europe and other regions.In addition to the ongoing internal work on the next generation of Evoca  Biotalys is also exploring strategic supply and commercialization agreements with Novozymes for a next generation of Evoca.The Company expects to advance the product pipeline in 2023 with the planned promotion of the BioFun-6 program into development stage while progressing current pipeline programs further in the discovery stage. Biotalys also aims to continue selectively leveraging its AGROBODY Foundry platform and pipeline to further expand into new markets and crops  with an increased focus on strategic collaborations that could drive additional value.The Company expects cash burn in 2023 to be slightly higher than last year (2022: €22 million)  in line with the planned investments in our pipeline  platform and manufacturing. Together with the cash and cash equivalents balance of €34 million at the end of 2022  the Company expects the financial runway to extend to mid 2024.Auditor StatementThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS  as adopted by the EU.

The formation and funding of...,"Cool Company Ltd.February 28  2023This release includes business and financial updates for the quarter and twelve months ended December 31  2022. The formation and funding of Cool Company Ltd. (“CoolCo” or the “Company”) and the phased acquisition of the Company’s initial eight TFDE vessels  The Cool Pool Limited  and the shipping and FSRU management organization from Golar LNG Limited commenced in January 2022 and concluded on June 30  2022. As a result of these acquisitions  results for the year ended December 31  2022 (""FY 2022"") include consolidated successor period and combined carve-out predecessor period results which on an aggregate basis represent the full year results for 2022. The three months ended December 31  2022 (""Q4"" or the ""Quarter"") only include a consolidated successor period. The subsequent acquisition of four LNG carriers on November 10  2022 from an affiliate of EPS Ventures Ltd (""EPS"")  has been treated as asset acquisitions  so the results for these four vessels are included within the successor period from the acquisition date.Q4 Highlights and Subsequent EventsGenerated total operating revenues of $90.3 million for the Quarter  compared to $65.8 million for the third quarter 2022 (""Q3"") with net income of $33.1 million and earnings per share of $0.68 for Q4;Achieved average Time Charter Equivalent Earnings (""TCE"") 1 of $83 600 per day for Q4  compared to $73 200 per day for Q3;Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $58.6 million for Q4  compared to $42.4 million for Q3;Commenced previously announced three-year charter from October 2022 at approximately $120 000 per day;Agreed another three-year charter that commenced in February 2023 at a rate that averages $120 000 per day over the charter period;Raised approximately $170 million in a primary equity offering on November 2  2022 to fund the equity consideration for the acquisition of four special purpose vehicles (""SPVs"")  each holding one contracted LNG carrier  for an aggregate purchase consideration of approximately $660 million on November 10  2022 (the balance was funded through the assumption of a $520 million term loan facility of which a principal repayment of approximately $20 million was made on November 14  2022);Entered into an option agreement expiring June 30  2023 to acquire two Hyundai Samho LNG carrier newbuild contracts (the ""newbuild option"") with scheduled deliveries in second half of 2024;Announced the sale of the Golar Seal in February 2023  the oldest vessel in the fleet for $184.3 million (with the buyer assuming all costs associated with the vessel’s forthcoming scheduled dry-dock)  releasing approximately $94 million  after repayment of its associated debt  that will be available to fund the acquisition of the two Hyundai Samho LNG carriers in the event the Company decides to exercise the newbuild option;Publicly filed a registration statement for direct listing of the Company's shares on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)  subject to the registration statement being declared effective  with the intention of listing around mid-March 2023 under the ticker of “CLCO” (which would be the common ticker for NYSE and Euronext Growth Oslo); andIn accordance with its dividend policy announced in the Quarter  the Company declared a dividend for Q4 of $0.40 per share  to be paid on March 10  2023 to all shareholders of record on March 3  2023.Story continuesRichard Tyrrell  CEO  commented:“At its IPO a year ago  CoolCo outlined its intention to target growth by consolidation and to focus on shareholder returns by allocating its free cash-flow to equity primarily to dividends. I am pleased to see us deliver on both as a result of steps taken during and subsequent to the fourth quarter. We acquired four high-spec  in-service vessels on attractive terms  placed two of our existing vessels on highly attractive charters  and on the back of a strong set of Q4 results were able to declare our first quarterly dividend. Through the sale of the Golar Seal  the earliest vessel in our fleet to be built  we are demonstrating our disciplined approach to locking in shareholder value. The valuation highlights the re-pricing of the LNG carrier market and strategic value of such LNG infrastructure assets in providing crucial energy security. A 2.5x cash-on-cash return in little more than 12 months since CoolCo’s formation shows the considerable upside potential in our fleet.With our recently announced planned NYSE listing  we are also delivering on our intention to provide expanded access to CoolCo for US investors  broaden the investor base and drive trading liquidity in our shares. Despite seasonal market softness in the spot market for LNG carriers  the 12-month market remains strong and 2023 looks fundamentally tighter than 2022. Freeport LNG's export terminal in the US Gulf is now well into the process of restarting after several months offline  Europe will not have access to the same level of Russian pipeline gas as it previously relied upon  and Asia could soon outbid Europe for spot volumes  potentially pushing up ton miles. As one of the few listed LNG shipping companies with open tonnage this year and next  we look forward to securing additional contracts that reflect the re-priced LNG carrier charter market and realize significant value for shareholders  including for the two highly sought-after Hyundai Samho newbuildings on which we hold an option.”Financial HighlightsThe table below sets forth certain key financial information for Q4 2022 and FY 2022  split between Successor and Predecessor periods (as defined below).Q4 Twelve Months ended December 31  2022 (in thousands of $  except TCE) Successor Successor Predecessor Total Time and voyage charter revenues 79 032 183 567 37 289 220 856 Total operating revenues 90 255 212 978 43 456 256 434 Operating income 48 881 110 936 27 728 138 664 Net income 33 069 87 500 23 244 110 744 Adjusted EBITDA1 58 621 134 585 33 473 168 058 Average daily TCE1 (to the closest $100) 83 600 73 000 57 100 69 800Note: The commencement of operations and funding of CoolCo and the acquisition of its initial eight TFDE LNG carriers  The Cool Pool Limited and the shipping and FSRU management organization from Golar LNG Limited (""Golar"") was completed in a phased process. It commenced with the funding of CoolCo on January 27  2022 and concluded with the acquisition of the LNG carrier and FSRU management organization on June 30  2022  with vessel acquisitions taking place on different dates over that period. Results for the twelve months that commenced January 1  2022 and ended December 31  2022 have therefore been split between the period prior to the funding of CoolCo and various phased acquisitions (the ""Predecessor"" period) and the period subsequent to the various phased acquisitions of such vessels and management entities (the ""Successor"" period). The combined results are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and consists of the aggregate of selected financial data of the Successor and Predecessor periods. No other adjustments have been made to the combined presentation.LNG Market ReviewThe Quarter commenced with the Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") at $40/MMBtu  the Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $54/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $226 000 per day. The freight market tightened seasonally early driven by cargo values  congestion at European terminals  and traders and portfolio players using vessels as storage to profit from a winter price contango. Virtually every modern carrier was under charterer control  resulting in an illiquid market dominated by the occasional sublet. Spot rates for a TFDE vessel reached as high as around $450 000 in late October. CoolCo took this opportunity to re-charter two of its available carriers  both on three-year charters: one charter commencing at the end of October at approximately $120 000 per day  and another commencing in Q1 2023 at a rate that steps down from a high level to a lower level and averages approximately $120 000 per day over the period of the charter.By late November  an unwinding of vessels waiting to discharge in Europe  further delays to the restart of Freeport  and no arbitrage to pull cargoes east saw available vessels increase and spot rates declined from unprecedented heights  halving within two weeks. The year concluded with JKM at $28/MMBtu  TTF at $23/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $148 000 per day. Sentiment in term rates remained strong despite spot rates coming under pressure.Operational ReviewCoolCo's fleet continued to perform well with no technical off-hire incurred during the Quarter. No idle time ahead of the vessel contract starting in late October meant that Q4 fleet utilization was 100%.Business DevelopmentDuring the Quarter  CoolCo completed the acquisition of four contracted LNG carriers  the 2021 built 2-stroke Kool Orca  2020 built 2-stroke Kool Firn  and 2015 built TFDE vessels Kool Boreas and Kool Baltic. The four LNG carriers collectively add revenue backlog1 of approximately $370 million excluding options and $1.2 billion including options. The estimated 2023 Adjusted EBITDA1 attributable to these four vessels is expected to be approximately $80 million. Revenue backlog1 as of December 31  2022  from shipping fixtures to date amounts to approximately $950 million excluding options and approximately $1.68 billion including options  if exercised for the maximum duration.CoolCo has also entered into an attractive option agreement to acquire newbuild contracts for two 2-stroke LNG carriers scheduled to deliver in second half of 2024. The exercise price for each carrier is $234 million and the option is exercisable until June 30  2023. Only four to six uncontracted newbuilds deliver ahead of these two vessels and CoolCo is receiving significant interest from potential charterers seeking long-term contracts. The Company expects to agree accretive contracts and secure attractive financing prior to exercising the option.Financing and LiquidityAs of December 31  2022  CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $129.1 million and total short and long-term debt  net of deferred finance charges  of $1 138.3 million. Total CoolCo Contractual Debt1 comprised of $540.4 million in respect of the six vessel bank financing facility maturing in March 2027 (the ""$570 million bank facility"")  $500.6 million in respect of the four vessel bank financing facility maturing in May 2029 (the “$520 million bank facility”)  and $210.3 million in respect of the two sale and leaseback facilities maturing in January 2025 (Ice and Kelvin). Total CoolCo Contractual Debt1 stood at $1 251.3 million.During Q4  we entered into further floating interest rate (SOFR) swap agreements for an additional notional amount of $167.2 million  resulting in the $570 million bank facility being fully hedged at an average fixed rate of 3.37% and an average all-in rate of 6.12%. The swap agreements started in October 2022  maturing in February 2027  and follow the amortization profile of the $570 million bank facility.Following the announcement in February 2023 of the sale of Golar Seal  to be completed in March 2023  cash and cash equivalents will be augmented by approximately $94.0 million of released cash  after the repayment of its associated debt of approximately $88.0 million. This provides a substantial pool of funding that can be used for the equity portion of the newbuild option  if we exercise the option  and the pursuit of other potential business development opportunities.Corporate and Other MattersAs of December 31  2022  CoolCo had 53 688 462 shares issued and outstanding. Of these  26 790 545 (49.9%) were owned by EPS  4 463 846 (8.3%) were owned by Golar LNG Limited and 22 434 071 (41.8%) were publicly owned.On February 14  2023  CoolCo publicly filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)  with the intention of directly listing its shares on the NYSE. Subject to the registration statement being declared effective by the SEC  the Company’s shares are expected to be listed for trading on the NYSE from around mid-March 2023 onwards under the ticker ""CLCO"". The ticker on the Euronext Growth Oslo will therefore be changed from “COOL” to “CLCO”. No CoolCo securities will be issued in connection with the share listing on the NYSE.In line with the Company’s variable dividend policy  the Board has declared a Q4 dividend of $0.40 per ordinary share. The record date is March 3  2023 and the dividend will be paid on March 10  2023.OutlookAlthough the short-term market has been negatively impacted by an unwinding of the winter storage play and an easing of congestion  new developments are expected to strengthen an already tight underlying market in 2023. An increasing share of Europe’s LNG imports will be received by FSRUs where cargoes take longer to discharge. The carbon intensity indicator (“CII”) rules that came into effect on January 1 will likely reduce the trading flexibility of steam turbine vessels. A re-opening China is expected to compete for more spot traded LNG  adding ton miles as it does. Freeport is returning to market and will re-employ up to 30 vessels once fully ramped up  and there are no uncommitted newbuilds delivering this year. With two vessel openings in 2023  at a seasonally strong time of year  CoolCo is one of the only publicly listed vessel owners exposed to this market.Approximately 160 million tons of new liquefaction is scheduled to deliver between now and 2026 that will require around 200 new carriers. With around 250 LNG carriers scheduled to deliver over the same timeframe  the market at first glance looks oversupplied. There is  however  a further 175 million tons of liquefaction in the US alone progressing through the Front End Engineering and Design process  supported by a government increasingly keen to fast-track development. This  together with the replacement of older  considerably less efficient steam vessels that come off contract over the same timeframe  could absorb a further 300 new vessels. A standard spec newbuild costs around $250 million and a vessel ordered today will most likely be delivered in 2027. Limited speculative ordering and high newbuild prices mean that long-term charter rates have increased from around $75 000/day to above $90 000/day  with premiums being paid for near-term availability. Reports indicate that a 10-year charter at a rate in the region of $105 000 per day has been agreed upon for a newbuild vessel delivering early in 2024. These are both positive datapoints for the second half of 2024 when the two vessels subject to the newbuild option are scheduled to be delivered.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release contains forward-looking statements which reflect management’s current expectations  estimates and projections about its operations.

Offering an all-in-one solution for electric vehicle powertrains  the EDM consists of three main components – the electric motor  power electronics and transmission – that are combined into a single module to deliver improved performance and range at a competitive cost. The optimized efficiency of the new EDM will help each platform achieve driving range up to 500 miles (800 km).“While we continue our successful transition to a decarbonized future in our European operations  we are now setting those same foundational elements for the North American market ” said Carlos Tavares  Stellantis CEO. “By combining the benefits of the EDM with our new BEV-centric platforms and innovative battery technologies  we will offer our customers a variety of electric vehicles with unparalleled performance and range at more affordable prices. And with our in-house manufacturing capabilities and expertise  we will do it with greater flexibility and efficiency.”Investments will be made at the Indiana Transmission  Kokomo Transmission and Kokomo Casting Plants. The gearbox cover will be cast at Kokomo Casting and machined at Kokomo Transmission. Gear machining and final assembly will be at the Indiana Transmission Plant. Production is expected to start in the third quarter of 2024  following retooling.With the investment  more than 265 jobs will be retained across all three plants.“With more than 7 000 employees in Indiana  these investments will leverage the core manufacturing competencies of the local workforce in the areas of casting  machining and assembly  all of which will be needed even as the market transitions to an electrified future ” said Mark Stewart  Stellantis North America COO. “The city of Kokomo and the state of Indiana have been great partners for many years. This community will continue to play a central role in our efforts to provide safe  clean and affordable mobility solutions for our customers long into the future.”Since 2020  Stellantis has invested nearly $3.3 billion in Indiana to support its transition to electrification. This includes recent announcements of $643 million to produce a new engine for conventional and PHEV applications  a next generation eight-speed transmission and a gigafactory joint venture with Samsung SDI.In total  these investments support Stellantis’ ambition to achieve carbon net zero by 2038  as set out in its Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan.Stellantis in IndianaStellantis currently operates five powertrain plants in Indiana – three transmission plants  a casting plant and an engine plant.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

Results showed that masitinib at 4.5 mg/kg/day can benefit patients by significantly slowing cognitive deterioration relative to placebo. There are very limited treatment options for patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease and to date no approved disease modifying therapy encompasses this later-stage Alzheimer’s disease population. I am therefore excited to continuing the development of masitinib in its confirmatory Phase 3 study (AB21004)  with the anticipation that it could benefit this difficult to treat population.”Professor Olivier Hermine  MD  President of the Scientific Committee of AB Science and member of the Académie des Sciences in France said  “Masitinib is a highly innovative drug for Alzheimer’s disease because unlike the majority of drug development research in this indication  masitinib targets the brain’s innate immune system  including mast cells. The positioning of masitinib as a treatment of mild and moderate Alzheimer’s disease is also different from other drugs  for example  anti-amyloid antibodies such as aduhelm and lecanemab target very mild dementia  prodromal or asymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. Remarkably  masitinib has now demonstrated neuroprotective benefits in three challenging neurodegenerative disorders; namely mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease [1]  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [2 3]  and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis [4]. Modulation of the neuroimmune system could therefore be a valid strategy across a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases  with masitinib now uniquely positioned to realize this therapeutic potential.”Study AB09004 met its primary analysis endpoint  demonstrating that masitinib administered at 4.5 mg/kg/day significantly slowed cognitive deterioration relative to placebo with a manageable safety profile.Results showed that masitinib can generate a significant treatment effect relative to placebo in the primary endpoint of ADAS-Cog  an instrument that measures the effect on cognition and memory. Specifically  masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day (n=182) showed significant benefit relative to placebo (n=176)  with a change in ADAS-cog from baseline of -1.46 (representing an overall improvement in cognition) versus +0.69 (representing increased cognitive deterioration)  respectively; a corresponding ADAS-cog between-group difference of -2.15 (97.5%CI [-3.48  -0.81])  p=0.0003. This change is considered clinically meaningful  especially when considering its administration on a background of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine  a 2-point change being consistent with published recommendations [5] and benchmark ADAS-Cog benefit according to well-established therapies [6-8].It was also seen that masitinib generated a non-significant trend towards improved overall function relative to placebo as measured by the ADCS-ADL score  an instrument that assesses self-care and activities of daily living. Specifically  masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day showed a change in ADCS-ADL from baseline of +1.01 (representing an overall functional improvement) versus -0.81 for placebo (representing increased functional deterioration); a corresponding ADCS-ADL between-group difference of +1.82 (97.5%CI [(-0.15  3.79])  p=0.038.The safety of masitinib as an adjunct to cholinesterase inhibitor and/or memantine was acceptable and consistent with its known tolerability profile. It is noteworthy that this result is in the context of a relative elderly population (average age of about 73 years) with comorbidities.About the confirmatory Phase 3 trial (AB21004)The objective of study AB21004 is to confirm results from the first phase 2B/3 study  AB09004. Study AB21004 has recently received an Investigational New Drug (IND) approval letter from the FDA  with similar authorizations having also been received from several European countries  including the French Medicine Agency (ANSM). This study will enroll 600 patients with confirmed clinical diagnosis of mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease  corresponding to a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of between 14 to 25  inclusive. The primary objective of the study will be to evaluate the effect of masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day  administered as an add-on therapy to standard of care (cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine)  on absolute change from baseline in ADCS-ADL score and in ADAS-Cog-11.About masitinib’s mechanism of action in Alzheimer’s diseaseMasitinib (AB1010) is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has demonstrated neuroprotective action in neurodegenerative diseases via inhibition of mast cell and microglia/macrophage activity  possibly by switching the neuroimmune system from a neurotoxic state towards a neuroprotective state through remodeling of the neuronal microenvironment. Mast cells  macrophages and microglia are types of innate immune cells that are present in the central nervous system  and for which there is a growing body of evidence implicating them in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease  progressive forms of multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).The rationale to use masitinib in Alzheimer’s disease patients is supported by preclinical evidence demonstrating that the pharmacological action of masitinib in mast cells can restore normal spatial learning performance in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease and promotes recovery of synaptic markers [9].Despite decades of extensive research  the overwhelming majority of human trials (predominantly testing amyloid-based therapeutics) have failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy. This underscores a need for innovative  non-amyloid based approaches  including therapies that modulate the neuroimmune response in Alzheimer’s disease  which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of the disease [10–14].References:[1] Dubois B  López‑Arrieta J  Lipschitz S  et al.

Supply of raw materials from Russia and Belarus was subject to an embargo and alternative supply sources needed to be developed. The European fertiliser market was heavily under supplied due to the ban on imports from Russian producers. All this has led to increased raw material costs which were offset by a sharp increase in fertiliser product prices. At the end of the year  gas prices returned to a more normal level.In addition  NASC supply difficulties due to technical problems encountered by our main supplier  forced us to modify our production schedules and use alternative raw materials for NASC to continue to produce. Rosier Group's estimated results can be summarised as follow: The operating result before amortization and depreciation (EBITDA) is kEUR 131 ;No triggering events were identified by management of potential further impairment  neither a potential reversal of past impairment on fixed assets.The financial result includes a revenue corresponding to a change in estimate in the decontamination provision for the Sas van Gent site ;After the deduction of operating costs  including amortization and depreciation  the operating result (EBIT) ends in a loss of MEUR 2 755 compared to a loss of MEUR 36 749 in 2021;After financial charges and taxes  the result for the period shows a profit of KEUR 825  against a loss of MEUR 36 930 for the year 2021. The key figures are as follows: Consolidated statement of comprehensive income EUR thousands 20222021 Operating revenues Revenue Other operating revenues Operating expenses Supplies and raw materials General expenses Personnel expenses Amortisation and amounts written off Provisions Other operating expenses Operating profit EBITDA Financial income Financial expense Profit before tax Income tax Profit of the period Other comprehensive income - items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss Defined benefit plan actuarial gains (losses) Income tax on other comprehensive income Total comprehensive income for the period Profit for the period attributable to : Owners of the Company Total comprehensive income attributable to : Owners of the Company 248.367 234.993 246.270 233.800 2.096 1.193 - 251.122 - 271.742 - 201.746 - 181.952 - 33.036 - 39.972 - 16.845 - 17.431 - 2.886 - 27.625 3.891 - 4.211 - 500 - 551 - 2.755 - 36.749 131 - 9.125 4.224 378 - 997 - 1.180 471 - 37.551 354 621 825 - 36.930 571 362 761 482 - 190 - 120 1.396 - 36.568 825- 36.930 1.396- 36.568 Earnings per share Number of shares at year end 3.005.000 255.000 Basic and diluted earnings per share (in Eur) (1) 0 98 -144 82 (1) based on weighted average number of shares during 2022 The consolidated results  as summarised above  were approved by the Board of Directors on the 27th of February 2023. Transactions with related companies Reference is made to the extraordinary general meeting's decision of 16 June 2022 to proceed with the transactions proposed as part of the rescue package offered by Borealis AG  Rosier SA's controlling shareholder  including the recapitalization of the company through a capital increase by contribution in kind by Borealis AG (the Capital Increase) of (i) its receivables under the following shareholder loans that Borealis AG (as lender) entered into with Rosier SA (as borrower):(A) the EUR 25 million intercompany loan agreement dated 16 July 2020 (effective as from 22 July 2020)  and (B) the EUR 25 million intercompanyloan agreement dated 16 July 2020 (effective as of 28 August 2020) and (ii) a portion of the receivables under the current account between Borealis Financial Services NV and Rosier SA (receivables now owned by Borealis AG) (the Current Account).In line with this decision of the extraordinary general meeting  Rosier SA confirms that the Capital Increase has been completed on 29 July 2022 as established by the board of directors of Rosier SA before a notary public. The implementation of the Capital Increase has occurred simultaneously with the entry into a new committed unsecured intra-group financing facility of up to EUR 15 million between Borealis AG (as lender) and Rosier SA (as borrower) to be repaid ultimately by 31 July 2023  unless refinanced earlier (see also press releases of 17 May and 16 June 2022 for further details).As a result of the Capital Increase  Borealis AG holds 98.09% of the share capital of Rosier SA and has therefore the right to launch a ""naked"" squeeze-out offer pursuant to applicable Belgian takeover regulations and to delist Rosier SA from Euronext Brussels. In this context  reference is made to Borealis AG's press release of 10 June 2022 in which it announces its intention to launch a squeeze-out offer. The conclusions of the written advice of the Committee of Independent Directors were as follows: ""Assignment and entering into the Assignment Agreement  (and  as such  approving that Borealis AG will  with effect from the date of the Closing  no longer have any obligations under the Facility Agreement considering the change of ownership resulting from the Yildirim Transaction) is in the case at hand to the advantage and in the interest of the Company  in particular  considering that it will ensure continuation in the financing of the Company at the same terms and conditions  and  in this manner  further safeguard the Company's liquidity position and ability to continue as a going concern until the maturity date of the Facility Agreement. In addition  the Assignment is considered a reasonable proposal and in line with market practice given that  as of Closing  Borealis AG will no longer be a shareholder of the Company but that Yildirim will be the new majority shareholder instead. Consequently  the Committee further concludes that the proposed approval of the Assignment and the entry into the Assignment Agreement is in line with the Company's strategic policy and is not of the nature to cause manifestly abusive disadvantages to the Company  in view of this policy pursued by the Company. Therefore  the Committee decides to issue a positive advice in relation to the approval of the Assignment and the entry into the Assignment Agreement."" On 22 September 2022  Rosier entered into a side letter to the Supply Agreement to amend and clarify certain terms of the Supply Agreement for NASC with Borealis LAT GmbH (see press release of 27 September 2022).The conclusions of the written advice of the Committee of Independent Directors were as follows:""The Committee has assessed the envisaged Side Letter in the light of the criteria included in article 7:97 of the BCCA and concluded that the expected advantages of the Side Letter exceed the expected disadvantages thereof  which leads to the conclusion that the Side Letter is to the advantage and in the interest of the Company.The Side Letter is in line with the Company's strategic policy and is not manifestly unreasonable and the Committee affirms its positive advice in relation to the Side Letter."" Shareholding On 26 September 2022  Borealis AG and YILDIRIM Group's YILFERT Holding announced that they signed a binding agreement for the acquisition of Borealis' shares in Rosier SA. The closing of the acquisition of Borealis' shares in Rosier SA is subject to certain regulatory approvals and Borealis concluding the squeeze-out. Borealis currently holds 98.09% of Rosier SA shares and has previously announced its intention to launch a squeeze-out offer for the remaining Rosier shares. However  Borealis and Yildirim have agreed on 7 November that the transaction will be closed upon the regulatory approvals being received  and that Yildirim will as soon as possible after such closing launch a mandatory takeover bid followed by a squeeze-out for the remaining Rosier shares at a price of EUR 20 per share  in accordance with article 53 of the Belgian Royal Decree on Public Takeover Bids. Borealis will accordingly not launch a squeeze-out offer. Statement from the Statutory Auditor: The statutory auditor  PwC Réviseurs d'Entreprises SRL  represented by Peter D'hondt  has confirmed that the audit  which is substantially complete  has not to date revealed any material misstatement in the draft consolidated accounts  and that the accounting data reported in the press release is consistent  in all material respects  with the draft accounts from which it has been derived. Subsequent events On 2 January  Borealis AG announced that the Yildirim Transaction has been completed As a result of the Closing  Yilfert Benelux B.V. (a member of the YILDIRIM Group) is the Company's new majority shareholder  holding 98.09% of all issued and outstanding shares of the Company. Pursuant to Borealis AG's press release of 8 November 2022  Yildirim will launch a mandatory takeover bid followed by a squeeze-out for the remaining Rosier shares at a price of EUR 20 per share  in accordance with article 53 of the Belgian Royal Decree on Public Takeover Bids. In the context of the Closing  the Board members  who were acting as a representative of Borealis AG on the Board  have each resigned from their respective functions as directors in the Company  with effect as from the occurrence of the Closing. It concerns the following (resigning) Board members: Mr Robin Koopmans  Mr Benoît Taymans and Mr Peter Leitner. With effect as from the Closing  the following Yildirim representatives have been appointed as new directors of the Company by means of co-optation (pursuant to article 7:88  §1 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations (the BCCA) and article 13 of the Company's articles of association): Mr Özer Öz  Mr Evren Öztürk and Mr Orçun Gökalp. Mr Özer Öz has been appointed as new chairman of the Board. Mr Willy Raymaekers will continue exercising his function as a director and  as a CEO and managing director of the Company following the Closing but this  as from Closing  through his management company ""Raywil BV"". Going concern On 27th of February 2023  the Board of Rosier SA received a letter of support from Yilfert Benelux BV and Yildirim International Investment Holding BV stating an ""unconditional and irrevocable financial support to the Rosier SA to ensure the development of its activities and its ability to continue operating as a going concern in the foreseeable future until the General Assembly to be held in June 2024"". As a result  the annual results of 2022 will be published on a going concern basis. The Group has defined the following objectives for 2023: Strengthen its Granular market share in Europe and the export area.Improve its cost position by fully utilising the synergies with the Yildirim Group.Grow the Specialties business based on the introduction of a new product line. 2023 shareholders' agenda Publication of 2022 annual report: 29th of April 2023 Annual General Meeting: 15th of June at 10.30 am In the name of the Board of Directors Willy Raymaekers President and CEO of Rosier Group Attachments Original LinkOriginal DocumentPermalink Disclaimer Rosier SA published this content on 28 February 2023 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

RNG sales and gas upgrading service sales to landfill operators accounted for 79% of total revenue  with RNG production equipment sales accounting for 19%.In 2022  the installed base of WAGABOX® units injected 216 GWh of RNG into the gas grid in France—49% more than the previous year. The increase was due to the commissioning of new RNG production units  including one that can produce five times more RNG than earlier units  proving that Waga Energy’s WAGABOX® technology can support volume RNG production. The successful deployment of very-large-capacity RNG production units marks a decisive step toward Waga Energy’s development on international markets like America.Waga Energy’s installed base continued to perform at a high level in 2022  with total overall uptime greater than 95%.During 2022 Waga Energy signed contracts to build seven new WAGABOX® units  five in France and two in Canada. At December 31  2022  Waga Energy operated fourteen units in France  for an installed base of 415 GWh/year  and had started construction on fifteen units  for an additional installed base of 565 GWh/year. These 29 units will represent a total capacity of nearly 1 TWh/year.Mathieu Lefebvre  CEO of Waga Energy  said:“Our 2022 results are evidence of the very high value Waga Energy’s technology delivers. Our solution  unlike anything else on the market  is particularly relevant in an energy crisis with no apparent end in sight. WAGABOX® RNG production units transform millions of cubic meters of greenhouse gases emitted by waste in landfills into a renewable substitute for environmentally-harmful fossil-based natural gas. And once again  our technology has proven itself to be extremely reliable  with average uptime of more than 95%. Landfill operators around the world have shown interest in our solution. However  for the time being  we have decided to remain focused on North America  where we opened a subsidiary just over three years ago. Our local staff has already won several contracts and we will start producing RNG in Canada and the United States later this year. The huge landfill gas potential in North America means that we will have to ramp up capital expenditures to harness it. However  the return on investment will be greater. Given this buoyant market  we can confirm our objective of increasing our installed base to reach RNG production of 4 TWh/year by end-2026.”Next release: FY 2022 results on Wednesday  April 26  2023  after the close of trading.About Waga EnergyWaga Energy (EPA: WAGA) produces competitively priced Renewable Natural Gas (also known as “biomethane”) by upgrading landfill gas using a patented purification technology called WAGABOX®. The RNG produced is injected directly into the gas grids to supply individuals and businesses  providing a substitute for natural gas. Waga Energy finances  builds and operates its WAGABOX® units under long-term contracts with landfill operators for the supply of raw gas  and generates income by selling the RNG it generated or by offering upgrading service. At the date of this press release  Waga Energy operates fifteen WAGABOX® units in France  representing an installed capacity of 440 GWh/year. Fourteen units are under construction in France  Spain  Canada and the US. Each project initiated by Waga Energy contributes to the fight against global warming and helps the energy transition.

To help you navigate in this virtual world  and at a time when the MoMA in New York  the LACMA in Los Angeles  and the Center Pompidou in Paris are opening their collections to digital art  Artprice suggests five ways to discover art that can be transferred from owner to owner in the form of NFTs.Weekly NFT Auction Proceeds Vs Ethereum Price Top 10 artists by NFT auction turnover (2021-2022)Weekly NFT Auction Proceeds Vs Ethereum PriceInfographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2010704/Weekly_NFT_Auction_Infographic.jpgTop 10 artists by NFT auction turnover (2021–2022)Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2010705/Top_10_artists_Infographic.jpg""Crypto-art is gradually entering museums and art history  but  for the time being  it is a form of artistic creation that is still very freely experienced on the Internet "" says Thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and founder of Artprice.""The crypto-art sphere is often described as operating like a 'community'; the more you invest in a project  the more qualitative information you receive. This is how the Discord platform works  for example  which offers to create different more or less private chat rooms for each project. Some allow everyone to participate in the discussions  but the most interesting chat rooms are those reserved for collectors or founding members.""To give you the desire and the means to take part in this new artistic experience  which aims to bring together artists  collectors  graphic designers  developers  and many others  Artprice recommends five ways to dive into this universe and start your adventure.1. The continuous way: following artists on TwitterDespite the many criticisms made of Twitter  Elon Musk's platform remains the royal road of Web3. Not only do digital artists use this channel to present their works as and when they are created  but they also relay the posts in which they – and all those they like – are quoted. Each page  therefore  contains countless dynamic links to other artists and other works  but also to collectors  curators  marketplaces  etc.To start with  one can follow any of the top performing NFT artists at auction that Artprice lists in its annual reports. The major auction houses are indeed doing valuable work by selecting NFT works that meet the same requirements as the traditional art market. But  as one thing leads to another in the digital world  and one artist leads to another  Twitter then makes it possible to continuously discover new works and new creators  but also to be the first to know about upcoming projects.Robbie Barrett:https://twitter.com/videodromeIX SHELLS: https://twitter.com/ix_shells2. The studious way: reading articles and interviewsThe decisions by Christie's  Sotheby's  Phillips  Bonhams but also Fauve  Van Ham  Millon  and many other auction operators to amply include NFT lots in their sales proves – even if it no longer needs to be proved – the seriousness of NFT technology and the artistic creation it allows. The most prestigious galleries  like Pace and Gagosian  have also understood this  yet few media dare to offer any real artistic critique of NFT projects. This work (art criticism)  so crucial to art history  would undoubtedly make a better appreciation of the approaches taken by digital artists and of their relationships to Blockchain technology  and to the 'communities' that support them.Faced with the multiplication of marketplaces  crypto-art needs space and time for reflection  to understand and digest innovative practices at the frontier of technology  as the projects of these artists gain in depth and intensity. Artprice offers two articles that capture the work of key digital artists in the NFT universe.Artforum : Hack the Planet  Hans Ulrich Obrist talks with Pak : www.artforum.com/print/202207/hans-ulrich-obrist-talks-with-pak-88907Right Click And Save: An Interview with XCOPY :www.rightclicksave.com/article/an-interview-with-xcopy3. The prospective way: surveying major collectionsTransparency is one of the main credos of the Blockchain and as such  it is possible to consult the collection to which each work belongs  to discover other works that the same entity collects... and so on. True  the real identity of collectors often remains anonymous or hides behind a pseudonym  and yes  NFTs can be transferred from one wallet to another to increase security and cover their tracks  but there is always a way to reconstitute their history.The most dynamic collectors have also become the true tutelary figures of crypto-art. Until museums and galleries become active in this universe  the major collectors of NFTs still have a very substantial influence  whether by sharing their favorites on social media  collaborating with artists  or exhibiting their collections in virtual universes or physical places as the prestigious Art Basel Miami or by offering them for sale via traditional auction houses.Cozomo di Medici: ""For over 700 years  we have loved the jpegs"":https://opensea.io/Cozomo_de_MediciMax Stealth: ""A Timeless Collection"":www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2022/inside-the-world-of-maxstealth-a-timeless-collection4. The traditional way: visiting physical eventsCrypto-art is now coming to public places  galleries  and museums. From the great hall of the MoMA to Times Square  digital art is gradually investing some of the biggest screens on the planet and some of the most prestigious museums. Advertising spaces and exhibition halls are coming together for the first time in history  no doubt  to show a new type of work  at the crossroads of art and technology  which sometimes looks a whole lot better on a big screen than on a smartphone or a laptop screen.At the same time  almost everywhere in the world  art fairs offer to investigate this universe more deeply and to experiment with digital creation in the best possible conditions. These events provide opportunities to meet the different players who form a real 'ecosystem' and to meet the 'community' which allows digital artists to largely bypass art galleries  and which brings together entrepreneurs  developers  collectors  and enthusiasts.NFT New York  April 12-14  2023 at Times Square and Hudson Yards:www.nft.nycPompidou Center: Presentation of the first NFT acquisitions on April 8  2023: www.centrepompidou.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/CP_NFT_Acquisition_fevrier_2023__1_.pdf5. The safe way: collect a first NFT workHowever… nothing replaces the experience of a first NFT acquisition. Not only does it force you to find a work that deserves to be purchased among the millions offered on platforms like opensea.io or objkt.com  but this process also requires you to complete an unusual transaction  to say the least. Although some platforms now offer payment in euros or dollars  the vast majority of them require the creation of a (free) electronic wallet  powered by cryptocurrency. This operation may seem complicated  but it is an integral part of the universe on which crypto-art is based and therefore of the experience it offers.In the absence of galleries  artists organize their own markets  choosing what  when  and how to put their works on sale  at what price  and in what quantity. Unique digital works (1/1) are the most sought-after  but larger editions offer a more affordable opportunity to collect pieces. Among the novelties of the NFT market  the Open Editions are particularly exciting  since these projects put an unlimited number of tokens on sale at a fixed price  but for only a few days or even a few hours...The information and econometric studies produced by Artmarket.com are presented uniquely for the purpose of analyzing and understanding the statistical realities of the art market and should in no way be considered as advice or a suggestion or a solicitation to invest in the art market.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image1-weekly-nft-auction-proceeds-vs-ethereum-price.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image2-artmarket-top-10-artists-by-nft-auction-turnover-2021-2022.png]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Through the sale of the Golar Seal  the earliest vessel in our fleet to be built  we are demonstrating our disciplined approach to locking in shareholder value. The valuation highlights the re-pricing of the LNG carrier market and strategic value of such LNG infrastructure assets in providing crucial energy security. A 2.5x cash-on-cash return in little more than 12 months since CoolCo’s formation shows the considerable upside potential in our fleet. With our recently announced planned NYSE listing  we are also delivering on our intention to provide expanded access to CoolCo for US investors  broaden the investor base and drive trading liquidity in our shares. Despite seasonal market softness in the spot market for LNG carriers  the 12-month market remains strong and 2023 looks fundamentally tighter than 2022. Freeport LNG's export terminal in the US Gulf is now well into the process of restarting after several months offline  Europe will not have access to the same level of Russian pipeline gas as it previously relied upon  and Asia could soon outbid Europe for spot volumes  potentially pushing up ton miles. As one of the few listed LNG shipping companies with open tonnage this year and next  we look forward to securing additional contracts that reflect the re-priced LNG carrier charter market and realize significant value for shareholders  including for the two highly sought-after Hyundai Samho newbuildings on which we hold an option.” Financial Highlights The table below sets forth certain key financial information for Q4 2022 and FY 2022  split between Successor and Predecessor periods (as defined below). Q4 Twelve Months ended December 31  2022 (in thousands of $  except TCE) Successor Successor Predecessor Total Time and voyage charter revenues 79 032 183 567 37 289 220 856 Total operating revenues 90 255 212 978 43 456 256 434 Operating income 48 881 110 936 27 728 138 664 Net income 33 069 87 500 23 244 110 744 Adjusted EBITDA1 58 621 134 585 33 473 168 058 Average daily TCE1 (to the closest $100) 83 600 73 000 57 100 69 800 Note: The commencement of operations and funding of CoolCo and the acquisition of its initial eight TFDE LNG carriers  The Cool Pool Limited and the shipping and FSRU management organization from Golar LNG Limited (""Golar"") was completed in a phased process. It commenced with the funding of CoolCo on January 27  2022 and concluded with the acquisition of the LNG carrier and FSRU management organization on June 30  2022  with vessel acquisitions taking place on different dates over that period. Results for the twelve months that commenced January 1  2022 and ended December 31  2022 have therefore been split between the period prior to the funding of CoolCo and various phased acquisitions (the ""Predecessor"" period) and the period subsequent to the various phased acquisitions of such vessels and management entities (the ""Successor"" period). The combined results are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and consists of the aggregate of selected financial data of the Successor and Predecessor periods. No other adjustments have been made to the combined presentation. LNG Market Review The Quarter commenced with the Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") at $40/MMBtu  the Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $54/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $226 000 per day. The freight market tightened seasonally early driven by cargo values  congestion at European terminals  and traders and portfolio players using vessels as storage to profit from a winter price contango. Virtually every modern carrier was under charterer control  resulting in an illiquid market dominated by the occasional sublet. Spot rates for a TFDE vessel reached as high as around $450 000 in late October. CoolCo took this opportunity to re-charter two of its available carriers  both on three-year charters: one charter commencing at the end of October at approximately $120 000 per day  and another commencing in Q1 2023 at a rate that steps down from a high level to a lower level and averages approximately $120 000 per day over the period of the charter. By late November  an unwinding of vessels waiting to discharge in Europe  further delays to the restart of Freeport  and no arbitrage to pull cargoes east saw available vessels increase and spot rates declined from unprecedented heights  halving within two weeks. The year concluded with JKM at $28/MMBtu  TTF at $23/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $148 000 per day. Sentiment in term rates remained strong despite spot rates coming under pressure. Operational Review CoolCo's fleet continued to perform well with no technical off-hire incurred during the Quarter. No idle time ahead of the vessel contract starting in late October meant that Q4 fleet utilization was 100%. Business Development During the Quarter  CoolCo completed the acquisition of four contracted LNG carriers  the 2021 built 2-stroke Kool Orca  2020 built 2-stroke Kool Firn  and 2015 built TFDE vessels Kool Boreas and Kool Baltic. The four LNG carriers collectively add revenue backlog1 of approximately $370 million excluding options and $1.2 billion including options. The estimated 2023 Adjusted EBITDA1 attributable to these four vessels is expected to be approximately $80 million. Revenue backlog1 as of December 31  2022  from shipping fixtures to date amounts to approximately $950 million excluding options and approximately $1.68 billion including options  if exercised for the maximum duration. CoolCo has also entered into an attractive option agreement to acquire newbuild contracts for two 2-stroke LNG carriers scheduled to deliver in second half of 2024. The exercise price for each carrier is $234 million and the option is exercisable until June 30  2023. Only four to six uncontracted newbuilds deliver ahead of these two vessels and CoolCo is receiving significant interest from potential charterers seeking long-term contracts. The Company expects to agree accretive contracts and secure attractive financing prior to exercising the option. Financing and Liquidity As of December 31  2022  CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $129.1 million and total short and long-term debt  net of deferred finance charges  of $1 138.3 million. Total CoolCo Contractual Debt1 comprised of $540.4 million in respect of the six vessel bank financing facility maturing in March 2027 (the ""$570 million bank facility"")  $500.6 million in respect of the four vessel bank financing facility maturing in May 2029 (the “$520 million bank facility”)  and $210.3 million in respect of the two sale and leaseback facilities maturing in January 2025 (Ice and Kelvin). Total CoolCo Contractual Debt1 stood at $1 251.3 million. During Q4  we entered into further floating interest rate (SOFR) swap agreements for an additional notional amount of $167.2 million  resulting in the $570 million bank facility being fully hedged at an average fixed rate of 3.37% and an average all-in rate of 6.12%. The swap agreements started in October 2022  maturing in February 2027  and follow the amortization profile of the $570 million bank facility. Following the announcement in February 2023 of the sale of Golar Seal  to be completed in March 2023  cash and cash equivalents will be augmented by approximately $94.0 million of released cash  after the repayment of its associated debt of approximately $88.0 million. This provides a substantial pool of funding that can be used for the equity portion of the newbuild option  if we exercise the option  and the pursuit of other potential business development opportunities. Corporate and Other Matters As of December 31  2022  CoolCo had 53 688 462 shares issued and outstanding. Of these  26 790 545 (49.9%) were owned by EPS  4 463 846 (8.3%) were owned by Golar LNG Limited and 22 434 071 (41.8%) were publicly owned. On February 14  2023  CoolCo publicly filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)  with the intention of directly listing its shares on the NYSE. Subject to the registration statement being declared effective by the SEC  the Company’s shares are expected to be listed for trading on the NYSE from around mid-March 2023 onwards under the ticker ""CLCO"". The ticker on the Euronext Growth Oslo will therefore be changed from “COOL” to “CLCO”. No CoolCo securities will be issued in connection with the share listing on the NYSE. In line with the Company’s variable dividend policy  the Board has declared a Q4 dividend of $0.40 per ordinary share. The record date is March 3  2023 and the dividend will be paid on March 10  2023. Outlook Although the short-term market has been negatively impacted by an unwinding of the winter storage play and an easing of congestion  new developments are expected to strengthen an already tight underlying market in 2023. An increasing share of Europe’s LNG imports will be received by FSRUs where cargoes take longer to discharge. The carbon intensity indicator (“CII”) rules that came into effect on January 1 will likely reduce the trading flexibility of steam turbine vessels. A re-opening China is expected to compete for more spot traded LNG  adding ton miles as it does. Freeport is returning to market and will re-employ up to 30 vessels once fully ramped up  and there are no uncommitted newbuilds delivering this year. With two vessel openings in 2023  at a seasonally strong time of year  CoolCo is one of the only publicly listed vessel owners exposed to this market. Approximately 160 million tons of new liquefaction is scheduled to deliver between now and 2026 that will require around 200 new carriers. With around 250 LNG carriers scheduled to deliver over the same timeframe  the market at first glance looks oversupplied. There is  however  a further 175 million tons of liquefaction in the US alone progressing through the Front End Engineering and Design process  supported by a government increasingly keen to fast-track development. This  together with the replacement of older  considerably less efficient steam vessels that come off contract over the same timeframe  could absorb a further 300 new vessels. A standard spec newbuild costs around $250 million and a vessel ordered today will most likely be delivered in 2027. Limited speculative ordering and high newbuild prices mean that long-term charter rates have increased from around $75 000/day to above $90 000/day  with premiums being paid for near-term availability. Reports indicate that a 10-year charter at a rate in the region of $105 000 per day has been agreed upon for a newbuild vessel delivering early in 2024. These are both positive datapoints for the second half of 2024 when the two vessels subject to the newbuild option are scheduled to be delivered.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements which reflect management’s current expectations  estimates and projections about its operations.

The formation and funding of Cool Company Ltd. (“CoolCo” or the “Company”) and the phased acquisition of the Company’s initial eight TFDE vessels  The Cool Pool Limited  and the shipping and FSRU management organization from Golar LNG Limited commenced in January 2022 and concluded on June 30  2022. As a result of these acquisitions  results for the year ended December 31  2022 (""FY 2022"") include consolidated successor period and combined carve-out predecessor period results which on an aggregate basis represent the full year results for 2022. The three months ended December 31  2022 (""Q4"" or the ""Quarter"") only include a consolidated successor period. The subsequent acquisition of four LNG carriers on November 10  2022 from an affiliate of EPS Ventures Ltd (""EPS"")  has been treated as asset acquisitions  so the results for these four vessels are included within the successor period from the acquisition date.Q4 Highlights and Subsequent EventsGenerated total operating revenues of $90.3 million for the Quarter  compared to $65.8 million for the third quarter 2022 (""Q3"") with net income of $33.1 million and earnings per share of $0.68 for Q4;Achieved average Time Charter Equivalent Earnings (""TCE"") 1 of $83 600 per day for Q4  compared to $73 200 per day for Q3;of $83 600 per day for Q4  compared to $73 200 per day for Q3; Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $58.6 million for Q4  compared to $42.4 million for Q3;of $58.6 million for Q4  compared to $42.4 million for Q3; Commenced previously announced three-year charter from October 2022 at approximately $120 000 per day;Agreed another three-year charter that commenced in February 2023 at a rate that averages $120 000 per day over the charter period;Raised approximately $170 million in a primary equity offering on November 2  2022 to fund the equity consideration for the acquisition of four special purpose vehicles (""SPVs"")  each holding one contracted LNG carrier  for an aggregate purchase consideration of approximately $660 million on November 10  2022 (the balance was funded through the assumption of a $520 million term loan facility of which a principal repayment of approximately $20 million was made on November 14  2022);Entered into an option agreement expiring June 30  2023 to acquire two Hyundai Samho LNG carrier newbuild contracts (the ""newbuild option"") with scheduled deliveries in second half of 2024;Announced the sale of the Golar Seal in February 2023  the oldest vessel in the fleet for $184.3 million (with the buyer assuming all costs associated with the vessel’s forthcoming scheduled dry-dock)  releasing approximately $94 million  after repayment of its associated debt  that will be available to fund the acquisition of the two Hyundai Samho LNG carriers in the event the Company decides to exercise the newbuild option;Publicly filed a registration statement for direct listing of the Company's shares on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)  subject to the registration statement being declared effective  with the intention of listing around mid-March 2023 under the ticker of “CLCO” (which would be the common ticker for NYSE and Euronext Growth Oslo); andIn accordance with its dividend policy announced in the Quarter  the Company declared a dividend for Q4 of $0.40 per share  to be paid on March 10  2023 to all shareholders of record on March 3  2023.Richard Tyrrell  CEO  commented:“At its IPO a year ago  CoolCo outlined its intention to target growth by consolidation and to focus on shareholder returns by allocating its free cash-flow to equity primarily to dividends.

The combined results are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and consists of the aggregate of selected financial data of the Successor and Predecessor periods.

The carbon intensity indicator (“CII”) rules that came into effect on January 1 will likely reduce the trading flexibility of steam turbine vessels. A re-opening China is expected to compete for more spot traded LNG  adding ton miles as it does. Freeport is returning to market and will re-employ up to 30 vessels once fully ramped up  and there are no uncommitted newbuilds delivering this year. With two vessel openings in 2023  at a seasonally strong time of year  CoolCo is one of the only publicly listed vessel owners exposed to this market.Approximately 160 million tons of new liquefaction is scheduled to deliver between now and 2026 that will require around 200 new carriers. With around 250 LNG carriers scheduled to deliver over the same timeframe  the market at first glance looks oversupplied. There is  however  a further 175 million tons of liquefaction in the US alone progressing through the Front End Engineering and Design process  supported by a government increasingly keen to fast-track development. This  together with the replacement of older  considerably less efficient steam vessels that come off contract over the same timeframe  could absorb a further 300 new vessels. A standard spec newbuild costs around $250 million and a vessel ordered today will most likely be delivered in 2027. Limited speculative ordering and high newbuild prices mean that long-term charter rates have increased from around $75 000/day to above $90 000/day  with premiums being paid for near-term availability. Reports indicate that a 10-year charter at a rate in the region of $105 000 per day has been agreed upon for a newbuild vessel delivering early in 2024. These are both positive datapoints for the second half of 2024 when the two vessels subject to the newbuild option are scheduled to be delivered.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release contains forward-looking statements which reflect management’s current expectations  estimates and projections about its operations.

The annual report  including the full financial report  will be published on the Company’s website on 24 March 2023.Patrice Sellès  Chief Executive Officer of Biotalys  stated: “Despite 2022 being a tumultuous year globally and across the agricultural industry  Biotalys achieved important milestones demonstrating the ability of its AGROBODY™ technology platform to develop innovative biocontrols at scale. We believe Biotalys’ strategy and focus are fully aligned with the dawn of a new crop and food protection era  addressing both European Green Deal targets for chemical pesticide reduction and the global need to safely and sustainably feed our world.”“The regulatory procedure for our first biofungicide Evoca is still ongoing. During our dialogue with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  we have learned that additional time is required to review all submitted data. We will continue to work closely with the Agency as it completes its review  now expected for Q3 2023  to bring this innovative technology into the hands of the growers.”2022 Ope rational H ighlights (including post-period r egulatory u pdate for Evoca)Throughout the year  Biotalys made significant headway in key areas to further develop its platform and pipeline.Biotalys solidified strategic partnerships with global leaders to prepare for the market calibration of Evoca  the Company’s first biofungicide:At the start of 2022  Biotalys partnered with Olon  a world-leading bioactive manufacturing organization  to significantly scale-up the production of the active ingredient of Evoca.Biotalys appointed Kwizda Agro  an established crop protection manufacturer  as formulator of its protein-based biocontrols – critical in the supply chain for high quality products  starting with Evoca.After entering into a partnership with Novozymes  a world leader in biotech solutions  to explore additional routes to scale efficient production of the bioactive protein of Evoca  Biotalys announced the results of its successful feasibility study in H2. The study identified new  cost-effective ways to further scale the Evoca active ingredient.Evoca continued to demonstrate its efficacy in our field trial program as future valuable tool for growers seeking more sustainable solutions to control devastating fungal diseases:The field trial results based on data from grapes across vineyards in diverse climates throughout California and New York demonstrated excellent preventative control of Botrytis bunch rot in grapevines.Evoca significantly outperformed a leading chemical product when positioned at the flowering stage of grapes in a fungicide rotation program.Wine grape juice quality  vinification and wine characteristics exhibited no differences for Evoca-treated vineyards compared to non-Evoca treated vineyards.Biotalys also achieved additional technology milestones for Evoca in 2022  including:Regulatory update for EvocaBiotalys submitted its regulatory dossier to the relevant authorities in both the U.S. (in December 2020) and the E.U. (in March 2021). In view of the progress made by these authorities as communicated to the Company  Biotalys is providing the following update: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is actively reviewing the regulatory dossier  and Biotalys has addressed all requests received by the EPA to date. The Company acknowledges the breakthrough nature of the protein-based biocontrol product requires more time than originally anticipated. The Company now expects to obtain the registration for Evoca in Q3 2023. As soon as obtained  the registration will allow the use of the product in selected fruit and vegetable crops. As a reminder  the first generation of Evoca represents a market calibration product that will not generate positive cashflow margins  but will enable the Company to create market demand and introduce growers to the new product in anticipation of a commercial  profit-generating version in 2026. In the E.U.  the Board for Authorisation of Plant Protection Products (College voor Toelating van Gewasbeschermingsmiddelen or Ctgb) in The Netherlands as Rapporteur Member State is currently reviewing the regulatory dossier that Biotalys submitted for the active ingredient of Evoca. Biotalys expects to obtain the first registration in the E.U. in 2025  opening a path to launching the commercial version of Evoca in Europe in 2026.The status of Biotalys’ current pipeline of product candidates  which includes novel biofungicides  biobactericides and bio-insecticides  is as follows:The next generation of Evoca (containing the same bioactive protein  with optimized manufacturing and formulation) has progressed into the development stage and is currently expected to enter both the U.S. and the E.U. markets by 2026  subject to regulatory approval. The Company expects this next generation of Evoca to generate positive cashflow margins as production efficiency improves and market potential further develops.(containing the same bioactive protein  with optimized manufacturing and formulation) has progressed into the development stage and is currently expected to enter both the U.S. and the E.U. markets by 2026  subject to regulatory approval. The Company expects this next generation of Evoca to generate positive cashflow margins as production efficiency improves and market potential further develops. BioFun-6 continues to progress according to plan and moved into in-depth in vitro characterization in 2022  with the goal of obtaining a novel mode of action differentiating it from Evoca  opening up the new product to a wider range of crops and regions. The Company expects to move this product candidate into development stage by the end of 2023  on track to bring an additional and complementary solution to fruit and vegetables growers by 2028.continues to progress according to plan and moved into in-depth in vitro characterization in 2022  with the goal of obtaining a novel mode of action differentiating it from Evoca  opening up the new product to a wider range of crops and regions.

As the field trial program for the first generation of Evoca has been completed  the Company will now focus on testing improved product formulations and the next generation product  both in the U.S. and the E.U. In addition  Biotalys plans to test Evoca with a broader number of potential commercial partners for Europe and other regions.In addition to the ongoing internal work on the next generation of Evoca  Biotalys is also exploring strategic supply and commercialization agreements with Novozymes for a next generation of Evoca.The Company expects to advance the product pipeline in 2023 with the planned promotion of the BioFun-6 program into development stage while progressing current pipeline programs further in the discovery stage. Biotalys also aims to continue selectively leveraging its AGROBODY Foundry platform and pipeline to further expand into new markets and crops  with an increased focus on strategic collaborations that could drive additional value.The Company expects cash burn in 2023 to be slightly higher than last year (2022: €22 million)  in line with the planned investments in our pipeline  platform and manufacturing. Together with the cash and cash equivalents balance of €34 million at the end of 2022  the Company expects the financial runway to extend to mid 2024.Auditor StatementThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS  as adopted by the EU.

To help you navigate in this virtual world  and at a time when the MoMA in New York  the LACMA in Los Angeles  and the Center Pompidou in Paris are opening their collections to digital art  Artprice suggests five ways to discover art that can be transferred from owner to owner in the form of NFTs.Weekly NFT Auction Proceeds Vs Ethereum Price[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image1-weekly-nft-auction-proceeds-vs-ethereum-price.png]Top 10 artists by NFT auction turnover (2021–2022)[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image2-artmarket-top-10-artists-by-nft-auction-turnover-2021-2022.png]“Crypto-art is gradually entering museums and art history  but  for the time being  it is a form of artistic creation that is still very freely experienced on the Internet ” says Thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and founder of Artprice.“The crypto-art sphere is often described as operating like a ‘community'; the more you invest in a project  the more qualitative information you receive. This is how the Discord platform works  for example  which offers to create different more or less private chat rooms for each project. Some allow everyone to participate in the discussions  but the most interesting chat rooms are those reserved for collectors or founding members.”To give you the desire and the means to take part in this new artistic experience  which aims to bring together artists  collectors  graphic designers  developers  and many others  Artprice recommends five ways to dive into this universe and start your adventure.1. The continuous way: following artists on TwitterDespite the many criticisms made of Twitter  Elon Musk's platform remains the royal road of Web3. Not only do digital artists use this channel to present their works as and when they are created  but they also relay the posts in which they – and all those they like – are quoted. Each page  therefore  contains countless dynamic links to other artists and other works  but also to collectors  curators  marketplaces  etc.To start with  one can follow any of the top performing NFT artists at auction that Artprice lists in its annual reports. The major auction houses are indeed doing valuable work by selecting NFT works that meet the same requirements as the traditional art market. But  as one thing leads to another in the digital world  and one artist leads to another  Twitter then makes it possible to continuously discover new works and new creators  but also to be the first to know about upcoming projects.Robbie Barrett: https://twitter.com/videodromeIX SHELLS: https://twitter.com/ix_shells2. The studious way: reading articles and interviewsThe decisions by Christie's  Sotheby's  Phillips  Bonhams but also Fauve  Van Ham  Millon  and many other auction operators to amply include NFT lots in their sales proves – even if it no longer needs to be proved – the seriousness of NFT technology and the artistic creation it allows. The most prestigious galleries  like Pace and Gagosian  have also understood this  yet few media dare to offer any real artistic critique of NFT projects. This work (art criticism)  so crucial to art history  would undoubtedly make a better appreciation of the approaches taken by digital artists and of their relationships to Blockchain technology  and to the ‘communities' that support them.Faced with the multiplication of marketplaces  crypto-art needs space and time for reflection  to understand and digest innovative practices at the frontier of technology  as the projects of these artists gain in depth and intensity. Artprice offers two articles that capture the work of key digital artists in the NFT universe.Artforum : Hack the Planet  Hans Ulrich Obrist talks with Pak : www.artforum.com/print/202207/hans-ulrich-obrist-talks-with-pak-88907Right Click And Save: An Interview with XCOPY :www.rightclicksave.com/article/an-interview-with-xcopy3. The prospective way: surveying major collectionsTransparency is one of the main credos of the Blockchain and as such  it is possible to consult the collection to which each work belongs  to discover other works that the same entity collects... and so on. True  the real identity of collectors often remains anonymous or hides behind a pseudonym  and yes  NFTs can be transferred from one wallet to another to increase security and cover their tracks  but there is always a way to reconstitute their history.The most dynamic collectors have also become the true tutelary figures of crypto-art. Until museums and galleries become active in this universe  the major collectors of NFTs still have a very substantial influence  whether by sharing their favorites on social media  collaborating with artists  or exhibiting their collections in virtual universes or physical places as the prestigious Art Basel Miami or by offering them for sale via traditional auction houses.Cozomo di Medici: “For over 700 years  we have loved the jpegs”:https://opensea.io/Cozomo_de_MediciMax Stealth: “A Timeless Collection”:www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2022/inside-the-world-of-maxstealth-a-timeless-collection4. The traditional way: visiting physical eventsCrypto-art is now coming to public places  galleries  and museums. From the great hall of the MoMA to Times Square  digital art is gradually investing some of the biggest screens on the planet and some of the most prestigious museums. Advertising spaces and exhibition halls are coming together for the first time in history  no doubt  to show a new type of work  at the crossroads of art and technology  which sometimes looks a whole lot better on a big screen than on a smartphone or a laptop screen.At the same time  almost everywhere in the world  art fairs offer to investigate this universe more deeply and to experiment with digital creation in the best possible conditions. These events provide opportunities to meet the different players who form a real ‘ecosystem' and to meet the ‘community' which allows digital artists to largely bypass art galleries  and which brings together entrepreneurs  developers  collectors  and enthusiasts.NFT New York  April 12-14  2023 at Times Square and Hudson Yards:www.nft.nycPompidou Center: Presentation of the first NFT acquisitions on April 8  2023: www.centrepompidou.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/CP_NFT_Acquisition_fevrier_2023__1_.pdf5. The safe way: collect a first NFT workHowever… nothing replaces the experience of a first NFT acquisition. Not only does it force you to find a work that deserves to be purchased among the millions offered on platforms like opensea.io or objkt.com  but this process also requires you to complete an unusual transaction  to say the least. Although some platforms now offer payment in euros or dollars  the vast majority of them require the creation of a (free) electronic wallet  powered by cryptocurrency. This operation may seem complicated  but it is an integral part of the universe on which crypto-art is based and therefore of the experience it offers.In the absence of galleries  artists organize their own markets  choosing what  when  and how to put their works on sale  at what price  and in what quantity. Unique digital works (1/1) are the most sought-after  but larger editions offer a more affordable opportunity to collect pieces. Among the novelties of the NFT market  the Open Editions are particularly exciting  since these projects put an unlimited number of tokens on sale at a fixed price  but for only a few days or even a few hours...The information and econometric studies produced by Artmarket.com are presented uniquely for the purpose of analyzing and understanding the statistical realities of the art market and should in no way be considered as advice or a suggestion or a solicitation to invest in the art market.Images:[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image1-weekly-nft-auction-proceeds-vs-ethereum-price.png ][ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image2-artmarket-top-10-artists-by-nft-auction-turnover-2021-2022.png ]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

In 2022  the Group returned to growth  at +1.3% at constant currency  and achieved all its financial objectives with a clear improvement in all KPIs in the second half of the year. In particular  Evidian started to accelerate its profitable growth and Tech Foundations delivered fast and tangible first results on its strategic roadmap  turning profitable three years ahead of plan.We embrace 2023 with confidence. Our envisioned separation  towards which we have achieved significant progress within only eight months of its announcement  will be a turning point in the Group’s history  unleashing the full potential of both future entities and maximizing value for all our stakeholders. Despite an uncertain macroeconomic context  we see a wealth of opportunities ahead of us and are confident in our capacity to continue improving our performance through 2023. We are laying strong foundations for renewed success  for Atos today and  tomorrow  for both the Evidian and the Tech Foundations perimeters.”In € million 2022 2021 Change Change at cst. currency Revenue 11 341 10 839 +4.6% +1.3% Operating Margin 356 383 In % of revenue 3.1% 3.5% -40 bps -60 bps OMDA 1 020 1 095 In % of revenue 9.0% 10.1% -110 bps Normalized Net income (loss) -28 -215 Net income (loss) -1 012 -2 962 Free Cash Flow - excluding costs of transformation plan -58 -419 Free Cash Flow -187 -419 Net debt 1 450 1 2262022 performance highlightsGroup revenue was € 11 341 million in 2022  up +4.6% compared to 2021. At constant currency  revenue grew +1.3%  at the high end of the Group’s guidance  with an organic stabilization over the full year (+0.1%) and a +1.2% contribution from acquisitions net of disposals. Organic growth turned positive in H2  at +2.3%  with a strong Q4 at +4.6%1. Evidian’s revenue was € 5 315 million  growing +4.8% at constant currency and +2.0% organically. Organic growth accelerated in H2  to +5.4% (Q4 at +11.0%)  driven by the ramp-up of Advanced Computing  steady strong growth in cybersecurity services where Evidian capitalizes on global leadership  and an acceleration in Digital. Tech Foundations’ revenue was € 6 026 million  decreasing by only -1.6% organically  a sharp improvement compared to 2021 (-11.4%). Following an earlier-than-anticipated stabilization in Q3  Tech Foundations accelerated the rationalization of its portfolio in Q4  particularly in BPO and value-added resale. Excluding non-strategic activities (BPO  VAR  UCC)  Tech Foundations’ Q4 organic growth was +1.0%2.Operating margin was € 356 million  or 3.1% of revenue. In a context of high-cost inflation (salaries  energy) and supply chain tensions  Atos managed to drastically improve its operating margin in H2  to 5.1%  after 1.1% in H1  thanks to vigorous performance improvement actions focused on structure costs (unwinding of the Spring program  selective hirings  better cost discipline)  underperforming contracts and pricing. Over the full year  Evidian’s operating margin was € 276 million  or 5.2% of revenue. Tech Foundations’ operating margin turned positive in 2022  three years ahead of plan  to € 79 million or 1.3% of revenue.Free cash flow was €-187 million in 2022  including € 129 million of costs related to the Group’s transformation plan. Excluding these costs  Free cash flow was € -58 million  a strong improvement compared to 2021 thanks to a strict control of working capital  as well as a € 60 million refund related to the early termination of the German restructuring plan announced in July 2021.Net debt was €-1 450 million at the end of December 2022  or 2.4x pre IFRS 16 OMDA  providing ample headroom to the Group’s bank debt covenant of 3.75x. Having successfully refinanced its bank debt in July 2022  Atos is adequately funded. The Group’s liquidity remains solid  with € 3.3 billion of gross cash and €2.0 billion of undrawn credit facilities at end December 2022.Book-to-bill rebounded sharply in Q4  to 112%  compared to 71% in Q3  with both perimeters improving markedly. Evidian’s book-to-bill was 130% in Q4  driven by both Digital and BDS. Tech Foundations started to reap the benefits of its refocused commercial strategy  with Q4 book-to-bill at 94%  driven by large contracts and a sharp increase in net new logos. This renewed commercial traction demonstrates Atos’ strong positions in its core markets and the intact attractiveness of the Group’s offering.Delivering on our transformation projectSignificant progress achieved in carve-out preparation  clear path for completion in H2 2023In June 2022  Atos announced its intention to split into two publicly listed entities  both strong leaders in their respective markets  in order to unlock value and implement an ambitious transformation plan. Within eight months of this announcement  the Group has already made significant progress and is on track to decide on the separation project for a completion in the second half of 2023.Started on September 7  2022  the information and consultation process of Atos’ European works councils (SEC) was completed within three months  with good collaboration  and represents a major milestone in Atos’ transformation project. In parallel  local consultation processes have also been completed in all 31 countries where such consultations were required. As a result  Atos now has a clear path to complete its separation into two listed entities (subject to final confirmation by its board of directors and shareholder approval  among other customary conditions)  and to accelerate the implementation of its transformation plan.All internal separation workstreams are progressing as planned  across four pillars: (i) go-to-market and commercial continuity  (ii) carve-out operations covering tax and legal structuring  strategic agreements  and preparation of carve-out financial statements  as well as Day-1 operational readiness  (iii) operating model and support functions set-up and (iv) program coordination and change management.Evidian: strong value proposition around clear distinctive factorsIn 2022  Evidian has implemented a clear roadmap to increase the synergies between its digital  cloud and big data & security core activities  and to leverage its unique combination of services and high-end technologies across the full digital continuum. This roadmap will position Evidian as a leading provider of high-value-added services and solutions to customers who are increasingly mindful of sovereignty and security issues. In parallel  Evidian accelerated the development of its global offshore and nearshore centers  to reinforce its delivery capabilities.Tech Foundations: fast and tangible first results on turnaround planTech Foundations is delivering on its announced strategy and objectives. In 2022  the business line mobilized its teams around an ambitious turnaround plan and started to gradually rebuild a robust commercial pipeline. In parallel  Tech Foundations has positioned its portfolio to be the partner of choice for digital services and infrastructure modernization  leveraging its strength in private and hybrid cloud  employee experience and innovative offerings focused on reducing IT carbon footprint. A comprehensive set of actions were initiated to reduce underperforming contracts and their associated losses  particularly in BPO  and to gradually wind down the value-added resale activity  and to dispose of the UCC business. Major steps were taken to reduce costs  with the first tangible results achieved in H2  as Tech Foundations’ operating margin turned positive three years ahead of plan.c.80% of the €700 million divestment program already securedOn June 14  2022  Atos announced a divestment program of non-core businesses representing around €700 million of expected proceeds  as part of the financing of its transformation plan. Eight months later  the Group has already secured c.80% of the €700 million expected proceeds  demonstrating Atos’ ability to execute in a swift and efficient manner.Transactions finalized or secured as of today include the sale of Atos’ 2.5% stake in Worldline on the stock market in June 2022  and the projected sale  at attractive conditions for the Group  of Atos Italia3 in November 2022  and the Unified Communications & Collaboration business in January 2023. Both transactions are subject to the consultation of relevant employee representative bodies and other customary regulatory approvals and are expected to close in H1 and H2 2023  respectively.Discussions with Airbus to form a long-term strategic and technological partnership and to sell a minority stake in EvidianOn February 16  2023  Atos announced that it had received an indicative non-binding offer from Airbus to enter into a long-term strategic and technological agreement and to acquire a minority stake of 29.9% in Evidian. This proposal is consistent with Atos’ separation plan as announced.Atos Board of Directors decided to further engage with Airbus to discuss  allow a due-diligence process and negotiate on mutually satisfactory terms on both a long-term strategic and technological partnership and the sale of the 29.9% stake in Evidian.Discussions are ongoing  on a non-exclusive basis. No assurances can be made that the parties will successfully negotiate and enter into a definitive set of agreements. Atos remains committed to examining received indications of interest from partners that can support a major financial and industrial project.2023 outlookDigital transformation  cybersecurity and big data markets are expected to continue growing at a strong pace despite a more challenging macroeconomic context. In 2023  Evidian will focus on deploying its new value proposition and offerings  maximizing synergies  and leveraging a joint go-to-market across its unique array of expertise. At the same time  Evidian will continue to enhance its sales and delivery capabilities  driving an acceleration of its profitable growth in 2023.Following a better-than-anticipated performance in 2022  Tech Foundations will continue the fast implementation of its turnaround plan. With a strong focus on business selectivity and quality  Tech Foundations will accelerate the reshaping of its portfolio  resulting in a managed revenue decrease in 2023 in non-strategic activities  while core business revenue will be stabilized. In parallel  Tech Foundations will step up the adaptation of its cost structure  with benefits offsetting the impacts of lower revenue  investment in sales and portfolio and inflationary pressure.In 2023  Group revenue organic growth is expected between -1.0% and +1.0%  as an acceleration of Evidian’s organic growth will be offset by the managed reduction of Tech Foundations’ revenue resulting from portfolio reshaping.Group operating margin4 is expected at 4% to 5%. Evidian’s operating margin is expected to increase compared to 2022. Tech Foundations’ operating margin is expected to remain in positive territories  well ahead of plan.On track with 2026 objectivesEvidian and Tech Foundations are well on track to achieve their 2026 objectives. In particular  Tech Foundations is performing better than planned as of today  with operating margin turned positive as soon as 2022. Each company will present more detailed guidance  including on cash generation  during Investor Days to be held prior to the contemplated spin-off.Operating Margin to Operating IncomeIn € million 2022 2021 Operating margin 356 383 Reorganization -352 -312 Rationalization and associated costs -69 -81 Integration and acquisition costs -30 -44 Amortization of intangible assets (PPA from acquisitions) -140 -151 Equity based compensation -25 -34 Impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets -177 -1 490 Other items -359 -1 039 Operating income (loss) -795 -2 768In addition to the costs of workforce adaptation measures already planned at the beginning of 2022  and mostly executed in H1  Reorganization costs included €-266 million of costs related to Atos’ envisioned transformation plan.

Such acceleration was driven by (i) a pick-up in Advanced Computing  with a ramp up of HPC revenue following the strong order entry recorded in Q2  and an increase in high-end servers sales  (ii) a steady strong growth in cybersecurity services  and (iii) an improvement at Digital with a good performance in digital transformation services.Evidian’s operating margin was € 276 million  or 5.2% of revenue. Following a low H1  at 3.5%  Evidian’s operating margin was 6.7% in H2. On top of usual seasonality  this increase resulted from cost take-out actions  higher pricing  better utilization of billable resources and higher fixed costs absorption in Advanced Computing. These positive impacts were mitigated by incremental salary inflation  as anticipated.Tech FoundationsTech Foundations’ revenue was € 6 026 million in 2022  declining by -1.6% organically  a sharp improvement compared to 2021 (-11.4%). Following an earlier-than-anticipated stabilization in Q3  revenue was down -1.2% organically in Q4  against a favourable comparison basis  driven by drastic portfolio rationalization actions  as Tech Foundations started to tackle underperforming contracts  particularly in the BPO activity  and to wind down its value-added resale business. The core infrastructure business reported a much more contained decline than in 2021  of c. -5% excluding value-added resale  back in line with global infrastructure market trends. Digital Workplace recorded robust growth  leveraging Atos’ global leadership in this activity; Professional Services grew strongly  driven by high staff demand  while UCC contracted  primarily due to persisting supply chain disruptions.Tech Foundations’ operating margin broke even in 2022  three years ahead of plan  at € 79 million or 1.3% of revenue. Vigorous performance actions focused on structure costs and underperforming contracts yielded tangible results in H2  partly offset by cost inflation-related headwinds.2022 performance by Regional Business UnitRevenue Operating margin Operating margin % In € million 2022 2021* Change at constant currency Change Organic 2022 2021* 2022 2021* Americas 2 866 2 841 +0.9% -1.7% 222 302 7.7% 10.6% Northern Europe & APAC 3 199 3 109 +2.9% +1.4% 115 87 3.6% 2.8% Central Europe 2 588 2 609 -0.8% -0.4% -10 34 -0.4% 1.3% Southern Europe 2 420 2 418 +0.1% +0.2% 106 54 4.4% 2.2% Others & Global Structures 269 224 +20.2% +7.7% -78 -65 -29.0% -29.2% Total 11 341 11 201 +1.3% +0.1% 356 412 3.1% 3.7% *At constant currencyAmericas: revenue was up +0.9% at constant currency  driven by the contribution of recent acquisitions in multi-cloud services in Digital. Digital activities were broadly stable  Advanced Computing was up with the delivery of an HPC to a Brazilian petroleum corporation. Infrastructure services declined in line with their underlying market. Operating margin was maintained at a high level despite high personal costs inflation  thanks to the first benefits of cost structure adaptation.Northern Europe & APAC: revenue was up +2.9% at constant currency compared to 2021. In addition to the contribution of Cloudreach  Digital activities were driven by strong demand in application services  in particular from the public sector. Tech Foundations activities were broadly stable  with new logos in digital workplace and infrastructure services  and so were BDS activities despite fluctuations in the Advanced Computing business  thanks to robust trends in Cybersecurity. Operating margin improved to 3.6% in 2022  thanks to management actions conducted in H2 to improve delivery  reduce costs and increase pricing.Central Europe: revenue decreased by -0.8% at constant currency  with however material growth in H2. Digital activities benefitted from new contracts in the public and automotive sectors. Cybersecurity recorded robust growth  partly offset by fluctuations in Advanced Computing. Tech Foundations contracted driven by hardware shortages in UCC  however at a much reduced rate compared with 2021. Operating margin was -0.4% over the full year  improving strongly in H2 thanks to the reduction in underperforming contracts  cost structure adjustments  and an improved top line momentum on the back of new business.Southern Europe: revenue was up +0.1% at constant currency. Growth in Big data and Cybersecurity  supported by a new EuroHPC supercomputer contract in Spain and mission critical systems expansion in aerospace  was offset by the deliberate wind down of value-added resale. Digital activities were slightly up and Tech Foundations activities excluding VAR were stable. Operating margin improved to 4.4% in 2022 thanks to renegotiation of underperforming contracts  better pricing and improved business mix.Others: encompass Middle East  Africa  Major Events as well as two cost centers: the Group’s global delivery centers and global structures.

In 2022  the Group returned to growth  at +1.3% at constant currency  and achieved all its financial objectives with a clear improvement in all KPIs in the second half of the year. In particular  Evidian started to accelerate its profitable growth and Tech Foundations delivered fast and tangible first results on its strategic roadmap  turning profitable three years ahead of plan.We embrace 2023 with confidence. Our envisioned separation  towards which we have achieved significant progress within only eight months of its announcement  will be a turning point in the Group’s history  unleashing the full potential of both future entities and maximizing value for all our stakeholders. Despite an uncertain macroeconomic context  we see a wealth of opportunities ahead of us and are confident in our capacity to continue improving our performance through 2023. We are laying strong foundations for renewed success  for Atos today and  tomorrow  for both the Evidian and the Tech Foundations perimeters.”In € million 2022 2021 Change Change at cst. currency Revenue 11 341 10 839 +4.6% +1.3% Operating Margin 356 383 In % of revenue 3.1% 3.5% -40 bps -60 bps OMDA 1 020 1 095 In % of revenue 9.0% 10.1% -110 bps Normalized Net income (loss) -28 -215 Net income (loss) -1 012 -2 962 Free Cash Flow - excluding costs of transformation plan -58 -419 Free Cash Flow -187 -419 Net debt 1 450 1 2262022 performance highlightsGroup revenue was € 11 341 million in 2022  up +4.6% compared to 2021. At constant currency  revenue grew +1.3%  at the high end of the Group’s guidance  with an organic stabilization over the full year (+0.1%) and a +1.2% contribution from acquisitions net of disposals. Organic growth turned positive in H2  at +2.3%  with a strong Q4 at +4.6%1. Evidian’s revenue was € 5 315 million  growing +4.8% at constant currency and +2.0% organically. Organic growth accelerated in H2  to +5.4% (Q4 at +11.0%)  driven by the ramp-up of Advanced Computing  steady strong growth in cybersecurity services where Evidian capitalizes on global leadership  and an acceleration in Digital. Tech Foundations’ revenue was € 6 026 million  decreasing by only -1.6% organically  a sharp improvement compared to 2021 (-11.4%). Following an earlier-than-anticipated stabilization in Q3  Tech Foundations accelerated the rationalization of its portfolio in Q4  particularly in BPO and value-added resale. Excluding non-strategic activities (BPO  VAR  UCC)  Tech Foundations’ Q4 organic growth was +1.0%2.Operating margin was € 356 million  or 3.1% of revenue. In a context of high-cost inflation (salaries  energy) and supply chain tensions  Atos managed to drastically improve its operating margin in H2  to 5.1%  after 1.1% in H1  thanks to vigorous performance improvement actions focused on structure costs (unwinding of the Spring program  selective hirings  better cost discipline)  underperforming contracts and pricing. Over the full year  Evidian’s operating margin was € 276 million  or 5.2% of revenue. Tech Foundations’ operating margin turned positive in 2022  three years ahead of plan  to € 79 million or 1.3% of revenue.Free cash flow was €-187 million in 2022  including € 129 million of costs related to the Group’s transformation plan. Excluding these costs  Free cash flow was € -58 million  a strong improvement compared to 2021 thanks to a strict control of working capital  as well as a € 60 million refund related to the early termination of the German restructuring plan announced in July 2021.Net debt was €-1 450 million at the end of December 2022  or 2.4x pre IFRS 16 OMDA  providing ample headroom to the Group’s bank debt covenant of 3.75x. Having successfully refinanced its bank debt in July 2022  Atos is adequately funded. The Group’s liquidity remains solid  with € 3.3 billion of gross cash and €2.0 billion of undrawn credit facilities at end December 2022.Book-to-bill rebounded sharply in Q4  to 112%  compared to 71% in Q3  with both perimeters improving markedly. Evidian’s book-to-bill was 130% in Q4  driven by both Digital and BDS. Tech Foundations started to reap the benefits of its refocused commercial strategy  with Q4 book-to-bill at 94%  driven by large contracts and a sharp increase in net new logos. This renewed commercial traction demonstrates Atos’ strong positions in its core markets and the intact attractiveness of the Group’s offering.Delivering on our transformation projectSignificant progress achieved in carve-out preparation  clear path for completion in H2 2023In June 2022  Atos announced its intention to split into two publicly listed entities  both strong leaders in their respective markets  in order to unlock value and implement an ambitious transformation plan. Within eight months of this announcement  the Group has already made significant progress and is on track to decide on the separation project for a completion in the second half of 2023.Started on September 7  2022  the information and consultation process of Atos’ European works councils (SEC) was completed within three months  with good collaboration  and represents a major milestone in Atos’ transformation project. In parallel  local consultation processes have also been completed in all 31 countries where such consultations were required. As a result  Atos now has a clear path to complete its separation into two listed entities (subject to final confirmation by its board of directors and shareholder approval  among other customary conditions)  and to accelerate the implementation of its transformation plan.All internal separation workstreams are progressing as planned  across four pillars: (i) go-to-market and commercial continuity  (ii) carve-out operations covering tax and legal structuring  strategic agreements  and preparation of carve-out financial statements  as well as Day-1 operational readiness  (iii) operating model and support functions set-up and (iv) program coordination and change management.Evidian: strong value proposition around clear distinctive factorsIn 2022  Evidian has implemented a clear roadmap to increase the synergies between its digital  cloud and big data & security core activities  and to leverage its unique combination of services and high-end technologies across the full digital continuum. This roadmap will position Evidian as a leading provider of high-value-added services and solutions to customers who are increasingly mindful of sovereignty and security issues. In parallel  Evidian accelerated the development of its global offshore and nearshore centers  to reinforce its delivery capabilities.Tech Foundations: fast and tangible first results on turnaround planTech Foundations is delivering on its announced strategy and objectives. In 2022  the business line mobilized its teams around an ambitious turnaround plan and started to gradually rebuild a robust commercial pipeline. In parallel  Tech Foundations has positioned its portfolio to be the partner of choice for digital services and infrastructure modernization  leveraging its strength in private and hybrid cloud  employee experience and innovative offerings focused on reducing IT carbon footprint. A comprehensive set of actions were initiated to reduce underperforming contracts and their associated losses  particularly in BPO  and to gradually wind down the value-added resale activity  and to dispose of the UCC business. Major steps were taken to reduce costs  with the first tangible results achieved in H2  as Tech Foundations’ operating margin turned positive three years ahead of plan.c.80% of the €700 million divestment program already securedOn June 14  2022  Atos announced a divestment program of non-core businesses representing around €700 million of expected proceeds  as part of the financing of its transformation plan. Eight months later  the Group has already secured c.80% of the €700 million expected proceeds  demonstrating Atos’ ability to execute in a swift and efficient manner.Transactions finalized or secured as of today include the sale of Atos’ 2.5% stake in Worldline on the stock market in June 2022  and the projected sale  at attractive conditions for the Group  of Atos Italia3 in November 2022  and the Unified Communications & Collaboration business in January 2023. Both transactions are subject to the consultation of relevant employee representative bodies and other customary regulatory approvals and are expected to close in H1 and H2 2023  respectively.Discussions with Airbus to form a long-term strategic and technological partnership and to sell a minority stake in EvidianOn February 16  2023  Atos announced that it had received an indicative non-binding offer from Airbus to enter into a long-term strategic and technological agreement and to acquire a minority stake of 29.9% in Evidian. This proposal is consistent with Atos’ separation plan as announced.Atos Board of Directors decided to further engage with Airbus to discuss  allow a due-diligence process and negotiate on mutually satisfactory terms on both a long-term strategic and technological partnership and the sale of the 29.9% stake in Evidian.Discussions are ongoing  on a non-exclusive basis. No assurances can be made that the parties will successfully negotiate and enter into a definitive set of agreements. Atos remains committed to examining received indications of interest from partners that can support a major financial and industrial project.2023 outlookDigital transformation  cybersecurity and big data markets are expected to continue growing at a strong pace despite a more challenging macroeconomic context. In 2023  Evidian will focus on deploying its new value proposition and offerings  maximizing synergies  and leveraging a joint go-to-market across its unique array of expertise. At the same time  Evidian will continue to enhance its sales and delivery capabilities  driving an acceleration of its profitable growth in 2023.Following a better-than-anticipated performance in 2022  Tech Foundations will continue the fast implementation of its turnaround plan. With a strong focus on business selectivity and quality  Tech Foundations will accelerate the reshaping of its portfolio  resulting in a managed revenue decrease in 2023 in non-strategic activities  while core business revenue will be stabilized. In parallel  Tech Foundations will step up the adaptation of its cost structure  with benefits offsetting the impacts of lower revenue  investment in sales and portfolio and inflationary pressure.In 2023  Group revenue organic growth is expected between -1.0% and +1.0%  as an acceleration of Evidian’s organic growth will be offset by the managed reduction of Tech Foundations’ revenue resulting from portfolio reshaping.Group operating margin4 is expected at 4% to 5%. Evidian’s operating margin is expected to increase compared to 2022. Tech Foundations’ operating margin is expected to remain in positive territories  well ahead of plan.On track with 2026 objectivesEvidian and Tech Foundations are well on track to achieve their 2026 objectives. In particular  Tech Foundations is performing better than planned as of today  with operating margin turned positive as soon as 2022. Each company will present more detailed guidance  including on cash generation  during Investor Days to be held prior to the contemplated spin-off.Operating Margin to Operating IncomeIn € million 2022 2021 Operating margin 356 383 Reorganization -352 -312 Rationalization and associated costs -69 -81 Integration and acquisition costs -30 -44 Amortization of intangible assets (PPA from acquisitions) -140 -151 Equity based compensation -25 -34 Impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets -177 -1 490 Other items -359 -1 039 Operating income (loss) -795 -2 768In addition to the costs of workforce adaptation measures already planned at the beginning of 2022  and mostly executed in H1  Reorganization costs included €-266 million of costs related to Atos’ envisioned transformation plan.

Book-to-bill improved markedly in Q4  to 112%  compared to 71% in Q3.Full backlog at the end of December 2022  amounted to €21.2 billion  down €3.2 billion compared to the end of December 2021  including € 1.9 billion of corrections pertaining to prior periods and partly due the exit of underperforming contracts. Backlog at the end of December represented 1.9 years of revenue. The full qualified pipeline was €6.6 billion  slightly down compared to the end of December 2021  and representing 7.0 months of revenue.Human resourcesThe total headcount was 110 797 at the end of December 2022  up +1.5% compared to 109 135 at the end of December 2021 (+1.7% organically).In 2022  the Group hired 29 458 employees (16 089 in H1  13 369 in H2). 62% of hirings were in offshore and nearshore countries.

Such acceleration was driven by (i) a pick-up in Advanced Computing  with a ramp up of HPC revenue following the strong order entry recorded in Q2  and an increase in high-end servers sales  (ii) a steady strong growth in cybersecurity services  and (iii) an improvement at Digital with a good performance in digital transformation services.Evidian’s operating margin was € 276 million  or 5.2% of revenue. Following a low H1  at 3.5%  Evidian’s operating margin was 6.7% in H2. On top of usual seasonality  this increase resulted from cost take-out actions  higher pricing  better utilization of billable resources and higher fixed costs absorption in Advanced Computing. These positive impacts were mitigated by incremental salary inflation  as anticipated.Tech FoundationsTech Foundations’ revenue was € 6 026 million in 2022  declining by -1.6% organically  a sharp improvement compared to 2021 (-11.4%). Following an earlier-than-anticipated stabilization in Q3  revenue was down -1.2% organically in Q4  against a favourable comparison basis  driven by drastic portfolio rationalization actions  as Tech Foundations started to tackle underperforming contracts  particularly in the BPO activity  and to wind down its value-added resale business. The core infrastructure business reported a much more contained decline than in 2021  of c. -5% excluding value-added resale  back in line with global infrastructure market trends. Digital Workplace recorded robust growth  leveraging Atos’ global leadership in this activity; Professional Services grew strongly  driven by high staff demand  while UCC contracted  primarily due to persisting supply chain disruptions.Tech Foundations’ operating margin broke even in 2022  three years ahead of plan  at € 79 million or 1.3% of revenue. Vigorous performance actions focused on structure costs and underperforming contracts yielded tangible results in H2  partly offset by cost inflation-related headwinds.2022 performance by Regional Business UnitRevenue Operating margin Operating margin % In € million 2022 2021* Change at constant currency Change Organic 2022 2021* 2022 2021* Americas 2 866 2 841 +0.9% -1.7% 222 302 7.7% 10.6% Northern Europe & APAC 3 199 3 109 +2.9% +1.4% 115 87 3.6% 2.8% Central Europe 2 588 2 609 -0.8% -0.4% -10 34 -0.4% 1.3% Southern Europe 2 420 2 418 +0.1% +0.2% 106 54 4.4% 2.2% Others & Global Structures 269 224 +20.2% +7.7% -78 -65 -29.0% -29.2% Total 11 341 11 201 +1.3% +0.1% 356 412 3.1% 3.7% *At constant currencyAmericas: revenue was up +0.9% at constant currency  driven by the contribution of recent acquisitions in multi-cloud services in Digital. Digital activities were broadly stable  Advanced Computing was up with the delivery of an HPC to a Brazilian petroleum corporation. Infrastructure services declined in line with their underlying market. Operating margin was maintained at a high level despite high personal costs inflation  thanks to the first benefits of cost structure adaptation.Northern Europe & APAC: revenue was up +2.9% at constant currency compared to 2021. In addition to the contribution of Cloudreach  Digital activities were driven by strong demand in application services  in particular from the public sector. Tech Foundations activities were broadly stable  with new logos in digital workplace and infrastructure services  and so were BDS activities despite fluctuations in the Advanced Computing business  thanks to robust trends in Cybersecurity. Operating margin improved to 3.6% in 2022  thanks to management actions conducted in H2 to improve delivery  reduce costs and increase pricing.Central Europe: revenue decreased by -0.8% at constant currency  with however material growth in H2. Digital activities benefitted from new contracts in the public and automotive sectors. Cybersecurity recorded robust growth  partly offset by fluctuations in Advanced Computing. Tech Foundations contracted driven by hardware shortages in UCC  however at a much reduced rate compared with 2021. Operating margin was -0.4% over the full year  improving strongly in H2 thanks to the reduction in underperforming contracts  cost structure adjustments  and an improved top line momentum on the back of new business.Southern Europe: revenue was up +0.1% at constant currency. Growth in Big data and Cybersecurity  supported by a new EuroHPC supercomputer contract in Spain and mission critical systems expansion in aerospace  was offset by the deliberate wind down of value-added resale. Digital activities were slightly up and Tech Foundations activities excluding VAR were stable.

To help you navigate in this virtual world  and at a time when the MoMA in New York  the LACMA in Los Angeles  and the Center Pompidou in Paris are opening their collections to digital art  Artprice suggests five ways to discover art that can be transferred from owner to owner in the form of NFTs.Weekly NFT Auction Proceeds Vs Ethereum Price Top 10 artists by NFT auction turnover (2021–2022)Weekly NFT Auction Proceeds Vs Ethereum PriceInfographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2010704/Weekly_NFT_Auction_Infographic.jpgTop 10 artists by NFT auction turnover (2021–2022)Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2010705/Top_10_artists_Infographic.jpg""Crypto-art is gradually entering museums and art history  but  for the time being  it is a form of artistic creation that is still very freely experienced on the Internet "" says Thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and founder of Artprice.""The crypto-art sphere is often described as operating like a 'community'; the more you invest in a project  the more qualitative information you receive. This is how the Discord platform works  for example  which offers to create different more or less private chat rooms for each project. Some allow everyone to participate in the discussions  but the most interesting chat rooms are those reserved for collectors or founding members.""To give you the desire and the means to take part in this new artistic experience  which aims to bring together artists  collectors  graphic designers  developers  and many others  Artprice recommends five ways to dive into this universe and start your adventure.1. The continuous way: following artists on TwitterDespite the many criticisms made of Twitter  Elon Musk's platform remains the royal road of Web3. Not only do digital artists use this channel to present their works as and when they are created  but they also relay the posts in which they – and all those they like – are quoted. Each page  therefore  contains countless dynamic links to other artists and other works  but also to collectors  curators  marketplaces  etc.To start with  one can follow any of the top performing NFT artists at auction that Artprice lists in its annual reports. The major auction houses are indeed doing valuable work by selecting NFT works that meet the same requirements as the traditional art market. But  as one thing leads to another in the digital world  and one artist leads to another  Twitter then makes it possible to continuously discover new works and new creators  but also to be the first to know about upcoming projects.Robbie Barrett:https://twitter.com/videodromeIX SHELLS: https://twitter.com/ix_shells2. The studious way: reading articles and interviewsThe decisions by Christie's  Sotheby's  Phillips  Bonhams but also Fauve  Van Ham  Millon  and many other auction operators to amply include NFT lots in their sales proves – even if it no longer needs to be proved – the seriousness of NFT technology and the artistic creation it allows. The most prestigious galleries  like Pace and Gagosian  have also understood this  yet few media dare to offer any real artistic critique of NFT projects. This work (art criticism)  so crucial to art history  would undoubtedly make a better appreciation of the approaches taken by digital artists and of their relationships to Blockchain technology  and to the 'communities' that support them.Faced with the multiplication of marketplaces  crypto-art needs space and time for reflection  to understand and digest innovative practices at the frontier of technology  as the projects of these artists gain in depth and intensity. Artprice offers two articles that capture the work of key digital artists in the NFT universe.Artforum : Hack the Planet  Hans Ulrich Obrist talks with Pak : www.artforum.com/print/202207/hans-ulrich-obrist-talks-with-pak-88907Right Click And Save: An Interview with XCOPY :www.rightclicksave.com/article/an-interview-with-xcopy3. The prospective way: surveying major collectionsTransparency is one of the main credos of the Blockchain and as such  it is possible to consult the collection to which each work belongs  to discover other works that the same entity collects... and so on. True  the real identity of collectors often remains anonymous or hides behind a pseudonym  and yes  NFTs can be transferred from one wallet to another to increase security and cover their tracks  but there is always a way to reconstitute their history.The most dynamic collectors have also become the true tutelary figures of crypto-art. Until museums and galleries become active in this universe  the major collectors of NFTs still have a very substantial influence  whether by sharing their favorites on social media  collaborating with artists  or exhibiting their collections in virtual universes or physical places as the prestigious Art Basel Miami or by offering them for sale via traditional auction houses.Cozomo di Medici: ""For over 700 years  we have loved the jpegs"":https://opensea.io/Cozomo_de_MediciMax Stealth: ""A Timeless Collection"":www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2022/inside-the-world-of-maxstealth-a-timeless-collection4. The traditional way: visiting physical eventsCrypto-art is now coming to public places  galleries  and museums. From the great hall of the MoMA to Times Square  digital art is gradually investing some of the biggest screens on the planet and some of the most prestigious museums. Advertising spaces and exhibition halls are coming together for the first time in history  no doubt  to show a new type of work  at the crossroads of art and technology  which sometimes looks a whole lot better on a big screen than on a smartphone or a laptop screen.At the same time  almost everywhere in the world  art fairs offer to investigate this universe more deeply and to experiment with digital creation in the best possible conditions. These events provide opportunities to meet the different players who form a real 'ecosystem' and to meet the 'community' which allows digital artists to largely bypass art galleries  and which brings together entrepreneurs  developers  collectors  and enthusiasts.NFT New York  April 12-14  2023 at Times Square and Hudson Yards:www.nft.nycPompidou Center: Presentation of the first NFT acquisitions on April 8  2023: www.centrepompidou.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/CP_NFT_Acquisition_fevrier_2023__1_.pdf5. The safe way: collect a first NFT workHowever… nothing replaces the experience of a first NFT acquisition. Not only does it force you to find a work that deserves to be purchased among the millions offered on platforms like opensea.io or objkt.com  but this process also requires you to complete an unusual transaction  to say the least. Although some platforms now offer payment in euros or dollars  the vast majority of them require the creation of a (free) electronic wallet  powered by cryptocurrency. This operation may seem complicated  but it is an integral part of the universe on which crypto-art is based and therefore of the experience it offers.In the absence of galleries  artists organize their own markets  choosing what  when  and how to put their works on sale  at what price  and in what quantity. Unique digital works (1/1) are the most sought-after  but larger editions offer a more affordable opportunity to collect pieces. Among the novelties of the NFT market  the Open Editions are particularly exciting  since these projects put an unlimited number of tokens on sale at a fixed price  but for only a few days or even a few hours...The information and econometric studies produced by Artmarket.com are presented uniquely for the purpose of analyzing and understanding the statistical realities of the art market and should in no way be considered as advice or a suggestion or a solicitation to invest in the art market.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image1-weekly-nft-auction-proceeds-vs-ethereum-price.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/02/image2-artmarket-top-10-artists-by-nft-auction-turnover-2021-2022.png]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

A deal ""could yet come back for Allfunds  but there is no obvious time imperative.""A Deutsche Boerse spokeswoman declined to comment.RARE REVERSALEuronext had so far focused on snapping up national exchanges  most recently Borsa Italiana  to become a pan-European stock exchange  with bourses in Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon  Oslo and Paris.There are few European exchanges left for Euronext to buy  and further acquisitions could run up against competition constraints.ING analysts considered Euronext's indicative offer as too low. ""Clearly  so did the Allfunds board and majority shareholders "" the analysts said.Euronext's sudden change of mind is an unusual move for CEO Stephane Boujnah  although Euronext does have strict financial conditions on takeovers  meaning it cannot pursue a deal at any price.Any takeover must have a return on capital goal above the weighted average cost of capital after three to five years  as per Euronext's own investment criteria.Euronext is also building up activities in stock and derivatives clearing  and needs to avoid the distraction that a contested and expensive takeover bid would bring.($1 = 0.9389 euros)(Reporting by Mathieu Rosemain  Huw Jones  Pablo Mayo Cerqueiro and Chiara Elisei; Editing by Jane Merriman)",neutral,0.01,0.96,0.03,mixed,0.11,0.11,0.78,True,English,"[""Allfunds' M&A prospects"", 'reset button', 'Euronext', 'bid', 'three to five years', 'existing fund services operation', 'Thomson Reuters FILE PHOTO', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'A Deutsche Boerse spokeswoman', 'fund management companies', 'Pablo Mayo Cerqueiro', 'obvious time imperative', 'pan-European stock exchange', 'CEO Stephane Boujnah', 'strict financial conditions', 'La Defense business', 'fund distribution company', 'traditional trading activities', 'complex data rules', 'expensive takeover bid', 'An Allfunds spokesperson', 'Exchange operator Euronext', ""Allfunds' takeover prospects"", 'financial district', 'Mathieu Rosemain', 'Huw Jones', 'reset button', 'other suitors', 'indicative cash', 'shareholder skepticism', 'new layer', 'merger talks', 'due diligence', 'other access', 'initial talks', 'Potential bidders', 'private equity', 'RARE REVERSAL', 'national exchanges', 'Borsa Italiana', 'European exchanges', 'competition constraints', 'majority shareholders', 'sudden change', 'unusual move', 'average cost', 'investment criteria', 'derivatives clearing', 'Chiara Elisei', 'Jane Merriman', 'indicative offer', '5.5 billion euros', 'buyout funds', 'second source', 'capital goal', 'game-changing deal', 'shares offer', 'Allfunds board', '0.9389 euros', 'Logo', 'headquarters', 'Courbevoie', 'Paris', 'speculation', 'sign', 'Tuesday', 'terms', 'discussions', 'rivals', 'others', 'areas', 'analytics', 'borders', 'decision', 'financials', 'withdrawal', 'field', 'hat', 'money', 'Analysts', 'Germany', 'view', 'virtue', 'top', 'episode', 'Jefferies', 'bourses', 'Amsterdam', 'Brussels', 'Dublin', 'Lisbon', 'Oslo', 'acquisitions', 'mind', 'takeovers', 'price', 'return', 'distraction', 'contested', 'Editing']",2023-03-01,2023-03-01,msn.com
