Amendment of the articles of associationThe Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that Article 9 of the articles of association be amended to enable holding a general meeting entirely without a meeting venue as a so-called remote meeting in addition to the Company’s domicile Espoo or in Helsinki as currently provided in the articles of association. In its amended form  said provision of the articles of association would read as follows (unofficial translation in English below for informational purposes only):9 § Annual General MeetingThe Annual General Meeting is to be held each year within six months from the end of the financial year.At the Meeting  the following shall be presented:1. financial statements for the company and possibly for the group as well as a report of the Board of Directors;2. auditor’s report;resolved upon:3. confirmation of the company’s financial statements and possibly that of the group;4. use of the profit indicated in the financial statements;5. discharge of liability for the Board members and the CEO;6. number of the Board members;elected:7. the members of the Board of Directors as well as8. the auditor.The Annual General Meeting may be held in the company’s domicile or Helsinki. In addition  the Board of Directors may resolve on organising the general meeting without a meeting venue whereby the shareholders have the right to exercise their decision-making power in full in real time during the meeting using telecommunication connection and technical means.The proposal is based on amendments made to Chapter 5 of the Finnish Companies Act  including the possibility to arrange remote general meetings. The legislative amendments are based on the premise that shareholder rights shall not be compromised  and that all participating shareholders are able to exercise their shareholder rights in full  including the right to request information and to vote  in real time during the general meeting  irrespective of the chosen general meeting format. The possibility to organise remote general meetings enables the Company to be prepared for rapidly changing conditions in the Company’s operating environment and society in general  for example due to pandemics. It is important for the Company to have means available to offer its shareholders the possibility to exercise their shareholder rights and resolve on any matters presented to the general meeting under all circumstances.It is proposed that the articles of association will otherwise remain unchanged.16. Authorising the Board of Directors to decide on the repurchase of the Company’s own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorises the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of a maximum of 450 000 shares in the Company in one or several instalments by using funds from unrestricted equity. The proposed number of shares corresponds to approximately 7 0% of all shares in the Company.The shares may be repurchased in order to improve the capital structure of the Company  to carry out acquisitions or other arrangements related to the Company’s business  to be transferred or cancelled for other purposes  to be used for the Company’s incentive plans  or if the Board of Directors otherwise deems it to be in the interest of shareholders.The price paid for the shares repurchased under the authorisation shall be based on the market price of the Company’s share in public trading. The minimum price to be paid shall be the lowest market price of the share quoted in public trading during the authorisation period and the maximum price the highest market price quoted during the authorisation period.The Company’s own shares may be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the shareholding of the shareholders (directed repurchase).It is proposed that the authorisation be valid until the next Annual General Meeting  however  no longer than until 30 June 2024. The authorisation will revoke the repurchase authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 17 March 2022.17. Authorising the Board of Directors to decide on the issuance of shares  and option rights and other special rights entitling to sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorises the Board of Directors to resolve on the issuance of shares  and option rights and other special rights entitling to shares as referred to in Chapter 10  Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act in one or several instalments as described below.The Board of Directors would  pursuant to the authorisation  be entitled to resolve on the issuance of an aggregate maximum of 620 000 new shares. The Board of Directors may decide to issue new shares or shares held by the Company. The maximum number of shares included in the proposed authorisation accounts for approximately 9 7% of all shares in the Company.The authorisation includes the right to issue shares  option rights and/or other special rights entitling to shares through private offering  in other words  to deviate from the shareholders’ pre-emptive rights  if there is a weighty financial reason from the Company’s point of view  such as using them as consideration to carry out acquisitions or other arrangements or investments related to the Company’s business  and/or as part of the remuneration of Board members paid for in shares as resolved by the Annual General Meeting. The authorisation also includes the right to issue shares  option rights and/or other special rights entitling to shares against payment or for free. A directed issue without payment requires that there is an especially weighty financial reason from the Company’s point of view and taking the interests of all of its shareholders into consideration.Under the authorisation  the Board of Directors will be entitled to resolve on the terms and conditions of the issuance of shares  option rights and other special rights entitling to shares  including the recipients and the compensation to be paid.It is proposed that the authorisation be valid until the next Annual General Meeting  however  no longer than until 30 June 2024. The authorisation will revoke the share issue authorisations granted by the Annual General Meeting on 17 March 2022.18. Closing of the meetingB.

The proposal is based on the changes to Chapter 5 of the Finnish Companies Act  which include the possibility to arrange remote general meetings. The possibility to organise remote general meetings enables the Company to be prepared for rapidly changing conditions in the Company's operating environment and society in general  for example due to pandemics or other unexpected or exceptional situations. It is important for the Company to have means to offer its shareholders the possibility to exercise their shareholder rights and resolve on any matters presented to a general meeting under any circumstances.

Amendment of the articles of associationThe Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that Article 9 of the articles of association be amended to enable holding a general meeting entirely without a meeting venue as a so-called remote meeting in addition to the Company’s domicile Espoo or in Helsinki as currently provided in the articles of association. In its amended form  said provision of the articles of association would read as follows (unofficial translation in English below for informational purposes only):9 § Annual General MeetingThe Annual General Meeting is to be held each year within six months from the end of the financial year.At the Meeting  the following shall be presented:1. financial statements for the company and possibly for the group as well as a report of the Board of Directors;2. auditor’s report;resolved upon:3. confirmation of the company’s financial statements and possibly that of the group;4. use of the profit indicated in the financial statements;5. discharge of liability for the Board members and the CEO;6. number of the Board members;elected:7. the members of the Board of Directors as well as8. the auditor.The Annual General Meeting may be held in the company’s domicile or Helsinki. In addition  the Board of Directors may resolve on organising the general meeting without a meeting venue whereby the shareholders have the right to exercise their decision-making power in full in real time during the meeting using telecommunication connection and technical means.The proposal is based on amendments made to Chapter 5 of the Finnish Companies Act  including the possibility to arrange remote general meetings. The legislative amendments are based on the premise that shareholder rights shall not be compromised  and that all participating shareholders are able to exercise their shareholder rights in full  including the right to request information and to vote  in real time during the general meeting  irrespective of the chosen general meeting format. The possibility to organise remote general meetings enables the Company to be prepared for rapidly changing conditions in the Company’s operating environment and society in general  for example due to pandemics. It is important for the Company to have means available to offer its shareholders the possibility to exercise their shareholder rights and resolve on any matters presented to the general meeting under all circumstances.It is proposed that the articles of association will otherwise remain unchanged.16. Authorising the Board of Directors to decide on the repurchase of the Company’s own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorises the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of a maximum of 450 000 shares in the Company in one or several instalments by using funds from unrestricted equity. The proposed number of shares corresponds to approximately 7 0% of all shares in the Company.The shares may be repurchased in order to improve the capital structure of the Company  to carry out acquisitions or other arrangements related to the Company’s business  to be transferred or cancelled for other purposes  to be used for the Company’s incentive plans  or if the Board of Directors otherwise deems it to be in the interest of shareholders.The price paid for the shares repurchased under the authorisation shall be based on the market price of the Company’s share in public trading. The minimum price to be paid shall be the lowest market price of the share quoted in public trading during the authorisation period and the maximum price the highest market price quoted during the authorisation period.The Company’s own shares may be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the shareholding of the shareholders (directed repurchase).It is proposed that the authorisation be valid until the next Annual General Meeting  however  no longer than until 30 June 2024. The authorisation will revoke the repurchase authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 17 March 2022.17. Authorising the Board of Directors to decide on the issuance of shares  and option rights and other special rights entitling to sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorises the Board of Directors to resolve on the issuance of shares  and option rights and other special rights entitling to shares as referred to in Chapter 10  Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act in one or several instalments as described below.The Board of Directors would  pursuant to the authorisation  be entitled to resolve on the issuance of an aggregate maximum of 620 000 new shares. The Board of Directors may decide to issue new shares or shares held by the Company. The maximum number of shares included in the proposed authorisation accounts for approximately 9 7% of all shares in the Company.The authorisation includes the right to issue shares  option rights and/or other special rights entitling to shares through private offering  in other words  to deviate from the shareholders’ pre-emptive rights  if there is a weighty financial reason from the Company’s point of view  such as using them as consideration to carry out acquisitions or other arrangements or investments related to the Company’s business  and/or as part of the remuneration of Board members paid for in shares as resolved by the Annual General Meeting. The authorisation also includes the right to issue shares  option rights and/or other special rights entitling to shares against payment or for free. A directed issue without payment requires that there is an especially weighty financial reason from the Company’s point of view and taking the interests of all of its shareholders into consideration.Under the authorisation  the Board of Directors will be entitled to resolve on the terms and conditions of the issuance of shares  option rights and other special rights entitling to shares  including the recipients and the compensation to be paid.It is proposed that the authorisation be valid until the next Annual General Meeting  however  no longer than until 30 June 2024. The authorisation will revoke the share issue authorisations granted by the Annual General Meeting on 17 March 2022.18. Closing of the meetingB.

Amendment of the articles of associationThe Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that Article 9 of the articles of association be amended to enable holding a general meeting entirely without a meeting venue as a so-called remote meeting in addition to the Company’s domicile Espoo or in Helsinki as currently provided in the articles of association. In its amended form  said provision of the articles of association would read as follows (unofficial translation in English below for informational purposes only):9 § Annual General MeetingThe Annual General Meeting is to be held each year within six months from the end of the financial year.At the Meeting  the following shall be presented:1. financial statements for the company and possibly for the group as well as a report of the Board of Directors;2. auditor’s report;resolved upon:3. confirmation of the company’s financial statements and possibly that of the group;4. use of the profit indicated in the financial statements;5. discharge of liability for the Board members and the CEO;6. number of the Board members;elected:7. the members of the Board of Directors as well as8. the auditor.The Annual General Meeting may be held in the company’s domicile or Helsinki. In addition  the Board of Directors may resolve on organising the general meeting without a meeting venue whereby the shareholders have the right to exercise their decision-making power in full in real time during the meeting using telecommunication connection and technical means.The proposal is based on amendments made to Chapter 5 of the Finnish Companies Act  including the possibility to arrange remote general meetings. The legislative amendments are based on the premise that shareholder rights shall not be compromised  and that all participating shareholders are able to exercise their shareholder rights in full  including the right to request information and to vote  in real time during the general meeting  irrespective of the chosen general meeting format. The possibility to organise remote general meetings enables the Company to be prepared for rapidly changing conditions in the Company’s operating environment and society in general  for example due to pandemics. It is important for the Company to have means available to offer its shareholders the possibility to exercise their shareholder rights and resolve on any matters presented to the general meeting under all circumstances.It is proposed that the articles of association will otherwise remain unchanged.16. Authorising the Board of Directors to decide on the repurchase of the Company’s own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorises the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of a maximum of 450 000 shares in the Company in one or several instalments by using funds from unrestricted equity. The proposed number of shares corresponds to approximately 7 0% of all shares in the Company.The shares may be repurchased in order to improve the capital structure of the Company  to carry out acquisitions or other arrangements related to the Company’s business  to be transferred or cancelled for other purposes  to be used for the Company’s incentive plans  or if the Board of Directors otherwise deems it to be in the interest of shareholders.The price paid for the shares repurchased under the authorisation shall be based on the market price of the Company’s share in public trading. The minimum price to be paid shall be the lowest market price of the share quoted in public trading during the authorisation period and the maximum price the highest market price quoted during the authorisation period.The Company’s own shares may be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the shareholding of the shareholders (directed repurchase).It is proposed that the authorisation be valid until the next Annual General Meeting  however  no longer than until 30 June 2024. The authorisation will revoke the repurchase authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 17 March 2022.17. Authorising the Board of Directors to decide on the issuance of shares  and option rights and other special rights entitling to sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorises the Board of Directors to resolve on the issuance of shares  and option rights and other special rights entitling to shares as referred to in Chapter 10  Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act in one or several instalments as described below.The Board of Directors would  pursuant to the authorisation  be entitled to resolve on the issuance of an aggregate maximum of 620 000 new shares. The Board of Directors may decide to issue new shares or shares held by the Company. The maximum number of shares included in the proposed authorisation accounts for approximately 9 7% of all shares in the Company.The authorisation includes the right to issue shares  option rights and/or other special rights entitling to shares through private offering  in other words  to deviate from the shareholders’ pre-emptive rights  if there is a weighty financial reason from the Company’s point of view  such as using them as consideration to carry out acquisitions or other arrangements or investments related to the Company’s business  and/or as part of the remuneration of Board members paid for in shares as resolved by the Annual General Meeting. The authorisation also includes the right to issue shares  option rights and/or other special rights entitling to shares against payment or for free. A directed issue without payment requires that there is an especially weighty financial reason from the Company’s point of view and taking the interests of all of its shareholders into consideration.Under the authorisation  the Board of Directors will be entitled to resolve on the terms and conditions of the issuance of shares  option rights and other special rights entitling to shares  including the recipients and the compensation to be paid.It is proposed that the authorisation be valid until the next Annual General Meeting  however  no longer than until 30 June 2024. The authorisation will revoke the share issue authorisations granted by the Annual General Meeting on 17 March 2022.18. Closing of the meetingB.

The maximum number above concerns the share issue and the issue of option rights and other special rights entitling to shares. The authorisation can also be used for incentive arrangements for the management and key personnel; however  no more than 900 000 shares in total may be granted for this purpose.The share issue may either be made against payment or without payment. The authorisation entitles the Board of Directors to issue the shares or option rights and other special rights otherwise than in proportion to the shareholdings of the shareholders (directed share issue) if the Company has a weighty financial reason to do so. The directed share issue may be without payment only if the Company has an especially weighty financial reason to do so and the interests of all the Company's shareholders are taken into consideration. The Board would be authorised to resolve on all terms and conditions of share issues and option rights and the issue of other special rights entitling to shares. The authorisation covers both the issuance of new shares and the transfer of the Company's own shares.The Board of Directors proposes that the authorisation be valid until 29 September 2024. This authorisation will cancel the authorisation to resolve on the issuance of shares and special rights granted to the Board of Directors by the Annual General Meeting of 23 March 2022.Authorising the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of the Company's own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the Board of Directors be authorised to resolve  in one or several instalments  on the repurchase of a maximum of 2 000 000 of the Company's own shares. The proposed maximum number of shares corresponds to approximately 5.13 per cent of the Company's total number of shares as at the date of this notice convening the Annual General Meeting.The shares would be repurchased using the Company's unrestricted equity  and thus  the repurchases will reduce funds available for distribution. The shares can be repurchased for developing the Company's capital structure  for financing or carrying out corporate acquisitions or other business arrangements  to be used as a part of the Company's remuneration or incentive plan or to be otherwise transferred further or cancelled  for example.In accordance with the resolution of the Board of Directors  the shares can also be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the existing shareholdings of the shareholders as directed repurchases at the market price of the shares quoted on the trading venues where the Company's shares are subject to public trading or at the price otherwise established on the market at the time of the repurchase. The Board of Directors is authorised to resolve on all other matters related to the repurchase of the Company's own shares  including how the shares will be repurchased. Among other means  derivatives may be used in acquiring the shares.The Board of Directors proposes that the authorisation be valid until 29 September 2024. The authorisation will cancel the authorisation to resolve on the repurchase of the Company's own shares granted to the Board of Directors by the Annual General Meeting of 23 March 2022.Amendment of the Articles of AssociationThe Board of Directors proposes that Article 9 of the Company's Articles of Association concerning the notice and place of general meeting be amended to allow for the shareholders' meeting to be held completely without a meeting venue as a remote meeting and that the provision on publishing the notice of general meeting in a national newspaper be removed.

FURTHER RESTRICTIONS APPLY. PLEASE REFER TO THE IMPORTANT NOTES AT THE END OF THIS NOTIFICATION.Montabaur  March 1  2023. In the course of the public share buyback offer by United Internet AG announced on February 14  2023  a total of 27 553 147 shares were tendered to the Company by the end of the offer period. The offer was based on the buyback of up to 13.9 million shares in total. As the total number of shares for which the offer was accepted exceeded this maximum amount  the declarations of acceptance will be considered on a pro rata basis  i.e. corresponding to the ratio of the maximum number of United Internet shares that may be purchased pursuant to this offer  i.e. 13.9 million United Internet shares  to the aggregate number of United Internet shares tendered by United Internet shareholders for buyback. 5.0 million of the shares bought back originate from the majority shareholder Mr. Ralph Dommermuth.Following the resolution of the Company’s Management Board of February 14  2023 to cancel 2.0 million treasury shares and thus reduce capital stock from EUR 194 million to EUR 192 million  the total number of 13.9 million shares bought back during the public share buyback offer corresponds to around 7.2% of all United Internet shares.The Company will hold approximately 10% of its share capital as treasury shares following the completion of the transaction.The treasury shares held by United Internet do not carry voting or dividend rights. Due to the non-voting nature of treasury shares  the proportion of shares with voting rights held by companies controlled by Mr. Dommermuth in relation to the total number of voting rights of United Internet AG will simultaneously increase from 53.02% to 54.37%.In view of the offer price of EUR 21.00 per United Internet share  the purchase price for the buyback of 13.9 million shares in total amounts to EUR 291.9 million. It is expected that the purchase price will be available on each custodian bank’s account with Clearstream by March 8  2023. Each custodian bank is instructed to credit the offer price to the account specified in the written declaration of acceptance of the relevant United Internet shareholder.DisclaimerThis notification may not be published  distributed or transmitted in the United States of America  Canada  Australia or Japan.

Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)° is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)° is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

The purpose of the trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of DSR 2.0  as well as to understand the dosing dynamics of DSR 2.0.DSR 2.0 was generally safe and well-tolerated  with no serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events. No patient showed a clinically relevant change in serum sodium levels or progressive hyponatremia  a further proof of safety of DSR 2.0. On average  a total of approximately 3L of fluid was removed per patient including 9g of sodium following a single treatment with 0.5L DSR 2.0 and a 24-hour dwell period.Oliver Gödje  Chief Medical Officer of Sequana Medical  commented: “The results of this study are really encouraging and  together with the positive safety data from the GLPii studies reported earlier this month  enable the filing of our IND application with the US FDA for MOJAVE  our US randomized controlled Phase 1/2a clinical trial  planned to start in Q2 2023.“In addition to positive safety and tolerability findings  with no serious adverse events or discontinuations  the amount of fluid and sodium removed following a single treatment is an indication of the effectiveness of DSR 2.0 as a potential treatment for patients with congestive heart failure.”Story continuesOn track to start M OJAVE with DSR 2.0 in Q2 2023The Company is progressing the development of its proprietary DSR 2.0 product  a sodium-free dextrose / icodextrin solution that is expected to have an improved therapeutic and favourable safety profile  and robust intellectual property protection. Data from the GLP animal studiesiii and Phase 1 CHIHUAHUA study are intended to support the filing of the US IND application  planned for Q1 2023.Following several initial discussions with the FDA  MOJAVE  a US multi-center randomized controlled Phase 1/2a clinical trial of DSR 2.0  is on track to start in Q2 2023  assuming FDA approval of the IND application. The intention is to enrol 30 diuretic-resistant chronic heart failure patients with persistent congestion. Of these  20 randomized patients will receive DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter on top of usual care for congestive heart failure (CHF) for up to four weeks and ten randomized patients will receive intravenous loop diuretic treatment as part of maximized usual care for CHF alone. Following four weeks of treatment  there will be a three-month safety follow-up period. Prior to enrolment of these 30 patients  the intention is for three additional patients to be enrolled in a non-randomized safety cohort and to receive DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter on top of CHF usual care for up to four weeks. Progression to the enrolment of the 30 randomized patients is anticipated to be dependent upon DSMBiv approval following their review of the initial three patients. More details on the final trial design will be announced following the FDA approval of the US IND application. Interim data of MOJAVE are expected in H2 2023 followed by top-line results in H2 2024.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)498 053579Optimum Strategic CommunicationsNick Bastin  Jonathan Edwards  Vici RabbettsE: Sequana@optimumcomms.comT: +44 (0) 208 078 4357About fluid overload in heart failure (AKA congestion)Heart failure is the leading cause of US hospitalizations in patients over 65 years old and 90% of these admissions are due to fluid overload  which is recognized as the primary driver of morbidity and hospitalization. Standard of care includes treatment with diuretic drugs  but these have well-recognized toxicity and resistance issues. Half of the heart failure patients admitted for fluid overload are discharged with no clinically relevant loss of fluid and one in four is re-admitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. It is estimated that 200 000 US heart failure patients have drug-resistant congestion requiring repeated hospitalization  severely impacting their survival and quality of life and creating a heavy financial burden.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficult breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic-resistant” patient population.alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company has reported positive primary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON trial of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  enabling the filing of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA  planned for H2 2023. Having delivered clinical proof-of-concept for DSR as a disease-modifying drug program for the treatment of heart failure  the Company is planning to commence MOJAVE  a US multi-centered randomized controlled Phase 1/2a clinical trial of DSR 2.0  in Q2 2023.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to cirrhosis.

A deal ""could yet come back for Allfunds  but there is no obvious time imperative.""A Deutsche Boerse spokeswoman declined to comment.RARE REVERSALEuronext had so far focused on snapping up national exchanges  most recently Borsa Italiana  to become a pan-European stock exchange  with bourses in Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon  Oslo and Paris.There are few European exchanges left for Euronext to buy  and further acquisitions could run up against competition constraints.ING analysts considered Euronext's indicative offer as too low. ""Clearly  so did the Allfunds board and majority shareholders "" the analysts said.Euronext's sudden change of mind is an unusual move for CEO Stephane Boujnah  although Euronext does have strict financial conditions on takeovers  meaning it cannot pursue a deal at any price.Any takeover must have a return on capital goal above the weighted average cost of capital after three to five years  as per Euronext's own investment criteria.Euronext is also building up activities in stock and derivatives clearing  and needs to avoid the distraction that a contested and expensive takeover bid would bring.($1 = 0.9389 euros)(Reporting by Mathieu Rosemain  Huw Jones  Pablo Mayo Cerqueiro and Chiara Elisei; Editing by Jane Merriman)By Mathieu Rosemain  Huw Jones and Pablo Mayo Cerqueiro",neutral,0.01,0.96,0.03,mixed,0.11,0.12,0.78,True,English,"[""Allfunds' M&A prospects"", 'reset button', 'Euronext', 'bid', 'three to five years', 'existing fund services operation', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'A Deutsche Boerse spokeswoman', 'fund management companies', 'pan-European stock exchange', 'obvious time imperative', 'CEO Stephane Boujnah', 'strict financial conditions', 'Pablo Mayo Cerqueiro', 'traditional trading activities', 'complex data rules', 'expensive takeover bid', 'An Allfunds spokesperson', 'indicative cash', 'shareholder skepticism', 'new layer', 'merger talks', 'due diligence', 'other access', 'initial talks', 'Potential bidders', 'private equity', 'RARE REVERSAL', 'national exchanges', 'Borsa Italiana', 'European exchanges', 'competition constraints', 'majority shareholders', 'sudden change', 'unusual move', 'average cost', 'investment criteria', 'derivatives clearing', 'Mathieu Rosemain', 'Huw Jones', 'Chiara Elisei', 'Jane Merriman', 'indicative offer', '5.5 billion euros', 'buyout funds', 'second source', 'capital goal', 'game-changing deal', 'shares offer', 'Allfunds board', '0.9389 euros', 'Euronext', 'sign', 'Tuesday', 'terms', 'discussions', 'rivals', 'others', 'areas', 'analytics', 'business', 'borders', 'company', 'decision', 'financials', 'withdrawal', 'field', 'hat', 'money', 'Analysts', 'Germany', 'view', 'virtue', 'top', 'episode', 'Jefferies', 'bourses', 'Amsterdam', 'Brussels', 'Dublin', 'Lisbon', 'Oslo', 'Paris', 'acquisitions', 'mind', 'takeovers', 'price', 'return', 'distraction', 'contested', 'Editing']",2023-03-01,2023-03-02,marketscreener.com
19560,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4582349-wolters-kluwer-well-managed-company-but-not-cheap,Wolters Kluwer: A Well-Managed Company  But Not Cheap (OTCMKTS:WOLTF),Wolters Kluwer isn't cheap  but it has a dominant position in its sector and should have no issue to continue to hike prices. Find out if WOLTF stock is a buy.,Pra-chid/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionWolters Kluwer (OTCPK:WTKWY) (OTCPK:WOLTF) is one of the global leaders in professional information where it has obtained a very strong position in the health  tax & accounting and risk & compliance sector. Wolters Kluwer used to be just a publishing house but hasn't missed the digitalization and the vast majority of its revenue is generated through digital formats (including software and online subscriptions to services).Wolters Kluwer Investor RelationsWolters Kluwer's primary listing is on Euronext Amsterdam where the stock is trading with WKL as ticker symbol. The average daily volume in Amsterdam is almost half a million shares per day  which represents a monetary value of in excess of 50M EUR. As it clearly is the most liquid listing  I'd recommend to trade in Wolters stock using the Amsterdam listing. Wolters Kluwer reports its financial results in Euro  so I will use the Euro as base currency throughout this article.Yahoo FinanceIn excess of 1B EUR of free cash flow in 20222022 was another year of strong growth. Wolters saw its revenue increase from 4.77B EUR to 5.45B EUR  an increase of just over 15%. Meanwhile the COGS increased at a slightly faster pace which resulted in a gross profit of 3.88B EUR  an increase of approximately 14%.Wolters Kluwer Investor RelationsBut as Wolters Kluwer was able to keep the increase of its other operating expenses relatively low with an increase of just over 10%  the operating profit excluding the other gains and losses came in at 1.27B EUR versus 1.04B EUR in 2021  that's a 23% increase.Wolters Kluwer Investor RelationsThe financing expenses continue to decrease and Wolters had to spend just 57M EUR on these expenses which resulted in a pre-tax income of 1.28B EUR and a net income of 1.03B EUR  an increase of in excess of 40%. The EPS came in at 4.03 EUR (up from 2.79 EUR) per share but that is based on the average share count of 254.7M shares for the year. Keep in mind that as Wolters continued to repurchase stock throughout the year  it ended the year with less than 249M shares outstanding and if you would use the existing share count instead of the weighted average  the EPS would be approximately 2% higher at just over 4 EUR per share.Thanks to the robust gross margins  Wolters Kluwer really is a cash flow story. The reported operating cash flow came in at 1.58B EUR but we need to deduct the 40M EUR in taxes paid that weren't owed based on the FY 2022 income statement while we should also deduct the 72M EUR in lease payments.Wolters Kluwer Investor RelationsThis means the adjusted operating cash flow was roughly 1.5B EUR and with a total capex of just 295M EUR  the free cash flow result was 1.2B EUR. Keep in mind this includes 178M EUR in working capital changes so on an underlying basis  the free cash flow was approximately 1.02B EUR. Divided over the current share count  the free cash flow result per share came in at 4.10 EUR.As of the end of 2022  Wolters Kluwer had approximately 2.25B EUR in net debt (including lease liabilities) for a debt ratio of 1.3 times EBITDA. That's very manageable and as Wolters expects its EBITDA to increase again this year  the debt ratio will likely continue to decline  even if Wolters doesn't reduce its net debt by a single Euro.Wolters Kluwer Investor RelationsI don't expect debt or interest expenses to be a major issue. Right now  Wolters has enough cash on its balance sheet to cover all repayments until 2026. And that ignores the cash that will come in during those years.Wolters Kluwer Investor RelationsOf course  Wolters won't be immune to increasing interest rates but looking at the bond market  it looks like the increases might be pretty benign. The 2027 bonds currently have a yield to maturity of 3.5% and even if I would use an average cost of debt of 4%  the total interest expenses would increase by just 60-70M EUR  which is just 2% of the revenue. So one inflation-related revenue hike would take care of the increased interest expenses  which explains why I'm not too worried.Investment thesisI usually would ignore a stock trading at a free cash flow yield of 3.7%. But Wolters Kluwer is appealing anyway as A) the company has not missed the digitalization trend and B) its dominant position in its core markets and the constant need for professionals to stay up to date on relevant news and updates are giving Wolters some moat. On top of that  as per the 2023 guidance  the ROIC will come in at 16.5-17% this year and the free cash flow should reach 1.2B EUR (although this includes changes in the working capital position so I am taking the guidance with a grain of salt). The dividend should increase as well from the 1.81 EUR that will be paid based on the 2022 performance.The company is currently also working on a 1B EUR share buyback program which will reduce the share count by an additional 3-4% and this helps to boost the diluted adjusted EPS by a 'high single digit' percentage this year. Which likely means we can expect an EPS of around 4.4 EUR per share and an underlying free cash flow result that should be pretty similar.I currently have no position in Wolters Kluwer as I always thought the company was expensive. Although WKL isn't cheap (trading at approximately 16.5 times EBITDA and a 4% FCF yield for this year)  I now understand the appeal. I'm in no rush to get in  but I think any major correction on the markets would be a good opportunity to initiate a long position.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

With euro zone...,"Traders work on the floor of the NYSE in New YorkA look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike DolanIf there were still doubts about a re-acceleration of the world economy into 2023  China's February business boom likely put them to rest.And after a bruising setback for stocks and bonds in February  investors now have to assess whether the unfolding economic rebound is sustainable given the eye-watering revision that it's forcing in inflation and interest rate expectations.March could be a messy month.China's manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in more than a decade in February  smashing expectations as production zoomed after the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions.The abrupt lifting of COVID curbs appears to have book-ended one of the worst years for the world's second-largest economy in nearly half a century.After its bleakest February in 40 years  Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock index roared back more than 4% on Wednesday  with Shanghai up 1% too. China's offshore yuan also surged 1% against the dollar.And against increasingly tense geopolitics  the rebound will be a relief to Beijing as China's annual parliament opens on Sunday and President Xi Jinping tightens control with the biggest government reshuffle in a decade.For the rest of world markets  jarred by increasingly uncomfortable inflation readings from Europe and the United States  the question is how much China's re-opening staves off recession or just spurs commodity and input prices once more.With euro zone factory output also now expanding again for the first time since May  German state inflation readings on Wednesday appeared to tally with data showing annual price rises picking up steam again last month.This is emboldening both the hawks at the European Central Bank and markets keen to re-price the interest rate horizon.Goldman Sachs raised its estimate for peak ECB interest rates for the second time in as many weeks  saying it now expects rates to go up by 50 basis points at the May meeting  taking the 'terminal rate' to 3.75% by June.Story continuesMoney markets have already moved beyond that and now price peak ECB rates at year-end almost 150 bps higher at 3.90%.Even though U.S. consumer confidence and housing data on Tuesday questioned some of the reheating narrative  markets now assume peak Federal Reserve rates will be as high as 5.42% by July. Two-year Treasury yields pushing to their highest in almost four months to 4.86%.Inflation expectations in markets are also on the rise in the United States and Europe  with 5-year  5-year forward inflation swaps in the latter near 2.5% for the first time in at least 13 years.The euro surged against the dollar on Wednesday.It gained against sterling too as Britain  as so often this year  struck a gloomier note.UK house prices last month dropped in annual terms for the first time in nearly three years  mortgage lender Nationwide said. And homebuilder Persimmon dropped almost 10% after it warned the housing slowdown and higher mortgage rates would hit profit and home-building targets.European bourses and U.S. stock futures were marginally higher  however.Tesla is readying a production revamp of its top-selling Model Y  according to Reuters sources.

I’m grateful and proud of the people across our brands who have provided comfort  food and work to those affected and those fleeing the violence. We also saw the impact on people’s mental well-being – which was already under pressure after two difficult years of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We have doubled down on our Save For Our Customers cost savings program that reached a record level of €979 million in 2022. In addition  our brands made significant donations to local communities  adding up to a total value of €218 million in cash and monetary value of food and products.Story continuesWe have made substantial progress in our Leading Together strategy and within our growth drivers of e-commerce and digitalization  health and sustainability  cultivating talent  and operational excellence. One example is the significant increase in our interim scope 3 CO2 emissions reduction target to 37% by 2030  in line with the UN goal of keeping global warming below 1.5°C.

China's offshore yuan also surged 1 per cent against the dollar.And against increasingly tense geopolitics  the rebound will be a relief to Beijing as China's annual parliament opens on Sunday and President Xi Jinping tightens control with the biggest government reshuffle in a decade.For the rest of world markets  jarred by increasingly uncomfortable inflation readings from Europe and the United States  the question is how much China's re-opening staves off recession or just spurs commodity and input prices once more.With euro zone factory output also now expanding again for the first time since May  German state inflation readings on Wednesday appeared to tally with data showing annual price rises picking up steam again last month.This is emboldening both the hawks at the European Central Bank and markets keen to re-price the interest rate horizon.Goldman Sachs raised its estimate for peak ECB interest rates for the second time in as many weeks  saying it now expects rates to go up by 50 basis points at the May meeting  taking the 'terminal rate' to 3.75 per cent by June.Money markets have already moved beyond that and now price peak ECB rates at year-end almost 150 bps higher at 3.90 per cent.Even though U.S. consumer confidence and housing data on Tuesday questioned some of the reheating narrative  markets now assume peak Federal Reserve rates will be as high as 5.42 per cent by July. Two-year Treasury yields pushing to their highest in almost four months to 4.86 per cent.Inflation expectations in markets are also on the rise in the United States and Europe  with 5-year  5-year forward inflation swaps in the latter near 2.5 per cent for the first time in at least 13 years.The euro surged against the dollar on Wednesday.It gained against sterling too as Britain  as so often this year  struck a gloomier note.UK house prices last month dropped in annual terms for the first time in nearly three years  mortgage lender Nationwide said. And homebuilder Persimmon dropped almost 10 per cent after it warned the housing slowdown and higher mortgage rates would hit profit and home-building targets.European bourses and U.S. stock futures were marginally higher  however.Tesla is readying a production revamp of its top-selling Model Y  according to Reuters sources.

Feb. 28  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Kevzara® (sarilumab) for the treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)  an inflammatory rheumatic disease  in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids or who cannot tolerate corticosteroid taper.""Polymyalgia rheumatica can be an incapacitating disease  causing painful disease flares in multiple parts of the body that leave people fatigued and unable to fully perform everyday activities. Corticosteroids have been the primary treatment to date  but many patients do not adequately respond to steroids or cannot be tapered off steroids  which puts such patients at risk of complications from long-term steroid therapy ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. “With the approval of Kevzara for polymyalgia rheumatica  patients now have an FDA-approved treatment to help offer relief from the disabling symptoms of this disease and long-term dependance on steroids.”The FDA evaluated the Kevzara application for PMR under Priority Review  which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Kevzara was previously approved for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.PMR often initially presents with pain and stiffness around the neck  shoulder and hip area and symptoms include fatigue  low-grade fever and weight loss. Patients often experience flares during tapering of  or relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroid (CS) treatment. Patients with PMR report difficulty in carrying out everyday functions such as getting out of bed  standing up from a chair  or lifting their arms. PMR generally affects people who are 50 years and older.Story continues“Until now  people living with polymyalgia rheumatica have had limited treatment options for this serious rheumatic condition  which causes significant pain and discomfort ” said Bill Sibold  Executive Vice President  Head  Specialty Care at Sanofi. “The approval of Kevzara as the first and only biologic for polymyalgia rheumatica is a new option for patients and the healthcare professionals who treat them.”The FDA approval for this additional indication for Kevzara is based on results from the SAPHYR Phase 3 randomized clinical trial in patients with steroid-resistant active PMR  who flared on ≥7.5 mg/day prednisone or equivalent during taper. In the trial  patients were randomized to receive either Kevzara 200 mg every two weeks along with a 14-week taper of CS (n=60; 1 patient randomized but not treated) or placebo every two weeks along with a 52-week CS taper (n=58). At 52 weeks  the trial met its primary endpoint with 28% of Kevzara-treated patients achieving sustained remission compared to 10% for placebo (p=0.0193). Sustained remission was defined as being in disease remission by week 12  absence of disease flare  C-reactive protein normalization from weeks 12 to 52  and adherence to the CS taper protocol from weeks 12 to 52.A sensitivity analysis removing acute phase reactants (measures of ongoing inflammation) maintained significance (proportion difference for Kevzara vs. placebo: 18%; 95% confidence interval: 3.1 to 32.6) and confirmed the primary outcome. In addition  an analysis of a secondary endpoint showed that the median cumulative CS dose was 777 mg for Kevzara  compared to 2044 mg for placebo.The common adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% of patients treated with Kevzara (n=59) were neutropenia (15%)  leukopenia (7%)  constipation (7%)  rash pruritic (5%)  myalgia (7%)  fatigue (5%)  and injection site pruritus (5%). Serious adverse reaction of neutropenia occurred in 2 patients (3%) in the Kevzara group compared to none in the placebo group (n=58). In both cases of neutropenia  the participants had a neutrophil count less than 500 per mm3 without any infections; neutropenia resolved following permanent discontinuation of study drug. The most common adverse reactions that resulted in permanent discontinuation of therapy with Kevzara were neutropenia occurring in 3 patients (5%) and infection in 3 separate patients (5%)  including COVID-19 (n=1)  intervertebral discitis (n=1)  and pneumonia (n=1).Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Kevzara gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need.

Kevzara  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  binds specifically to the IL-6 receptor and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling. IL-6 is an immune system protein produced in increased quantities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and has been associated with disease activity  joint destruction and other systemic problems.Sarilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).U.S. Indications and Important Safety InformationKEVZARA® (sarilumab) is an injectable prescription medicine called an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor blocker.

Standard of care includes treatment with diuretic drugs  but these have well-recognized toxicity and resistance issues. Half of the heart failure patients admitted for fluid overload are discharged with no clinically relevant loss of fluid and one in four is re-admitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. It is estimated that 200 000 US heart failure patients have drug-resistant congestion requiring repeated hospitalization  severely impacting their survival and quality of life and creating a heavy financial burden.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficult breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population.alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company has reported positive primary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON trial of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  enabling the filing of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA  planned for H2 2023. Having delivered clinical proof-of-concept for DSR as a disease-modifying drug program for the treatment of heart failure  the Company is planning to commence MOJAVE  a US multi-centered randomized controlled Phase 1/2a clinical trial of DSR 2.0  in Q2 2023.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

Standard of care includes treatment with diuretic drugs  but these have well-recognized toxicity and resistance issues. Half of the heart failure patients admitted for fluid overload are discharged with no clinically relevant loss of fluid and one in four is re-admitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. It is estimated that 200 000 US heart failure patients have drug-resistant congestion requiring repeated hospitalization  severely impacting their survival and quality of life and creating a heavy financial burden.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficult breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic-resistant” patient population.alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company has reported positive primary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON trial of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  enabling the filing of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA  planned for H2 2023. Having delivered clinical proof-of-concept for DSR as a disease-modifying drug program for the treatment of heart failure  the Company is planning to commence MOJAVE  a US multi-centered randomized controlled Phase 1/2a clinical trial of DSR 2.0  in Q2 2023.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

I’m grateful and proud of the people across our brands who have provided comfort  food and work to those affected and those fleeing the violence. We also saw the impact on people’s mental well-being – which was already under pressure after two difficult years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our brands worked hard to support associates  continuing to invest in mental health and overall well-being.In response to these circumstances  the brands remained laser focused on keeping grocery prices as low as possible and make healthy food options accessible to everyone by investing in high-quality own-brand products  expanding the range of price-entry products  and offer more personalized discounts through their loyalty programs. We have doubled down on our Save For Our Customers cost savings program that reached a record level of €979 million in 2022. In addition  our brands made significant donations to local communities  adding up to a total value of €218 million in cash and monetary value of food and products.We have made substantial progress in our Leading Together strategy and within our growth drivers of e-commerce and digitalization  health and sustainability  cultivating talent  and operational excellence. One example is the significant increase in our interim scope 3 CO2 emissions reduction target to 37% by 2030  in line with the UN goal of keeping global warming below 1.5°C.

China's offshore yuan also surged 1% against the dollar.And against increasingly tense geopolitics  the rebound will be a relief to Beijing as China's annual parliament opens on Sunday and President Xi Jinping tightens control with the biggest government reshuffle in a decade.For the rest of world markets  jarred by increasingly uncomfortable inflation readings from Europe and the United States  the question is how much China's re-opening staves off recession or just spurs commodity and input prices once more.With euro zone factory output also now expanding again for the first time since May  German state inflation readings on Wednesday appeared to tally with data showing annual price rises picking up steam again last month.This is emboldening both the hawks at the European Central Bank and markets keen to re-price the interest rate horizon.Goldman Sachs raised its estimate for peak ECB interest rates for the second time in as many weeks  saying it now expects rates to go up by 50 basis points at the May meeting  taking the 'terminal rate' to 3.75% by June.Money markets have already moved beyond that and now price peak ECB rates at year-end almost 150 bps higher at 3.90%.Even though U.S. consumer confidence and housing data on Tuesday questioned some of the reheating narrative  markets now assume peak Federal Reserve rates will be as high as 5.42% by July. Two-year Treasury yields pushing to their highest in almost four months to 4.86%.Inflation expectations in markets are also on the rise in the United States and Europe  with 5-year  5-year forward inflation swaps in the latter near 2.5% for the first time in at least 13 years.The euro surged against the dollar on Wednesday.It gained against sterling too as Britain  as so often this year  struck a gloomier note.UK house prices last month dropped in annual terms for the first time in nearly three years  mortgage lender Nationwide said. And homebuilder Persimmon dropped almost 10% after it warned the housing slowdown and higher mortgage rates would hit profit and home-building targets.European bourses and U.S. stock futures were marginally higher  however.Tesla is readying a production revamp of its top-selling Model Y  according to Reuters sources. Chief Executive Elon Musk has said he will discuss the third part of the EV maker's ""Master Plan"" when the company holds an investor day event later on Wednesday.Frankfurt-listed shares of COVID-19 vaccine maker Novavax fell 26% on Wednesday  after the company raised doubts the day before about its ability to remain in business.BNP Paribas fell 2.9% after the Belgian state participation agency SFPI said the country is preparing the sale of a third of its 7.8% equity stake in the bank. Euronext has withdrawn its 5.5 billion euro ($5.9 billion)indicative offer to buy fund distribution firm Allfunds.Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday:* U.S. and Global Feb manufacturing surveys  U.S. Jan construction spending* Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari speaks  Italian central bank chief Ignazio Visco speaks* G20 foreign ministers meet in New Delhi* U.S. corporate earnings: Salesforce  Lowe's  Dollar Tree  Snowflake  NIO etc($1 = 0.9389 euros)Graphic: China's factory activity at a decade high https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CHINA-ECONOMY/PMI/gdpzqmkngvwithchart.pngGraphic: First fall in almost three years https://www.reuters.com/graphics/BRITAIN-ECONOMY/HOUSEPRICES/dwpkdzkmdvm/chart.pngGraphic: Predicted 2023 best performing strategy https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GLOBAL-HEDGEFUNDS/akveqoezgvr/chart_eikon.jpg(By Mike Dolan  editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

EBITDA up 31%  with double digit price increases and sustained volume driving revenue up 20% LFL  as well as continuous cost reduction delivery;Full year adj. EBITDA down 33%  due to net impact of major cost inflation  while revenue outperformed the market at 15% LFL growth;Net debt and leverage reduction over Q4 to 6.4x by year end;Portfolio transformation and hyperinflation led to restructuring costs and non-cash impairments  mostly in H1;Acceleration of strategy anticipated  built on reducing complexity in the organization  allowing for more focus;2023 outlook of high single-digit revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin in 8% to 10% range  to result in leverage below 4x.FY resultsRevenue [1] of Core Markets was €1 672 million  up 15% LFL  driven by 7% volume and mix growth  and 8% overall higher prices. The strong increase confirms Ontex’s top line turnaround after several years of organic sales decline and its reactiveness to raw material price increases.Adjusted EBITDA [1] of Core Markets was €104 million  down 33%  with revenue growth contributing €164 million and gross savings €55 million. While these were still more than offset by raw material and operating cost inflation of €(280) million in the year  they reversed the negative trend in Q4. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the year dropped to 6.2%  down 4.9pp. The operating loss was €(69) million  including €(11)M restructuring costs  €(92) million non-cash impairments and €(70) million depreciation.Total Group revenue  including discontinued Emerging Markets was €2 464 million  up 17% LFL  driven by 6% volume and mix and by 11% higher prices  while adjusted EBITDA came in at €136 million  down 21% year on year. The resulting EBITDA margin of 5.5% was down 3.0pp year on year  and includes a margin improvement of discontinued Emerging Markets of 1.4pp.Adjusted EPS of continuing operations was €(0.62) compared to €0.30 in 2021. Basic EPS  including restructuring and impairment costs as well as profit from discontinued operations  was €(3.34) compared to €(0.76) in 2021. The delta is almost entirely attributable to non-cash impairments booked on the Russian  Mexican and Turkish assets of €(84) million  €(76) million and €(33) million respectively.Free cash flow was €(54) million  compared to €53 million in 2021  as a result of lower EBITDA  slightly higher capex and an increase in working capital needs due to higher revenue and despite improvement in the cash conversion cycle.Net debt for the total Group was €867 million at year end  up €142 million over the year  but showing an improvement versus the end of September thanks to EBITDA and working capital inflow. The leverage ratio was 6.4x  down from 7.7x in September and up from 4.2x at the start of the year.Story continuesCEO quoteGustavo Calvo Paz  Ontex’s CEO  said “I’m happy to see that we have turned the corner  giving us momentum to deliver further recovery in 2023. My first 100 days as CEO increased my conviction that there is a significant opportunity. Our strategy is working and I commit to accelerate its execution. Complexity reduction and laser-focus on the strategy execution  will bring us to best-in-class competitivity  which Ontex deserves as a performance-driven organization.”Q4 resultsRevenue [1] of Core Markets was €460 million  up 20% like for like  including a 6% contribution from volume and mix and 14% higher prices. With a 7% increase compared to Q3  this marks seven consecutive quarters of sequential growth.Adjusted EBITDA [1] of Core Markets was €40 million  up 31% year on year  marking the first quarter of year-on-year recovery. Revenue growth contributed €65 million and gross savings €16 million to the year-on-year evolution  more than offsetting the adverse impact of raw material and operating cost inflation of €(74) million. Compared to Q3  adjusted EBITDA was up 68%  as prices were raised further and volume growth and savings delivery levels were maintained  while cost inflation remained largely stable. The adjusted EBITDA margin thereby recovered to 8.8%  up 0.5pp year on year  and up 3.2pp quarter on quarter. The operating profit was €12 million  after deduction of €(11) million of restructuring costs and non-cash impairments  and €(18) million depreciation.Total Group revenue  including discontinued Emerging Markets was €675 million  up 20% LFL  driven by 16% higher prices and by 5% volume and mix improvement  while adjusted EBITDA came in at €51 million  up 64% year on year  and 47% quarter on quarter. The resulting EBITDA margin of 7.6% was up 1.7pp versus Q4 2021  and 2.1pp versus Q3 2022.OutlookWhile the volatile inflationary macro-economic situation is diminishing  but not over yet  Ontex believes it can continue to restore its profitability in 2023 and expects:Revenue of Core Markets  to grow by high single-digits  consolidating the improvement realized in 2022 and further balancing its portfolio;Adjusted EBITDA margin for Core markets in a range of 8% to 10%  with cost inflation headwinds as from year start to be gradually offset as additional pricing is passed through and structural cost reduction measures continue to deliver;Discontinued operations to contribute positively to adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow;Leverage to reduce by year end from 6.4x to less than 4x  with improving profitability and cash flow discipline remaining a focus.Portfolio developmentsOntex entered into a binding agreement in July 2022 to sell its Mexican and related export activities to Softys S.A.  marking a milestone in the transformation of Ontex. Net cash proceeds are estimated at approximately €250 million [2]. The closing is foreseen early Q2 2023  subject to the customary conditions  including the applicable merger clearance approvals. Proceeds from the transaction will be exclusively applied to reduce debt.Ontex is making progress in the divestment of its remaining Emerging Markets businesses  as discussions with potential acquirers continue.The exploratory discussions with AIP have been discontinued. The board and management believe that the persistent macro-economic challenges currently outweigh the strong business rationale of a combination. They also believe that focusing on the stated strategy today and restoring profitable growth will deliver significant value for shareholders.[1] Reported P&L figures  except for basic EPS  represent continuing operations  i.e. Core Markets  only. As from 2022  Emerging Markets  representing some 30% of revenue  are reported as assets held for sale and discontinued operations  following the strategic decision to divest these businesses.[2] Gross proceeds are valued at about €285 million  resulting in an estimated €250 million net proceeds  after deduction of taxes and transaction costs. Some €225 million is to be received at closing  the remainder is a deferred payment.Unless otherwise indicated  all comments in this document on changes are on a year-on-year basis and for revenue specifically on a like-for-like (LFL) basis (at constant currencies and scope and excluding hyperinflation effects).

Revenue in North America was up more than 20% like for like. Forex fluctuations added 4%  as a result of the year-on-year appreciation of the US dollar  Russian ruble and British pound  bringing revenue up 19% overall.Volume and mix remained had a 7% impact  driven by strong market momentum supplemented by the contract gains secured in 2021 both in Europe and North America. As consumers seek better value-for-money alternatives  retailer brands gained share overall in Europe  especially in the second half of the year  when the overall market shrunk in volume  whereas retailer brands continued to grow.Prices were up 8% on average  gradually increasing from 2% in the first quarter to 14% in the fourth quarter  supported by contract renegotiations. Additional pricing actions are being executed to respond to the persisting input cost inflation  which rose faster than pricing and which continues to rise.In baby care revenue grew 17% like for like  based on volume growth and price increases. The retailer brand channel was favorable overall  with volume growth driven by baby pants  while diapers were largely stable. Ontex thereby outperformed both submarkets  especially on baby pants  where it outpaced at double the rate  benefitting from the success of its new Happyfit platform and supporting production capacity increases. In adult care revenue growth continued  up 12% like for like  mostly from pricing. Growth in the institutional channel was more subdued  as price pass-through is contractually limited. Retail and on-line channels grew consistently double digit  however  as this segment grows with more attention for care at home. Feminine care products grew 21% like for like  both through volume and pricing.Adjusted EBITDA of Core Markets (continuing operations)Adjusted EBITDA of Core Markets was €104 million  down 33%  with revenue growth contributing 164 million and gross savings €55 million. While these were still more than offset by raw material and operating cost inflation of €(280) million in the year  they reversed the negative trend in Q4. Forex fluctuations had an €8 million positive impact as the increase of the US dollar  which negatively affected the cost base  was more than offset by the appreciation of other currencies  mainly the Russian ruble and the British pound. The adjusted EBITDA margin thereby dropped to 6.2%  4.9pp lower year on year.Cost inflation weighed heavily on the year-on-year comparison  with a negative impact of €(209) million from raw materials and €(71) million from operating costs. The overall cost base rose 22% due to inflation  especially on raw materials  where prices rose 26% year on year  mostly on super absorbent polymers. Compared to end 2020  leading indicators for oil-based raw materials had risen about 70% by the start of 2022 to exceed 100% during H1. While that increase has reduced to about 50% by the end of 2022  the impact remains significant. For fluff  the leading indicator continued to rise over the last two years to almost 90% by year end. As Ontex has been partly protected through contractually fixed purchasing prices  part of the increase will still flow through in the first quarter of 2023. Other operating costs rose similarly  including distribution costs  energy prices and wages  reflecting the inflationary environment.Cost reduction measures delivered €55 million in gross savings  which represents 4.2% of the total cost base  thereby maintaining the momentum to reduce costs annually by about 4%. These consisted entirely of gross savings in operations. Continuous improvement of production efficiency  including lower scrap rates  were the main lever. These were helped by the footprint optimization  with the closure of the production plant in Mayen  Germany  during the first half of the year and the operations in Reidsville  US  in the second half. Despite a challenging supply environment  savings were also realized in the supply chain and design-to-value initiatives allowed to develop more cost-efficient product platforms. After last year’s significant efforts  strict cost control continues to be applied in SG&A  allowing to offset inflation. Combined with revenue growth  this resulted in SG&A costs over revenue to drop to 9.1%  below the 10% target.Total Group (including discontinued operations)Discontinued operations  consisting of the Emerging Markets division generated a revenue of €792 million  up 21% like for like  driven almost entirely by pricing. Volumes were largely stable in Brazil and Mexico  where market growth was slower  whereas in the Middle East volumes continued to grow throughout the period. Forex effects added 7%  with the appreciation of the Mexican peso and Brazilian real more than offsetting the depreciation of the Turkish lira. Adjusted EBITDA came in at €32 million  doubling the 2021 figure  as revenue growth and savings exceeded cost inflation and forex. Inflation started impacting these markets earlier in 2021 and price increases were more rapidly implemented  given the preponderance of branded channels. The net forex effect was negative since the adverse impact of the US dollar appreciation on cost outweighed the forex gains in revenue. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 4.0%  increasing by 1.4pp.Total Group revenue rose to €2 464 million  up 17% like for like  with pricing up 11% and volume and mix contributing 6%. Adjusted EBITDA was €136 million  a 21% decrease  as inflation impacted operating costs by €(392) million and SG&A costs by €(13) million  more than offsetting the revenue growth benefit of €299 million and the gross operating savings of €81 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin thereby dropped to 5.5%  down 3.0pp year on year.Q4 2022 BUSINESS REVIEWRevenue of Core Markets (continuing operations)Revenue of Core Markets was €460 million  up 20% like for like  including steady contribution from volume and mix and significantly higher prices. Positive forex fluctuations  with the year-on-year appreciation of the US dollar and Russian ruble  added 4%  bringing overall revenue growth to 24% year on year. With a 7% increase compared to Q3  this marks seven consecutive quarters of sequential growth.The volume and mix increase of 6%  in line with the third quarter  was based on solid market momentum and the contract gains secured earlier in Europe and North America. Retail brands are gaining share in Europe  as consumers seek better value-for-money alternatives  notably in feminine and baby care.Prices were up 14% on average versus last year  continuing the acceleration seen through the year starting from 2% in the first quarter.In baby care  revenue grew 23% like for like compared to last year  with baby pants volume up some 30%  driving the growth of retailer brands  which outpace the overall market. In adult care revenue growth was 14% like for like  mostly driven by pricing and volume growth in retail channels. Price increases in adult care were relatively lower due to contract structure limitations in institutional healthcare channels. Feminine care revenue grew 32% like for like.Adjusted EBITDA of Core Markets (continuing operations)Adjusted EBITDA of Core Markets was €40 million  up 31% year on year  marking the first quarter of year-on-year recovery. Revenue growth contributed €65 million and gross savings €16 million to the year-on-year evolution  more than offsetting the adverse impact of raw material and operating cost inflation of €(74) million. Forex fluctuations had a €3 million positive net impact  with the appreciation of the Russian ruble offsetting the net negative cost impact of US dollar appreciation. Compared to Q3  adjusted EBITDA was up 68%  as prices were raised further  volume growth and savings delivery levels were maintained and cost inflation remained largely stable versus Q3. The adjusted EBITDA margin thereby recovered to 8.8%  up 0.5pp versus Q4 2021  and up 3.2pp sequentially versus Q3 2022  but still well below historic margins.Cost inflation continued to impact the year-on-year comparison significantly  with a negative impact of €(57) million from raw materials and €(18) million from operating costs  largely similar to the year-on-year increase in the third quarter. Raw material costs were up significantly  mostly driven by non-indexed components of the price setting  such as energy  distribution and wage inflation. These also drove Ontex’s own operating costs up significantly. The total cost base went up by 21% versus the fourth quarter of 2021.Cost reduction measures contributed €16 million in gross savings. While gross operating savings of €14 million were in line with the previous quarter  SG&A costs were reduced quarter on quarter and year on year to 8.2% of revenue  despite wage inflation.Total Group (including discontinued operations)Discontinued operations  consisting of the Emerging Markets division  generated a revenue of €215 million  up 22% like for like compared with the last quarter of 2021  driven mostly by pricing  and a small positive impact of volume and mix coming from gains in the Middle East. Overall revenue growth was 32% year on year  thanks to positive forex fluctuations  with the higher Mexican peso and Brazilian real more than offsetting the lower Turkish lira. Adjusted EBITDA came in at €11 million  similar to the third quarter  and compares to €1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue growth and savings more than compensated for cost inflation. The US dollar appreciation impact on cost offset the positive impact of forex on revenue. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 5.1%  is up 4.8pp versus 2021  and in line with the third quarter.Total Group revenue thereby rose to €675 million  up 20% like for like compared to 2021. Prices were up 16% and volume and mix contributed 5%. Including forex fluctuations  revenue was up 26% year on year  and up 6% compared to the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was €51 million  a 64% year on year increase and 46% quarter-on-quarter. The revenue growth impact of €103 million and €21 million gross operating savings more than offset the cost inflation impact on raw materials  operating and SG&A costs of €(107) million combined. The adjusted EBITDA margin thereby was 7.6%  up 1.7pp year on year  and 2.1pp quarter on quarter.2022 OPERATIONAL REVIEWInvestmentsOntex continues to invest in its operations. About 1/3rd of capex in 2022 was invested in capacity expansions  notably in adult care in Europe and baby care in North America. In July Ontex opened a new plant there in Stokesdale  North Carolina  complementing Ontex’s plant in Tijuana  Mexico to supply the growing retailer and lifestyle brand channels in North America.Operational excellenceContinuous delivery on operational cost reduction measures delivered €81 million  of which €56 million in continuing operations  allowing to reduce the raw materials and operating costs  prior to inflation  by 4.9% in 2022  up from 3.7% in 2021. These efforts require capital and operational expenditure as well as some restructuring costs  which were mostly taken in previous years. To optimize the manufacturing footprint  several production lines were moved across Ontex’s operations and three plants were shut down. The production plants in Mayen  Germany  and in Ethiopia were closed in the first half  while the remaining lines in Reidsville  US  were discontinued in the second half  following the start-up of operations in Stokesdale. The scrap generation was reduced by a further 15% and Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) improved by 4pp. While service levels were still down on 2021 overall  caused by the disruption in the supply chain  they showed continuous improvement versus the end of 2021.InnovationIn 2022 innovation represented some €20 million in operational and capital expenditure. The success of Ontex’s innovation platform is demonstrated by the market uptake of its new baby pant platform Happyfit®. Developed in 2020  it was brought to the market in 2021 and represents the bulk of Ontex’s growth in the baby care category in 2022. The product platform is now being further developed for swim pants. In baby diapers  the new absorption technology Climaflex® was launched end of 2021 and commercially deployed in 2022. This technology ensures comfort  protects the skin and ensures absorption even under extensive baby motion. In adult care  Ontex has developed a smart continence management service for elderly homes and hospitals in Europe under the brand Orizon®. In 2022 field studies across Europe received enthusiastic reception of the concept. The commercial deployment is foreseen in 2023.2022 SUSTAINABILITY REVIEWSafety [1]Ontex takes the safety of its employees at heart. The accident frequency rate was 3.78 accidents per million worked hours. While improving versus 2020  this marks a step-back compared to 2.96 in 2021. Ontex has put in place the necessary action plans to bring the trend back within its ultimate ambition to a zero accident work environment.Climate change [1]In 2022 Ontex managed to further reduce its scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 47% versus 2020  compared to 41% in 2021  and is working out the steps needed to improve its scope 3 emissions. Ontex commits to achieving carbon-neutral operations by 2030  reducing its own greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2030  through energy savings  on-site renewable energy production as well as purchasing energy from renewable sources and carbon offsets. The company also has the ambition to cut the emissions of its global supply chain by 25% by 2030. In October  Ontex activated a large solar power installation in Italy  which will produce more than 10GWh of electricity per year. The company is opening solar power installations in Europe and the Americas to produce more energy on-site and achieve carbon-neutral operations by 2030. Ontex’s factories in Italy and seven other European countries now run on 100% renewable electricity. In June 2022  the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) approved Ontex’s climate action plan. In December 2022  Ontex received a top A-rating for leadership in corporate transparency and performance on climate change from the global non-profit Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).Sustainable supply chain [1]The sustainable supply chain was further reenforced. The vast majority of wood-based raw materials are 100% certified or controlled and more than 90% of cotton is organic  and in 2022 more than 95% of suppliers signed Ontex’s Supplier Code of Conducts. Gradually  Ontex is boosting its circular product & packaging solutions. The amount of manufacturing waste recycled in the year was 92%. In May 2022 Ontex renewed its support to Woosh  a Belgian startup that aims to make diaper recycling a reality in Ontex’s home country. Together with waste companies Woosh aims to set up the first diaper recycling facility in Belgium. Eco and health labels on products remained largely stable at close to half of sales.[1] Preliminary figures2022 FINANCIAL REVIEWP&LDepreciation was up 7% at €(70) million  reflecting the continued investments in growth and some forex fluctuations.EBITDA adjustments totalled €(103) million  and consist mainly of a €(92) million non-cash impairments. This was mostly related to the €(84) million goodwill impairment on the Russian assets in June. As the continuity of the Russian operations and the associated financial transactions remains uncertain  the Group had decided to separate and then impair a portion of goodwill allocated to its Russian business. Restructuring costs represented €(11) million  covering primarily the further European footprint optimisation.The net finance cost was €(51) million  some €9 million higher than in 2021. The increase reflects the higher average interest rate following the issuance in July 2021 of a €580 million bond at a 3.5% fixed rate  and the impact of the rising Euribor on the floating rate debt  especially in the second half of the year.The income tax was €(28) million  mainly due to the geographical mix  certain losses than cannot be recognized  such as the impairment on the Russian activities  and some previously recognized deferred tax assets which were derecognized.Discontinued operations booked a loss of €(122) million  compared to €(42) million in 2021. The adjusted EBITDA was €32 million and includes a €(4) million bad debt provision for certain receivables in Brazil. EBITDA adjustments were €(123) million  consisting mainly of non-cash goodwill impairment of €(76) million on the Mexican assets  following their agreed divestment  and of €(33) million on the Turkish assets  which corresponds to the hyperinflation impact on these. The remainder was related to restructuring charges and M&A costs. Financial and tax charges were €(20) million and €(11) million respectively.Adjusted profit/loss from continuing operations was €(51) million  compared to €25 million in 2021  reflecting the lower adjusted EBITDA  and the higher financial and tax charges. Including the impact of adjustments and the contribution of discontinued operations the loss for the period was €(270) million  the delta being almost entirely attributable to the non-cash impairments in continuing and discontinued operations. Adjusted earnings per share of continuing operations were €(0.62) compared to €0.30 in 2021. Basic earnings per share were €(3.34)  compared to €(0.76) in 2021.CashCapital expenditure was €(62) million  slightly up versus €(57) million in 2021. The pace of 2.5% of revenue remains low but consists for 2/3rd of investments in expansion  innovation and cost reduction measures. Strict capital management continues to be applied in the current challenging business conditions  but is expected to increase in the future to support further value creating initiatives.Free cash flow (after-tax) outflow was €(54) million  compared to an inflow of €53 million in 2021  mainly as a result of lower EBITDA and the increase in working capital needs of €(46) million. Capex and lease payments  net of disposal proceeds  were €(83) million combined. The cash impact of restructuring costs and other adjustment to EBITDA was €(37) million. Cash taxes were slightly higher at €(25) million. The improving EBITDA in the second half of the year resulted in a positive free cash flow of €4 million  compared to €(59) million in the first half.Balance sheetWorking capital for the total Group at the end of the period was €178 million  a €47 million increase versus the end of 2021. The increase is largely attributable to continuous revenue increase throughout the year. Although working capital over revenue of the last 3 months was 6.6% at the end of the period versus 6.1% in December 2021  this hides an improvement in days of outstanding receivables and inventory. The working capital includes monetization of accounts receivables through factoring for €192 million  versus €163 million at the end of 2021.Net financial debt of the total Group was €867 million at the end of the period including lease liabilities of €138 million. The €142 million increase over the year  includes the negative free cash flow of €(54) million  net interest payments of €(43) million and other financing outflow of €(18) million. The latter are mainly related to costs from the term loan negotiations concluded in February 2022  and hedging costs. Non-cash changes of €(27) million resulted from the increase in lease liabilities  mainly linked to the start-up of production in the US and Poland. At the end of the year Ontex had drawn €115 million from its €250 million revolving credit facility. This mainly covers temporary mismatches in the geographical cash distribution of the €209 million cash position. The leverage ratio was 6.4x at the end of the period  compared to 4.2x at the year start  as debt increased and adjusted EBITDA decreased. Over the last quarter a significant improvement was recorded compared to 7.7x at the end of September. This resulted from the strong adjusted EBITDA improvement and the decrease in net financial debt  from €895 million at the end of September with an improvement in net working capital use.As from 2022  the Emerging Markets activities are reported as assets held for sale  representing most of the €662 million in assets. After deduction of related liabilities  the net value was €412 million.DisclaimerThis report may include forward-looking statements.

AB InBev is the parent company of Budweiser APAC and is a public company based in Leuven  Belgium and listed on Euronext which has over 600 years of brewing heritage and an extensive global presence.This year marks the beginning of Chinese modernization. The past two months have shown good economic growth  which is promising for both consumption and investment in China. ""China is the largest beer industry globally. China is such an important market  one of the top markets for us globally. It was only natural to me to come on in the year  to see how things are and have the opportunity to talk to the team. And I'm very glad to see how consumption is returning very fast."" said Mr. Doukeris. During his interview with Chinese media  Mr. Doukeris shared AB InBev's strategic plans in China. This included progress toward carbon neutrality  sustainability and AB InBev's ESG goals  as well as ways the beer industry can boost local consumption and economic revitalization.Investments in China for Long-Term GrowthMr. Doukeris emphasized China's importance to AB InBev  noting that ""one beer in four globally is consumed in China"". Since entering China in 1984  AB InBev has laid down significant roots in the country and invested more than 30B RMB (including direct investments and acquisitions). AB InBev brews beer at approximately 30 breweries across China and provides a diverse portfolio of more than 50 brands. AB InBev has also spared no efforts to fulfill its commitments to the Chinese market  while continually increasing its investment here.In recent years  China has firmly and continuously implemented its ""dual circulation"" model in which domestic market is core with foreign investment to accelerate the growth and expansion. This aligns with the country's commitment to high-quality economic opening following the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The growth of the middle-income population at the size of over 400 million and the ongoing trends of trading up and premiumization are good news to AB InBev which embraced premiumization at very early stage.""We have been in China since 1984. Each and every time that the market is growing  that there is consumption  we need to keep up with the investment to grow "" said Mr. Doukeris. The listing of Budweiser APAC on the Hong Kong Exchange in 2019 has increased investment in China. For example the Putian Craft Brewery  the largest craft brewery of Budweiser China  started operation in July 2022  producing globally well-known craft beers such as Goose Island and Boxing Cat. It is also a base for its locally inspired craft beer brand ""059 Coastline Craft"" which combines local ingredients in Fujian such as Wuyi Mountain Da Hong Pao tea and FJ passion fruit.AB InBev's development in China was also fast-tracked last October when the beer industry was listed as an encouraged catalogue in the West and Northeast. AB InBev promptly invested to expand the brewery for the production of its three premium brands at its Ziyang plant  Sichuan province  by an additional 42 000 tons.Expand Consumption to Accelerate Market GrowthChina's 2022 Central Economic Work Conference stated that relevant local government departments should prioritize recovery and expansion of consumption. China's Ministry of Commerce also defined 2023 as the year of consumption-expansion with nationwide promotions to boost consumption and revitalize the market.Shortly after arriving in Beijing  Mr. Doukeris and his team visited the market to see the recovery of consumption first-hand at local restaurants and pubs. Mr. Doukeris noted  ""With the rise of 'she economy'  healthy consumption and other market segments  AB InBev will continue to introduce more diversified and innovative products. We will create more consumption occasions while establishing connections with more consumers.""Beer consumption is occasion oriented  creates more human interactions and strengthens connections among us—thereby playing an important role in boosting overall consumption in the market. ""The beer industry is of huge significance in global economy."" said Mr. Doukeris  ""According to a new Oxford Economics study  one out of one hundred and ten jobs is related directly and indirectly with the beer industry.""Despite three years of global pandemic  being one of the Global Top 500 Enterprises  AB InBev has shown resilience and continued to inject confidence into the industry and market. Budweiser China plans to launch a public welfare program called ""Cheers Campaign"" in China at the end of March. The program aims to support small and medium-sized merchants to boost consumption and the development of the night-time economy with AB InBev's ""BEES"". It is a B2B digital platform which helps wholesalers cut costs and improve efficiency with its technology and professional supports.ESG and Empowering Industrial ChainsThe report to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China highlighted that high-quality development is the first and foremost task for building a modern socialist country. As a sunrise industry with a market size of 400B RMB  the beer industry is speeding towards such development. Budweiser APAC's goal is to become the ""Most Loved High-Quality Growth Leader in Beverage"" and has placed ESG at the heart of its strategy and operations.AB InBev emphasizes that ESG is at the core of its business. Mr. Doukeris reiterated that ""Beer is natural  inclusive and local"". According to him  the beer business can only be sustainable with healthy  prosperous communities and healthy  natural ingredients. Hence  AB InBev's ESG strategy focuses on eight priorities including water stewardship  smart agriculture  circular package and climate action.Budweiser APAC develops ESG breakthroughs through innovation and cooperation with market players and stakeholders of the upstream and downstream value chain. Its Nanning brewery sets a new industry benchmark with water efficiency of 1.11hl/hl; its breweries in Wuhan and Jinzhou are the first carbon-neutral breweries; and its Taizhou brewery is 'Zero Waste'. Last June  MSCI ranked Budweiser China as an ESG leader with AA rating. Currently  AB InBev is incubating innovative ESG solutions through the 100+ Accelerator  Budweiser 100+ Innovation Hub  and the Supplier Strategic Alliance.Hand in hand with the business partners  AB InBev leverages its resources and technology to empower the industrial chain and achieve shared prosperity in the communities where it operates. For example  the Wholesaler Excellent Program has already helped nearly 2 000 wholesalers nationwide reduce costs and increase efficiency. Budweiser China has also supported lychee farmers in Zhangzhou  Fujian Province  and lime farmers in Anyue  Sichuan Province  to explore new models of rural revitalization.In the new journey towards Chinese-style modernization  foreign capital has increased involvement in China's high-quality development. By accelerating investment deployment  consumption deployment and ESG  AB InBev has jumpstarted the growth of the beer industry with ""three accelerators"" and strengthened its determination and confidence to further grow the Chinese market.View original content to download multimedia: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/abis-ceo-first-global-executive-to-visit-chinas-minister-of-commerce-this-year---ab-inbev-invests-for-a-future-with-more-cheers-in-china-301758912.htmlSOURCE AB InBev",neutral,0.03,0.96,0.0,positive,0.98,0.01,0.0,True,English,"['First Global Executive', 'AB InBev', 'More Cheers', 'ABI', 'CEO', 'China', 'Minister', 'Commerce', 'Future', 'Wuyi Mountain Da Hong Pao tea', 'new Oxford Economics study', '2022 Central Economic Work Conference', 'relevant local government departments', 'Hong Kong Exchange', 'past two months', 'dual circulation"" model', 'high-quality economic opening', '20th National Congress', 'FJ passion fruit', 'Three Leading ""Accelerators', 'extensive global presence', 'Mr. Wang Wentao', 'Global Top 500 Enterprises', 'Putian Craft Brewery', 'largest craft brewery', 'craft beer brand', 'three premium brands', 'other market segments', 'good economic growth', 'public welfare program', 'largest beer industry', 'CEO Michel Doukeris', 'Beer Industry Growth', 'central government', 'economic revitalization', 'craft beers', '059 Coastline Craft', 'public company', 'top markets', 'good news', 'local ingredients', 'local restaurants', 'global pandemic', 'three years', 'Mr. Doukeris', 'one beer', 'AB InBev', 'Fortune 500 company', 'early visitor', 'pandemic restrictions', 'parent company', 'brewing heritage', 'Chinese modernization', 'Chinese media', 'strategic plans', 'carbon neutrality', 'ESG goals', 'Long-Term Growth', 'significant roots', '30B RMB', 'diverse portfolio', 'Communist Party', 'middle-income population', 'ongoing trends', 'early stage', 'Goose Island', 'Boxing Cat', 'Ziyang plant', 'Sichuan province', 'additional 42,000 tons', 'nationwide promotions', 'innovative products', 'human interactions', 'important role', 'huge significance', 'global economy', 'one hundred', 'ten jobs', 'medium-sized merchants', 'local consumption', 'Budweiser APAC', 'recent years', 'important market', 'Chinese market', 'domestic market', 'Market Growth', 'Beer consumption', 'direct investments', 'healthy consumption', 'consumption occasions', 'overall consumption', 'foreign investment', 'Budweiser China', '50 brands', '600 years', 'BEIJING', 'Feb.', 'February', 'Minister', 'Commerce', 'lifting', 'Leuven', 'Belgium', 'Euronext', 'beginning', 'things', 'opportunity', 'team', 'interview', 'progress', 'sustainability', 'ways', 'importance', 'country', 'acquisitions', '30 breweries', 'efforts', 'commitments', 'expansion', 'premiumization', 'listing', 'example', 'operation', 'July', 'base', 'Fujian', 'development', 'catalogue', 'West', 'Northeast', 'production', 'recovery', 'Ministry', 'pubs', 'diversified', 'connections', 'consumers', 'resilience', 'confidence', 'March', 'small', 'night-ti']",2023-03-01,2023-03-02,marketscreener.com

This agreement is an important step towards solidifying our position as a leading provider and enabler of zero-emission mobility globally. Mitsui’s in-depth knowledge and active role in the hydrogen space and their global presence will contribute to strengthening our offering  expand our global reach and cement our strategic position with our customers”  says Morten Holum  CEO of Hexagon Purus.“We have been a strategic partner for the Hexagon group over the last seven years  and we are very pleased to extend our cooperation through actively supporting Hexagon Purus' strategic development and in achieving their long-term growth targets. Mitsui is a firm believer in Hexagon Purus’ strong technology offering and its key role in enabling the transition to zero-emission mobility in the decades to come. We look forward to continuing leveraging the synergies between Hexagon Purus’ competitive zero-emission solutions and our vast global network”  says Hiroshi Kakiuchi  Managing Director  Chief Operating Officer of Performance Materials Business Unit at Mitsui.Summary of key terms of the Convertible Bond Private PlacementThe Company is contemplating a Convertible Bond Private Placement raising NOK 700-800 million in gross proceeds. Mitsui has pre-committed to subscribe for NOK 500 million and will receive full allocation for its commitment in the Convertible Bond Private Placement. The bookbuilding period for the Convertible Bond Private Placement will start today  1 March 2023 at 16:30 (CET) and close on 2 March 2023 at 08:00 (CET). The Company  after consultation with the Managers  reserves the right  at any time and in its sole discretion  to close or extend the bookbuilding period on short or no notice.The Convertible Bonds are structured as a 5-year senior unsecured convertible bond with a 6% fixed interest rate payable semi-annually in kind (i.e. through issuance of additional bonds). The conversion price is set at a 25% premium to the lowest of i) Equity Private Placement Offer Price (as defined below) and ii) the 5-days volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares for the period to and including 1 March 2023 (the “Conversion Price”). The issuance of the Convertible Bonds are conditional upon the approval of an extraordinary general meeting (“EGM”) of the Company expected to be held on or about 16 March 2023. The Company's largest shareholder  Hexagon Composites  has undertaken to vote in favour of the Convertible Bonds at the EGM.The subscribers in the Convertible Bond Private Placement will receive 100 million non-transferrable warrants and 4.5 million non-transferrable additional warrants. All warrants will be issued irrespectively of whether the full amount of the Convertible Bonds are subscribed. The warrants will be allocated pro rata among the Convertible Bonds subscribers based on their Convertible Bonds allocation amount.The warrants provide rights to subscribe  in context of any future equity financing round  for (i) common shares in the Company at the price determined by the Company in such equity financing  limited to the subscription amount for the Convertible Bond Private Placement initially allocated to such holder; and (ii) additional common shares in the Company limited to 3% of the number of shares allocated to them in any such equity financing round  at par value (currently NOK 0.1). All warrants expire five years after the date of the EGM.The Company may redeem all but not only some of the outstanding Convertible Bonds (the “Call Option”) from and including the date falling 36 months after the Convertible Bond Private Placement at a price equal to 112% of the nominal amount for each redeemed bond (provided that the daily VWAP on each of at least 30 consecutive trading days ending not earlier than the trading day prior to the date of the Call Option notice  has exceeded 140% of the Conversion Price).The Convertible Bonds can be converted into shares in the Company at any time at each convertible bondholder’s sole discretion.Mitsui has agreed to undertake a 2-year lock-up on its Convertible Bonds (i.e. a transfer restriction  not a conversion restriction). Furthermore  Mitsui has agreed to a 180-day lock-up for shares received upon conversion prior to 3 years from the disbursement date of the Convertible Bonds  and a 90-day lock-up for shares received upon conversion after 3 years from the disbursement date of the Convertible Bonds.Summary of key terms for the Equity Private PlacementThe contemplated Equity Private Placement is expected to raise gross proceeds of NOK 350-450 million. The offer price in the Equity Private Placement (the “Equity Private Placement Offer Price”) is NOK 27.00 per Offer Share. The final number of Offer Shares will be determined by the Board  in consultation with the Joint Global Coordinators  following the bookbuilding process.The bookbuilding period for the Equity Private Placement will start on 1 March 2023 at 16:30 (CET) and close on 2 March 2023 at 08:00 (CET). The Company  after consultation with the Joint Global Coordinators  reserves the right  at any time and in its sole discretion  to close or extend the bookbuilding period on short or no notice. If the bookbuilding period is shortened or extended  the other dates referred to herein may be changed accordingly.Allocation of the Offer Shares in the Equity Private Placement will be determined at the close of the bookbuilding period  and the final allocation will be made by the Board at its sole discretion  following advice from the Joint Global Coordinators. The Company may focus on allocation criteria such as (but not limited to) pre-commitments/early indications  current ownership in the Company  timeliness of the application  price leadership  relative order size  sector knowledge  investment history  perceived investor quality  investment horizon and shareholder structure. The Board may  at its sole discretion  reject and/or reduce any orders  in whole or in part. The Board and the Joint Global Coordinators further reserve the right  at their sole discretion  to take into account the creditworthiness of any applicant. There is no guarantee that any applicant will be allocated Offer Shares. The Company intends to announce the Equity Private Placement Offer Price and the number of Offer Shares allocated in the Equity Private Placement through a stock exchange announcement expected to be published before opening of the trading on the Oslo Stock Exchange on 2 March 2023.Settlement is expected to take place on or about 6 March 2023 on a delivery versus payment basis. Delivery versus payment settlement of the Offer Shares will be facilitated through the delivery of existing and unencumbered shares in the Company  that are already listed on Euronext Growth Oslo  being borrowed by ABGSC (on behalf of the Joint Global Coordinators) from Hexagon Composites ASA (“Hexagon Composites”) pursuant to a share lending agreement (the ""Share Lending Agreement"") between the Joint Global Coordinators  Hexagon Composites and the Company. The Offer Shares will thus be tradable from allocation. The share loan will be settled with new shares in the Company (the ""New Shares"") to be issued by a resolution of the Board pursuant to an authorisation granted by the annual general meeting held on 27 April 2022.The Company's largest shareholder  Hexagon Composites  will not participate in the Offering (or any Subsequent Offering). As Hexagon Composites has previously communicated  its strategy is to over time reduce their ownership in Hexagon Purus below 50%. Hexagon Composites will  however  continue as a meaningful and supporting shareholder  and has committed to a lock-up of 90 days on its shares in Hexagon Purus.The Company has agreed to a lock-up of 90 days  subject to customary exceptions  including any Subsequent Offering (as defined below).Completion of the Equity Private Placement is subject to i) the corporate resolutions of the Company required to implement the Equity Private Placement  including a resolution of the Board to proceed with the Equity Private Placement following the expiry of the bookbuilding period and to increase the share capital of the Company by the issuance of the New Shares and ii) the Share Lending Agreement remaining unmodified and in full force and effect.Subject to  inter alia  completion of the Equity Private Placement  relevant corporate resolutions  including approval by the Board  prevailing market price of the Company’s shares and approval of a prospectus  the Board may consider carrying out a subsequent offering (the ""Subsequent Offering"") of new shares at the same subscription price as the Equity Private Placement and otherwise in line with market practice. Shareholders who were allocated shares in the Equity Private Placement will not be eligible to participate in the Subsequent Offering. The Company reserves the right in its sole discretion to not conduct or to cancel the Subsequent Offering.Additional key terms for the OfferingThe Convertible Bond Private Placement and the Equity Private Placement will be directed towards selected Norwegian and international investors (a) outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S  Securities Act of 1933  as amended (the ""U.S. Securities Act"")  and (b) to investors in the United States who are ""qualified institutional buyers"" (""QIBs"") as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act  in each case subject to an exemption being available from prospectus requirements and any other filing or registration requirements in the applicable jurisdictions and subject to other selling restrictions. The minimum application and allocation amount has in the Equity Private Placement been set to the NOK equivalent of EUR 100 000 per investor and in the Convertible Bond Private Placement been set to NOK 1 200 000 (but in no event less than the NOK equivalent of EUR 100 000). The Company may  however  at its sole discretion  allocate an amount below said thresholds to the extent applicable exemptions from the prospectus requirements pursuant to the Norwegian Securities Trading Act and ancillary regulations are available. Further selling restrictions and transaction terms will apply.Equal treatment of shareholdersThe Company has carefully considered the Equity Private Placement and issue of Convertible Bonds in light of the equal treatment obligations under the Norwegian Securities Trading Act and the rules on equal treatment under Euronext Growth Oslo Rule Book Part II and the Oslo Stock Exchange's Guidelines on the rule of equal treatment. The Company has evaluated various forms of financing alternatives over a substantial period of time  with the joint interests of the shareholder community in mind.

This agreement is an important step towards solidifying our position as a leading provider and enabler of zero-emission mobility globally. Mitsui’s in-depth knowledge and active role in the hydrogen space and their global presence will contribute to strengthening our offering  expand our global reach and cement our strategic position with our customers”  says Morten Holum  CEO of Hexagon Purus.“We have been a strategic partner for the Hexagon group over the last seven years  and we are very pleased to extend our cooperation through actively supporting Hexagon Purus' strategic development and in achieving their long-term growth targets. Mitsui is a firm believer in Hexagon Purus’ strong technology offering and its key role in enabling the transition to zero-emission mobility in the decades to come. We look forward to continuing leveraging the synergies between Hexagon Purus’ competitive zero-emission solutions and our vast global network”  says Hiroshi Kakiuchi  Managing Director  Chief Operating Officer of Performance Materials Business Unit at Mitsui.Summary of key terms of the Convertible Bond Private PlacementThe Company is contemplating a Convertible Bond Private Placement raising NOK 700-800 million in gross proceeds. Mitsui has pre-committed to subscribe for NOK 500 million and will receive full allocation for its commitment in the Convertible Bond Private Placement. The bookbuilding period for the Convertible Bond Private Placement will start today  1 March 2023 at 16:30 (CET) and close on 2 March 2023 at 08:00 (CET). The Company  after consultation with the Managers  reserves the right  at any time and in its sole discretion  to close or extend the bookbuilding period on short or no notice.The Convertible Bonds are structured as a 5-year senior unsecured convertible bond with a 6% fixed interest rate payable semi-annually in kind (i.e. through issuance of additional bonds). The conversion price is set at a 25% premium to the lowest of i) Equity Private Placement Offer Price (as defined below) and ii) the 5-days volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares for the period to and including 1 March 2023 (the “Conversion Price”). The issuance of the Convertible Bonds are conditional upon the approval of an extraordinary general meeting (“EGM”) of the Company expected to be held on or about 16 March 2023. The Company's largest shareholder  Hexagon Composites  has undertaken to vote in favour of the Convertible Bonds at the EGM.The subscribers in the Convertible Bond Private Placement will receive 100 million non-transferrable warrants and 4.5 million non-transferrable additional warrants. All warrants will be issued irrespectively of whether the full amount of the Convertible Bonds are subscribed. The warrants will be allocated pro rata among the Convertible Bonds subscribers based on their Convertible Bonds allocation amount.The warrants provide rights to subscribe  in context of any future equity financing round  for (i) common shares in the Company at the price determined by the Company in such equity financing  limited to the subscription amount for the Convertible Bond Private Placement initially allocated to such holder; and (ii) additional common shares in the Company limited to 3% of the number of shares allocated to them in any such equity financing round  at par value (currently NOK 0.1). All warrants expire five years after the date of the EGM.The Company may redeem all but not only some of the outstanding Convertible Bonds (the “Call Option”) from and including the date falling 36 months after the Convertible Bond Private Placement at a price equal to 112% of the nominal amount for each redeemed bond (provided that the daily VWAP on each of at least 30 consecutive trading days ending not earlier than the trading day prior to the date of the Call Option notice  has exceeded 140% of the Conversion Price).The Convertible Bonds can be converted into shares in the Company at any time at each convertible bondholder’s sole discretion.Mitsui has agreed to undertake a 2-year lock-up on its Convertible Bonds (i.e. a transfer restriction  not a conversion restriction). Furthermore  Mitsui has agreed to a 180-day lock-up for shares received upon conversion prior to 3 years from the disbursement date of the Convertible Bonds  and a 90-day lock-up for shares received upon conversion after 3 years from the disbursement date of the Convertible Bonds.Summary of key terms for the Equity Private PlacementThe contemplated Equity Private Placement is expected to raise gross proceeds of NOK 350-450 million. The offer price in the Equity Private Placement (the “Equity Private Placement Offer Price”) is NOK 27.00 per Offer Share. The final number of Offer Shares will be determined by the Board  in consultation with the Joint Global Coordinators  following the bookbuilding process.The bookbuilding period for the Equity Private Placement will start on 1 March 2023 at 16:30 (CET) and close on 2 March 2023 at 08:00 (CET). The Company  after consultation with the Joint Global Coordinators  reserves the right  at any time and in its sole discretion  to close or extend the bookbuilding period on short or no notice. If the bookbuilding period is shortened or extended  the other dates referred to herein may be changed accordingly.Allocation of the Offer Shares in the Equity Private Placement will be determined at the close of the bookbuilding period  and the final allocation will be made by the Board at its sole discretion  following advice from the Joint Global Coordinators. The Company may focus on allocation criteria such as (but not limited to) pre-commitments/early indications  current ownership in the Company  timeliness of the application  price leadership  relative order size  sector knowledge  investment history  perceived investor quality  investment horizon and shareholder structure. The Board may  at its sole discretion  reject and/or reduce any orders  in whole or in part. The Board and the Joint Global Coordinators further reserve the right  at their sole discretion  to take into account the creditworthiness of any applicant. There is no guarantee that any applicant will be allocated Offer Shares. The Company intends to announce the Equity Private Placement Offer Price and the number of Offer Shares allocated in the Equity Private Placement through a stock exchange announcement expected to be published before opening of the trading on the Oslo Stock Exchange on 2 March 2023.Settlement is expected to take place on or about 6 March 2023 on a delivery versus payment basis. Delivery versus payment settlement of the Offer Shares will be facilitated through the delivery of existing and unencumbered shares in the Company  that are already listed on Euronext Growth Oslo  being borrowed by ABGSC (on behalf of the Joint Global Coordinators) from Hexagon Composites ASA (“Hexagon Composites”) pursuant to a share lending agreement (the ""Share Lending Agreement"") between the Joint Global Coordinators  Hexagon Composites and the Company. The Offer Shares will thus be tradable from allocation. The share loan will be settled with new shares in the Company (the ""New Shares"") to be issued by a resolution of the Board pursuant to an authorisation granted by the annual general meeting held on 27 April 2022.The Company's largest shareholder  Hexagon Composites  will not participate in the Offering (or any Subsequent Offering). As Hexagon Composites has previously communicated  its strategy is to over time reduce their ownership in Hexagon Purus below 50%. Hexagon Composites will  however  continue as a meaningful and supporting shareholder  and has committed to a lock-up of 90 days on its shares in Hexagon Purus.The Company has agreed to a lock-up of 90 days  subject to customary exceptions  including any Subsequent Offering (as defined below).Completion of the Equity Private Placement is subject to i) the corporate resolutions of the Company required to implement the Equity Private Placement  including a resolution of the Board to proceed with the Equity Private Placement following the expiry of the bookbuilding period and to increase the share capital of the Company by the issuance of the New Shares and ii) the Share Lending Agreement remaining unmodified and in full force and effect.Subject to  inter alia  completion of the Equity Private Placement  relevant corporate resolutions  including approval by the Board  prevailing market price of the Company’s shares and approval of a prospectus  the Board may consider carrying out a subsequent offering (the ""Subsequent Offering"") of new shares at the same subscription price as the Equity Private Placement and otherwise in line with market practice. Shareholders who were allocated shares in the Equity Private Placement will not be eligible to participate in the Subsequent Offering. The Company reserves the right in its sole discretion to not conduct or to cancel the Subsequent Offering.Additional key terms for the OfferingThe Convertible Bond Private Placement and the Equity Private Placement will be directed towards selected Norwegian and international investors (a) outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S  Securities Act of 1933  as amended (the ""U.S. Securities Act"")  and (b) to investors in the United States who are ""qualified institutional buyers"" (""QIBs"") as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act  in each case subject to an exemption being available from prospectus requirements and any other filing or registration requirements in the applicable jurisdictions and subject to other selling restrictions. The minimum application and allocation amount has in the Equity Private Placement been set to the NOK equivalent of EUR 100 000 per investor and in the Convertible Bond Private Placement been set to NOK 1 200 000 (but in no event less than the NOK equivalent of EUR 100 000). The Company may  however  at its sole discretion  allocate an amount below said thresholds to the extent applicable exemptions from the prospectus requirements pursuant to the Norwegian Securities Trading Act and ancillary regulations are available. Further selling restrictions and transaction terms will apply.Equal treatment of shareholdersThe Company has carefully considered the Equity Private Placement and issue of Convertible Bonds in light of the equal treatment obligations under the Norwegian Securities Trading Act and the rules on equal treatment under Euronext Growth Oslo Rule Book Part II and the Oslo Stock Exchange's Guidelines on the rule of equal treatment. The Company has evaluated various forms of financing alternatives over a substantial period of time  with the joint interests of the shareholder community in mind. It is of the opinion that the deviation from the preferential rights inherent in carrying out the Offering in the manner proposed is firmly in the common interest of the shareholders of the Company.AdvisorsABGSC and BNP Paribas are acting as joint managers and bookrunners on the Convertible Bond Private Placement and as financial advisers on the Mitsui strategic investment.

Feb. 28  2023 -- Regen…,"Three times more patients treated with Kevzara achieved sustained remission compared to placebo in Phase 3 trialKevzara now approved to treat two chronic inflammatory disordersTARRYTOWN  N.Y. and CAMBRIDGE  Mass.  Feb. 28  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Kevzara® (sarilumab) for the treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)  an inflammatory rheumatic disease  in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids or who cannot tolerate corticosteroid taper.""Polymyalgia rheumatica can be an incapacitating disease  causing painful disease flares in multiple parts of the body that leave people fatigued and unable to fully perform everyday activities. Corticosteroids have been the primary treatment to date  but many patients do not adequately respond to steroids or cannot be tapered off steroids  which puts such patients at risk of complications from long-term steroid therapy ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. “With the approval of Kevzara for polymyalgia rheumatica  patients now have an FDA-approved treatment to help offer relief from the disabling symptoms of this disease and long-term dependance on steroids.”The FDA evaluated the Kevzara application for PMR under Priority Review  which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Kevzara was previously approved for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.PMR often initially presents with pain and stiffness around the neck  shoulder and hip area and symptoms include fatigue  low-grade fever and weight loss. Patients often experience flares during tapering of  or relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroid (CS) treatment. Patients with PMR report difficulty in carrying out everyday functions such as getting out of bed  standing up from a chair  or lifting their arms. PMR generally affects people who are 50 years and older.“Until now  people living with polymyalgia rheumatica have had limited treatment options for this serious rheumatic condition  which causes significant pain and discomfort ” said Bill Sibold  Executive Vice President  Head  Specialty Care at Sanofi. “The approval of Kevzara as the first and only biologic for polymyalgia rheumatica is a new option for patients and the healthcare professionals who treat them.”The FDA approval for this additional indication for Kevzara is based on results from the SAPHYR Phase 3 randomized clinical trial in patients with steroid-resistant active PMR  who flared on ≥7.5 mg/day prednisone or equivalent during taper. In the trial  patients were randomized to receive either Kevzara 200 mg every two weeks along with a 14-week taper of CS (n=60; 1 patient randomized but not treated) or placebo every two weeks along with a 52-week CS taper (n=58). At 52 weeks  the trial met its primary endpoint with 28% of Kevzara-treated patients achieving sustained remission compared to 10% for placebo (p=0.0193). Sustained remission was defined as being in disease remission by week 12  absence of disease flare  C-reactive protein normalization from weeks 12 to 52  and adherence to the CS taper protocol from weeks 12 to 52.A sensitivity analysis removing acute phase reactants (measures of ongoing inflammation) maintained significance (proportion difference for Kevzara vs. placebo: 18%; 95% confidence interval: 3.1 to 32.6) and confirmed the primary outcome. In addition  an analysis of a secondary endpoint showed that the median cumulative CS dose was 777 mg for Kevzara  compared to 2044 mg for placebo.The common adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% of patients treated with Kevzara (n=59) were neutropenia (15%)  leukopenia (7%)  constipation (7%)  rash pruritic (5%)  myalgia (7%)  fatigue (5%)  and injection site pruritus (5%). Serious adverse reaction of neutropenia occurred in 2 patients (3%) in the Kevzara group compared to none in the placebo group (n=58). In both cases of neutropenia  the participants had a neutrophil count less than 500 per mm3 without any infections; neutropenia resolved following permanent discontinuation of study drug. The most common adverse reactions that resulted in permanent discontinuation of therapy with Kevzara were neutropenia occurring in 3 patients (5%) and infection in 3 separate patients (5%)  including COVID-19 (n=1)  intervertebral discitis (n=1)  and pneumonia (n=1).Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Kevzara gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need.

Kevzara  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  binds specifically to the IL-6 receptor and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling. IL-6 is an immune system protein produced in increased quantities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and has been associated with disease activity  joint destruction and other systemic problems.Sarilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).U.S. Indications and Important Safety InformationKEVZARA® (sarilumab) is an injectable prescription medicine called an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor blocker.

The strong increase confirms Ontex’s top line turnaround after several years of organic sales decline and its reactiveness to raw material price increases. Adjusted EBITDA [1] of Core Markets was €104 million  down 33%  with revenue growth contributing €164 million and gross savings €55 million. While these were still more than offset by raw material and operating cost inflation of €(280) million in the year  they reversed the negative trend in Q4.

The adjusted EBITDA margin for the year dropped to 6.2%  down 4.9pp. The operating loss was €(69) million  including €(11)M restructuring costs  €(92) million non-cash impairments and €(70) million depreciation. Total Group revenue  including discontinued Emerging Markets was €2 464 million  up 17% LFL  driven by 6% volume and mix and by 11% higher prices  while adjusted EBITDA came in at €136 million  down 21% year on year. The resulting EBITDA margin of 5.5% was down 3.0pp year on year  and includes a margin improvement of discontinued Emerging Markets of 1.4pp.Adjusted EPS of continuing operations was €(0.62) compared to €0.30 in 2021. Basic EPS  including restructuring and impairment costs as well as profit from discontinued operations  was €(3.34) compared to €(0.76) in 2021. The delta is almost entirely attributable to non-cash impairments booked on the Russian  Mexican and Turkish assets of €(84) million  €(76) million and €(33) million respectively.Free cash flow was €(54) million  compared to €53 million in 2021  as a result of lower EBITDA  slightly higher capex and an increase in working capital needs due to higher revenue and despite improvement in the cash conversion cycle.Net debt for the total Group was €867 million at year end  up €142 million over the year  but showing an improvement versus the end of September thanks to EBITDA and working capital inflow. The leverage ratio was 6.4x  down from 7.7x in September and up from 4.2x at the start of the year.CEO quoteGustavo Calvo Paz  Ontex’s CEO  said “I’m happy to see that we have turned the corner  giving us momentum to deliver further recovery in 2023. My first 100 days as CEO increased my conviction that there is a significant opportunity. Our strategy is working and I commit to accelerate its execution. Complexity reduction and laser-focus on the strategy execution  will bring us to best-in-class competitivity  which Ontex deserves as a performance-driven organization.”Q4 resultsRevenue [1] of Core Markets was €460 million  up 20% like for like  including a 6% contribution from volume and mix and 14% higher prices.

With a 7% increase compared to Q3  this marks seven consecutive quarters of sequential growth. Adjusted EBITDA [1] of Core Markets was €40 million  up 31% year on year  marking the first quarter of year-on-year recovery. Revenue growth contributed €65 million and gross savings €16 million to the year-on-year evolution  more than offsetting the adverse impact of raw material and operating cost inflation of €(74) million. Compared to Q3  adjusted EBITDA was up 68%  as prices were raised further and volume growth and savings delivery levels were maintained  while cost inflation remained largely stable. The adjusted EBITDA margin thereby recovered to 8.8%  up 0.5pp year on year  and up 3.2pp quarter on quarter. The operating profit was €12 million  after deduction of €(11) million of restructuring costs and non-cash impairments  and €(18) million depreciation.of Core Markets was €40 million  up 31% year on year  marking the first quarter of year-on-year recovery.

The resulting EBITDA margin of 7.6% was up 1.7pp versus Q4 2021  and 2.1pp versus Q3 2022.OutlookWhile the volatile inflationary macro-economic situation is diminishing  but not over yet  Ontex believes it can continue to restore its profitability in 2023 and expects:Revenue of Core Markets  to grow by high single-digits  consolidating the improvement realized in 2022 and further balancing its portfolio;Adjusted EBITDA margin for Core markets in a range of 8% to 10%  with cost inflation headwinds as from year start to be gradually offset as additional pricing is passed through and structural cost reduction measures continue to deliver;Discontinued operations to contribute positively to adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow;Leverage to reduce by year end from 6.4x to less than 4x  with improving profitability and cash flow discipline remaining a focus.Portfolio developmentsOntex entered into a binding agreement in July 2022 to sell its Mexican and related export activities to Softys S.A.  marking a milestone in the transformation of Ontex. Net cash proceeds are estimated at approximately €250 million [2]. The closing is foreseen early Q2 2023  subject to the customary conditions  including the applicable merger clearance approvals. Proceeds from the transaction will be exclusively applied to reduce debt.Ontex is making progress in the divestment of its remaining Emerging Markets businesses  as discussions with potential acquirers continue.The exploratory discussions with AIP have been discontinued. The board and management believe that the persistent macro-economic challenges currently outweigh the strong business rationale of a combination. They also believe that focusing on the stated strategy today and restoring profitable growth will deliver significant value for shareholders.[1] Reported P&L figures  except for basic EPS  represent continuing operations  i.e. Core Markets  only. As from 2022  Emerging Markets  representing some 30% of revenue  are reported as assets held for sale and discontinued operations  following the strategic decision to divest these businesses.[2] Gross proceeds are valued at about €285 million  resulting in an estimated €250 million net proceeds  after deduction of taxes and transaction costs. Some €225 million is to be received at closing  the remainder is a deferred payment.Unless otherwise indicated  all comments in this document on changes are on a year-on-year basis and for revenue specifically on a like-for-like (LFL) basis (at constant currencies and scope and excluding hyperinflation effects).

Revenue in North America was up more than 20% like for like. Forex fluctuations added 4%  as a result of the year-on-year appreciation of the US dollar  Russian ruble and British pound  bringing revenue up 19% overall.Volume and mix remained had a 7% impact  driven by strong market momentum supplemented by the contract gains secured in 2021 both in Europe and North America. As consumers seek better value-for-money alternatives  retailer brands gained share overall in Europe  especially in the second half of the year  when the overall market shrunk in volume  whereas retailer brands continued to grow.Prices were up 8% on average  gradually increasing from 2% in the first quarter to 14% in the fourth quarter  supported by contract renegotiations. Additional pricing actions are being executed to respond to the persisting input cost inflation  which rose faster than pricing and which continues to rise.In baby care revenue grew 17% like for like  based on volume growth and price increases. The retailer brand channel was favorable overall  with volume growth driven by baby pants  while diapers were largely stable. Ontex thereby outperformed both submarkets  especially on baby pants  where it outpaced at double the rate  benefitting from the success of its new Happyfit platform and supporting production capacity increases. In adult care revenue growth continued  up 12% like for like  mostly from pricing. Growth in the institutional channel was more subdued  as price pass-through is contractually limited. Retail and on-line channels grew consistently double digit  however  as this segment grows with more attention for care at home. Feminine care products grew 21% like for like  both through volume and pricing.Adjusted EBITDA of Core Markets (continuing operations)Adjusted EBITDA of Core Markets was €104 million  down 33%  with revenue growth contributing 164 million and gross savings €55 million. While these were still more than offset by raw material and operating cost inflation of €(280) million in the year  they reversed the negative trend in Q4. Forex fluctuations had an €8 million positive impact as the increase of the US dollar  which negatively affected the cost base  was more than offset by the appreciation of other currencies  mainly the Russian ruble and the British pound. The adjusted EBITDA margin thereby dropped to 6.2%  4.9pp lower year on year.Cost inflation weighed heavily on the year-on-year comparison  with a negative impact of €(209) million from raw materials and €(71) million from operating costs. The overall cost base rose 22% due to inflation  especially on raw materials  where prices rose 26% year on year  mostly on super absorbent polymers. Compared to end 2020  leading indicators for oil-based raw materials had risen about 70% by the start of 2022 to exceed 100% during H1. While that increase has reduced to about 50% by the end of 2022  the impact remains significant. For fluff  the leading indicator continued to rise over the last two years to almost 90% by year end. As Ontex has been partly protected through contractually fixed purchasing prices  part of the increase will still flow through in the first quarter of 2023. Other operating costs rose similarly  including distribution costs  energy prices and wages  reflecting the inflationary environment.Cost reduction measures delivered €55 million in gross savings  which represents 4.2% of the total cost base  thereby maintaining the momentum to reduce costs annually by about 4%. These consisted entirely of gross savings in operations. Continuous improvement of production efficiency  including lower scrap rates  were the main lever. These were helped by the footprint optimization  with the closure of the production plant in Mayen  Germany  during the first half of the year and the operations in Reidsville  US  in the second half. Despite a challenging supply environment  savings were also realized in the supply chain and design-to-value initiatives allowed to develop more cost-efficient product platforms. After last year’s significant efforts  strict cost control continues to be applied in SG&A  allowing to offset inflation. Combined with revenue growth  this resulted in SG&A costs over revenue to drop to 9.1%  below the 10% target.Total Group (including discontinued operations)Discontinued operations  consisting of the Emerging Markets division generated a revenue of €792 million  up 21% like for like  driven almost entirely by pricing. Volumes were largely stable in Brazil and Mexico  where market growth was slower  whereas in the Middle East volumes continued to grow throughout the period. Forex effects added 7%  with the appreciation of the Mexican peso and Brazilian real more than offsetting the depreciation of the Turkish lira. Adjusted EBITDA came in at €32 million  doubling the 2021 figure  as revenue growth and savings exceeded cost inflation and forex. Inflation started impacting these markets earlier in 2021 and price increases were more rapidly implemented  given the preponderance of branded channels. The net forex effect was negative since the adverse impact of the US dollar appreciation on cost outweighed the forex gains in revenue. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 4.0%  increasing by 1.4pp.Total Group revenue rose to €2 464 million  up 17% like for like  with pricing up 11% and volume and mix contributing 6%. Adjusted EBITDA was €136 million  a 21% decrease  as inflation impacted operating costs by €(392) million and SG&A costs by €(13) million  more than offsetting the revenue growth benefit of €299 million and the gross operating savings of €81 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin thereby dropped to 5.5%  down 3.0pp year on year.Q4 2022 BUSINESS REVIEWRevenue of Core Markets (continuing operations)Revenue of Core Markets was €460 million  up 20% like for like  including steady contribution from volume and mix and significantly higher prices. Positive forex fluctuations  with the year-on-year appreciation of the US dollar and Russian ruble  added 4%  bringing overall revenue growth to 24% year on year. With a 7% increase compared to Q3  this marks seven consecutive quarters of sequential growth.The volume and mix increase of 6%  in line with the third quarter  was based on solid market momentum and the contract gains secured earlier in Europe and North America. Retail brands are gaining share in Europe  as consumers seek better value-for-money alternatives  notably in feminine and baby care.Prices were up 14% on average versus last year  continuing the acceleration seen through the year starting from 2% in the first quarter.In baby care  revenue grew 23% like for like compared to last year  with baby pants volume up some 30%  driving the growth of retailer brands  which outpace the overall market. In adult care revenue growth was 14% like for like  mostly driven by pricing and volume growth in retail channels. Price increases in adult care were relatively lower due to contract structure limitations in institutional healthcare channels. Feminine care revenue grew 32% like for like.Adjusted EBITDA of Core Markets (continuing operations)Adjusted EBITDA of Core Markets was €40 million  up 31% year on year  marking the first quarter of year-on-year recovery. Revenue growth contributed €65 million and gross savings €16 million to the year-on-year evolution  more than offsetting the adverse impact of raw material and operating cost inflation of €(74) million. Forex fluctuations had a €3 million positive net impact  with the appreciation of the Russian ruble offsetting the net negative cost impact of US dollar appreciation. Compared to Q3  adjusted EBITDA was up 68%  as prices were raised further  volume growth and savings delivery levels were maintained and cost inflation remained largely stable versus Q3. The adjusted EBITDA margin thereby recovered to 8.8%  up 0.5pp versus Q4 2021  and up 3.2pp sequentially versus Q3 2022  but still well below historic margins.Cost inflation continued to impact the year-on-year comparison significantly  with a negative impact of €(57) million from raw materials and €(18) million from operating costs  largely similar to the year-on-year increase in the third quarter. Raw material costs were up significantly  mostly driven by non-indexed components of the price setting  such as energy  distribution and wage inflation. These also drove Ontex’s own operating costs up significantly. The total cost base went up by 21% versus the fourth quarter of 2021.Cost reduction measures contributed €16 million in gross savings. While gross operating savings of €14 million were in line with the previous quarter  SG&A costs were reduced quarter on quarter and year on year to 8.2% of revenue  despite wage inflation.Total Group (including discontinued operations)Discontinued operations  consisting of the Emerging Markets division  generated a revenue of €215 million  up 22% like for like compared with the last quarter of 2021  driven mostly by pricing  and a small positive impact of volume and mix coming from gains in the Middle East. Overall revenue growth was 32% year on year  thanks to positive forex fluctuations  with the higher Mexican peso and Brazilian real more than offsetting the lower Turkish lira. Adjusted EBITDA came in at €11 million  similar to the third quarter  and compares to €1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue growth and savings more than compensated for cost inflation. The US dollar appreciation impact on cost offset the positive impact of forex on revenue. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 5.1%  is up 4.8pp versus 2021  and in line with the third quarter.Total Group revenue thereby rose to €675 million  up 20% like for like compared to 2021. Prices were up 16% and volume and mix contributed 5%. Including forex fluctuations  revenue was up 26% year on year  and up 6% compared to the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was €51 million  a 64% year on year increase and 46% quarter-on-quarter. The revenue growth impact of €103 million and €21 million gross operating savings more than offset the cost inflation impact on raw materials  operating and SG&A costs of €(107) million combined. The adjusted EBITDA margin thereby was 7.6%  up 1.7pp year on year  and 2.1pp quarter on quarter.2022 OPERATIONAL REVIEWInvestmentsOntex continues to invest in its operations. About 1/3rd of capex in 2022 was invested in capacity expansions  notably in adult care in Europe and baby care in North America. In July Ontex opened a new plant there in Stokesdale  North Carolina  complementing Ontex’s plant in Tijuana  Mexico to supply the growing retailer and lifestyle brand channels in North America.Operational excellenceContinuous delivery on operational cost reduction measures delivered €81 million  of which €56 million in continuing operations  allowing to reduce the raw materials and operating costs  prior to inflation  by 4.9% in 2022  up from 3.7% in 2021. These efforts require capital and operational expenditure as well as some restructuring costs  which were mostly taken in previous years. To optimize the manufacturing footprint  several production lines were moved across Ontex’s operations and three plants were shut down. The production plants in Mayen  Germany  and in Ethiopia were closed in the first half  while the remaining lines in Reidsville  US  were discontinued in the second half  following the start-up of operations in Stokesdale. The scrap generation was reduced by a further 15% and Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) improved by 4pp. While service levels were still down on 2021 overall  caused by the disruption in the supply chain  they showed continuous improvement versus the end of 2021.InnovationIn 2022 innovation represented some €20 million in operational and capital expenditure. The success of Ontex’s innovation platform is demonstrated by the market uptake of its new baby pant platform Happyfit®. Developed in 2020  it was brought to the market in 2021 and represents the bulk of Ontex’s growth in the baby care category in 2022. The product platform is now being further developed for swim pants. In baby diapers  the new absorption technology Climaflex® was launched end of 2021 and commercially deployed in 2022. This technology ensures comfort  protects the skin and ensures absorption even under extensive baby motion. In adult care  Ontex has developed a smart continence management service for elderly homes and hospitals in Europe under the brand Orizon®. In 2022 field studies across Europe received enthusiastic reception of the concept. The commercial deployment is foreseen in 2023.2022 SUSTAINABILITY REVIEWSafety [1]Ontex takes the safety of its employees at heart. The accident frequency rate was 3.78 accidents per million worked hours. While improving versus 2020  this marks a step-back compared to 2.96 in 2021. Ontex has put in place the necessary action plans to bring the trend back within its ultimate ambition to a zero accident work environment.Climate change [1]In 2022 Ontex managed to further reduce its scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 47% versus 2020  compared to 41% in 2021  and is working out the steps needed to improve its scope 3 emissions. Ontex commits to achieving carbon-neutral operations by 2030  reducing its own greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2030  through energy savings  on-site renewable energy production as well as purchasing energy from renewable sources and carbon offsets. The company also has the ambition to cut the emissions of its global supply chain by 25% by 2030. In October  Ontex activated a large solar power installation in Italy  which will produce more than 10GWh of electricity per year. The company is opening solar power installations in Europe and the Americas to produce more energy on-site and achieve carbon-neutral operations by 2030. Ontex’s factories in Italy and seven other European countries now run on 100% renewable electricity. In June 2022  the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) approved Ontex’s climate action plan. In December 2022  Ontex received a top A-rating for leadership in corporate transparency and performance on climate change from the global non-profit Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).Sustainable supply chain [1]The sustainable supply chain was further reenforced. The vast majority of wood-based raw materials are 100% certified or controlled and more than 90% of cotton is organic  and in 2022 more than 95% of suppliers signed Ontex’s Supplier Code of Conducts. Gradually  Ontex is boosting its circular product & packaging solutions. The amount of manufacturing waste recycled in the year was 92%. In May 2022 Ontex renewed its support to Woosh  a Belgian startup that aims to make diaper recycling a reality in Ontex’s home country. Together with waste companies Woosh aims to set up the first diaper recycling facility in Belgium. Eco and health labels on products remained largely stable at close to half of sales.[1] Preliminary figures2022 FINANCIAL REVIEWP&LDepreciation was up 7% at €(70) million  reflecting the continued investments in growth and some forex fluctuations.EBITDA adjustments totalled €(103) million  and consist mainly of a €(92) million non-cash impairments. This was mostly related to the €(84) million goodwill impairment on the Russian assets in June. As the continuity of the Russian operations and the associated financial transactions remains uncertain  the Group had decided to separate and then impair a portion of goodwill allocated to its Russian business. Restructuring costs represented €(11) million  covering primarily the further European footprint optimisation.The net finance cost was €(51) million  some €9 million higher than in 2021. The increase reflects the higher average interest rate following the issuance in July 2021 of a €580 million bond at a 3.5% fixed rate  and the impact of the rising Euribor on the floating rate debt  especially in the second half of the year.The income tax was €(28) million  mainly due to the geographical mix  certain losses than cannot be recognized  such as the impairment on the Russian activities  and some previously recognized deferred tax assets which were derecognized.Discontinued operations booked a loss of €(122) million  compared to €(42) million in 2021. The adjusted EBITDA was €32 million and includes a €(4) million bad debt provision for certain receivables in Brazil. EBITDA adjustments were €(123) million  consisting mainly of non-cash goodwill impairment of €(76) million on the Mexican assets  following their agreed divestment  and of €(33) million on the Turkish assets  which corresponds to the hyperinflation impact on these. The remainder was related to restructuring charges and M&A costs. Financial and tax charges were €(20) million and €(11) million respectively.Adjusted profit/loss from continuing operations was €(51) million  compared to €25 million in 2021  reflecting the lower adjusted EBITDA  and the higher financial and tax charges. Including the impact of adjustments and the contribution of discontinued operations the loss for the period was €(270) million  the delta being almost entirely attributable to the non-cash impairments in continuing and discontinued operations. Adjusted earnings per share of continuing operations were €(0.62) compared to €0.30 in 2021. Basic earnings per share were €(3.34)  compared to €(0.76) in 2021.CashCapital expenditure was €(62) million  slightly up versus €(57) million in 2021. The pace of 2.5% of revenue remains low but consists for 2/3rd of investments in expansion  innovation and cost reduction measures. Strict capital management continues to be applied in the current challenging business conditions  but is expected to increase in the future to support further value creating initiatives.Free cash flow (after-tax) outflow was €(54) million  compared to an inflow of €53 million in 2021  mainly as a result of lower EBITDA and the increase in working capital needs of €(46) million. Capex and lease payments  net of disposal proceeds  were €(83) million combined. The cash impact of restructuring costs and other adjustment to EBITDA was €(37) million. Cash taxes were slightly higher at €(25) million. The improving EBITDA in the second half of the year resulted in a positive free cash flow of €4 million  compared to €(59) million in the first half.Balance sheetWorking capital for the total Group at the end of the period was €178 million  a €47 million increase versus the end of 2021. The increase is largely attributable to continuous revenue increase throughout the year. Although working capital over revenue of the last 3 months was 6.6% at the end of the period versus 6.1% in December 2021  this hides an improvement in days of outstanding receivables and inventory. The working capital includes monetization of accounts receivables through factoring for €192 million  versus €163 million at the end of 2021.Net financial debt of the total Group was €867 million at the end of the period including lease liabilities of €138 million. The €142 million increase over the year  includes the negative free cash flow of €(54) million  net interest payments of €(43) million and other financing outflow of €(18) million. The latter are mainly related to costs from the term loan negotiations concluded in February 2022  and hedging costs. Non-cash changes of €(27) million resulted from the increase in lease liabilities  mainly linked to the start-up of production in the US and Poland. At the end of the year Ontex had drawn €115 million from its €250 million revolving credit facility. This mainly covers temporary mismatches in the geographical cash distribution of the €209 million cash position. The leverage ratio was 6.4x at the end of the period  compared to 4.2x at the year start  as debt increased and adjusted EBITDA decreased. Over the last quarter a significant improvement was recorded compared to 7.7x at the end of September. This resulted from the strong adjusted EBITDA improvement and the decrease in net financial debt  from €895 million at the end of September with an improvement in net working capital use.As from 2022  the Emerging Markets activities are reported as assets held for sale  representing most of the €662 million in assets. After deduction of related liabilities  the net value was €412 million.DisclaimerThis report may include forward-looking statements.

The strong increase confirms Ontex’s top line turnaround after several years of organic sales decline and its reactiveness to raw material price increases. Adjusted EBITDA [1] of Core Markets was €104 million  down 33%  with revenue growth contributing €164 million and gross savings €55 million. While these were still more than offset by raw material and operating cost inflation of €(280) million in the year  they reversed the negative trend in Q4.

Basic EPS  including restructuring and impairment costs as well as profit from discontinued operations  was €(3.34) compared to €(0.76) in 2021.

My first 100 days as CEO increased my conviction that there is a significant opportunity. Our strategy is working and I commit to accelerate its execution. Complexity reduction and laser-focus on the strategy execution  will bring us to best-in-class competitivity  which Ontex deserves as a performance-driven organization.”Q4 results Revenue [1] of Core Markets was €460 million  up 20% like for like  including a 6% contribution from volume and mix and 14% higher prices.

With a 7% increase compared to Q3  this marks seven consecutive quarters of sequential growth. Adjusted EBITDA [1] of Core Markets was €40 million  up 31% year on year  marking the first quarter of year-on-year recovery. Revenue growth contributed €65 million and gross savings €16 million to the year-on-year evolution  more than offsetting the adverse impact of raw material and operating cost inflation of €(74) million. Compared to Q3  adjusted EBITDA was up 68%  as prices were raised further and volume growth and savings delivery levels were maintained  while cost inflation remained largely stable. The adjusted EBITDA margin thereby recovered to 8.8%  up 0.5pp year on year  and up 3.2pp quarter on quarter.

The resulting EBITDA margin of 7.6% was up 1.7pp versus Q4 2021  and 2.1pp versus Q3 2022.Outlook While the volatile inflationary macro-economic situation is diminishing  but not over yet  Ontex believes it can continue to restore its profitability in 2023 and expects: Revenue of Core Markets  to grow by high single-digits  consolidating the improvement realized in 2022 and further balancing its portfolio;Adjusted EBITDA margin for Core markets in a range of 8% to 10%  with cost inflation headwinds as from year start to be gradually offset as additional pricing is passed through and structural cost reduction measures continue to deliver;Discontinued operations to contribute positively to adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow;Leverage to reduce by year end from 6.4x to less than 4x  with improving profitability and cash flow discipline remaining a focus. Portfolio developments Ontex entered into a binding agreement in July 2022 to sell its Mexican and related export activities to Softys S.A.  marking a milestone in the transformation of Ontex. Net cash proceeds are estimated at approximately €250 million [2]. The closing is foreseen early Q2 2023  subject to the customary conditions  including the applicable merger clearance approvals. Proceeds from the transaction will be exclusively applied to reduce debt.Ontex is making progress in the divestment of its remaining Emerging Markets businesses  as discussions with potential acquirers continue.The exploratory discussions with AIP have been discontinued. The board and management believe that the persistent macro-economic challenges currently outweigh the strong business rationale of a combination. They also believe that focusing on the stated strategy today and restoring profitable growth will deliver significant value for shareholders. [1] Reported P&L figures  except for basic EPS  represent continuing operations  i.e. Core Markets  only. As from 2022  Emerging Markets  representing some 30% of revenue  are reported as assets held for sale and discontinued operations  following the strategic decision to divest these businesses. [2] Gross proceeds are valued at about €285 million  resulting in an estimated €250 million net proceeds  after deduction of taxes and transaction costs. Some €225 million is to be received at closing  the remainder is a deferred payment.

Revenue in North America was up more than 20% like for like. Forex fluctuations added 4%  as a result of the year-on-year appreciation of the US dollar  Russian ruble and British pound  bringing revenue up 19% overall. Volume and mix remained had a 7% impact  driven by strong market momentum supplemented by the contract gains secured in 2021 both in Europe and North America. As consumers seek better value-for-money alternatives  retailer brands gained share overall in Europe  especially in the second half of the year  when the overall market shrunk in volume  whereas retailer brands continued to grow. Prices were up 8% on average  gradually increasing from 2% in the first quarter to 14% in the fourth quarter  supported by contract renegotiations. Additional pricing actions are being executed to respond to the persisting input cost inflation  which rose faster than pricing and which continues to rise. In baby care revenue grew 17% like for like  based on volume growth and price increases. The retailer brand channel was favorable overall  with volume growth driven by baby pants  while diapers were largely stable. Ontex thereby outperformed both submarkets  especially on baby pants  where it outpaced at double the rate  benefitting from the success of its new Happyfit platform and supporting production capacity increases. In adult care revenue growth continued  up 12% like for like  mostly from pricing. Growth in the institutional channel was more subdued  as price pass-through is contractually limited. Retail and on-line channels grew consistently double digit  however  as this segment grows with more attention for care at home. Feminine care products grew 21% like for like  both through volume and pricing. Adjusted EBITDA of Core Markets (continuing operations) Adjusted EBITDA of Core Markets was €104 million  down 33%  with revenue growth contributing 164 million and gross savings €55 million. While these were still more than offset by raw material and operating cost inflation of €(280) million in the year  they reversed the negative trend in Q4. Forex fluctuations had an €8 million positive impact as the increase of the US dollar  which negatively affected the cost base  was more than offset by the appreciation of other currencies  mainly the Russian ruble and the British pound. The adjusted EBITDA margin thereby dropped to 6.2%  4.9pp lower year on year. Cost inflation weighed heavily on the year-on-year comparison  with a negative impact of €(209) million from raw materials and €(71) million from operating costs. The overall cost base rose 22% due to inflation  especially on raw materials  where prices rose 26% year on year  mostly on super absorbent polymers. Compared to end 2020  leading indicators for oil-based raw materials had risen about 70% by the start of 2022 to exceed 100% during H1. While that increase has reduced to about 50% by the end of 2022  the impact remains significant. For fluff  the leading indicator continued to rise over the last two years to almost 90% by year end. As Ontex has been partly protected through contractually fixed purchasing prices  part of the increase will still flow through in the first quarter of 2023. Other operating costs rose similarly  including distribution costs  energy prices and wages  reflecting the inflationary environment. Cost reduction measures delivered €55 million in gross savings  which represents 4.2% of the total cost base  thereby maintaining the momentum to reduce costs annually by about 4%. These consisted entirely of gross savings in operations. Continuous improvement of production efficiency  including lower scrap rates  were the main lever. These were helped by the footprint optimization  with the closure of the production plant in Mayen  Germany  during the first half of the year and the operations in Reidsville  US  in the second half. Despite a challenging supply environment  savings were also realized in the supply chain and design-to-value initiatives allowed to develop more cost-efficient product platforms. After last year’s significant efforts  strict cost control continues to be applied in SG&A  allowing to offset inflation. Combined with revenue growth  this resulted in SG&A costs over revenue to drop to 9.1%  below the 10% target. Total Group (including discontinued operations) Discontinued operations  consisting of the Emerging Markets division generated a revenue of €792 million  up 21% like for like  driven almost entirely by pricing. Volumes were largely stable in Brazil and Mexico  where market growth was slower  whereas in the Middle East volumes continued to grow throughout the period. Forex effects added 7%  with the appreciation of the Mexican peso and Brazilian real more than offsetting the depreciation of the Turkish lira. Adjusted EBITDA came in at €32 million  doubling the 2021 figure  as revenue growth and savings exceeded cost inflation and forex. Inflation started impacting these markets earlier in 2021 and price increases were more rapidly implemented  given the preponderance of branded channels. The net forex effect was negative since the adverse impact of the US dollar appreciation on cost outweighed the forex gains in revenue. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 4.0%  increasing by 1.4pp. Total Group revenue rose to €2 464 million  up 17% like for like  with pricing up 11% and volume and mix contributing 6%. Adjusted EBITDA was €136 million  a 21% decrease  as inflation impacted operating costs by €(392) million and SG&A costs by €(13) million  more than offsetting the revenue growth benefit of €299 million and the gross operating savings of €81 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin thereby dropped to 5.5%  down 3.0pp year on year. Q4 2022 BUSINESS REVIEW Revenue of Core Markets (continuing operations) Revenue of Core Markets was €460 million  up 20% like for like  including steady contribution from volume and mix and significantly higher prices. Positive forex fluctuations  with the year-on-year appreciation of the US dollar and Russian ruble  added 4%  bringing overall revenue growth to 24% year on year. With a 7% increase compared to Q3  this marks seven consecutive quarters of sequential growth. The volume and mix increase of 6%  in line with the third quarter  was based on solid market momentum and the contract gains secured earlier in Europe and North America. Retail brands are gaining share in Europe  as consumers seek better value-for-money alternatives  notably in feminine and baby care. Prices were up 14% on average versus last year  continuing the acceleration seen through the year starting from 2% in the first quarter. In baby care  revenue grew 23% like for like compared to last year  with baby pants volume up some 30%  driving the growth of retailer brands  which outpace the overall market. In adult care revenue growth was 14% like for like  mostly driven by pricing and volume growth in retail channels. Price increases in adult care were relatively lower due to contract structure limitations in institutional healthcare channels. Feminine care revenue grew 32% like for like. Adjusted EBITDA of Core Markets (continuing operations) Adjusted EBITDA of Core Markets was €40 million  up 31% year on year  marking the first quarter of year-on-year recovery. Revenue growth contributed €65 million and gross savings €16 million to the year-on-year evolution  more than offsetting the adverse impact of raw material and operating cost inflation of €(74) million. Forex fluctuations had a €3 million positive net impact  with the appreciation of the Russian ruble offsetting the net negative cost impact of US dollar appreciation. Compared to Q3  adjusted EBITDA was up 68%  as prices were raised further  volume growth and savings delivery levels were maintained and cost inflation remained largely stable versus Q3. The adjusted EBITDA margin thereby recovered to 8.8%  up 0.5pp versus Q4 2021  and up 3.2pp sequentially versus Q3 2022  but still well below historic margins. Cost inflation continued to impact the year-on-year comparison significantly  with a negative impact of €(57) million from raw materials and €(18) million from operating costs  largely similar to the year-on-year increase in the third quarter. Raw material costs were up significantly  mostly driven by non-indexed components of the price setting  such as energy  distribution and wage inflation. These also drove Ontex’s own operating costs up significantly. The total cost base went up by 21% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Cost reduction measures contributed €16 million in gross savings. While gross operating savings of €14 million were in line with the previous quarter  SG&A costs were reduced quarter on quarter and year on year to 8.2% of revenue  despite wage inflation. Total Group (including discontinued operations) Discontinued operations  consisting of the Emerging Markets division  generated a revenue of €215 million  up 22% like for like compared with the last quarter of 2021  driven mostly by pricing  and a small positive impact of volume and mix coming from gains in the Middle East. Overall revenue growth was 32% year on year  thanks to positive forex fluctuations  with the higher Mexican peso and Brazilian real more than offsetting the lower Turkish lira. Adjusted EBITDA came in at €11 million  similar to the third quarter  and compares to €1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue growth and savings more than compensated for cost inflation. The US dollar appreciation impact on cost offset the positive impact of forex on revenue. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 5.1%  is up 4.8pp versus 2021  and in line with the third quarter. Total Group revenue thereby rose to €675 million  up 20% like for like compared to 2021. Prices were up 16% and volume and mix contributed 5%. Including forex fluctuations  revenue was up 26% year on year  and up 6% compared to the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was €51 million  a 64% year on year increase and 46% quarter-on-quarter. The revenue growth impact of €103 million and €21 million gross operating savings more than offset the cost inflation impact on raw materials  operating and SG&A costs of €(107) million combined. The adjusted EBITDA margin thereby was 7.6%  up 1.7pp year on year  and 2.1pp quarter on quarter. 2022 OPERATIONAL REVIEW Investments Ontex continues to invest in its operations. About 1/3rd of capex in 2022 was invested in capacity expansions  notably in adult care in Europe and baby care in North America. In July Ontex opened a new plant there in Stokesdale  North Carolina  complementing Ontex’s plant in Tijuana  Mexico to supply the growing retailer and lifestyle brand channels in North America. Operational excellence Continuous delivery on operational cost reduction measures delivered €81 million  of which €56 million in continuing operations  allowing to reduce the raw materials and operating costs  prior to inflation  by 4.9% in 2022  up from 3.7% in 2021. These efforts require capital and operational expenditure as well as some restructuring costs  which were mostly taken in previous years. To optimize the manufacturing footprint  several production lines were moved across Ontex’s operations and three plants were shut down. The production plants in Mayen  Germany  and in Ethiopia were closed in the first half  while the remaining lines in Reidsville  US  were discontinued in the second half  following the start-up of operations in Stokesdale. The scrap generation was reduced by a further 15% and Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) improved by 4pp. While service levels were still down on 2021 overall  caused by the disruption in the supply chain  they showed continuous improvement versus the end of 2021. Innovation In 2022 innovation represented some €20 million in operational and capital expenditure. The success of Ontex’s innovation platform is demonstrated by the market uptake of its new baby pant platform Happyfit®. Developed in 2020  it was brought to the market in 2021 and represents the bulk of Ontex’s growth in the baby care category in 2022. The product platform is now being further developed for swim pants. In baby diapers  the new absorption technology Climaflex® was launched end of 2021 and commercially deployed in 2022. This technology ensures comfort  protects the skin and ensures absorption even under extensive baby motion. In adult care  Ontex has developed a smart continence management service for elderly homes and hospitals in Europe under the brand Orizon®. In 2022 field studies across Europe received enthusiastic reception of the concept. The commercial deployment is foreseen in 2023. 2022 SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW Safety [1] Ontex takes the safety of its employees at heart. The accident frequency rate was 3.78 accidents per million worked hours. While improving versus 2020  this marks a step-back compared to 2.96 in 2021. Ontex has put in place the necessary action plans to bring the trend back within its ultimate ambition to a zero accident work environment. Climate change [1] In 2022 Ontex managed to further reduce its scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 47% versus 2020  compared to 41% in 2021  and is working out the steps needed to improve its scope 3 emissions. Ontex commits to achieving carbon-neutral operations by 2030  reducing its own greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2030  through energy savings  on-site renewable energy production as well as purchasing energy from renewable sources and carbon offsets. The company also has the ambition to cut the emissions of its global supply chain by 25% by 2030. In October  Ontex activated a large solar power installation in Italy  which will produce more than 10GWh of electricity per year. The company is opening solar power installations in Europe and the Americas to produce more energy on-site and achieve carbon-neutral operations by 2030. Ontex’s factories in Italy and seven other European countries now run on 100% renewable electricity. In June 2022  the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) approved Ontex’s climate action plan. In December 2022  Ontex received a top A-rating for leadership in corporate transparency and performance on climate change from the global non-profit Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). Sustainable supply chain [1] The sustainable supply chain was further reenforced. The vast majority of wood-based raw materials are 100% certified or controlled and more than 90% of cotton is organic  and in 2022 more than 95% of suppliers signed Ontex’s Supplier Code of Conducts. Gradually  Ontex is boosting its circular product & packaging solutions. The amount of manufacturing waste recycled in the year was 92%. In May 2022 Ontex renewed its support to Woosh  a Belgian startup that aims to make diaper recycling a reality in Ontex’s home country. Together with waste companies Woosh aims to set up the first diaper recycling facility in Belgium. Eco and health labels on products remained largely stable at close to half of sales. [1] Preliminary figures 2022 FINANCIAL REVIEW P&L Depreciation was up 7% at €(70) million  reflecting the continued investments in growth and some forex fluctuations. EBITDA adjustments totalled €(103) million  and consist mainly of a €(92) million non-cash impairments. This was mostly related to the €(84) million goodwill impairment on the Russian assets in June. As the continuity of the Russian operations and the associated financial transactions remains uncertain  the Group had decided to separate and then impair a portion of goodwill allocated to its Russian business. Restructuring costs represented €(11) million  covering primarily the further European footprint optimisation. The net finance cost was €(51) million  some €9 million higher than in 2021. The increase reflects the higher average interest rate following the issuance in July 2021 of a €580 million bond at a 3.5% fixed rate  and the impact of the rising Euribor on the floating rate debt  especially in the second half of the year. The income tax was €(28) million  mainly due to the geographical mix  certain losses than cannot be recognized  such as the impairment on the Russian activities  and some previously recognized deferred tax assets which were derecognized. Discontinued operations booked a loss of €(122) million  compared to €(42) million in 2021. The adjusted EBITDA was €32 million and includes a €(4) million bad debt provision for certain receivables in Brazil. EBITDA adjustments were €(123) million  consisting mainly of non-cash goodwill impairment of €(76) million on the Mexican assets  following their agreed divestment  and of €(33) million on the Turkish assets  which corresponds to the hyperinflation impact on these. The remainder was related to restructuring charges and M&A costs. Financial and tax charges were €(20) million and €(11) million respectively. Adjusted profit/loss from continuing operations was €(51) million  compared to €25 million in 2021  reflecting the lower adjusted EBITDA  and the higher financial and tax charges. Including the impact of adjustments and the contribution of discontinued operations the loss for the period was €(270) million  the delta being almost entirely attributable to the non-cash impairments in continuing and discontinued operations. Adjusted earnings per share of continuing operations were €(0.62) compared to €0.30 in 2021. Basic earnings per share were €(3.34)  compared to €(0.76) in 2021. Cash Capital expenditure was €(62) million  slightly up versus €(57) million in 2021. The pace of 2.5% of revenue remains low but consists for 2/3rd of investments in expansion  innovation and cost reduction measures. Strict capital management continues to be applied in the current challenging business conditions  but is expected to increase in the future to support further value creating initiatives. Free cash flow (after-tax) outflow was €(54) million  compared to an inflow of €53 million in 2021  mainly as a result of lower EBITDA and the increase in working capital needs of €(46) million. Capex and lease payments  net of disposal proceeds  were €(83) million combined. The cash impact of restructuring costs and other adjustment to EBITDA was €(37) million. Cash taxes were slightly higher at €(25) million. The improving EBITDA in the second half of the year resulted in a positive free cash flow of €4 million  compared to €(59) million in the first half. Balance sheet Working capital for the total Group at the end of the period was €178 million  a €47 million increase versus the end of 2021. The increase is largely attributable to continuous revenue increase throughout the year. Although working capital over revenue of the last 3 months was 6.6% at the end of the period versus 6.1% in December 2021  this hides an improvement in days of outstanding receivables and inventory. The working capital includes monetization of accounts receivables through factoring for €192 million  versus €163 million at the end of 2021. Net financial debt of the total Group was €867 million at the end of the period including lease liabilities of €138 million. The €142 million increase over the year  includes the negative free cash flow of €(54) million  net interest payments of €(43) million and other financing outflow of €(18) million. The latter are mainly related to costs from the term loan negotiations concluded in February 2022  and hedging costs. Non-cash changes of €(27) million resulted from the increase in lease liabilities  mainly linked to the start-up of production in the US and Poland. At the end of the year Ontex had drawn €115 million from its €250 million revolving credit facility. This mainly covers temporary mismatches in the geographical cash distribution of the €209 million cash position. The leverage ratio was 6.4x at the end of the period  compared to 4.2x at the year start  as debt increased and adjusted EBITDA decreased. Over the last quarter a significant improvement was recorded compared to 7.7x at the end of September. This resulted from the strong adjusted EBITDA improvement and the decrease in net financial debt  from €895 million at the end of September with an improvement in net working capital use. As from 2022  the Emerging Markets activities are reported as assets held for sale  representing most of the €662 million in assets. After deduction of related liabilities  the net value was €412 million. Disclaimer This report may include forward-looking statements.

AB InBev is the parent company of Budweiser APAC and is a public company based in Leuven  Belgium and listed on Euronext which has over 600 years of brewing heritage and an extensive global presence.Michel Doukeris  CEO of AB InBev 059 Coastline Craft inspired by Fujianese ingredients AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris (on the right) visits local market The Corona X Lime Poverty Alleviation ProjectThis year marks the beginning of Chinese modernization. The past two months have shown good economic growth  which is promising for both consumption and investment in China. ""China is the largest beer industry globally. China is such an important market  one of the top markets for us globally. It was only natural to me to come on in the year  to see how things are and have the opportunity to talk to the team. And I'm very glad to see how consumption is returning very fast."" said Mr. Doukeris. During his interview with Chinese media  Mr. Doukeris shared AB InBev's strategic plans in China. This included progress toward carbon neutrality  sustainability and AB InBev's ESG goals  as well as ways the beer industry can boost local consumption and economic revitalization.Investments in China for Long-Term GrowthMr. Doukeris emphasized China's importance to AB InBev  noting that ""one beer in four globally is consumed in China"". Since entering China in 1984  AB InBev has laid down significant roots in the country and invested more than 30B RMB (including direct investments and acquisitions). AB InBev brews beer at approximately 30 breweries across China and provides a diverse portfolio of more than 50 brands. AB InBev has also spared no efforts to fulfill its commitments to the Chinese market  while continually increasing its investment here.In recent years  China has firmly and continuously implemented its ""dual circulation"" model in which domestic market is core with foreign investment to accelerate the growth and expansion. This aligns with the country's commitment to high-quality economic opening following the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The growth of the middle-income population at the size of over 400 million and the ongoing trends of trading up and premiumization are good news to AB InBev which embraced premiumization at very early stage.""We have been in China since 1984. Each and every time that the market is growing  that there is consumption  we need to keep up with the investment to grow "" said Mr. Doukeris. The listing of Budweiser APAC on the Hong Kong Exchange in 2019 has increased investment in China. For example the Putian Craft Brewery  the largest craft brewery of Budweiser China  started operation in July 2022  producing globally well-known craft beers such as Goose Island and Boxing Cat. It is also a base for its locally inspired craft beer brand ""059 Coastline Craft"" which combines local ingredients in Fujian such as Wuyi Mountain Da Hong Pao tea and FJ passion fruit.AB InBev's development in China was also fast-tracked last October when the beer industry was listed as an encouraged catalogue in the West and Northeast. AB InBev promptly invested to expand the brewery for the production of its three premium brands at its Ziyang plant  Sichuan province  by an additional 42 000 tons.Expand Consumption to Accelerate Market GrowthChina's 2022 Central Economic Work Conference stated that relevant local government departments should prioritize recovery and expansion of consumption. China's Ministry of Commerce also defined 2023 as the year of consumption-expansion with nationwide promotions to boost consumption and revitalize the market.Shortly after arriving in Beijing  Mr. Doukeris and his team visited the market to see the recovery of consumption first-hand at local restaurants and pubs. Mr. Doukeris noted  ""With the rise of 'she economy'  healthy consumption and other market segments  AB InBev will continue to introduce more diversified and innovative products. We will create more consumption occasions while establishing connections with more consumers.""Beer consumption is occasion oriented  creates more human interactions and strengthens connections among us—thereby playing an important role in boosting overall consumption in the market. ""The beer industry is of huge significance in global economy."" said Mr. Doukeris  ""According to a new Oxford Economics study  one out of one hundred and ten jobs is related directly and indirectly with the beer industry.""Despite three years of global pandemic  being one of the Global Top 500 Enterprises  AB InBev has shown resilience and continued to inject confidence into the industry and market. Budweiser China plans to launch a public welfare program called ""Cheers Campaign"" in China at the end of March. The program aims to support small and medium-sized merchants to boost consumption and the development of the night-time economy with AB InBev's ""BEES"". It is a B2B digital platform which helps wholesalers cut costs and improve efficiency with its technology and professional supports.ESG and Empowering Industrial ChainsThe report to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China highlighted that high-quality development is the first and foremost task for building a modern socialist country. As a sunrise industry with a market size of 400B RMB  the beer industry is speeding towards such development. Budweiser APAC's goal is to become the ""Most Loved High-Quality Growth Leader in Beverage"" and has placed ESG at the heart of its strategy and operations.AB InBev emphasizes that ESG is at the core of its business. Mr. Doukeris reiterated that ""Beer is natural  inclusive and local"". According to him  the beer business can only be sustainable with healthy  prosperous communities and healthy  natural ingredients. Hence  AB InBev's ESG strategy focuses on eight priorities including water stewardship  smart agriculture  circular package and climate action.Budweiser APAC develops ESG breakthroughs through innovation and cooperation with market players and stakeholders of the upstream and downstream value chain. Its Nanning brewery sets a new industry benchmark with water efficiency of 1.11hl/hl; its breweries in Wuhan and Jinzhou are the first carbon-neutral breweries; and its Taizhou brewery is 'Zero Waste'. Last June  MSCI ranked Budweiser China as an ESG leader with AA rating. Currently  AB InBev is incubating innovative ESG solutions through the 100+ Accelerator  Budweiser 100+ Innovation Hub  and the Supplier Strategic Alliance.Hand in hand with the business partners  AB InBev leverages its resources and technology to empower the industrial chain and achieve shared prosperity in the communities where it operates. For example  the Wholesaler Excellent Program has already helped nearly 2 000 wholesalers nationwide reduce costs and increase efficiency. Budweiser China has also supported lychee farmers in Zhangzhou  Fujian Province  and lime farmers in Anyue  Sichuan Province  to explore new models of rural revitalization.In the new journey towards Chinese-style modernization  foreign capital has increased involvement in China's high-quality development. By accelerating investment deployment  consumption deployment and ESG  AB InBev has jumpstarted the growth of the beer industry with ""three accelerators"" and strengthened its determination and confidence to further grow the Chinese market.Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2011697/Michel_Doukeris__CEO_of_AB_InBev.jpgPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2011695/059_Coastline_Craft_inspired_by_Fujianese_ingredients.jpgPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2011696/AB_InBev_CEO_Michel_Doukeris__on_the_right__visits_local_market.jpgPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2011698/The_Corona_X_Lime_Poverty_Alleviation_Project.jpgSOURCE AB InBev",neutral,0.03,0.96,0.0,positive,0.96,0.03,0.0,True,English,"['First Global Executive', 'AB InBev', 'More Cheers', 'ABI', 'CEO', 'China', 'Minister', 'Commerce', 'Future', 'The Corona X Lime Poverty Alleviation Project', 'Wuyi Mountain Da Hong Pao tea', 'new Oxford Economics study', '2022 Central Economic Work Conference', 'relevant local government departments', 'AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris', 'Hong Kong Exchange', 'AB InBev 059 Coastline Craft', 'past two months', 'dual circulation"" model', 'high-quality economic opening', '20th National Congress', 'FJ passion fruit', 'Three Leading ""Accelerators', 'extensive global presence', 'Putian Craft Brewery', 'largest craft brewery', 'Mr. Wang Wentao', 'craft beer brand', 'Global Top 500 Enterprises', 'three premium brands', 'other market segments', 'good economic growth', 'largest beer industry', 'Beer Industry Growth', 'central government', 'economic revitalization', 'craft beers', 'top markets', 'good news', 'global pandemic', 'Mr. Doukeris', 'local ingredients', 'local restaurants', 'three years', 'one beer', 'local market', 'Fortune 500 company', 'early visitor', 'pandemic restrictions', 'parent company', 'public company', 'brewing heritage', 'Fujianese ingredients', 'Chinese modernization', 'Chinese media', 'strategic plans', 'carbon neutrality', 'ESG goals', 'Long-Term Growth', 'significant roots', '30B RMB', 'diverse portfolio', 'Communist Party', 'middle-income population', 'ongoing trends', 'early stage', 'Goose Island', 'Boxing Cat', 'Ziyang plant', 'Sichuan province', 'additional 42,000 tons', 'nationwide promotions', 'innovative products', 'human interactions', 'important role', 'huge significance', 'global economy', 'one hundred', 'ten jobs', 'local consumption', 'Budweiser APAC', 'recent years', 'important market', 'Chinese market', 'domestic market', 'Market Growth', 'Beer consumption', 'direct investments', 'healthy consumption', 'consumption occasions', 'overall consumption', 'foreign investment', 'Budweiser China', '50 brands', '600 years', 'BEIJING', 'March', 'PRNewswire', 'February', 'Minister', 'Commerce', 'lifting', 'Leuven', 'Belgium', 'Euronext', 'right', 'beginning', 'things', 'opportunity', 'team', 'interview', 'progress', 'sustainability', 'ways', 'importance', 'country', 'acquisitions', '30 breweries', 'efforts', 'commitments', 'expansion', 'size', 'premiumization', 'listing', 'example', 'operation', 'July', 'base', 'development', 'catalogue', 'West', 'Northeast', 'production', 'recovery', 'Ministry', 'pubs', 'diversified', 'connections', 'consumers', 'resilience', 'confidence']",2023-03-01,2023-03-02,prnewswire.com

First of all  welcome to Dolphin Drilling's Fourth Quarter Presentation 2022. This is our first presentation since we went public on the Euronext Growth on the 28th of October 2022. With me today  I have Stephen Cox  the Chief Financial Officer of Dolphin Drilling and myself  Bjørnar Iversen  the CEO.Today  you have the opportunity to put questions to us in the chat that you see on the right corner in your screen  and you can do that through the whole presentation. We will  at the end  after the presentation  pick up those questions and answer them as good as we can. Then as always  we refer to the disclaimer. And for those with special interest  please read that.Today's presenter  I have already introduced myself and Stephen. So then a little bit about today's agenda. First  we will go through the highlights of the quarter  then including the key metrics  we will go through  and I will present the operational update. Stephen will take the key metrics and financial figures. Then I will come to a little bit in that presentation of the market outlook. And at the end  I will do a quick summary. For the picture here  we see Blackford Dolphin.Okay. Q4 and the subsequent highlights. Mobilization  we have - had during this quarter  mobilized the Blackford Dolphin from Mexico to Las Palmas. At Las Palmas we've had and she arrived Las Palmas in November 2022. During that phase  we also received the second mobilization payment from Global Hydrocarbons Limited  and we went straight into our 5-year recertification or classwork  a 5-year class for Blackford at the yard in Las Palmas.That scope was finished early February  and it came in  in line with the budget  which was $15 million. We came in a little bit shy of the $15 million budget. Today  Blackford Dolphin is on route to Nigeria  and she is estimated to arrive Nigerian Waters 2nd of March  and then she will go through a quick test  and then she will be on contract  we estimate mid-March.We have also  during the quarter  signed a letter of award for further work for Blackford Dolphin  at a day rate of $325 000 a day. That's the all-in day rate based on the minimum term. During the quarter  we had some initial challenges when we exited Mexico to get the right approvals to take the rig out and export - the rig or take out a rig out of Mexico  and that has increased vessel cost and a little bit the time cost during the quarter. Of course  this also basically kicks into a longer transit time. On the picture at the right  we see the Blackford Dolphin  the parting Las Palmas on the 9th of February earlier this month.Then I think we go quickly into the key metrics and the results of Q2  and I give the word to you  Stephen.Stephen CoxThanks  Bjørnar. So very quickly  we'll touch on the numbers here. As everybody is aware  Q3 and Q4  we had very minimal revenues. All our fleet was either mobilizing or stacked in Norway. The key aspects of this were that we did manage to close the account with Pemex. We did receive all payments that were due to Dolphin to that process  including a demobilization. And we also have been touched on previously received the second half of the mobilization payment due from GHL  which was $6 million.So the income flow in  the cash came into the company during Q4. We did  as expected  to spend roughly $16 million  $17 million. That's consistent with Q3. That's our general OpEx as we've gone through the quarter. And then as you can see on the page there  pretty much all the CapEx that we incurred in the quarter was connected to the Blackford SPS.Again  as everybody is aware  Dolphin is completely debt-free. We finished the year-end with $36 million - just below $36 million in cash. Some of that was restricted as you'll see in the accounts  and that's linked to the mobilization that will be released upon arrival in Mexico. So all in  roughly zero revenue quarter and as expected on OpEx targets. I think that's everything in there.Bjørnar IversenThat's in on that page. Okay.Stephen CoxYes. So the big numbers  I think the key number to look at for the company. Backlog-wise  looking at the 12 months we have with GHL  that's equivalent of $85 million. That's after receipt of the mobilization. So $85 million in booked backlog. Market cap today around about USD150 million and then zero debt  and that's a position that we're in right now.Bjørnar IversenThank you  Stephen. Let's then take a quick operational update. As we see on this slide  we see our rigs  and we have the Borgland and the Bideford smart stack  in a smart stack mode outside Flekkefjord in Norway. Both of them has - have a mobilization time around 80 to 120 days with an estimated mobilization cost in the range of 20 to 25 each. They are both heavily marketed  both in the North Sea and internationally. And we have had multiple customers already visiting the rigs lately.I will come back to the market situation  more about the market situation or other rigs in the market section. But as we see here  we moved the rig from the Blackford rig from Mexico into Las Palmas. And now she is now  as we said  this week entering Nigerian Waters and have the expected start-up in May – in March.We have a firm contract with General Hydrocarbons  and we have this new lateral award signed 420 to 485 days based on 325 000 a day  including monitoring [ph] for the shorter period of that contract. So this shows the rigs. It shows the status of the company today. And of course  as we said previously  we are very happy to see that the organization did the SPS on time and cost  though a little bit delayed in the transit time  bringing her out of Mexico and into Las Palmas.And as we said a little bit more in depth here for the Blackford. Blackford arrived safely 24th of November. Capital cost  repeating myself here  $15 million. We have done the full 5-year recertification. They left the port in Las Palmas 9th of February and expected to arrive Nigerian Waters early 2nd of March and will be on the contract shortly thereafter. Expected on contract will be mid-March 2  probably around second week of March and then starting that GHL contract we mentioned. The LOA is also mentioned. And as previous - mentioned in some of our presentations with the contract - being on contract with GHL  the company will have a positive operating cash flow.A little bit on the mark look [ph] We decided this presentation to focus on the market. And let me first take you a little bit back in history to show you how the market was in 2010 versus today. In 2010  there were 105 rigs from the standard mode - segment on the contract. Today  we have 23. That's approximately a 75% reduction. We can also note that most of the activities were in the North Sea  it was in the Gulf of Mexico  West Africa  but also Brazil and the Far East  including Australia and New Zealand.Jumping today  we have seen strong interest for more rigs in all the same areas. We have received approximately or  in fact  a little bit more than 20 rig inquiries over the last 90 days. And here  we have put them on the map  and we see the pattern. It pops back in the same areas as we saw back in 2010 and in the last up cycle.As we say - as I said  approximately 20 tenders in process or pre-screenings or direct inquiries  and we have put them on the map here. We also see the location on the Dolphin Drilling rigs there. Two in Flekkefjord  one soon in Nigeria.Okay. That was the demand side. Let's have a look at the supply side [Technical Difficulty] sorry for that  there were some technical issues trying to ruin my main point in the presentation  but I'm going to do - to repeat myself  strong interest for the mod rigs in all offshore basins  as I said  approximately 20 inquiries received over the last 20 days. We have met them on the map here.Okay. Then looking back again  that has to be viewed in the light of history  105 rigs from 2010 down to 23 and then  of course  looking at the supply side. The supply side of rigs has really  really changed from approximately 140 in the last up cycle  down to 36 rigs in the market. That's close to 75% reduction. And if we look at this  of course  this has a major impact. So it's not only that the demand is coming back. It's also that the supply has really  really been reduced.And let's have a deep dive into the 36 rigs in the market. If we look at the gray down there  we see the Caspian Sea and the China  of course  in the Caspian Sea  you cannot take out those rigs  and we have long-term contracts on most of the China rigs. That means 15 rigs are taken out of the market based on that.Then we have the red part  which is the high reactivation cost rigs. We have four of those. And today  we have 12 rigs on contract. That means we have five free and available rigs  more rigs available in the market  and please have a reflect - reflect on that in relation to the 20 opportunities we've seen in there that has currently come up over the 19 days and look at it in the light of that it was 105 rigs on contract in 2010.So there might be an overlap of some other rig segments  but take into consideration that sixth-generation rigs are currently operating or marketed around the 400 - 450 000 mark internationally. And there might be some of this that is sliding. But as we see it  we think there's a high probability to bring the rest of the fleet out and to have a very  very strong rig market going forward. So we are very optimistic on that.Then I would like to take you quickly into the U.K. market. It has nearing sold out. The rig market has gone from three rigs contracted in December 2021 to 11 rigs as we see there in 2023  and one to 11 there. And then you have three rigs or four rigs available. That is the Borgland Dolphin and Bideford Dolphin. In addition to that  you have the Transocean Leader and the Ocean Valiant that both needs  as we said from the previous slide  slightly higher investments to bring them back into the market. So a tight market in the U.K.But in the U.K.  we have seen the windfall tax. It has reduced a little bit the investment appetite  but still  we think that there will be a relatively high investment and increased spending. It will not change the direction of the investment.As we see here  investments in the U.K. has been around the $6 billion mark. The predictions is an 87% increase. It might be reduced somewhat due to the last windfall taxes. But as I said  we don't believe in a change in the direction of that travel. We think that U.K. will be rational and will do their energy investments to bring back energy security and a decent cost level.That brings us back to the summary  and I will start with summarizing the strategy of the company. Based on what we just said  we believe in an improved market and improved market conditions for the existing fleet. We think that the day rates will come up and that we will be able to announce and take out the rigs within a recent period of time.We still have the marketing rights for the Keppel newbuilds  which we're still marketing in the market or marketing out in the market  particularly in Norway. We are still chasing management opportunities on some assets  and we are still focusing on growing the company  doing some opportunistic moves.So to sum up the quarter  Blackford is through on contract start-up in Nigeria that will move the company of Dolphin Drilling into a positive operating cash flow. We see some near-term opportunities that will add the backlog to Blackford at increased day rates. We see a significant increased tender activity for standard mod rigs in the global market. And as we saw  the supply is very limited.And we think that both Borgland and Bideford are two of the few remaining units in the market  and we are working to realize our growth opportunities. And again  to the right  we see the Blackford  left Las Palmas  the 9th of February  and we expect to be in Nigerian Waters on the 2nd of March beyond contract mid-March.On that  I think we open up for the Q&A session. And Stephen  have we received any - any questions?Question-and-Answer SessionA - Stephen CoxYes. So a few questions here. So let me just start off with the first one. So in Nigeria  you got a day rate of $325 000. Do you consider that a good rate in today's market?Bjørnar IversenI think the - yes  I would say it's a good rate in today's market. But we see that the ultra-deepwater  the tide is lifting all the boats  and it starts with the ultra-deepwater market. And we've seen the ultra- deep market - water market go around 400  450. And some is now saying that they're bidding above the 500 mark. So there's an upward pull on the premium segment. And that lifts the rest of the market.And my answer to that is  yes  it's a good rate  but we have seen day rates on - in this market significantly higher than we've seen today. And personally  I think the market will go up  continue to increase in all segments due to the lack of supply in combination with increase in demand.Stephen CoxOkay. Next question here. Could you add some flavor to the start-up and duration of the approximate 20 mentioned inquiries on Slide 14?Bjørnar IversenYes. What we see there  most of it will be start-ups  the earliest one of those start-ups will be  I would say  third  fourth quarter this year  the earliest one of those inquiries  but most of them kicking in from early '24 and from early mid-'24. It seems that the lead time on tenders on the standard segment is somewhat between  I would say  6 and 12 months  probably leaning towards 9 months. So I think that's the answer to that  Stephen.Stephen CoxSo there's a connected question here  but I'm just going to take the second half of what was the key challenges with the reactivation. I presume that's of the Borgland and Bideford?Bjørnar IversenI don't see that as a big challenge. We have secured - we have something called smart stack. That means we have secured the key personnel for the rigs. So we have the key personnel of the drilling section and the technical section and the marine section. That means we have the key guys to take out the rig.So when we mobilize a rig  of course  we need local crew in the country or the market we go to. So there's a hiring or an HR mobilization challenge  which we will overcome. And then  of course  in a tighter market  you need access to the critical vendors for doing the actual job. And that is  of course  also becoming a little bit tighter. So I would say that those are the two things that we need to manage.Stephen CoxOkay. There was a specific question on Blackford here. How do you see the market for Blackford going forward? Are you able to market Blackford is a deepwater rig now that the high-spec deepwater is sold out  can we expect to see day rates of $400 000?Bjørnar IversenThe answer is yes. We see - if you look at the map and the opportunity map  there's a lot of dots around West Africa. The beauty of Blackford  it is a deepwater asset. It can go down to 1 800 meters. And there's not many rigs in the world that can do that. The other ones  as you said  is the ultra deepwater rigs  the big DP rigs.So we see demand in West Africa on the deepwater side  and we see some other basins like India  where there's also - also an opportunity. And we will look at  of course  adjusting the day rates to the right level. So the rig has been operating well north of 400  and I think we will see it in this up cycle  too.Stephen CoxI'll try and take these in some sequence. So would it be different CapEx involved in Bideford and Borland to bring it back to work in a more exotic location than the North Sea  Brazil  Australia or other basins?Bjørnar IversenThe answer is yes. Yes and no  there will be a slightly lower cost on personnel. So typically  if we go international  we have our key personnel  which will be  let's say  North Sea-based Norway  U.K. based mainly. And of course  in some markets  you have a slightly lower wage level and some other markets  slightly higher wage level. So it depends. So I think the estimates of 2025 is good for both.Stephen CoxSpecific to CapEx reactivation...Bjørnar IversenYes.Stephen CoxIt's more determined by the location?Bjørnar IversenExactly.Stephen CoxSo let me get this - what is your best guess on the cost of bringing one of the high reactivation cost rigs back to the market?Bjørnar IversenI would say north of $50 million  probably somewhat between $50 million and $100 million  75 is in the middle. So let's say  my guesstimate then will be 60 to 70 will be the expected level to bring back some of the four others that we had on that list.Stephen CoxThere's a specific question here around possible to give some more guidance around timing of a contract for Borgland?Bjørnar IversenIt's always difficult to predict the past  but I can say there's a lot of activity around the Borgland. Our ambition is to have a start-up on Borgland still in 2023  and we still have time for that  and there's significant interest around the rig.And so I would say  signing or getting a contract has to be this quarter. So it has to be able to mobilize in this year. You have to have a signed contract this quarter. So at the earliest  this quarter  so - and we are now at the end of February. So that means within the next 30 days. So there's a lot of interest around her. And we also  as I said  see incoming  increased incoming activity around the Bideford in this setup  referring again to the 20 processes we have.So I would say - from a month best case  worst case slipping a little bit into the second quarter  but it's going to be sold out. There's - I'm 100% convinced of that  in fact.Stephen CoxIn the connected question  do you see increased competition from modern floaters becoming available at Norway?Bjørnar IversenWe see some tender activity from particularly Transocean in Australia  and I would not - this trial - that's a possibility that they will pick up something. So - but outside that  I don't see anything. I think Norway from '24 and onwards has an undersupply of rigs by itself. And I think we probably will see over the next quarter  at least before the summer holidays  rig commitments in Norway  particularly from Equinor [ph] but also some of the others that is looking for rigs. So I don't believe in the great out flux of rigs from Norway  maybe one  maybe two maximum.Stephen CoxAnd then there's a question about cost inflation  reactivating an operational and difference in cost between the North Sea and international  which we may be touched on with the wage aspect. It's predominantly driven by the salary aspect and the wages. There's been some slight supply chain pressure.Bjørnar IversenI would say the big thing is Norway has a different location 24[ph] while the rest of the world has equal time. That means you have - you need to have an extra crew in Norway  and that means $30  $35 000 a day in extra cost. Taking that aside  there's a little bit different cost level if we operate in India or Brazil or Mexico or Nigeria. West Africa is still high  relatively high OpEx  lower OpEx  India  Asia. So it varies a little bit  but the big differentiator is that 24 Norway it's the different market  yeah.Stephen CoxOkay. That's all.Bjørnar IversenI think that's what we had on the Q&A session. So on that note  we thank you all for calling in and showing interest in the company  and we are looking forward to have you back in the quarter presenting first quarter results and with news and updates from the company in three months' time.

Potential bidders  including buyout funds  are now considering throwing their hat in the ring  a second source said  adding that private equity would be able to raise money for a takeover.Analysts have also tipped Germany's Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) as a potential bidder for Allfunds  with a view to bolstering its existing fund services operation.""By virtue of doing nothing  we believe Deutsche Boerse comes out on top from this episode "" analysts at Jefferies said. A deal ""could yet come back for Allfunds  but there is no obvious time imperative.""A Deutsche Boerse spokeswoman declined to comment.RARE REVERSALEuronext had so far focused on snapping up national exchanges  most recently Borsa Italiana  to become a pan-European stock exchange  with bourses in Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon  Oslo and Paris.There are few European exchanges left for Euronext to buy  and further acquisitions could run up against competition constraints.ING analysts considered Euronext's indicative offer as too low. ""Clearly  so did the Allfunds board and majority shareholders "" the analysts said.Euronext's sudden change of mind is an unusual move for CEO Stephane Boujnah  although Euronext does have strict financial conditions on takeovers  meaning it cannot pursue a deal at any price.Any takeover must have a return on capital goal above the weighted average cost of capital after three to five years  as per Euronext's own investment criteria.Euronext is also building up activities in stock and derivatives clearing  and needs to avoid the distraction that a contested and expensive takeover bid would bring.($1 = 0.9389 euros)Reporting by Mathieu Rosemain  Huw Jones  Pablo Mayo Cerqueiro and Chiara Elisei; Editing by Jane MerrimanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",neutral,0.01,0.96,0.03,mixed,0.11,0.11,0.77,True,English,"[""Allfunds' M&A prospects"", 'reset button', 'Euronext', 'bid', 'The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles', 'three to five years', 'existing fund services operation', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'A Deutsche Boerse spokeswoman', 'fund management companies', 'pan-European stock exchange', 'CEO Stephane Boujnah', 'strict financial conditions', 'Summary Companies Investors', 'fund distribution company', 'traditional trading activities', 'complex data rules', 'expensive takeover bid', 'Exchange operator Euronext', 'An Allfunds spokesperson', 'private equity', 'possible suitors', 'reset button', 'ALLFG.AS', 'other suitors', 'indicative cash', 'shareholder skepticism', 'LSEG.L', 'new layer', 'merger talks', 'due diligence', 'other access', 'initial talks', 'Potential bidders', 'obvious time', 'RARE REVERSAL', 'national exchanges', 'Borsa Italiana', 'European exchanges', 'competition constraints', 'majority shareholders', 'sudden change', 'unusual move', 'average cost', 'investment criteria', 'derivatives clearing', 'Mathieu Rosemain', 'Huw Jones', 'Mayo Cerqueiro', 'Chiara Elisei', 'Jane Merriman', 'takeover prospects', 'indicative offer', '5.5 billion euros', 'buyout funds', 'second source', 'capital goal', 'game-changing deal', 'shares offer', 'Allfunds board', 'Euronext withdrawal', '0.9389 euros', 'PARIS/LONDON', 'March', 'speculation', 'sign', 'Tuesday', 'terms', 'discussions', 'rivals', 'others', 'areas', 'analytics', 'business', 'borders', 'decision', 'financials', 'field', 'hat', 'money', 'Analysts', 'Germany', 'view', 'virtue', 'top', 'episode', 'Jefferies', 'bourses', 'Amsterdam', 'Brussels', 'Dublin', 'Lisbon', 'Oslo', 'acquisitions', 'mind', 'takeovers', 'price', 'return', 'distraction', 'contested', 'Reporting', 'Pablo', 'Editing', 'Standards']",2023-03-01,2023-03-02,reuters.com

AB InBev is the parent company of Budweiser APAC and is a public company based in Leuven  Belgium and listed on Euronext which has over 600 years of brewing heritage and an extensive global presence.Michel Doukeris  CEO of AB InBev 059 Coastline Craft inspired by Fujianese ingredients AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris (on the right) visits local market The Corona X Lime Poverty Alleviation ProjectThis year marks the beginning of Chinese modernization. The past two months have shown good economic growth  which is promising for both consumption and investment in China. ""China is the largest beer industry globally. China is such an important market  one of the top markets for us globally. It was only natural to me to come on in the year  to see how things are and have the opportunity to talk to the team. And I'm very glad to see how consumption is returning very fast."" said Mr. Doukeris. During his interview with Chinese media  Mr. Doukeris shared AB InBev's strategic plans in China. This included progress toward carbon neutrality  sustainability and AB InBev's ESG goals  as well as ways the beer industry can boost local consumption and economic revitalization.Investments in China for Long-Term GrowthMr. Doukeris emphasized China's importance to AB InBev  noting that ""one beer in four globally is consumed in China"". Since entering China in 1984  AB InBev has laid down significant roots in the country and invested more than 30B RMB (including direct investments and acquisitions). AB InBev brews beer at approximately 30 breweries across China and provides a diverse portfolio of more than 50 brands. AB InBev has also spared no efforts to fulfill its commitments to the Chinese market  while continually increasing its investment here.In recent years  China has firmly and continuously implemented its ""dual circulation"" model in which domestic market is core with foreign investment to accelerate the growth and expansion. This aligns with the country's commitment to high-quality economic opening following the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The growth of the middle-income population at the size of over 400 million and the ongoing trends of trading up and premiumization are good news to AB InBev which embraced premiumization at very early stage.""We have been in China since 1984. Each and every time that the market is growing  that there is consumption  we need to keep up with the investment to grow "" said Mr. Doukeris. The listing of Budweiser APAC on the Hong Kong Exchange in 2019 has increased investment in China. For example the Putian Craft Brewery  the largest craft brewery of Budweiser China  started operation in July 2022  producing globally well-known craft beers such as Goose Island and Boxing Cat. It is also a base for its locally inspired craft beer brand ""059 Coastline Craft"" which combines local ingredients in Fujian such as Wuyi Mountain Da Hong Pao tea and FJ passion fruit.AB InBev's development in China was also fast-tracked last October when the beer industry was listed as an encouraged catalogue in the West and Northeast. AB InBev promptly invested to expand the brewery for the production of its three premium brands at its Ziyang plant  Sichuan province  by an additional 42 000 tons.Expand Consumption to Accelerate Market GrowthChina's 2022 Central Economic Work Conference stated that relevant local government departments should prioritize recovery and expansion of consumption. China's Ministry of Commerce also defined 2023 as the year of consumption-expansion with nationwide promotions to boost consumption and revitalize the market.Shortly after arriving in Beijing  Mr. Doukeris and his team visited the market to see the recovery of consumption first-hand at local restaurants and pubs. Mr. Doukeris noted  ""With the rise of 'she economy'  healthy consumption and other market segments  AB InBev will continue to introduce more diversified and innovative products. We will create more consumption occasions while establishing connections with more consumers.""Beer consumption is occasion oriented  creates more human interactions and strengthens connections among us—thereby playing an important role in boosting overall consumption in the market. ""The beer industry is of huge significance in global economy."" said Mr. Doukeris  ""According to a new Oxford Economics study  one out of one hundred and ten jobs is related directly and indirectly with the beer industry.""Despite three years of global pandemic  being one of the Global Top 500 Enterprises  AB InBev has shown resilience and continued to inject confidence into the industry and market. Budweiser China plans to launch a public welfare program called ""Cheers Campaign"" in China at the end of March. The program aims to support small and medium-sized merchants to boost consumption and the development of the night-time economy with AB InBev's ""BEES"". It is a B2B digital platform which helps wholesalers cut costs and improve efficiency with its technology and professional supports.ESG and Empowering Industrial ChainsThe report to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China highlighted that high-quality development is the first and foremost task for building a modern socialist country. As a sunrise industry with a market size of 400B RMB  the beer industry is speeding towards such development. Budweiser APAC's goal is to become the ""Most Loved High-Quality Growth Leader in Beverage"" and has placed ESG at the heart of its strategy and operations.AB InBev emphasizes that ESG is at the core of its business. Mr. Doukeris reiterated that ""Beer is natural  inclusive and local"". According to him  the beer business can only be sustainable with healthy  prosperous communities and healthy  natural ingredients. Hence  AB InBev's ESG strategy focuses on eight priorities including water stewardship  smart agriculture  circular package and climate action.Budweiser APAC develops ESG breakthroughs through innovation and cooperation with market players and stakeholders of the upstream and downstream value chain. Its Nanning brewery sets a new industry benchmark with water efficiency of 1.11hl/hl; its breweries in Wuhan and Jinzhou are the first carbon-neutral breweries; and its Taizhou brewery is 'Zero Waste'. Last June  MSCI ranked Budweiser China as an ESG leader with AA rating. Currently  AB InBev is incubating innovative ESG solutions through the 100+ Accelerator  Budweiser 100+ Innovation Hub  and the Supplier Strategic Alliance.Hand in hand with the business partners  AB InBev leverages its resources and technology to empower the industrial chain and achieve shared prosperity in the communities where it operates.

Good afternoon  everyone. Thank you for attending EDPR 2022 results conference call. We have here with us our CEO  Miguel Stilwell de Andrade; and our CFO  Rui Teixeira. We'll run you through the key highlights of our 2022 execution and the financial results. We'll then move to Q&A in which we'll be taking your questions  both by phone or written questions that you can insert from now onwards in our conference web page.This call should last less than 60 minutes. And given that this time  this is a special points  given that we will have our Capital Markets Day on the next Thursday  we'll ask you to focus your questions on our 2022 performance and more short-term issues related with 2022 or 2023  beginning of the year.I will give you now the floor to our CEO  Miguel Stilwell de Andrade.Miguel AndradeThank you  Miguel  and good afternoon  everyone. So it's a pleasure to share with you strong set of results for 2022. I mean  we are living a unique moment of strong acceleration of the energy transition and the renewables growth prospects  so positive for EDP Renewables. And this is supported very much by a couple of different things  the ongoing implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. following the approval by the Congress last August  and also the more recent developments of the EU Green Deal Industrial Plan.So a set of very positive developments. And then also we're seeing quite a lot of movement on the permitting legislation at the level of several countries in which we are present in  and which is supporting also the acceleration of the renewable development over the next couple of years.And we can go to the results. And if we move to Slide 4  you can see that our revenues reached around €2.4 billion. We're talking about 100% -- 99.5% aligned with the EU taxonomy  and it shows a 35% increase year-on-year on the back of solid operational performance  with installed capacity 9% higher year-on-year and generation increasing also 10% year-on-year. We also saw a significant improvement in our average selling price to €65 per megawatt hour  which means a 21% rise year-on-year  supported by repricing mostly in the European markets.EBITDA increased to €2.2 billion  so plus 23% year-on-year. It includes already the negative impact of the regulatory clawbacks in Europe for a total of almost €100 million in our P&L in 2022  mostly from 3 countries  so Romania  Italy and Poland. It includes €424 million of asset rotation gains  5 transactions -- successful transactions in different markets and -- of wind and solar technologies.So our EBITDA  excluding the Asset Rotation gains showed a strong 40% increase year-on-year. And so  this reflects  I think  the good underlying operational performance of the company. Recurring net profit increased 2% to €671 million or 57% year-on-year  excluding the contribution for -- from the ongoing Asset Rotation activity  and that you know well.2022 was also a year of investment in future growth. So we had gross investments reaching €5.1 billion  almost doubling versus 2021  including the entry into the APAC market with the acquisition of Sunseap and also the entry into Germany and the Netherlands with the acquisition of Kronos. Net debt/EBITDA  2.3x  so including the investment ramp up with renewables projects under construction  reaching 4 gigawatts in December.And then regarding our 2022 dividend  and as you will have seen also from the results of the communication [readressable] market  the Board of Directors is proposing a change in the dividend policy introducing the EDPR scrip dividend program. We're upgrading the target payout to 30% to 50%  but with this additional flexibility in the way that it's received  as you know  EDP has also announced that it intends to take shares and not sell those bonus shares. So we'll talk a little bit about that in a couple of slides.We move on to the next slide  and let's just talk quickly about the Asset Rotation. So again  in 2022  EDPR surpassed its business plan targets in terms of Rsset rotation. It continues to bring excellent returns to our portfolio  and I think it shows clearly the value creation that we are capable of. We also continue to see strong demand for renewable assets throughout 2022. In terms of capacity  we sold around 1 gigawatt in 2022  so below the 1.4 gigawatt year average that we had in the business plan  but we got above the proceeds assumed in the business plan.And above all  I mean  this capacity involves [frac] transactions  as I mentioned  good diversification of markets and technologies  overall multiple of around €1.8 million per megawatt. And then  in terms of capital gains  we reached an average gain of around €400 million -- or €400 000 per megawatt. So a total gains of around €0.9 billion when you sum up '21 and '22. So clearly above  let's say  the average of $300 million that we had in the business plan.Finally  just talking about the returns. If you look at it as  let's say  Asset Rotation gains over invested capital  which perhaps is also a good way of looking at this. I mean  we also surpassed the business plan expectations  meaning we continue to have attractive returns as expected. And this in the year of 2022 with all the volatility and the increase in interest rates  et cetera  that you know. And I think a big part of this is because it was different markets -- different technology side. I think it shows our ability to really do good capital allocation and take advantage of different market dynamics.If we move to Slide 6  and let's talk about something that we communicated to the market also at the beginning of the year. We've mentioned a potential risk of around €0.3 billion. The fact is that there's significantly lower clawback costs expected now for 2023 because prices have come down  and there have also been some positive developments on the regulatory amendments in -- particularly in Poland and Romania. Taking a step back  we know 2022 has been a tough year in terms of regulations in Europe. I mean  a lot of moving pieces. Obviously  many member states implementing measures to try and protect the final consumers from the impact of the price volatility and the price increases.Clawbacks were implemented in a number of different countries in Europe and impacted us around €100 million in the year. But I think  for me  the point is not so much the clawbacks when they're well implemented. We can discuss by principle whether we think we agree with them or not. But at least they should take into account hedging and they should take into account sort of forward sales that have already been done. Most countries did that correctly. In the case of Poland  Romania  that wasn't done correctly. So we flagged the potential €0.3 billion of impact  as I mentioned  that has now come down a lot to -- it's around €0.1 billion at the moment for both Poland and Romania.Again  decline in the energy prices closer to the regulatory price caps so that we don't get the sort of double impact  and also some amendments on the discussion in Poland and Romania to either fix or at least reduce the impact from the clawback taxation on the unrealized profits. So hopefully  this will also reduce some of the risk that we had for the year.Move on to Slide 7. And here  talking about offshore wind execution  again  is a topic which comes up often. I think 2022 was a good year. You can see that we have already 1.5 gigawatts in operation  had excellent operational outperformance over the year  particularly the gigawatts Moray East. We have 1 gigawatt under construction related to Moray West and also 1 gigawatt relatively close to FID for the French project. I think  one of the good things about our offshore portfolio is it's got good economics  most of it inflation-linked revenues with a clear visibility on the CapEx and on the supply chain  and that  obviously  as you know  is important in volatile times.During 2022  we were awarded 8 gigawatts of seabed leases  and so clearly  I think this is one of the areas where we did very well versus the previous business plan. Regarding secured revenues  more than 80% is in Europe with revenues linked to inflation and less than 20% in the U.S. regarding our project on the South Coast  Mayflower. Overall  I mean  we're talking about a total development or Devex to date of less than €200 000 per megawatt. So we still have relatively little capital employed in these projects.The project is expected to become operational only in 2028 and 50% of its capacity is still to be contracted. So we will be able to contract the remaining capacity of Mayflower on terms and conditions which reflect the latest market conditions. All in all  Ocean Winds reached a portfolio of 16.6 gigawatts in 2022  almost tripling the 6.6 gigawatts it had at the beginning of 2021  so in the space of 2 years.Move on to Slide 8. So talking a little bit about the dividend policy. As I mentioned  we upgraded the target payout to 30% to 50%. This is much more in line with what peers -- similar peers of renewable players have in the sector. But at the same time  we wanted to introduce flexibility. We believe it's â€“ EDPR is very much a growth company  and it's important to go on capitalizing the company. And so  we replaced the ordinary dividend -- ordinary cash dividend with a remuneration programme  which basically gives optionality to the shareholders  so the scrip dividend.This works through a capital increase through a bonus issue and then -- and for the year of 2022  we're essentially assuming €275 million of distribution  representing around 40% of EDPR's 2022 results  so in the middle of the payout ratio or the payout range that I just mentioned.So just technically how it will work. EDPR shareholders will be allocated in corporation rights  and they can opt between receiving bonus shares  selling the incorporation rights to EDPR at a fixed price or selling the incorporation rights in the Euronext market at trading prices. So with this program  EDP renewals increases its dividend payout 30% to 50%  but the shareholders also get a flexible way of getting that  let's say  which is -- I think optionality in this case is positive.As I mentioned  EDP will be opting for shares  and it's basically prioritizing reinvesting back into the company rather than taking cash out of EDPR. So we believe this will be accretive growth  and so we'll be taking the shares.Let's move on to Slide 9. Just to say that -- so as you know  EDPR is the largest European listed 100% renewable player. ESG is at the core of our strategy in the operations. And I think the year-on-year evolution reflects this growth and the implementation of best standards.We can start just by giving a couple of highlights. So in terms of environmental performance  99.5%  and I think we've got a commitment to get this to 100% because we struggled to find a 0.5% that wasn't eligible of turnover and CapEx fully aligned with the EU taxonomy. And as I say  our core business is 100% focused on renewables. We avoided the emission of 20 million tons of CO2  so benefiting from the increase in energy production and actively contributing to the global challenge of net zero.On the social dimension  number of employees has now reached over 3 000 employees. So it's increased around 40% year-on-year. In terms of diversity  percentage of female employees is currently at 33%  so also increasing versus last year. In terms of employee well-being the engagement on our employee climate survey is at 86%  an increase versus last year of 7 percentage points  so also a very positive score  which I think shows how people see themselves in the purpose and in the mission of EDP Renewables.And also  we'd like to say that we've been included in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook  which distinguishes companies within their industries that have demonstrated real strength in corporate sustainability. We've also been recognized by Sustainalytics as an ESG top-rated company within our industry  given our low risk score. So all in all  I think on the ESG front  EDP Renewables continue to do very  very well.We move on to Slide 10. So -- and just before I pass over to Rui -- we have scaled up delivery. We have continued to expand. We've had excellent Asset Rotation execution. We have a very strong top line  taking advantage of the current market conditions.Focusing on growth. We have 11.4 gigawatts of secured capacity  including the 4 gigawatts under construction  so supporting the additions for 2023 and beyond. We've more than doubled our offshore portfolio  the 6.6 gigawatts we had in the beginning of 2021 to the 16.6 gigawatts that I mentioned for Ocean Winds. We've established the Asia Pacific platform on the back of the Sunseap acquisition  and that gives us  I think  also a good  strong growth prospect.We've scaled up our European position. So entering Germany  which  as you know  is absolutely key core European markets and that we expect will explode over the next couple of years. And I think that will give us great optionality on that side. On value  as I mentioned we've outperformed the Asset Rotation and had an excellent €0.5 billion per year of EBITDA gains versus the €300 million that we had in the business plan  so clear value creation in the projects that we're developing. And on excellence  we've been continuing to manage the full value chain  delivering competitive and quality projects at high excellent standards.So overall  great value creation for all stakeholders  given that we also surpassed both the EBITDA and net profit 2023 target 1 year ahead despite all the market turbulence.So I'll just pause there and pass it over to Rui to walk you through the 2022 results  and then I'll come back for closing remarks. Thank you.Rui TeixeiraThank you  Miguel  and good afternoon to you all. So now let's move to the 2022 results.So starting at Slide 12. During 2022  we installed 2.1 gigawatts. We sold 0.9 gigawatts through the Asset Rotation program. Thus  our portfolio grew to 14.7 gigawatts with a very balanced mix across North America with 49%  Europe with 38%  Brazil 8% and APAC 5%. By the end of the year  capacity under construction reached a record volume of 4 gigawatts of both solar and wind. And therefore  this is contributing further to the portfolio diversification.The renewable resource was slightly higher year-on-year at 30%. That's a 1 percentage point growth versus last year  reflecting an improved renewables index just 2% below the expected long-term average. So all in all  our electricity output increased 10%  benefiting from capacity additions and the higher renewable resource. And as a result  EDPR generated 34.4 terawatt hours of clean energy  avoiding 20 million tons of CO2 emission.So how this translates into operational results. On Slide 13  you can see that EDPR ended 2022 with an EBITDA growth of 40% year-on-year. This excludes Asset Rotation gains to €2.2 billion backed by outstanding top line performance. It's 10% higher electricity production and 21% higher average selling prices. Strong capital gains as well from Asset Rotation with a total of €424 million  impacting our 2022 EBITDA. This performance was partly offset by €98 million of regulatory clawbacks in Europe.If we exclude asset rotation capital gains  the operational portfolio EBITDA increased by 51% in Europe  14% in North America and 3.2x in South America  APAC and others. The Asset Rotation gains for the year amounted to €424 million  as I said before  that's less €99 million versus 2021  but substantially above the average guidance in our business plan '21-'25 with 5 Asset Rotation deals closed with very robust multiples.So finally  EBITDA was also impacted by regulatory OpEx in the year. As I've mentioned  all in all  €98 million. €63 million are impacting here  and then the remaining impact is €35 million at the corporate tax level.If we move now to the financial results on Slide 14  we see that EDPR closed 2022 with €449 million versus €249 million in 2021. This increase is mainly driven by higher cost of debt that increases 0.6 million year-on-year. This is mostly from the Brazilian rates given that our project finance in Brazil is floating to match the inflation-linked revenues and from the consolidation of APAC higher cost of debt and also a higher average gross debt to support the growth strategy with both the CapEx execution and the acquisition of Sunseap and Kronos.Approximately 1/3 of the increase in financial results resulted from Forex and Forex derivatives in 2022  penalized by the Euro-U.S. dollar evolution during the year. I want to highlight that these costs are not yet reflecting the 5-year pre-hedges that we executed back in December of €1 billion at 1.8% and $1 billion at 2.6% that will be used for the 2023-'24 refinancing needs.So net debt on Slide 15 is  of course  supporting EDPR growth in line with the strong target additions. As of December 2022  our net debt was €4.2 billion. That's an increase of €2 billion versus December '21. And of course  this reflects  on one hand  the €0.8 billion strong recurring organic cash flow  €0.8 billion and €2.4 billion in net expansion investment. And this includes also on the one hand  the CapEx  the acquisition of Sunseap in APAC  Kronos in Central Europe and equity investments at the Ocean Winds as well as some Forex impact.On the other hand  the Asset Rotation strategy  which net of gains means $2 billion of proceeds during the year of 2022. Despite this increase in net debt versus last year  balance sheet remains very strong with a solid net debt/EBITDA ratio of 2.3x in 2022.On the net profit. Net profit growth was supported by the top line performance  partly offset by the higher financial costs  as already explained. Taxes impacted by the €35 million Italian tax clawback mechanism  along also with some jurisdiction-specific taxation on capital gains. Also minorities performance linked to positive evolution in portfolio held by noncontrolling interests. Our reported net profit includes a €54 million noncash impairment or it's a provision accounted at the depreciation and amortization levels related to the impact of a project-specific construction delays in Colombia.So really  despite another challenging year for the sector  we have been able to operate efficiently our portfolio and our recurring net profit totaled €671 million. It's growing 57% year-on-year if we exclude capital gains or 2% year-on-year if we include capital gains.And with this  I would hand over to Miguel for the closing remarks. Thank you.Miguel AndradeOkay. Thank you . So listen  just to finalize the presentation  just a couple of key takeaways. First  we have strong top line performance in 2022. This was driven by increased generation and average realized price that led then to an increase in EBITDA of -- to reach the €2.2 billion  so 40% year-on-year  excluding gains  23% year-on-year with the gains  and recurring net profit  2% up  but excluding Asset Rotation gains 57% up year-on-year. So clearly  we didn't need Asset Rotation gains to reach the net profit of the previous year.Second point  I think we continue to see very good asset rotation execution in 2022. So 5 transactions  5 different markets  €2 billion of proceeds  more than €400 million of capital gains  doubling the target gain per megawatt to reach the €400 000 per megawatt. So clearly  I think very impressive Asset Rotation execution.Third point. In 2022  a lot of European measures came out  European regulatory clawbacks. We accounted for around $100 million of that in the 2022 accounts.For 2023  we flagged that we were -- we had already flagged that in the third quarter results  and we flagged that again at the beginning of the year where with Poland and Romania fortunately  that things have seemed to come down so the €0.3 billion has now come down to €0.1 billion  so materially less  and depending on the forward prices could be lower impact. So we're comfortable with the €0.1 billion at the moment.The fourth point  EDPR's dividend policy. We've aligned it with peers. So it's more attractive. But at the same time  we've ensured that we can continue to capitalize the company. So the program  the scrip dividend structure through a capital increase is a bonus issue  as I mentioned. And as I mentioned  but I'll just reiterate  so there's no misunderstanding  EDP will be opting for shares  so we will not be taking cash out of EDPR. Overall  renewables global outlook continues to improve. I mean  we continue to see that. And we currently have around 4 gigawatts under construction.And finally  I'd just say  listen  we had targets in our previous business plan for 2023 for EBITDA and net profit. We have reached those targets in 2022. So I think it's a good segue to say that we'll talk more about targets at the Capital Markets Day on Thursday.And with that  I'd probably stop there and turn it over to Q&A. Thank you.Miguel VianaOkay. We can go now to Q&A  starting with the questions on the line.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alberto Gandolfi from Goldman Sachs.Alberto GandolfiI'm going to try to stick to '22. But I'd like to start from the scrip dividend announcement from last night. I have my own theory and I can see where this is coming from. I was just wondering if you can comment -- I know I need to wait for Thursday for full disclosure  but is this part of a wider plan to preserve capital and fund incremental growth? So this is an extremely qualitative question just to understand the philosophy  the logic around higher payout ratio and scrip. Is this trying to tell us there's less growth and so more payouts  I suspect not  or is it part of let's strengthen balance sheet  preparing for what's coming?The second question is related to the first one. I guess that considering more disclosure on the U.S. IRA and considering we have seen some papers from the European Commission and very strong statements by the EU  can you share some initial comments? I suspect you  again  tell us quite a lot on Thursday  but the U.S. IRA  do we know enough today to start working towards higher growth? Again  extremely qualitative not asking targets.And last question here  Miguel  you talked about surpassing 2022 targets. Is there anything in '22 that could not be sustainable going forward? So why wouldn't you surpass targets going forward? So I'm trying to understand what worries you a little bit  maybe the Asset Rotation gains  maybe prices  you only added 1 gigawatt 0.1% last year. So maybe that's an offset. So can you maybe elaborate on how much of this '22 you can bring with you for the future years?Miguel AndradeSo listen  I’ll try to answer this without re-empting  I guess  Thursday. The scrip dividend. So as I mentioned  it gives us flexibility. We’re increasing the payout  but you get the option to take shares. So I’m sure you can also run some math on what could be  let’s say  an estimate of what minorities take up in terms of cash versus shares. But we believe we’ll probably end up having less cash coming out of EDPR as a result than with the current dividend policy. So even though we increased the payout  actually  probably  we have less cash coming out.So what I can say is we definitely see a lot of growth. We see a lot of growth coming. We already see it now and we believe it will only continue to increase. And so I’m not going to talk to a wider plan. I’ll just say that  obviously  measures  which allow us to continue capitalizing the company like the scrip dividend are obviously positive  and we believe in making sure we have the balance sheet to continue to grow that. And the truth is we have a solid balance sheet. We’ve had strong performance. I think that positions us well to take advantage of that growth going forward.In terms of the second point  again  from a very qualitative because I will talk more about it  obviously  on Thursday  and we are very excited about both the U.S. IRA and also about the European Green Plan. Do we know enough? I mean  we certainly know enough to know that this will have an impact on growth. And we can get into more details as I say on Thursday. But does that long-term visibility that additional incentives sort of the additional tailwind that it provides  I think  to investments on the renewables  all of these different issues that we've been talking about  I think  in the past lead us to believe that  yes  we know enough to believe that there will be more growth.I mean it’s a broad qualitative statement  but I think it’s – for us  it’s unquestionable that  that is resulting. Obviously  the IRA  there’s still details that are coming out in terms of actually how it will be applied  et cetera  but it doesn’t materially change sort of the underlying strength of those plans.On the third point  so the 2022 targets. Listen  I think we’re being flexible in how we manage. But I think the point is we had a fantastic underlying year in terms of selling prices in terms of volumes in terms of – I mean  just generally  I think it was quite a positive year. You can see that when on the pre-asset rotation gains. So we had a good Asset Rotation year  but we didn’t need to do more. So I think we can also flex this. So I would – I think there’s a big part of that we can take forward.Obviously  the prices will evolve as they evolve and you can run the numbers on that. But we have also 4 gigawatts under construction at the moment. So we’ll have a lot more megawatts generating over the next couple of months  years. So yes  I mean  I think it is sustainable. It’s going to be a bumpy ride  but it’s going to be a positive trajectory is what I’ll say.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Javier Garrido from JPMorgan.Javier GarridoThree quick questions  if I may. The first one is you can tell us what is the amount of volumes that you have hedge in Spain for 2023 and at what price? The second question is on Sunseap. Is the EBITDA margin that we saw in 2022 sustainable? I guess if not so you can give us an indication of where you see the sustainable EBITDA margin in those operations.And the third question is on Mayflower. You have mentioned in the presentation that half of it is yet to be contracted. But that means also half of it is contracted now. We have seen [indiscernible] in one of the U.S. offshore assets  Iberdrola abandoning PPAs? What is your stance on the existing PPAs of Mayflower?Miguel AndradeSo Rui  do you want to take the first one  and then I'll take the second and third.Rui TeixeiraOkay. So on the -- for the Spanish hedges EDPR  we're talking about prices above 90%. Pretty much -- I would say that we have it -- I would say  around 90% hedged -- 80% to 90% hedge  Miguel  if you want to take on?Miguel AndradeYes. So listen  on the Sunseap EBITDA margin  I mean  I think there is – generally  we’re quite positive that the margins will continue to be there. As we go on getting more critical mass in Asia  we’ll definitely be able to  I think  even improve on these. There are obviously initial start-up costs  as is normal when you’re setting up a new platform. But given there is considered – or we’re considering a substantial amount of growth over the next couple of years  that margin will continue to increase.On Mayflower  I mean  yes  obviously  you can see the glass half full  half empty  I think  versus peers. I think it’s half full in the sense that 50% still to be contracted. I mean we have no doubt that the overall blended will be positive. And so we don’t see any reason to do any [impairments] on this.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of [Enrico Bartoli] from Mediobanca.Unidentified AnalystFirst question is related to  if you can elaborate a bit on pricing expectations for 2023. You mentioned you're hedging in Spain. If you can give some flavor on what you expect in the other European markets and in the U.S. compared to 2022?Second question also this very qualitative  if you can give some into what is your perception of the appetite for Asset Rotation assets in this moment  considering the evolution of interest rates? If you can give some details of what you can expect for 2023?And the last one is related to the cost of debt. You mentioned on that the financial results we saw in 2022 don't include the pre-hedging. So can you also  in this case  provide some comments on the evolution of interest charges that you expect for '23?Miguel AndradeSo I'll do the first two and then Rui can answer the third. But on pricing expectations  I mean  clearly  we continue to see the prices coming up over the year of 2022 and even the beginning of '23. And they are good statistics. I mean  we expect to show you that also on Thursday to be honest. But what I'd say is that we're seeing PPA prices  for example  in the U.S.  I mean  even recently  just looking at some sort of in the high €60  €70 in Europe in many countries also in that type of range in euros.So obviously  it depends then on the tenure  whether it's 5  10  15 years  but let's say  for a 10  15-year tenure  you can clearly be in the sort of €60  €70. But as I said  that does depend a little bit by market  but we can get a bit more into that.On the perception of Asset Rotation  as I mentioned  the fact that we did 5 portfolios in 5 different markets means we can flex quite a bit depending on the market dynamics. I can give you a very easy example  which is Brazil. I mean  Brazil has been at a high cost of capital last year. It's still the same this year  it's not going up  anything it might even come down. And so we continue to believe we can get good asset rotation gains on that.We see the demand is there  which is the important part. And then obviously  there's an issue around pricing  but energy prices are also higher. So you saw the Italian transaction last year. I mean  that was a record multiple and that was done in August. So we already had very high or rising interest rates. And yet you had super high energy prices that more than compensated for that. So as long as demand is there  these continue to be high-quality assets  and it will continue to be part of our strategy.On the cost of debt  Rui?Rui TeixeiraSure. Yes. I mean  of course  we will be providing a bit more information Thursday in terms of how we see the cost of funding evolving over the period of the business plan. And maybe just a couple of beta points. One is  again  to highlight that as yields are going up and then  of course  the base will go up. But back in summer 2022  we had we pre-hedged our interest rate -- the base interest rates with the €1 billion and $1 billion. That pre-hedging means that we have already locked in the cost of funding in both currencies as we look into refinancing the 2022 -- sorry  the 2023 and 2024 financing mix that we'll have.Again  in wuros was at 1.8% the base rate and in dollars was 2.6%. And again  I stress this because it means that whatever the yield you can see on the screen that will apply  of course  for some part of the refinancing needs  but not to be $1 billion and €1 billion. All in all  what I would say is that we should -- in any case  I would expect to see sort of pretty much the same levels of cost of debt overall as we are seeing for 2022  around the 4%. But in any case  we will be providing more information on the -- during the Thursday's presentation.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jenny Ping from Citi.Jenny PingA couple of questions from me  please. Firstly  just going back to the scrip. I just want to understand a bit more your thinking around that. If the aim is to reduce the cash outflow  why change the dividend policy? Why not just offer a scrip on the current dividend policy as we stand? And then sort of link to that. Clearly  there will be a dilutive impact from the scrip  which is kind of seen as a series of mini equity raises. Is there a way that you would look to cap the level of dilution at some stage? Is there a maximum sort of impact which you would look to then offset beyond at that point?Miguel AndradeListen  I think what we wanted to do is make sure that we are aligned with peers in terms of the payout policy because I think that's important in terms of the competitiveness and the attractiveness of EDPR  but at the same time  giving that flexibility. So as you rightly say  this is a way of capitalizing the company. We are not â€“ we don't have any intention or we haven't defined any cap on the level of dilution.So as I mentioned  this decision is taken on a yearly basis by EDP  but we will be taking shares for the foreseeable future because we think it's an appropriate way to continue to â€“ or part of the way to continue to fund the business going forward.Miguel VianaOkay. We go now to some questions on the web  and starting with a question from Arthur Sitbon from Morgan Stanley.Could you please provide more details around potential or actual improvements in the Romanian and Polish windfall tax schemes and the impact that we referred? So that went down from €0.3 billion to €0.1 billion?Rui TeixeiraSo yes  I mean  just to be clear  there have been some amendments already passed in both countries  in Poland and Romania. In Poland  there was a big improvement as the hedges are now considered. However  still  it's been clear if only the hedges within the Polish jurisdiction would be considered or not something that we will have to clarify. But there was definitely a very positive step forward as the hedges now are considered for the clawback calculation.In Romania  there was an improvement with the elimination of the cap of the 5% in the deviation of generation volumes  so the balancing costs versus the forecast. However  here in Romania  we still need some further improvements because the hedges are not yet considered for the calculation of the clawbacks withholding tax is still applied.But I would also stress the following. So as we saw this -- the overall amount reducing from the €0.3 billion to approximately €0.1 billion  We are also in parallel trying to crystallize that position and working around to crystallize like that. So that regardless of the regulatory involvements  then we get no further exposure to this sort of price swings and to price increases in the future. But if and when we do that  of course  we would communicate it to the market.Miguel VianaWe have another question also coming from Skye Landon from Jefferies.Could you give some detail on the NPV over CapEx for the Brazil project. And also the U.S. solar project now closed in December. This seems to be the expectations  and additional info would be useful.Miguel AndradeSo what I can say is that  for Brazil  it's basically what -- I think we also mentioned in the third quarter results to around 60%. We did have Forex covered with hedges  so we weren't impacted by changes in Forex. For the U.S. solar transaction  it's not quite as comparable because it's a build and transfer. The economics are different  but they're still double digits in terms of NPV over CapEx.Miguel VianaI think this is what we have from the web. So I'll pass now to our CEO for final remarks.Miguel AndradeI mean  I won’t talk very much because  as I say  we have the Capital Markets Day on Thursday. I’ll just reiterate  I think we had a strong set of ‘22 results. We think we had a good performance  certainly both on the underlying business and also on the asset rotations. We are seeing strong growth coming through in the various different geographies  and we are taking advantage of that and give you a lot – well  and I think important to note as I mentioned that we hit the ‘23 targets in 2022. And I think  as I mentioned  that’s a good segue for when we come back on Thursday to talk to you. So thank you very much and I guess  talk to you soon.

It is unclear yet what it will mean for the group’s secondary Irish listing.“When we get the feedback from our shareholders in that regard  particularly with regard to indeed the UK and indeed [the] Ireland Euronext [listing]  at that stage we will be able to update you  at the end of April ” said group finance director Jim Mintern. “But for the next six weeks we need to engage with our shareholders.”After announcing record 2022 sales  profits  margins and cash reserves today  chief executive Albert Manifold told reporters the “size and strength” of CRH’s American business – which makes up 75pc of its earnings  up from 50pc a decade ago – was behind the move.A trio of multi-trillion dollar subsidy plans by the US administration – the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  Inflation Reduction Act and Chips Act  some of which the EU is trying to emulate – are part and parcel of CRH’s transatlantic shift.“We would have higher levels of growth if we were to list our business in America ” Mr Manifold said.“It’s clear that there will be significantly stronger support for construction in North America than there is in Europe. That’s because of the level and extent of federal funding. That alone is going to super-charge construction growth in infrastructure over the next decade.”Europe is still “absolutely critical” for CRH  particularly central and eastern Europe  which is the “jewel in the crown” of the business  despite the ongoing war in Ukraine.CRH has been active in Ukraine since 1999 and employs more than 800 people in the country. It reopened its two facilities there  in the western half of the country  last autumn.“We remain committed to Ukraine. We have a fine business there. Our people are all safe. Our facilities remain undamaged. I think that it should be an area for CRH in the years to come.”But costs in Europe have spiralled higher than those in its American business  with price hikes last year offsetting lower activity. Earnings in Europe were down 4pc on 2021  despite sales jumping 11pc.Further price increases are likely this year as CRH attempts to “fully” recover cost hikes. “We still have a ways to do  in particular parts of the world  particularly here in Europe  because there were some very  very significant cost increases last year which we have not fully recovered yet.”Overall  he said  its full-year results show the firm is in “fairly rude  robust shape”.Earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortisation (Ebitda) were $5.6bn (€5.3bn)  up 13pc on 2021. Its Ebitda margin was up 10 basis points to 17.2pc  despite cost increases.Group sales rose 12pc across the year to $32.7bn.Profit after tax rose 10pc to $2.7bn  with CRH announcing a full-year dividend of $1.27  up 5pc from 2021  and a new $3bn share buyback.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.23,0.18,0.58,True,English,"['US listing switch', 'stock market', 'CRH', 'Dublin', 'part', 'multi-trillion dollar subsidy plans', 'chief executive Albert Manifold', 'new $3bn share buyback', 'Building materials giant CRH', 'Irish stock exchange', 'President Joe Biden', 'The Irish company', 'rude, robust shape', 'next six weeks', 'secondary Irish listing', 'Inflation Reduction Act', 'Further price increases', 'booming US demand', 'sweeping infrastructure subsidies', 'UK stock market', 'group finance director', 'significant cost increases', 'New York', 'Mr Manifold', 'next decade', 'price hikes', 'main listing', 'primary listing', 'Jobs Act', 'Chips Act', 'cost hikes', 'post-Brexit Britain', 'largest companies', 'Jim Mintern', 'cash reserves', 'US administration', 'Infrastructure Investment', 'transatlantic shift', 'higher levels', 'stronger support', 'federal funding', 'ongoing war', 'western half', 'lower activity', 'full-year results', 'full-year dividend', 'business sense', 'record 2022 sales', 'American business', 'fine business', 'Group sales', 'Ireland Euronext', 'North America', 'two facilities', 'Ebitda margin', 'eastern Europe', 'construction growth', 'London', 'Dublin', 'shareholders', 'move', 'blow', 'FTSE100', 'feedback', 'regard', 'stage', 'April', 'profits', 'margins', 'reporters', 'size', 'strength', '75pc', 'earnings', 'trio', 'part', 'parcel', 'extent', 'central', 'jewel', 'crown', 'Ukraine', '800 people', 'country', 'area', 'years', 'costs', 'ways', 'world', 'firm', 'interest', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', '2pc']",2023-03-02,2023-03-02,independent.ie
