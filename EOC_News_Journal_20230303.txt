The maximum number above concerns the share issue and the issue of option rights and other special rights entitling to shares. The authorisation can also be used for incentive arrangements for the management and key personnel; however  no more than 900 000 shares in total may be granted for this purpose.The share issue may either be made against payment or without payment. The authorisation entitles the Board of Directors to issue the shares or option rights and other special rights otherwise than in proportion to the shareholdings of the shareholders (directed share issue) if the Company has a weighty financial reason to do so. The directed share issue may be without payment only if the Company has an especially weighty financial reason to do so and the interests of all the Company’s shareholders are taken into consideration. The Board would be authorised to resolve on all terms and conditions of share issues and option rights and the issue of other special rights entitling to shares. The authorisation covers both the issuance of new shares and the transfer of the Company’s own shares.The Board of Directors proposes that the authorisation be valid until 29 September 2024. This authorisation will cancel the authorisation to resolve on the issuance of shares and special rights granted to the Board of Directors by the Annual General Meeting of 23 March 2022.Authorising the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of the Company’s own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the Board of Directors be authorised to resolve  in one or several instalments  on the repurchase of a maximum of 2 000 000 of the Company’s own shares. The proposed maximum number of shares corresponds to approximately 5.13 per cent of the Company’s total number of shares as at the date of this notice convening the Annual General Meeting.The shares would be repurchased using the Company’s unrestricted equity  and thus  the repurchases will reduce funds available for distribution. The shares can be repurchased for developing the Company’s capital structure  for financing or carrying out corporate acquisitions or other business arrangements  to be used as a part of the Company’s remuneration or incentive plan or to be otherwise transferred further or cancelled  for example.In accordance with the resolution of the Board of Directors  the shares can also be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the existing shareholdings of the shareholders as directed repurchases at the market price of the shares quoted on the trading venues where the Company’s shares are subject to public trading or at the price otherwise established on the market at the time of the repurchase. The Board of Directors is authorised to resolve on all other matters related to the repurchase of the Company’s own shares  including how the shares will be repurchased. Among other means  derivatives may be used in acquiring the shares.The Board of Directors proposes that the authorisation be valid until 29 September 2024. The authorisation will cancel the authorisation to resolve on the repurchase of the Company’s own shares granted to the Board of Directors by the Annual General Meeting of 23 March 2022.Amendment of the Articles of AssociationThe Board of Directors proposes that Article 9 of the Company’s Articles of Association concerning the notice and place of general meeting be amended to allow for the shareholders’ meeting to be held completely without a meeting venue as a remote meeting and that the provision on publishing the notice of general meeting in a national newspaper be removed.

Authorising the Board of Directors to resolve on the issuance of shares as well as the issuance of options and other special rights entitling to shares The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the Board be authorised to resolve on one or several share issues and the issue of option rights and other special rights entitling to shares as defined in Chapter 10  Section 1 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act as follows: The total maximum number of shares to be issued under the authorisation shall be 3 900 000 shares corresponding to 10.00 per cent of all current shares in the Company as at the date of this notice. The maximum number above concerns the share issue and the issue of option rights and other special rights entitling to shares. The authorisation can also be used for incentive arrangements for the management and key personnel; however  no more than 900 000 shares in total may be granted for this purpose. The share issue may either be made against payment or without payment. The authorisation entitles the Board of Directors to issue the shares or option rights and other special rights otherwise than in proportion to the shareholdings of the shareholders (directed share issue) if the Company has a weighty financial reason to do so. The directed share issue may be without payment only if the Company has an especially weighty financial reason to do so and the interests of all the Company’s shareholders are taken into consideration. The Board would be authorised to resolve on all terms and conditions of share issues and option rights and the issue of other special rights entitling to shares. The authorisation covers both the issuance of new shares and the transfer of the Company’s own shares. The Board of Directors proposes that the authorisation be valid until 29 September 2024. This authorisation will cancel the authorisation to resolve on the issuance of shares and special rights granted to the Board of Directors by the Annual General Meeting of 23 March 2022.

The proposed maximum number of shares corresponds to approximately 5.13 per cent of the Company’s total number of shares as at the date of this notice convening the Annual General Meeting. The shares would be repurchased using the Company’s unrestricted equity  and thus  the repurchases will reduce funds available for distribution. The shares can be repurchased for developing the Company’s capital structure  for financing or carrying out corporate acquisitions or other business arrangements  to be used as a part of the Company’s remuneration or incentive plan or to be otherwise transferred further or cancelled  for example. In accordance with the resolution of the Board of Directors  the shares can also be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the existing shareholdings of the shareholders as directed repurchases at the market price of the shares quoted on the trading venues where the Company’s shares are subject to public trading or at the price otherwise established on the market at the time of the repurchase. The Board of Directors is authorised to resolve on all other matters related to the repurchase of the Company’s own shares  including how the shares will be repurchased. Among other means  derivatives may be used in acquiring the shares. The Board of Directors proposes that the authorisation be valid until 29 September 2024. The authorisation will cancel the authorisation to resolve on the repurchase of the Company’s own shares granted to the Board of Directors by the Annual General Meeting of 23 March 2022. Amendment of the Articles of Association The Board of Directors proposes that Article 9 of the Company’s Articles of Association concerning the notice and place of general meeting be amended to allow for the shareholders’ meeting to be held completely without a meeting venue as a remote meeting and that the provision on publishing the notice of general meeting in a national newspaper be removed.

These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration separately decided or approved by the general meeting.The guidelines' promotion of the Volvo Group's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityIt is a prerequisite for the successful implementation of the Volvo Group's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  that the Group can recruit  retain and develop senior management. These guidelines enable AB Volvo to offer Executives a competitive total remuneration. More information regarding the Volvo Group's business strategy is available in the Volvo Group Annual Report.Types of remunerationVolvo Group remuneration to Executives shall consist of the following components: base salary  short-term and long-term variable incentives  pension benefits and other benefits.Short-term incentives may  for the President and CEO  amount to a maximum of 100 % of the base salary and  for other Executives  a maximum of 80 % of the base salary.Long-term incentives may  for the President and CEO  amount to a maximum of 150 % of the base salary and  for other Executives  a maximum of 80 % of the base salary. Current and proposed long-term incentives are described and addressed separately by the 2023 general meeting.Further cash remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and only made on an individual basis  either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining Executives  or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual's ordinary tasks. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount corresponding to 100 % of the annual base salary. Any resolution on such remuneration shall be made by the Board of Directors based on a proposal from the Remuneration Committee.For the President and CEO  pension benefits shall be granted on the basis of a defined contribution plan. The pensionable salary shall include base salary only. The pension contributions for the President and CEO attributable to the annual base salary shall amount to not more than 35 % of the base salary.Other benefits may include  for example  life insurance  medical and health insurance  and company car. Premiums and other costs relating to such benefits may amount to not more than 3 % of the annual base salary for the President and CEO.For other Executives  pension benefits shall be granted on the basis of a defined contribution plan except where law or collective agreement requires a defined benefit pension. The pensionable salary shall include base salary and  where required by law or collective agreement  incentives. The total pension contributions for other Executives shall amount to not more than 35 % of base salary  unless a higher percentage results from the application of law or collective agreement.Other benefits may include  for example  life insurance  medical and health insurance  and company car. Premiums and other costs relating to such benefits may amount to not more than 10 % of the annual base salary for other Executives.Remuneration for Executives that reside outside Sweden or reside in Sweden but having a material connection to or having been residing in a country other than Sweden may be duly adjusted to comply with mandatory rules or local practice  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines.In addition to remuneration set out above  Executives who relocate for the purposes of the position or who work in other multiple countries may also receive such remuneration and benefits as are reasonable to reflect the special circumstances associated with such arrangements  taking into account the overall purpose of these guidelines and alignment with the general policies and practices within the Volvo Group applicable to cross border work.Termination of employmentUpon termination of an Executive's employment  the notice period may not exceed twelve months. Base salary during the notice period and severance pay may not together exceed an amount corresponding to the base salary for two years.Executives that reside outside Sweden or reside in Sweden but having a material connection to or having been residing in a country other than Sweden may be offered notice periods for termination and severance payment as are reasonable to reflect the special circumstances  taking into account the overall purpose of these guidelines and alignment with the general policies and practices within the Volvo Group.Criteria for awarding variable remuneration  etc.Plans for long-term and short-term incentives shall be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria  to be determined by the Board of Directors. The criteria – which for example may relate to EBIT  cash flow  return on capital employed or similar ratios  or sustainability targets – shall be devised to promote the Volvo Group's strategy and long-term value creation and strengthen the link between achieved performance targets and reward. The satisfaction of the criteria shall be measured over periods of one or multiple years  depending on the type of incentive plan.To which extent the criteria for awarding incentives has been satisfied shall be determined when the relevant measurement period has ended. The Board of Directors is responsible for the determination of the incentives to be paid  if any  to all Executives.Claw-back and adjustmentsExecutives participating in the Volvo Group's short-term and long-term incentive plans are obligated  in certain circumstances and for specified periods of time  to repay  partially or in its entirety  incentive awards already paid if payments have been made by mistake or been based on intentionally falsified data or in the event of material restatement of the Volvo Group's financial results. Furthermore  the Board of Directors may decide on adjustments of pay-out under the incentive plans (before payment has been made) in case of extraordinary circumstances or to adjust for unforeseen one-timers.Salary and employment conditions for employeesIn the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these guidelines  the Board has considered that the various benefits offered to the Executives need to be aligned with the general structures applicable for employees of AB Volvo at levels that are competitive in the market. Thus  salary and employment conditions for other AB Volvo employees have been taken into account by including information thereon in the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are appropriate.The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' decision to propose guidelines for executive remuneration. The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate plans for variable remuneration for Executives  the application of the guidelines for executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the Group. The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent of AB Volvo and its executive management. The President and CEO and other members of the executive management do not participate in the Board of Directors' processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.Derogation from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the Volvo Group's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the Group's financial viability. As set out above  the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.Description of changes to the guidelines  etc.During 2022  the company has carefully considered feedback received from shareholders and proxy advisors in connection with the general meeting 2022 and otherwise during the year. As a result of this dialogue  the Board and the Remuneration Committee have during 2022 performed a review of the design of the Group's long-term incentives. As a result of this review  the Board proposes the adoption of a new long-term incentive plan with a three-year performance period  to be implemented starting 2023. It is proposed that the transition into a new long-term incentive plan with a three-year performance period will be made in parallel with a two-year phasing out of the current long-term incentive plan. For further information  please refer to the Board's proposal for a new long-term incentive plan.For further information about the dialogue with shareholders and proxy advisors  please refer to the Remuneration Report 2022. Additional information regarding executive remuneration in the Volvo Group is available in the Volvo Group Annual Report.Point 20.2: The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting adopts a new long-term incentive plan in accordance with the following.GeneralThe objective of AB Volvo's long-term incentive plans is to drive long-term value creation and align the interests of the senior management  including the Executives  and employees in other business critical positions with those of shareholders. Both the current and the proposed new plan operate on a four-year cycle. However  while the current plan measures performance on an annual basis with a three-year lock-in of shares  it is proposed that the new plan shall have a three-year performance period with a one-year lock-in period for the AB Volvo shares that the participants are required to acquire. It is further considered that the extension of the performance period will further promote the objective  as specified above.Both plans – the current and proposed new plan – are cash-based  where the participants are required to immediately invest the after-tax portion of the payment in AB Volvo shares which must be held for a minimum lock-in period  as defined by each plan. This way  the participants build up a shareholding and have a vested interest in the longer-term development of the value of the AB Volvo shares. At the end of the defined lock-in period  participants may sell their shares. However  Executives may only do so if they meet the requirement for owning AB Volvo shares at a value of at least two years of pre-tax base salary for the President and CEO and one year of the pre-tax base salary for the other Executives. The holding requirements for participants shall cease upon termination of a participant's employment  and the Board may grant such other exceptions to the requirements as the Board deems appropriate.Current planThe current long-term incentive plan  which was introduced in connection with the 2016 general meeting  is funded on an annual basis by an award  measured against annual performance criteria established by the Board. The after-tax portion of this payment must be immediately invested in AB Volvo shares which must be held for a minimum of three years. There is no payout under the long-term incentive plan if the annual general meeting that is held in the year following the performance year  decides not to distribute any dividends to the shareholders.New planThe Board proposes to introduce a new long-term incentive plan starting 2023. The new plan has a three-year performance measurement period followed by a one-year lock-in period for the AB Volvo shares that the participants are required to acquire. As a consequence of the introduction of the new long-term incentive plan commencing in 2023 it is proposed to phase out the current plan in two years. Hence  it is proposed to continue with the current plan for two more years (to be implemented after the general meetings 2023 and 2024 respectively)  but only for participants who were already enrolled in the current plan by year end 2022. For clarity  Executives enrolled in both the current plan (during the phasing out thereof) and the proposed plan will not receive payouts exceeding the annual maximum percentages for long term-incentives set out in the company's guidelines for remuneration. Measures have been taken to ensure that these Executives will not be overcompensated under the proposed plan  taking into account awards received under the current plan.The new long-term incentive plan is for senior management  including the Executives  and employees in certain business-critical positions within the Volvo Group. The new plan has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee  followed by final approval by the Board. The implementation of the new plan is subject to adoption  by simple majority  of this proposal at the 2023 general meeting. Once the plan is approved by the 2023 general meeting  the plan is to be implemented  as overseen by the Board and the Remuneration Committee  on a consecutive annual basis going forward  each year's implementation with a three-year performance measurement period.Each annual implementation of the plan operates on a four-year cycle: a three-year performance measurement period followed by a one-year lock-in period of the AB Volvo shares acquired. Accordingly  the after-tax portion of any payout from the plan (payable in cash after the end of each three-year performance period) must be immediately invested in AB Volvo shares  which must be held for a minimum period of one year. To facilitate recruitment of external candidates  such a candidate may  if the Board deems this to be appropriate  be offered participation in an already implemented/pending plan cycle as if the candidate had been enrolled already at the start of the relevant performance period.The plan shall be linked to the two following predetermined and measurable performance measures: (i) AB Volvo's three-year average return on capital employed with a linear scale (0% at minimum  100% at maximum of the scale; relative weighting 70 %) and (ii) the relative three-year average Volvo B total shareholder return vs. MSCI World Machinery Index with a linear scale (20% at minimum  100% at maximum of the scale; relative weighting 30%). The satisfaction of these measures shall be measured over a period of three years each. To which extent the measures for awarding remuneration have been satisfied shall be determined when the relevant three-year measurement period has ended.The Board shall be responsible for preparing the detailed design and administration of the terms and conditions of the new long-term incentive plan  including appropriate provisions on corporate actions  participants leaving the Volvo Group  etc. The Board may make appropriate adjustments to address mandatory rules as well as foreign requirements  local practice or market conditions. The Board may make other appropriate adjustments  including to performance measures and bases for calculation  to the extent prompted by significant changes in the Volvo Group or its business environment resulting in the terms of the plan no longer reasonably fulfilling their objectives.Maximum cost for the new plan  including social security charges  is estimated to range between a payout of nil if the performance thresholds are not met and an amount of SEK 844 million if the fulfilment of the performance conditions is 100%.* Between the performance threshold and the maximum performance level  the payout will be determined in accordance with the linear scales as described above. The cost for each following cycle (which is to be implemented annually) is expected to be the same as for the first cycle based on the same assumptions.The payouts under the plan will be made in cash  the net proceeds of which will be converted into shares in the open market. As such  the plan does not entail any dilution for the Company's shareholders. No hedging arrangements are intended to be made with regard to the plan's financial exposure.* This cost estimate has been calculated based on a total number of 505 participants out of the maximum number of 600 participants  a best possible estimate of the average base salaries during the performance period  using an estimated annual adjustment rate of 5% across countries  as well as applicable incentive opportunity percentages (CEO 150%; Executive Board/Group Management 80%; Top Executive 60%; others 40%/20%). Base salaries in currencies other than SEK have been converted into SEK based on the average exchange rate for the applicable currencies in 2022. The calculations have further been based on an average rate for social security charges of 27.0%.Documents and other informationThe complete proposal by the Election Committee and its statement explaining the proposals are available at www.volvogroup.com.The Annual Report  the Auditor's Report  the Consolidated Accounts  the Auditor's Report on the Consolidated Accounts  the remuneration report and the Auditor's statement pursuant to Chapter 8  section 54 of the Swedish Companies Act are available at www.volvogroup.com and at AB Volvo's Headquarters  Gropegårdsgatan 2  SE-417 15 Göteborg.

Mea…,"Chairman's and Chief Executive's ReportTradingAcross the half year to December 2022 UK markets were broadly level  although there was a material dip in October. Meanwhile  across the world  different markets had separate distinctive profiles in the period. With Fiske's client assets invested internationally  assets under management and thus management fees were broadly level; slightly down versus the prior reported interims (to November 2021) but slightly up on the immediately preceding six months to 30 June 2022.In contrast  commission revenues were some 15% lower than the prior reported interims (to November 2021) and also lower than the immediately preceding six months to 30 June 2022. We believe that this recent pattern reflects the apparent turmoil in the world  with sentiment highly tuned to expectations around interest rate movements.In a period of double-digit inflation  operating expenses have increased by some 4% over the immediately preceding six months to June 30  but are down almost 10% on the prior reported interims (to November 2021) when we had the expenses associated with our relocation to new offices at 100 Wood Street and restructuring costs incurred in anticipation of a smaller office footprint. As expected  we now benefit from the reduction in overall property costs.Overall  the profit before tax for the half year to 31 December 2022 was £28 000 compared to a loss of £6 000 in the half year to November 2021.Our cash balances remain strong  at £3.1m.Recent results from Euroclear showed further improvement in the company's operating businesses. Sales of shares by other shareholders have taken place at modestly lower levels than when last notified. Accordingly  we have adjusted our holding value down to this lower level. The company also guided shareholders that it expects to increase its dividend  payable in October 2023  by some 31%.Significant regulatory change in the form of the Consumer Duty is due for implementation in 2023. Considerable time and effort is being spent evaluating how the new rules should be implemented across our business and client base. As guided by the Financial Conduct Authority we have appointed a Consumer Duty Champion at Board level to oversee the implementation of these new regulations.MarketsOver the past six months market leadership has shifted dramatically away from highly valued US technology growth stocks and pandemic beneficiaries towards higher yielding value situations found in the ""old economy"" sectors that are so predominant in the UK equity market. The relatively low ratings of many of the UK's major companies are attracting the interest of activist investors. As a result  the US and UK markets have become disconnected with the latter moving ahead whilst the US market and the NASDAQ market are falling. Whilst not necessarily a long-term trend this adjustment may have further to go.The two major factors affecting stock markets at present are the European war between Russia and Ukraine and the high level of inflation. It would appear that neither is about to be solved favourably in the short term. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and in the background the threatening behaviour of China towards Taiwan have at last so disturbed the very complacent Western powers that the geo-political scene for at least the next decade will be totally changed.Defence expenditure  for so long a declining priority amongst Western but especially European powers  has re-emerged as an urgent priority. At the same time inflation which has been quiescent for two decades has been rekindled partly by the changed world political scene but more because it had never gone away but rather lain dormant and consequently ignored. Commodity prices  especially that of oil and gas  have always been volatile but what we have seen in the past decade looks more like a major readjustment and as such will be of economic significance for many years to come. The idea that inflation in the West will return to a maximum of 2% within the current calendar year is naïve if not irresponsible and seems like the wish fulfilment of the Wall Street bulls rather than a considered economic forecast.",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.12,0.08,0.79,True,English,"['Interim Report', 'Fiske', 'Accounts', 'December', 'higher yielding value situations', 'US technology growth stocks', 'separate distinctive profiles', 'prior reported interims', 'smaller office footprint', 'Significant regulatory change', 'Financial Conduct Authority', 'old economy"" sectors', 'overall property costs', 'Wall Street bulls', 'current calendar year', 'interest rate movements', 'Consumer Duty Champion', 'two major factors', 'complacent Western powers', 'UK equity market', 'same time inflation', 'world political scene', 'past six months', 'holding value', 'US market', '100 Wood Street', 'restructuring costs', 'Considerable time', 'geo-political scene', 'European powers', 'two decades', 'past decade', 'major companies', 'major readjustment', 'half year', 'market leadership', 'NASDAQ market', 'Chief Executive', 'Report Trading', 'material dip', 'commission revenues', 'recent pattern', 'apparent turmoil', 'new offices', 'cash balances', 'Recent results', 'operating businesses', 'lower levels', 'new rules', 'client base', 'Board level', 'new regulations', 'pandemic beneficiaries', 'low ratings', 'activist investors', 'long-term trend', 'European war', 'high level', 'short term', 'Russian invasion', 'next decade', 'Defence expenditure', 'declining priority', 'urgent priority', 'Commodity prices', 'economic significance', 'many years', 'wish fulfilment', 'economic forecast', 'UK markets', 'different markets', 'stock markets', 'double-digit inflation', 'client assets', 'management fees', 'operating expenses', 'other shareholders', 'Chairman', 'December', 'October', 'period', 'Fiske', 'November', '30 June', 'contrast', 'sentiment', 'expectations', 'relocation', 'anticipation', 'reduction', 'profit', 'tax', 'loss', 'Euroclear', 'improvement', 'company', 'Sales', 'shares', 'form', 'implementation', 'effort', 'Ukraine', 'background', 'behaviour', 'China', 'Taiwan', 'gas', 'idea', 'maximum']",2023-03-02,2023-03-03,marketscreener.com

These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration separately decided or approved by the general meeting.The guidelines' promotion of the Volvo Group's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityIt is a prerequisite for the successful implementation of the Volvo Group's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  that the Group can recruit  retain and develop senior management. These guidelines enable AB Volvo to offer Executives a competitive total remuneration. More information regarding the Volvo Group's business strategy is available in the Volvo Group Annual Report.Types of remunerationVolvo Group remuneration to Executives shall consist of the following components: base salary  short-term and long-term variable incentives  pension benefits and other benefits.Short-term incentives may  for the President and CEO  amount to a maximum of 100 % of the base salary and  for other Executives  a maximum of 80 % of the base salary.Long-term incentives may  for the President and CEO  amount to a maximum of 150 % of the base salary and  for other Executives  a maximum of 80 % of the base salary. Current and proposed long-term incentives are described and addressed separately by the 2023 general meeting.Further cash remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and only made on an individual basis  either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining Executives  or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual's ordinary tasks. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount corresponding to 100 % of the annual base salary. Any resolution on such remuneration shall be made by the Board of Directors based on a proposal from the Remuneration Committee.For the President and CEO  pension benefits shall be granted on the basis of a defined contribution plan. The pensionable salary shall include base salary only. The pension contributions for the President and CEO attributable to the annual base salary shall amount to not more than 35 % of the base salary.Other benefits may include  for example  life insurance  medical and health insurance  and company car. Premiums and other costs relating to such benefits may amount to not more than 3 % of the annual base salary for the President and CEO.For other Executives  pension benefits shall be granted on the basis of a defined contribution plan except where law or collective agreement requires a defined benefit pension. The pensionable salary shall include base salary and  where required by law or collective agreement  incentives. The total pension contributions for other Executives shall amount to not more than 35 % of base salary  unless a higher percentage results from the application of law or collective agreement.Other benefits may include  for example  life insurance  medical and health insurance  and company car. Premiums and other costs relating to such benefits may amount to not more than 10 % of the annual base salary for other Executives.Remuneration for Executives that reside outside Sweden or reside in Sweden but having a material connection to or having been residing in a country other than Sweden may be duly adjusted to comply with mandatory rules or local practice  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines.In addition to remuneration set out above  Executives who relocate for the purposes of the position or who work in other multiple countries may also receive such remuneration and benefits as are reasonable to reflect the special circumstances associated with such arrangements  taking into account the overall purpose of these guidelines and alignment with the general policies and practices within the Volvo Group applicable to cross border work.Termination of employmentUpon termination of an Executive's employment  the notice period may not exceed twelve months. Base salary during the notice period and severance pay may not together exceed an amount corresponding to the base salary for two years.Executives that reside outside Sweden or reside in Sweden but having a material connection to or having been residing in a country other than Sweden may be offered notice periods for termination and severance payment as are reasonable to reflect the special circumstances  taking into account the overall purpose of these guidelines and alignment with the general policies and practices within the Volvo Group.Criteria for awarding variable remuneration  etc.Plans for long-term and short-term incentives shall be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria  to be determined by the Board of Directors. The criteria – which for example may relate to EBIT  cash flow  return on capital employed or similar ratios  or sustainability targets – shall be devised to promote the Volvo Group's strategy and long-term value creation and strengthen the link between achieved performance targets and reward. The satisfaction of the criteria shall be measured over periods of one or multiple years  depending on the type of incentive plan.To which extent the criteria for awarding incentives has been satisfied shall be determined when the relevant measurement period has ended. The Board of Directors is responsible for the determination of the incentives to be paid  if any  to all Executives.Claw-back and adjustmentsExecutives participating in the Volvo Group's short-term and long-term incentive plans are obligated  in certain circumstances and for specified periods of time  to repay  partially or in its entirety  incentive awards already paid if payments have been made by mistake or been based on intentionally falsified data or in the event of material restatement of the Volvo Group's financial results. Furthermore  the Board of Directors may decide on adjustments of pay-out under the incentive plans (before payment has been made) in case of extraordinary circumstances or to adjust for unforeseen one-timers.Salary and employment conditions for employeesIn the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these guidelines  the Board has considered that the various benefits offered to the Executives need to be aligned with the general structures applicable for employees of AB Volvo at levels that are competitive in the market. Thus  salary and employment conditions for other AB Volvo employees have been taken into account by including information thereon in the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are appropriate.The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' decision to propose guidelines for executive remuneration. The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate plans for variable remuneration for Executives  the application of the guidelines for executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the Group. The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent of AB Volvo and its executive management. The President and CEO and other members of the executive management do not participate in the Board of Directors' processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.Derogation from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the Volvo Group's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the Group's financial viability. As set out above  the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.Description of changes to the guidelines  etc.During 2022  the company has carefully considered feedback received from shareholders and proxy advisors in connection with the general meeting 2022 and otherwise during the year. As a result of this dialogue  the Board and the Remuneration Committee have during 2022 performed a review of the design of the Group's long-term incentives. As a result of this review  the Board proposes the adoption of a new long-term incentive plan with a three-year performance period  to be implemented starting 2023. It is proposed that the transition into a new long-term incentive plan with a three-year performance period will be made in parallel with a two-year phasing out of the current long-term incentive plan. For further information  please refer to the Board's proposal for a new long-term incentive plan.For further information about the dialogue with shareholders and proxy advisors  please refer to the Remuneration Report 2022. Additional information regarding executive remuneration in the Volvo Group is available in the Volvo Group Annual Report.Point 20.2: The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting adopts a new long-term incentive plan in accordance with the following.GeneralThe objective of AB Volvo's long-term incentive plans is to drive long-term value creation and align the interests of the senior management  including the Executives  and employees in other business critical positions with those of shareholders. Both the current and the proposed new plan operate on a four-year cycle. However  while the current plan measures performance on an annual basis with a three-year lock-in of shares  it is proposed that the new plan shall have a three-year performance period with a one-year lock-in period for the AB Volvo shares that the participants are required to acquire. It is further considered that the extension of the performance period will further promote the objective  as specified above.Both plans – the current and proposed new plan – are cash-based  where the participants are required to immediately invest the after-tax portion of the payment in AB Volvo shares which must be held for a minimum lock-in period  as defined by each plan. This way  the participants build up a shareholding and have a vested interest in the longer-term development of the value of the AB Volvo shares. At the end of the defined lock-in period  participants may sell their shares. However  Executives may only do so if they meet the requirement for owning AB Volvo shares at a value of at least two years of pre-tax base salary for the President and CEO and one year of the pre-tax base salary for the other Executives. The holding requirements for participants shall cease upon termination of a participant's employment  and the Board may grant such other exceptions to the requirements as the Board deems appropriate.Current planThe current long-term incentive plan  which was introduced in connection with the 2016 general meeting  is funded on an annual basis by an award  measured against annual performance criteria established by the Board. The after-tax portion of this payment must be immediately invested in AB Volvo shares which must be held for a minimum of three years. There is no payout under the long-term incentive plan if the annual general meeting that is held in the year following the performance year  decides not to distribute any dividends to the shareholders.New planThe Board proposes to introduce a new long-term incentive plan starting 2023. The new plan has a three-year performance measurement period followed by a one-year lock-in period for the AB Volvo shares that the participants are required to acquire. As a consequence of the introduction of the new long-term incentive plan commencing in 2023 it is proposed to phase out the current plan in two years. Hence  it is proposed to continue with the current plan for two more years (to be implemented after the general meetings 2023 and 2024 respectively)  but only for participants who were already enrolled in the current plan by year end 2022. For clarity  Executives enrolled in both the current plan (during the phasing out thereof) and the proposed plan will not receive payouts exceeding the annual maximum percentages for long term-incentives set out in the company's guidelines for remuneration. Measures have been taken to ensure that these Executives will not be overcompensated under the proposed plan  taking into account awards received under the current plan.The new long-term incentive plan is for senior management  including the Executives  and employees in certain business-critical positions within the Volvo Group. The new plan has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee  followed by final approval by the Board. The implementation of the new plan is subject to adoption  by simple majority  of this proposal at the 2023 general meeting. Once the plan is approved by the 2023 general meeting  the plan is to be implemented  as overseen by the Board and the Remuneration Committee  on a consecutive annual basis going forward  each year's implementation with a three-year performance measurement period.Each annual implementation of the plan operates on a four-year cycle: a three-year performance measurement period followed by a one-year lock-in period of the AB Volvo shares acquired. Accordingly  the after-tax portion of any payout from the plan (payable in cash after the end of each three-year performance period) must be immediately invested in AB Volvo shares  which must be held for a minimum period of one year. To facilitate recruitment of external candidates  such a candidate may  if the Board deems this to be appropriate  be offered participation in an already implemented/pending plan cycle as if the candidate had been enrolled already at the start of the relevant performance period.The plan shall be linked to the two following predetermined and measurable performance measures: (i) AB Volvo's three-year average return on capital employed with a linear scale (0% at minimum  100% at maximum of the scale; relative weighting 70 %) and (ii) the relative three-year average Volvo B total shareholder return vs. MSCI World Machinery Index with a linear scale (20% at minimum  100% at maximum of the scale; relative weighting 30%). The satisfaction of these measures shall be measured over a period of three years each. To which extent the measures for awarding remuneration have been satisfied shall be determined when the relevant three-year measurement period has ended.The Board shall be responsible for preparing the detailed design and administration of the terms and conditions of the new long-term incentive plan  including appropriate provisions on corporate actions  participants leaving the Volvo Group  etc. The Board may make appropriate adjustments to address mandatory rules as well as foreign requirements  local practice or market conditions. The Board may make other appropriate adjustments  including to performance measures and bases for calculation  to the extent prompted by significant changes in the Volvo Group or its business environment resulting in the terms of the plan no longer reasonably fulfilling their objectives.Maximum cost for the new plan  including social security charges  is estimated to range between a payout of nil if the performance thresholds are not met and an amount of SEK 844 million if the fulfilment of the performance conditions is 100%.* Between the performance threshold and the maximum performance level  the payout will be determined in accordance with the linear scales as described above. The cost for each following cycle (which is to be implemented annually) is expected to be the same as for the first cycle based on the same assumptions.The payouts under the plan will be made in cash  the net proceeds of which will be converted into shares in the open market. As such  the plan does not entail any dilution for the Company's shareholders. No hedging arrangements are intended to be made with regard to the plan's financial exposure.* This cost estimate has been calculated based on a total number of 505 participants out of the maximum number of 600 participants  a best possible estimate of the average base salaries during the performance period  using an estimated annual adjustment rate of 5% across countries  as well as applicable incentive opportunity percentages (CEO 150%; Executive Board/Group Management 80%; Top Executive 60%; others 40%/20%). Base salaries in currencies other than SEK have been converted into SEK based on the average exchange rate for the applicable currencies in 2022. The calculations have further been based on an average rate for social security charges of 27.0%.Documents and other informationThe complete proposal by the Election Committee and its statement explaining the proposals are available at www.volvogroup.com.The Annual Report  the Auditor's Report  the Consolidated Accounts  the Auditor's Report on the Consolidated Accounts  the remuneration report and the Auditor's statement pursuant to Chapter 8  section 54 of the Swedish Companies Act are available at www.volvogroup.com and at AB Volvo's Headquarters  Gropegårdsgatan 2  SE-417 15 Göteborg.

The investment income tax will also be forwarded to the revenue authority by the custodian banks.For shareholders who are residents of Germany  the dividend is taxed in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act and the Corporation Tax Act.Non-tax exempt shareholders who are residents of Germany can have the withheld investment income tax imputed to their assessable corporation tax. For private shareholders  the flat-rate investment income tax deduction basically settles their income tax obligation.If resident shareholders have submitted a non-assessment certificate (Nichtveranlagungs- bescheinigung) or an exemption application form (Freistellungsauftrag) to their custodian bank  the flat-rate withholding tax will not be deducted from the dividend payment.Non-residentshareholders may be eligible for a reduction of the flat-rate withholding tax on investment income including the solidarity surcharge under an applicable double taxation convention between the Federal Republic of Germany and the respective country. If Clearstream Banking AG pays the dividend to a foreign-based bank or through a foreign-based intermediate custodian  Clearstream Banking AG will directly retain the withholding tax.The corresponding tax certificate will be issued by the bank or Clearstream Banking AG retaining the withholding tax.Applications for full or partial refunds of withholding tax on investment income must be submitted to the German Federal Central Tax Office within the statutory period of four years.Frankfurt/Main  February 2023Deutsche Beteiligungs AGThe Board of Management1/1,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.01,True,English,"['Deutsche Beteiligungs', 'Dividend announcement', 'German Federal Central Tax Office', 'flat-rate investment income tax deduction', 'applicable double taxation convention', 'flat-rate withholding tax', 'Income Tax Act', 'income tax obligation', 'Corporation Tax Act', 'assessable corporation tax', 'Annual General Meeting', 'Deutsche Beteiligungs AG', 'par value share', 'Clearstream Banking AG', 'exemption application form', 'corresponding tax certificate', 'Deutsche Bank AG', 'Non-tax exempt shareholders', 'foreign-based intermediate custodian', 'total withholding tax', 'Federal Republic', 'church tax', 'assessment certificate', 'foreign-based bank', 'custodian banks', 'WKN A1TNUT', 'financial year', 'residual amount', 'new account', '25 per cent', 'solidarity surcharge', '5.5 per cent', '26.375 per cent', 'paying bank', 'revenue authority', 'Nichtveranlagungs- bescheinigung', 'respective country', 'partial refunds', 'statutory period', 'four years', 'The Board', 'private shareholders', 'resident shareholders', 'Dividend Announcement', 'ISIN', '28 February', 'profit', '994.07 euros', 'payment', '0.80 euro', '209,578,000.47 euros', '3 March', 'residents', 'Germany', 'accordance', 'provisions', 'Freistellungsauftrag', 'reduction', 'Applications', 'full', 'Frankfurt/Main', 'Management', '60']",2023-03-02,2023-03-03,marketscreener.com

The increase in revenue was driven by the strong market momentum in 2022  representing an increase in activity across all areas of the business with the largest increase occurring in the Maintenance and Construction Services segment.Gross profit for the year ended December 31  2022 was $63 133 compared to $40 336 for the same period of 2021  representing an increase of 56.5%. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by an increase in the volume of work in the Maintenance and Construction Services segment. Gross profit margin for the year ended December 31  2022 was 10.4%  which was consistent with 2021.SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31  2022 were $37 204  in comparison to $26 298 for the same period in 2021  representing an increase of 41.5%. As a percentage of revenue  SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31  2022 were 6.2% compared to 6.8% for the same period in 2021. The increase in SG&A expenses is largely due to the growth in the business and ongoing investments in the Company's enterprise systems and digital strategy  which are expected to drive longer-term efficiencies  increase cost competitiveness and improve scalability.For the year ended December 31  2022  Adjusted EBITDAS was $32 053 compared to $17 114 for the same period in 2021. As a percentage of revenue  Adjusted EBITDAS was 5.3% for the year ended December 31  2022 compared to 4.4% for the same period in 2021.Loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31  2022 was $12 431 in comparison to a loss of $9 296 for the same period in 2021. The variance was driven by the reduction in government subsidies in 2022  an increase in SG&A expenses and restructuring expenses and the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets recognized in 2022  partially offset by a significant improvement in gross profit for the Maintenance and Construction Services segment and the impairment of right-of-use assets recognized in 2021.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOn October 5  2022  FLINT amended its asset-based revolving credit facility (the ""ABL Facility"") with a Canadian charted bank to increase the maximum borrowings available thereunder to $50 million. The amount available under the ABL Facility will vary from time to time based on the borrowing base determined with reference to the accounts receivable of FLINT and certain of its subsidiaries. The maturity date of the ABL Facility is April 14  2025. The expanded ABL Facility will provide additional working capital needed to finance higher levels of activity.The Company anticipates that its liquidity (cash on hand and available credit facilities) and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its short-term contractual obligations and maintain compliance with its financial covenants through December 31  2023.As at December 31  2022  the issued and outstanding share capital included 110 001 239 common shares  127 732 Series 1 preferred shares  and 40 111 Series 2 preferred shares.The Series 1 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $127.732 million) are convertible at the option of the holder into common shares at a price of $0.35/share and the Series 2 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $40.111 million) are convertible into common shares at a price of $0.10/share.The Series 1 and Series 2 preferred shares have a 10% fixed cumulative preferential cash dividend payable when the Company has sufficient monies to be able to do so  including under the provisions of applicable law and contracts affecting the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company does not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends until such times as the Company's balance sheet and liquidity position supports the payment. As at December 31  2022  the accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series 1 and Series 2 shares totaled $76.7 million. Any accrued and unpaid dividends are convertible in certain circumstances at the option of the holder into additional Series 1 and Series 2 preferred shares.OUTLOOKThe combination of rising global energy demand  the sanctions on Russian production in response to the war in Ukraine and a multi-year period of underinvestment in upstream development has resulted in a tight market for oil and gas  which should continue to provide support for commodity prices in 2023. At current commodity price levels  we anticipate continued high demand for our services as customers seek to maintain or incrementally grow production levels. However  broad economic concerns exist with respect to inflation  rising interest rates and geopolitical instability  the combination of which may lead to a global recession. These concerns may negatively impact the spending plans of our customers.While our customers have been prioritizing debt repayment and returns to shareholders  they are starting to increase spending on both maintenance projects (to enhance operational reliability) and capital projects (to maintain or expand production capacity). We expect these activity levels to remain strong in 2023.FLINT has continued to add new service offerings that encompass the full asset lifecycle and is now offering a suite of more than 40 services. Through the extensive regional coverage provided by our 19 operating facilities  we believe that FLINT is well-positioned to further consolidate the services required at various operating sites while generating efficiencies and cost reductions for its customers. We are also continually working to improve our service delivery to anticipate our customer's requirements and proactively meet their needs.Additional InformationOur audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31  2022 and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of the operating and financial results can be accessed on our website at www.flintcorp.com and will be available shortly through SEDAR at www.sedar.com.About FLINT Corp.With a legacy of excellence and experience stretching back more than 100 years  FLINT provides solutions for the Energy and Industrial markets including: Oil & Gas  Petrochemical  Mining  Power  Agriculture  Forestry  Infrastructure and Water Treatment.

In some cases  forward-looking information can be identified by terminology such as ""may""  ""will""  ""should""  ""expect""  ""plan""  ""anticipate""  ""believe""  ""estimate""  ""predict""  ""potential""  ""continue"" or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. This press release contains forward-looking information relating to: our business plans  strategies and objectives; contract renewals and project awards  including the estimated value thereof and the timing of completing the associated work; the demand for wear technology overlay and fabrication services; that customers will continue to allocate expenditures for the closure  reclamation and remediation of oil and gas wells  pipelines and facilities in Western Canada; that the investments being made to support our enterprise systems and digital strategy will drive longer-term efficiencies  increase cost competitiveness and improve scalability; the sufficiency of our liquidity and cash flow from operations to meet our short-term contractual obligations and maintain compliance with our financial covenants through December 31  2023; our dividend policy; the supply/demand fundamentals for oil and natural gas and its impact on the demand for our services; and that broad economic concerns may negatively impact the spending plans of our customers.Forward-looking information involves significant risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual events or results to differ materially from the events and results discussed in the forward-looking information including  but not limited to  compliance with debt covenants  access to credit facilities and other sources of capital for working capital requirements and capital expenditure needs  availability of labour  dependence on key personnel  economic conditions  commodity prices  interest rates  future actions by governmental authorities in response to Covid-19 or another pandemic  regulatory change  weather and risks related to the integration of acquired businesses. These factors should not be considered exhaustive. Risks and uncertainties about FLINT's business are more fully discussed in FLINT's disclosure materials  including its annual information form and management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results  filed with the securities regulatory authorities in Canada and available at www.sedar.com. In formulating the forward-looking information  management has assumed that business and economic conditions affecting FLINT will continue substantially in the ordinary course  including  without limitation  with respect to general levels of economic activity  regulations  taxes and interest rates.

Undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking information. Forward-looking information is provided for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes.Advisory regarding Non-Standard MeasuresThe terms ""EBITDAS'' and ""Adjusted EBITDAS"" (collectively  the ""Non-standard measures'') are financial measures used in this press release that are not standard measures under IFRS. FLINT's method of calculating the Non-Standard Measures may differ from the methods used by other issuers. Therefore  the Non-Standard Measures  as presented  may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.EBITDAS refers to income (loss) from continued operations in accordance with IFRS  before depreciation and amortization  interest expense  income tax expense (recovery) and long-term incentive plan expenses. EBITDAS is used by management and the directors of FLINT as well as many investors to determine the ability of an issuer to generate cash from operations. Management also uses EBITDAS to monitor the performance of FLINT's reportable segments and believes that in addition to income (loss) from continued operations and cash provided by operating activities  EBITDAS is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine FLINT's ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures and income taxes. FLINT has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to EBITDAS below.Adjusted EBITDAS refers to EBITDAS excluding impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  restructuring expense  gain on sale of property  plant and equipment  loss (recovery) of contingent consideration liability  one time incurred expenses  impairment of right-of-use assets and government subsidies. FLINT has used Adjusted EBITDAS as the basis for the analysis of its past operating financial performance. Adjusted EBITDAS is a measure that management believes (i) is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine FLINT's ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures  and income taxes  and (ii) facilitates the comparability of the results of historical periods and the analysis of its operating financial performance which may be useful to investors. FLINT has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDAS below.Investors are cautioned that the Non-Standard Measures are not alternatives to measures under IFRS and should not  on their own  be construed as an indicator of performance or cash flows  a measure of liquidity or as a measure of actual return on the shares. These Non-Standard Measures should only be used with reference to FLINT's consolidated interim and annual financial statements  which are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or on FLINT's website at www.flintcorp.com.Three months ended Maintenance andConstructionServices Wear TechnologyOverlay Services Corporate Total December 31  2022 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 13 760 $ 10 016 $ (3 252 ) $ 1 172 $ (15 356 ) $ (11 183 ) $ (4 848 ) $ 5 Add: Amortization of intangible assets 32 52 101 115 - - 133 167 Depreciation expense 1 749 1 861 628 700 179 323 2 556 2 884 Long-term incentive plan expense - - - - 1 758 1 239 1 758 1 239 Interest expense 114 153 136 97 4 284 3 664 4 534 3 914 EBITDAS 15 655 12 082 (2 387 ) 2 084 (9 135 ) (5 957 ) 4 133 8 209 Add (deduct): Gain on sale of property  plant and equipment (119 ) (53 ) - - - - (119 ) (53 ) Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill - - 3 652 - - - 3 652 - Restructuring expenses 169 - 3 - (110 ) 168 62 168 Income from government subsidies - (4 153 ) - (359 ) - (308 ) - (4 820 ) One-time incurred expenses - - - - 1 030 1 107 1 030 1 107 Recovery on contingent consideration liability - - - - - (149 ) - (149 ) Adjusted EBITDAS $ 15 705 $ 7 876 $ 1 268 $ 1 725 $ (8 215 ) $ (5 139 ) $ 8 758 $ 4 462",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.0,True,English,"['2022 Annual Financial Results', 'Fourth Quarter', 'FLINT Corp.', 'ClearStream Energy Services Inc', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'SG&A"") expenses', 'SG&A expenses', 'available credit facilities', 'new contract awards', 'Construction Services segment', 'strong market momentum', 'record 30 turnaround projects', 'first two months', 'Gross profit margin', 'FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS', 'fourth quarter revenues', 'legacy Flint business', 'annual record', 'going momentum', 'ANNUAL HIGHLIGHTS', 'new customers', 'EBITDAS margin', 'twelve months', 'GLOBE NEWSWIRE', 'standard measures', 'press release', 'activity levels', 'Barry Card', 'next step', 'Mr. Card.', 'ongoing investments', 'enterprise systems', 'digital strategy', 'longer-term efficiencies', 'cost competitiveness', 'same period', 'various scopes', 'three months', 'FLINT Corp.', 'Canadian dollars', 'Adjusted EBITDAS', 'service company', 'full year', 'CALGARY', 'Alberta', 'March', 'FLNT', 'results', 'amounts', 'thousands', 'IFRS', 'Advisory', 'end', 'description', 'items', 'limitations', 'use', 'seasonality', 'increase', 'commitment', 'workforce', '4,000 employees', 'safety', 'quality', 'time', 'budget', 'December', 'rebranding', 'transformation', 'purpose', 'resources', 'world', 'mission', 'choice', 'markets', 'booking', 'renewals', 'full-year', 'Selling', 'general', 'growth', 'scalability', 'percentage', 'Liquidity', 'cash', 'Q4', 'Maintenance', 'existing', '2021']",2023-03-05,2023-03-03,finanznachrichten.de

19653,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/03/deutsche-borse-prize-review-the-photographers-gallery-london,Deutsche Börse photography prize review – stern heroes  uncanny hybrids and a missing person,Black history and identity loom large in the work of Samuel Fosso and Arthur Jafa while Frida Orupabo offers strange  hybrid creations and Bieke Depoorter faces an ethical dilemma,There are many abiding spirits  historical and cultural  hovering over the work on display on the fourth floor of the Photographers’ Gallery in London  where Samuel Fosso and Arthur Jafa are in competition for this year’s Deutsche Börse prize. As you enter the gallery  the stern faces of Martin Luther King  Haile Selassie and Angela Davis stare down from the opposite wall  instantly recognisable but unsettlingly unreal. Next door  Robert Johnson and Miles Davis gaze directly at the viewer  cigarettes dangling from their lips  the latter in particular seeming to channel the ghost of the mythical “bad man”  Stagger Lee  from behind his outsize shades.Black history and identity loom large in the work of both artists  but also the historical and contemporary function of the photographic image in creating  and distorting  that history and identity. African Spirits  Fosso’s series of performative self-portraits of iconic black figures  have such a powerful presence that they seem to be watching you from across the years as you peruse his other work. The diptych on an adjoining wall in which Fosso pays homage to the many west African soldiers who fought in both world wars is poignant as well as historically and formally complex. It carries a less immediately dramatic  but no less resonant  charge.Visceral … Bloods II  2020  by Arthur Jafa. Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Gladstone GalleryIn contrast  Jafa’s work resonates in a more visceral way  with found images from black history and contemporary culture coming together and colliding in an uneasy flow that echoes the dissonant urgency of certain strands of experimental jazz and futuristic funk. His epic show at Luma in Arles last year was titled Live Evil  a nod to Miles Davis’s 1971 album of the same name. The work on display here is a small  somewhat fragmented  distillation of that exhibition. Inevitably  the often wilfully jarring juxtapositions that comprise his exploration of every facet of black experience  from the joyous to the soul-numbingly repressive  lose some of their associative thrust in this much smaller setting. That said  the huge image of the site of a Rwandan massacre that takes up most of one wall is  if anything  more unsettling in this context  all the more so when contrasted with the adjacent blurred photo of HR  the lead singer of the hardcore punk band Bad Brains  suspended in mid air as if levitating. A taster  then  of Jafa’s ambitious and provocative practice  that leaves you longing for the full-scale experience.Loaded with meaning … Batwoman  2021  by Frida Orupabo. Photograph: © Frida Orupabo Courtesy of the artist and Galerie Nordenhake  Berlin  Stockholm  Mexico CityUpstairs  sculptural photographic collages by the young Norwegian Nigerian artist Frida Orupabo make for the most intriguing display in the exhibition. Having followed her work with curiosity for some time on Instagram  where she posts as @nemiepeba  I was uncertain as to how her art would translate to the gallery. I needn’t have worried. Here  her strange  hybrid creations inhabit the space  seeming to hover on the walls as if about to become animated. Her raw material is sourced from the digital sphere – images found on social media  eBay and old colonial archives. Printed  cut out and then layered in segments  her collages have a distinctly old-fashioned  hands-on feel  but her mainly female figures are loaded with meaning  both personal and cultural.There is something unsettling  too  in the looks on the faces she has retrieved from history  their direct  unsparing stares. “The stare back is a way of fighting objectification ” Orupabo states in an illuminating video about her work on YouTube  citing it as a kind of “resistance” to the gallery experience  one that hopefully precipitates an “internal dialogue” between the viewer and subject. Her quietly complex creations do that and much more. It is rare to see contemporary issues of identity  sexuality  race and belonging explored though work that is so singular  instinctive and elusive  so buoyed up by mysterious  unconscious undercurrents.Entering the Belgian photographer Bieke Depoorter’s room  one is immediately transported to another conceptual universe  one of compulsion  self-doubt  blurred boundaries and ethical dilemmas. Her film  Michael  taken from A Chance Encounter  her exhibition in Berlin last year  tracks her relationship with one of her subjects  whom she met by accident in Portland in 2015  became close to  and then lost touch with when he mysteriously disappeared. Comprised of still images  Depoorter’s voiceover punctuated by the testimony of people who knew or crossed paths with Michael  the film has a cumulative power that has much to do with the hypnotic rhythm and grain of her narration as the unfolding images.Cumulative power … We walked together  Portland  Oregon  USA  May 2015  by Bieke Depoorter. Photograph: ©Bieke Depoorter/Magnum Photos Courtesy of the artistMichael remains an eccentric  if elusive  figure throughout  and there are moments when I began to wonder if he was a creation of the artist’s imagination: an accomplished actor in an elaborately constructed mystery. The room is covered with papers  photographs  notes and ephemera pertaining to Michael’s obsessive life and his disappearance  and the film  too  is haunted by his fleeting presence. Ultimately  though  it tells you more about the narrator than the subject  and  by extension  raises myriad questions about the compulsive nature of photography: the obsessive need to document  record  observe and track. A brave  self-interrogatory work  nevertheless  that stayed with me for hours afterwards in the manner of an intriguing short story.

19660,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valneva-provides-clinical-regulatory-updates-060000933.html,Valneva Provides Clinical and Regulatory Updates for its COVID-19 Vaccine VLA2001,Saint-Herblain (France)  March 2  2023 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today announced additional data from...,VALNEVASaint-Herblain (France)  March 2  2023 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today announced additional data from remaining clinical studies and an update on regulatory submissions for its inactivated COVID-19 vaccine  VLA2001. As previously announced  Valneva will not invest in further development of the vaccine  in the absence of a new partnership1. It is  however  completing remaining clinical studies and submissions as agreed with regulators.On February 23  2023  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a positive opinion for the use of VLA2001 in adults 18 to 50 years of age as a booster dose to be given at least seven months following primary vaccination (the second dose) with VLA2001 (homologous booster dose) or with an adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose).Valneva also provided an update on its pivotal Phase 3 Study COV-Compare (VLA2001-301). In this study  neutralizing antibodies on Day 208 (six months after the second dose of the primary vaccination with VLA2001) were non-inferior compared to the active comparator AZD1222  an adenoviral vector vaccine. The fold decline of neutralizing antibodies over six months after a second vaccination with VLA2001 was similar to the active comparator  and less pronounced than for other licensed COVID-19 vaccines2 3. The T-cell response against the spike protein elicited upon vaccination with VLA2001 was in the same range as for the active comparator. Moreover  T-cell reactivity against the nucleocapsid and membrane protein was induced upon vaccination with VLA2001.Additionally  results from VLA2001-304  a Phase 3 study in older adults  56 years of age and above  showed that VLA2001 was well tolerated by these participants when administered as a two-dose or three-dose immunization  thus confirming the previously reported favorable safety profile of VLA20014. In this age group  a two-dose vaccination with VLA2001 was inferior in terms of geometric mean titers and seroconversion rates compared to younger adults aged 30 years and above. After two doses  immunogenicity in older adults was at a level which could be correlated with 60-70% vaccine efficacy against ancestral SARS-CoV-25. A third dose of VLA2001 further increased immunogenicity in participants aged 56 years and above to the titers associated with vaccine efficacy of >90% against ancestral SARS-CoV-26 7.Story continuesFinally  VLA2001’s shelf life was recently extended to 21 months compared to 18 months previously. The Company will continue to submit data to further extend it.About VLA2001VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which was upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).VLA2001 was the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe8 and the only whole virus  inactivated  COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom9 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates10 and Kingdom of Bahrain11. Valneva signed agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States and the Kingdom of Bahrain12. In August 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations for use of VLA200113. In light of current order levels and existing inventories  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine and is continuing discussions on the potential sale of some of the remaining inventory. VLA2001 currently has a 21-month shelf life and the Company will continue to submit data to further extend it.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases.

During these storms  lightning strikes often lead to instability in the power supply to the mine. Kenmare employs a range of protection systems to minimise the impact on operations  including the recently installed Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply (“RUPS”) system to ensure stable power to the Mineral Separation Plant (“MSP”) and a synchronous condenser (a voltage stabilisation device referred to as a “Dip Doctor”)  which alleviates approximately 80% of the dips and spikes in power supply to the mine.In early February 2023  power lines nearby the mine were subject to a direct lightning strike of unusually high intensity. The severity of the strike cut two of the powerline conductors and the energy discharged overwhelmed the mine’s lightning protection systems. In addition to damaging the power line infrastructure  a large number of variable speed drives and electronic devices at the mine were also damaged  primarily at the three Wet Concentrator Plants (“WCPs”). This was a highly unusual event  which has not previously occurred in Kenmare’s 15 years of operations.Mining operations were severely disrupted while repairs were carried out. While Kenmare is working hard to recover lost production of Heavy Mineral Concentrate  production of ilmenite and rutile is now expected to be towards the lower half of the guidance range for 2023. Due to a drawdown of intermediate stocks at the MSP  the guidance range for zircon and concentrates remains unchanged. The shipping schedule has also been less affected  as the MSP continued to operate  and existing finished product inventories have been sufficient to allow product shipments to continue.Story continuesThe Company has undertaken a process of either replacing or repairing the damaged equipment and WCP production capacity has now been restored at close to normal operating levels. The MSP sustained only minor damage  because of additional protection provided by the RUPS system  and returned to operations quickly. The Company is engaging with suppliers to rebuild normal spares inventories of variable speed drives.Kenmare is working to establish and mitigate the capital and operating cost impacts of the disruptions. Insurance cover is in place and Kenmare is liaising with its insurers to process claims in relation to the lightning strike.The Company will provide further updates in due course and expects to announce its 2022 Preliminary Results on 22 March 2023.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Michael StarkeInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

No factor VIII inhibitors were observed in the 74 children enrolled in the study  of which 65 experienced at least 50 exposure days. Efanesoctocog alfa provided high sustained factor VIII levels throughout the weekly dosing interval with a median annualised bleeding rate (ABR) of 0.00 (interquartile range: 0.00-1.02) and an estimated mean ABR (95% confidence interval) of 0.89 (0.56-1.42).Haemophilia A is a rare  genetic disorder in which the ability of a person's blood to clot is impaired due to a lack of factor VIII. Haemophilia A occurs in about one in 5 000 male births annually  and more rarely in females. People with haemophilia can experience bleeding episodes that can cause pain  irreversible joint damage and life-threatening haemorrhages.Despite advancements in treatment made in recent years  a large unmet medical need still exists and requires further improvement in the standard of care. Efanesoctocog alfa is a new class of factor VIII replacement therapy decoupled of von Willebrand factor  providing high sustained factor activity levels with a once-weekly prophylactic treatment regimen.""These data confirm that efanesoctocog alfa has the potential to become a new standard of care for haemophilia A with higher protection for longer across treatment scenarios for all age groups "" said Anders Ullman  MD  PhD  Head of Research & Development and Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer at Sobi. ""We are excited to move ahead with regulatory submission in the EU and look forward to sharing these results at a future medical meeting.""Story continuesCombined with the XTEND-1 phase 3 trial  these results will provide the basis for regulatory submission in the EU. Efanesoctocog alfa was granted orphan designation by the European Commission in June 2019 and the medicine was recently approved in the US.About XTEND-KidsXTEND-Kids is an open-label  non-randomised interventional  single-arm study. Participants received a weekly prophylactic dose of efanesoctocog alfa for 52 weeks. XTEND-Kids evaluates efficacy  safety and pharmacokinetics in 74 previously treated patients <12 years of age with severe haemophilia A.About efanesoctocog alfaEfanesoctocog alfa (formerly BIVV001) is a novel and investigational recombinant factor VIII therapy with the potential to deliver near-normal factor activity levels for a significant part of the week  extending bleed protection in a once-weekly dose for people with haemophilia A. Efanesoctocog alfa builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN® polypeptides to potentially extend its time in circulation. It is the only therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which is believed to impose a half-life limitation on current factor VIII therapies. It is approved as ALTUVIIIO [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein-ehtl] in the US.XTEN® is a registered trademark of Amunix Pharmaceuticals  Inc.About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialisation of Alprolix® and Elocta®/Eloctate®.

No factor VIII inhibitors were observed in the 74 children enrolled in the study  of which 65 experienced at least 50 exposure days. Efanesoctocog alfa provided high sustained factor VIII levels throughout the weekly dosing interval with a median annualised bleeding rate (ABR) of 0.00 (interquartile range: 0.00-1.02) and an estimated mean ABR (95% confidence interval) of 0.89 (0.56-1.42).Haemophilia A is a rare  genetic disorder in which the ability of a person's blood to clot is impaired due to a lack of factor VIII. Haemophilia A occurs in about one in 5 000 male births annually  and more rarely in females. People with haemophilia can experience bleeding episodes that can cause pain  irreversible joint damage and life-threatening haemorrhages.Despite advancements in treatment made in recent years  a large unmet medical need still exists and requires further improvement in the standard of care. Efanesoctocog alfa is a new class of factor VIII replacement therapy decoupled of von Willebrand factor  providing high sustained factor activity levels with a once-weekly prophylactic treatment regimen.""These data confirm that efanesoctocog alfa has the potential to become a new standard of care for haemophilia A with higher protection for longer across treatment scenarios for all age groups "" said Anders Ullman  MD  PhD  Head of Research & Development and Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer at Sobi. ""We are excited to move ahead with regulatory submission in the EU and look forward to sharing these results at a future medical meeting.""Story continuesCombined with the XTEND-1 phase 3 trial  these results will provide the basis for regulatory submission in the EU. Efanesoctocog alfa was granted orphan designation by the European Commission in June 2019 and the medicine was recently approved in the US.About XTEND-KidsXTEND-Kids is an open-label  non-randomised interventional  single-arm study. Participants received a weekly prophylactic dose of efanesoctocog alfa for 52 weeks. XTEND-Kids evaluates efficacy  safety and pharmacokinetics in 74 previously treated patients <12 years of age with severe haemophilia A.About efanesoctocog alfaEfanesoctocog alfa (formerly BIVV001) is a novel and investigational recombinant factor VIII therapy with the potential to deliver near-normal factor activity levels for a significant part of the week  extending bleed protection in a once-weekly dose for people with haemophilia A. Efanesoctocog alfa builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN® polypeptides to potentially extend its time in circulation. It is the only therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which is believed to impose a half-life limitation on current factor VIII therapies. It is approved as ALTUVIIIO [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein-ehtl] in the US.XTEN® is a registered trademark of Amunix Pharmaceuticals  Inc.About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialisation of Alprolix® and Elocta®/Eloctate®.

19686,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/03/02/2618904/0/en/Valneva-Provides-Clinical-and-Regulatory-Updates-for-its-COVID-19-Vaccine-VLA2001.html,Valneva Provides Clinical and Regulatory Updates for its COVID-19 Vaccine VLA2001,Saint-Herblain (France)  March 2  2023 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today announced additional data from remaining clinical studies and an update on regulatory submissions for its inactivated COVID-19 vaccine …,English FrenchSaint-Herblain (France)  March 2  2023 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today announced additional data from remaining clinical studies and an update on regulatory submissions for its inactivated COVID-19 vaccine  VLA2001. As previously announced  Valneva will not invest in further development of the vaccine  in the absence of a new partnership1. It is  however  completing remaining clinical studies and submissions as agreed with regulators.On February 23  2023  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a positive opinion for the use of VLA2001 in adults 18 to 50 years of age as a booster dose to be given at least seven months following primary vaccination (the second dose) with VLA2001 (homologous booster dose) or with an adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose).Valneva also provided an update on its pivotal Phase 3 Study COV-Compare (VLA2001-301). In this study  neutralizing antibodies on Day 208 (six months after the second dose of the primary vaccination with VLA2001) were non-inferior compared to the active comparator AZD1222  an adenoviral vector vaccine. The fold decline of neutralizing antibodies over six months after a second vaccination with VLA2001 was similar to the active comparator  and less pronounced than for other licensed COVID-19 vaccines2 3. The T-cell response against the spike protein elicited upon vaccination with VLA2001 was in the same range as for the active comparator. Moreover  T-cell reactivity against the nucleocapsid and membrane protein was induced upon vaccination with VLA2001.Additionally  results from VLA2001-304  a Phase 3 study in older adults  56 years of age and above  showed that VLA2001 was well tolerated by these participants when administered as a two-dose or three-dose immunization  thus confirming the previously reported favorable safety profile of VLA20014. In this age group  a two-dose vaccination with VLA2001 was inferior in terms of geometric mean titers and seroconversion rates compared to younger adults aged 30 years and above. After two doses  immunogenicity in older adults was at a level which could be correlated with 60-70% vaccine efficacy against ancestral SARS-CoV-25. A third dose of VLA2001 further increased immunogenicity in participants aged 56 years and above to the titers associated with vaccine efficacy of >90% against ancestral SARS-CoV-26 7.Finally  VLA2001’s shelf life was recently extended to 21 months compared to 18 months previously. The Company will continue to submit data to further extend it.About VLA2001VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which was upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).VLA2001 was the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe8 and the only whole virus  inactivated  COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom9 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates10 and Kingdom of Bahrain11. Valneva signed agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States and the Kingdom of Bahrain12. In August 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations for use of VLA200113. In light of current order levels and existing inventories  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine and is continuing discussions on the potential sale of some of the remaining inventory. VLA2001 currently has a 21-month shelf life and the Company will continue to submit data to further extend it.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

The XTEND-Kids phase 3 pivotal study evaluating the safety  efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ALTUVIIIO as once-weekly prophylaxis in previously treated patients <12 years of age with severe hemophilia A met its primary endpoint of safety  with no FVIII inhibitors detected in 74 children  with more than 50 children experiencing at least 50 exposure days  nearly a full year of treatment. The completion of XTEND-Kids represents the final milestone needed for regulatory submission in the EU.Karin Knobe  MD  PhDTherapeutic Area Head  Rare Diseases and Rare Blood Disorders  Sanofi“At Sanofi  we never settle. We work alongside patients  caregivers  and advocacy organizations to understand the needs of the hemophilia community and pursue first-in-class technologies to meet those needs. We strive for a future where every child with hemophilia can play without fear  travel free from a rigid treatment schedule  and pursue their dreams unencumbered by worry.”Hemophilia A is a rare  lifelong condition in which the ability of a person’s blood to clot properly is impaired  leading to excessive bleeds and spontaneous bleeds into joints that can result in joint damage and chronic pain  and potentially impact quality of life. The severity of hemophilia is determined by the level of clotting factor activity in a person’s blood  and there is a negative correlation between risk of bleeding and factor activity levels.ALUTVIIIO is a first-in-class  high-sustained FVIII therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine prophylaxis  on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes  and perioperative management of bleeding in adults and children in February 2023. Granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA in May 2022 – the first FVIII therapy to receive this designation—ALTUVIIIO also received Fast Track designation in February 2021 and Orphan Drug designation in 2017. The European Commission granted Orphan Drug designation in June 2019.Story continuesAbout XTEND-KidsThe XTEND-Kids study (NCT04759131) was an open-label  non-randomized interventional study of the safety  efficacy  and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly ALTUVIIIO in previously treated patients younger than 12 years of age with severe hemophilia A. Patients received once-weekly ALTUVIIIO prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for 52 weeks which provided high-sustained FVIII levels throughout the weekly dosing interval with a median (IQR) annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of 0.00 (0.00  1.02) and an estimated mean (95% CI) ABR of 0.89 (0.56 ; 1.42). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of inhibitor development (baseline to 52 weeks). No inhibitors were detected in this study.About ALTUVIIIO™ALTUVIIIO [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein-ehtl] is a first-in-class high-sustained factor VIII therapy that is designed to extend protection from bleeds with once-weekly prophylactic dosing for adults and children with hemophilia A. ALTUVIIIO has a 3 to 4 fold longer half-life relative to standard and extended half-life factor VIII products  providing high-sustained factor activity levels throughout (≥40%) for most of the week and at 15% at the end of the dosing interval. ALTUVIIIO is the first factor VIII therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which imposes a half-life limitation on earlier generation factor VIII therapies. ALTUVIIIO builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN® polypeptides to extend its time in circulation. XTEN® is a registered trademark of Amunix Pharmaceuticals  Inc.About the XTEND Clinical ProgramsThe XTEND clinical program is comprised of two Phase 3 trials in hemophilia A: XTEND-1 in people 12 years or older and XTEND-Kids in children younger than 12 years old. There is also an ongoing extension study (XTEND-ed).The Phase 3 XTEND-1 study (NCT04161495) was an open-label  non-randomized interventional study assessing the safety  efficacy  and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly ALTUVIIIO in people 12 years of age or older (n=159) with severe hemophilia A who were previously treated with factor VIII replacement therapy. The study consisted of two parallel treatment arms — the prophylaxis Arm A (n=133)  in which patients who had received prior factor VIII prophylaxis were treated with once-weekly intravenous ALTUVIIIO prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for 52 weeks  and the on-demand Arm B (n=26)  in which patients who had received prior on-demand factor VIII therapy began with 26 weeks of on-demand ALTUVIIIO (50 IU/kg)  then switched to once-weekly prophylaxis with ALTUVIIIO (50 IU/kg) for an additional 26 weeks.The primary efficacy endpoint of XTEND-1 was the mean annualized bleeding rate (ABR) in Arm A  and the key secondary endpoint was an intra-patient comparison of ABR during the ALTUVIIIO weekly prophylaxis treatment period versus the prior factor VIII prophylaxis ABR for a subset of participants in Arm A who had participated in a previous observational study (Study 242HA201/OBS16221).The XTEND-Kids study (NCT04759131) was an open-label  non-randomized interventional study of the safety  efficacy  and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly ALTUVIIIO in previously treated patients younger than 12 years of age with severe hemophilia A. Patients received once-weekly ALTUVIIIO prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of inhibitor development.About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialization of Alprolix® and Elocta®/Eloctate®.

It is unclear yet what it will mean for the group’s secondary Irish listing.“When we get the feedback from our shareholders in that regard  particularly with regard to indeed the UK and indeed [the] Ireland Euronext [listing]  at that stage we will be able to update you  at the end of April ” said group finance director Jim Mintern. “But for the next six weeks we need to engage with our shareholders.”After announcing record 2022 sales  profits  margins and cash reserves today  chief executive Albert Manifold told reporters the “size and strength” of CRH’s American business – which makes up 75pc of its earnings  up from 50pc a decade ago – was behind the move.A trio of multi-trillion dollar subsidy plans by the US administration – the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  Inflation Reduction Act and Chips Act  some of which the EU is trying to emulate – are part and parcel of CRH’s transatlantic shift.“We would have higher levels of growth if we were to list our business in America ” Mr Manifold said.“It’s clear that there will be significantly stronger support for construction in North America than there is in Europe. That’s because of the level and extent of federal funding. That alone is going to super-charge construction growth in infrastructure over the next decade.”Europe is still “absolutely critical” for CRH  particularly central and eastern Europe  which is the “jewel in the crown” of the business  despite the ongoing war in Ukraine.CRH has been active in Ukraine since 1999 and employs more than 800 people in the country. It reopened its two facilities there  in the western half of the country  last autumn.“We remain committed to Ukraine. We have a fine business there. Our people are all safe. Our facilities remain undamaged. I think that it should be an area for CRH in the years to come.”But costs in Europe have spiralled higher than those in its American business  with price hikes last year offsetting lower activity. Earnings in Europe were down 4pc on 2021  despite sales jumping 11pc.Further price increases are likely this year as CRH attempts to “fully” recover cost hikes. “We still have a ways to do  in particular parts of the world  particularly here in Europe  because there were some very  very significant cost increases last year which we have not fully recovered yet.”Overall  he said  its full-year results show the firm is in “fairly rude  robust shape”.Earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortisation (Ebitda) were $5.6bn (€5.3bn)  up 13pc on 2021. Its Ebitda margin was up 10 basis points to 17.2pc  despite cost increases.Group sales rose 12pc across the year to $32.7bn.Profit after tax rose 10pc to $2.7bn  with CRH announcing a full-year dividend of $1.27  up 5pc from 2021  and a new $3bn share buyback.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.23,0.18,0.58,True,English,"['US listing switch', 'stock market', 'CRH', 'Dublin', 'part', 'multi-trillion dollar subsidy plans', 'chief executive Albert Manifold', 'new $3bn share buyback', 'Building materials giant CRH', 'Irish stock exchange', 'President Joe Biden', 'The Irish company', 'rude, robust shape', 'next six weeks', 'secondary Irish listing', 'Inflation Reduction Act', 'Further price increases', 'booming US demand', 'sweeping infrastructure subsidies', 'UK stock market', 'group finance director', 'significant cost increases', 'New York', 'Mr Manifold', 'next decade', 'price hikes', 'main listing', 'primary listing', 'Jobs Act', 'Chips Act', 'cost hikes', 'post-Brexit Britain', 'largest companies', 'Jim Mintern', 'cash reserves', 'US administration', 'Infrastructure Investment', 'transatlantic shift', 'higher levels', 'stronger support', 'federal funding', 'ongoing war', 'western half', 'lower activity', 'full-year results', 'full-year dividend', 'business sense', 'record 2022 sales', 'American business', 'fine business', 'Group sales', 'Ireland Euronext', 'North America', 'two facilities', 'Ebitda margin', 'eastern Europe', 'construction growth', 'London', 'Dublin', 'shareholders', 'move', 'blow', 'FTSE100', 'feedback', 'regard', 'stage', 'April', 'profits', 'margins', 'reporters', 'size', 'strength', '75pc', 'earnings', 'trio', 'part', 'parcel', 'extent', 'central', 'jewel', 'crown', 'Ukraine', '800 people', 'country', 'area', 'years', 'costs', 'ways', 'world', 'firm', 'interest', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', '2pc']",2023-03-02,2023-03-03,independent.ie

The audit procedures have been substantially completed by the Company’s statutory auditors and financials – prepared under both US GAAP and IFRS for the purpose of Form 10-K and Universal Registration Document respectively – were approved by the Board of Directors on March 2  2023.EVOLVEDBV completed EVOLVE  a 12-week caregiver and patient user experience study of the modified Viaskin Peanut patch in 50 peanut allergic children ages 4 – 11-years old. The objective of EVOLVE was to evaluate the Instructions for Use (IFU) and ease of use for the modified Viaskin Peanut patch. The study concluded that the updated Viaskin Peanut IFU supported correct patch application  which included no lifting of the patch edges or detachment directly after application. Furthermore  EVOLVE concluded that the majority of parents/caregivers reported a positive ease of use experience with the modified Viaskin Peanut patch.In EVOLVE  DBV also tested the functionality of an electronic patient diary (eDiary) to collect information on activities of daily living and patch adhesion scores. As previously announced  VITESSE will assess patch adhesion of the modified Viaskin Peanut patch and DBV will include a statistical test of adhesion in the VITESSE statistical analysis plan. EVOLVE verified that the eDiary tool can be used by caregivers in VITESSE to capture the adhesion data in support of a potential BLA application.Story continuesFinancial Highlights for the Full Year 2022The Company’s annual consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with both generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""US GAAP"") and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union.

A pre-submission meeting with the HAS is scheduled for March and the application for early access authorisation should be submitted shortly after with the aim of obtaining authorisation in the second quarter of 2023. This programme would allow patients hospitalised in France with a severe form of COVID-19 to access treatment with Sarconeos (BIO101)  which has been shown to reduce the risk of respiratory failure and early death by 44% in the positive phase 2-3 COVA clinical trial. Biophytis continues to prepare conditional marketing authorisation applications in Europe and in the US due to the health emergency.Stanislas Veillet  CEO of Biophytis  said: ""We aim to accelerate the availability of Sarconeos (BIO101) to hospitalized patients in France with severe forms of COVID-19 through an early access program that we will present to the HAS in the coming weeks. Sarconeos (BIO101) is a drug candidate that has been shown in the positive phase 2-3 COVA clinical trial to reduce the risk of respiratory failure and early death in these patients by 44%. We plan to file the application formally shortly after with the objective of obtaining approval to start this programme in the second quarter of 2023. In parallel  we are also preparing a conditional approval application due to the health emergency in Europe and the US.""The early access in France is granted by the HAS after the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) has given its opinion on the presumption of efficacy and safety. This is a system that allows the provision and early financial coverage  on an exceptional and derogatory basis  of certain medicinal products that meet an unmet medical need  that are likely to be innovative but have not yet been authorised in a therapeutic indication.About BIOPHYTISBiophytis SA is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the development of therapeutics aimed at slowing the degenerative processes associated with aging and improving functional outcomes in patients suffering from age-related diseases  including severe respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19. Sarconeos (BIO101)  our lead drug candidate  is a small molecule  orally administered drug that is planned to be developed as a treatment for sarcopenia in upcoming Phase 3 clinical trials in the US  Brazil and Europe (SARA-31 and SARA-32).

The collaboration revenue during the twelve months ended December 31  2022 primarily relates to the recognition of milestone revenue following the option exercise by LEO Pharma to enter into a commercial license for ARGX-112. The collaboration revenue for the twelve months ended December 31  2021 was primarily attributable to the recognition of the transaction price as a consequence of the termination of the collaboration agreement with Janssen  resulting in the recognition of $315.1 million  and the recognition of $177.5 million in collaboration revenue related to the strategic collaboration with Zai Lab  including the development milestone which was triggered by the FDA approval of VYVGART.Other operating income for the fourth quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $7.9 million  and $34.5 million  respectively  compared to $7.7 million and $42.1 million for the same periods in 2021.

The research and development expenses mainly relate to external research and development expenses and personnel expenses incurred in the clinical development of efgartigimod in various indications and the expansion of other clinical and preclinical pipeline candidates. The increase in research and development expense during 2022 is mainly driven by the recognition of the priority review voucher submitted with the BLA filing for SC efgartigimod for the treatment of gMG  which resulted in an expense of $99.1 million.Selling  general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter and year-to-date in 2022 were $135.3 million and $472.1 million  respectively  compared to $97.4 million and $307.6 million for the same periods in 2021.

During these storms  lightning strikes often lead to instability in the power supply to the mine. Kenmare employs a range of protection systems to minimise the impact on operations  including the recently installed Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply (“RUPS”) system to ensure stable power to the Mineral Separation Plant (“MSP”) and a synchronous condenser (a voltage stabilisation device referred to as a “Dip Doctor”)  which alleviates approximately 80% of the dips and spikes in power supply to the mine.In early February 2023  power lines nearby the mine were subject to a direct lightning strike of unusually high intensity. The severity of the strike cut two of the powerline conductors and the energy discharged overwhelmed the mine’s lightning protection systems. In addition to damaging the power line infrastructure  a large number of variable speed drives and electronic devices at the mine were also damaged  primarily at the three Wet Concentrator Plants (“WCPs”). This was a highly unusual event  which has not previously occurred in Kenmare’s 15 years of operations.Mining operations were severely disrupted while repairs were carried out. While Kenmare is working hard to recover lost production of Heavy Mineral Concentrate  production of ilmenite and rutile is now expected to be towards the lower half of the guidance range for 2023. Due to a drawdown of intermediate stocks at the MSP  the guidance range for zircon and concentrates remains unchanged. The shipping schedule has also been less affected  as the MSP continued to operate  and existing finished product inventories have been sufficient to allow product shipments to continue.The Company has undertaken a process of either replacing or repairing the damaged equipment and WCP production capacity has now been restored at close to normal operating levels. The MSP sustained only minor damage  because of additional protection provided by the RUPS system  and returned to operations quickly. The Company is engaging with suppliers to rebuild normal spares inventories of variable speed drives.Kenmare is working to establish and mitigate the capital and operating cost impacts of the disruptions. Insurance cover is in place and Kenmare is liaising with its insurers to process claims in relation to the lightning strike.The Company will provide further updates in due course and expects to announce its 2022 Preliminary Results on 22 March 2023.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Michael StarkeInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

This 510(k) clearance reinforces Biocartis’ commitment to enable clinical molecular diagnostics in the U.S. Now  labs of all sizes can benefit from Idylla™’s high sensitivity  unmatched ease-of-use  and rapid turnaround times.MSI is the result of inactivation of the body’s so-called DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system  which normally spontaneously corrects errors that occur during DNA replication. In case this MMR system does not function properly  microsatellite instability occurs. MSI-High (MSI-H) is detected in approximately 15% of all colorectal cancers and 3% are associated with Lynch syndrome  whereas the other 12% have sporadic disease2. Lynch syndrome is the most common cause of hereditary colorectal cancer and is caused by inherited changes (mutations) in genes that affect DNA mismatch repair3.The Idylla™ MSI Test is cleared for in-vitro diagnostic use on the Biocartis Idylla™ System only. The Idylla™ MSI Test  for use on the Idylla™ System  uses formalin-fixed  paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections of human CRC tumor  from which nucleic acids are liberated  then analyzed using PCR amplification of seven monomorphic biomarkers (ACVR2A  BTBD7  DIDO1  MRE11  RYR3  SEC31A and SULF2) and subsequent melt-curve analysis. The Idylla™ MSI Test reports results as either microsatellite stable (MSS)  or microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) or invalid. Idylla™ MSI Test is indicated for use by healthcare professionals for the qualitative identification of microsatellite instability (MSI) in colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors  indicative of mismatch repair deficiency  as an aid in the identification of potential Lynch syndrome to help identify patients that would benefit from additional genetic testing to diagnose Lynch syndrome. The results from the Idylla™ MSI Test should be interpreted by healthcare professionals in conjunction with other clinical findings  family history  and other laboratory data. The Idylla™ MSI Test should not be used for diagnosis of CRC. The clinical performance of this device to guide treatment decision for MSI high patients has not been established.The Idylla™ MSI Test is a fully automated test  that provides information on the MSI status of CRC tumors within approximately 150 minutes from just one section of formalin-fixed  paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue  without the need for paired normal tissue sample.Commenting on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance Herman Verrelst  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis said: “This first US FDA 510(k) clearance of an oncology assay is a major milestone for the Company. Both large and small US labs are expected to benefit from this fast and easy to use Idylla™ MSI testing thanks to the fully automated sample-to-result nature of our platform. We can now start to commercialize our in-vitro diagnostic solution for clinical use  which will unlock significant additional market potential and pave the way for continued strong growth of our oncology business in the U.S. We continue to build momentum in our regulatory program and plan to submit more products to the U.S. FDA  also supported by our pharma partners.”--- END ---More information:e-mail: ir@biocartis.com@Biocartis_www.linkedin.com/BiocartisAbout BiocartisWith its revolutionary and proprietary Idylla™ platform  Biocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) aspires to enable personalized medicine for patients around the world through universal access to molecular testing  by making molecular testing actionable  convenient  fast and suitable for any lab.

No factor VIII inhibitors were observed in the 74 children enrolled in the study  of which 65 experienced at least 50 exposure days. Efanesoctocog alfa provided high sustained factor VIII levels throughout the weekly dosing interval with a median annualised bleeding rate (ABR) of 0.00 (interquartile range: 0.00-1.02) and an estimated mean ABR (95% confidence interval) of 0.89 (0.56-1.42).Haemophilia A is a rare  genetic disorder in which the ability of a person's blood to clot is impaired due to a lack of factor VIII. Haemophilia A occurs in about one in 5 000 male births annually  and more rarely in females. People with haemophilia can experience bleeding episodes that can cause pain  irreversible joint damage and life-threatening haemorrhages.Despite advancements in treatment made in recent years  a large unmet medical need still exists and requires further improvement in the standard of care. Efanesoctocog alfa is a new class of factor VIII replacement therapy decoupled of von Willebrand factor  providing high sustained factor activity levels with a once-weekly prophylactic treatment regimen.""These data confirm that efanesoctocog alfa has the potential to become a new standard of care for haemophilia A with higher protection for longer across treatment scenarios for all age groups "" said Anders Ullman  MD  PhD  Head of Research & Development and Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer at Sobi. ""We are excited to move ahead with regulatory submission in the EU and look forward to sharing these results at a future medical meeting.""Combined with the XTEND-1 phase 3 trial  these results will provide the basis for regulatory submission in the EU. Efanesoctocog alfa was granted orphan designation by the European Commission in June 2019 and the medicine was recently approved in the US.About XTEND-KidsXTEND-Kids is an open-label  non-randomised interventional  single-arm study. Participants received a weekly prophylactic dose of efanesoctocog alfa for 52 weeks. XTEND-Kids evaluates efficacy  safety and pharmacokinetics in 74 previously treated patients <12 years of age with severe haemophilia A.About efanesoctocog alfaEfanesoctocog alfa (formerly BIVV001) is a novel and investigational recombinant factor VIII therapy with the potential to deliver near-normal factor activity levels for a significant part of the week  extending bleed protection in a once-weekly dose for people with haemophilia A. Efanesoctocog alfa builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN® polypeptides to potentially extend its time in circulation. It is the only therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which is believed to impose a half-life limitation on current factor VIII therapies. It is approved as ALTUVIIIO [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein-ehtl] in the US.XTEN® is a registered trademark of Amunix Pharmaceuticals  Inc.About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialisation of Alprolix® and Elocta®/Eloctate®.

All markets within Industrial Systems contributed to the increased revenue  with a considerable increase in the poultry market share in particular. There was also a marked rise in the gross margin. However  the margin as a percentage of revenue fell because the price increases of raw materials and sea freight could not be passed on directly in the ongoing projects. Operating costs increased. Industrial Systems' operating result was €17.2 million  which is comparable to 2021 (€17.5 million).Hightech ComponentsAt €127 million  Hightech Components' revenue remained at the same level as in 2021. Revenue in the mobility market stabilised  while it increased in the health and food markets. Furthermore  production in Poland was phased out. Despite higher raw material prices  a better product mix led to a rise in the gross margin. Operating costs remained at the same level as in 2021. Hightech Components' operating result was markedly higher at €7.8 million compared to €7.0 million last year.Bart Aangenendt (CEO) on last year:""Looking back  we see that thanks to the commitment of our employees and the trust of shareholders and customers  Hydratec has enjoyed solid  consistent development over the past 25 years. It gives us reason to be proud of what we have achieved while offering confidence in the future.""A turbulent yearOur society is going through a turbulent period. In January last year  we left the last Covid-19 lockdown behind us and started out with renewed enthusiasm and ambition. But Russia unexpectedly invaded Ukraine in February  which plunged Europe into an international energy crisis  resulting in soaring gas and electricity prices. Supply chain issues arose again  which we had expected to be largely resolved. Inflation soared during the year to its highest point in decades. Wage costs rose  and fears of a recession grew.All these developments directly or indirectly affected our performance. Our revenue in Russia and Ukraine understandably collapsed  but our order books were well filled  which enabled us to compensate for this minor loss in other regions. However  orders were distributed differently across our markets compared to previous years. For instance  mobility got off to a promising start in 2022  but the market suffered a global chip shortage later in the year. The food market grew significantly due to the importance of chicken as a foodstuff and the need for the availability of water. The future still looks promising for health  although we have noticed that the speed of developments is determined by technical challenges to a significant extent. We are in a promising position to find solutions to those challenges in partnership with our customers.All in all  our revenue increased over the whole year  once again resulting in record revenue. Given the circumstances  that is a good result.Current societal and economic challenges also present opportunities: higher energy prices and shortages of materials and labour lead to a growing need for raw material savings and automation. Our focus on innovations to reduce waste encourages customers to choose our solutions.2022 Annual ReportHydratec Industries will publish its 2022 Annual Report after the close of trading on Thursday 16 March 2023. The audit has not yet been fully completed.Meeting of ShareholdersThis year's general meeting of shareholders will be held on Wednesday 17 May 2023 in Amersfoort.Proposed dividendEarnings per share in 2022 amounted to €12.31 (2021: €11.70). The proposal to the General Meeting of Shareholders is to set the dividend for the 2022 financial year at €6.00 per share. This dividend payment is in line with the policy of paying out at least 40% of the result after tax  excluding non-recurring income. The dividend will be paid out in cash. The net result after the dividend for 2022 will be added to the other reserves.Expectations for the 2023 financial yearHydratec got off to a good start in 2023. The market position of the companies  each in its own niche  is as strong as ever. As a result  we expect to pass on any continuing inflation  perhaps with a delay. Factors such as the situation in Ukraine continue to cause uncertainty. We do not expect any changes in our personnel  investment and financing policies in 2023. However  we will continue to critically examine activities that do not contribute enough. For instance  we plan to close the Hellevoetsluis site and relocate profitable operations to other locations.The order book is well-filled. In view of macroeconomic developments such as volatile exchange rates  trade restrictions  supply chain uncertainties and rising inflation  we do not consider it possible to make any concrete pronouncements about 2023.Bart AangenendtCEOHydratec Industries is listed on the Euronext Amsterdam NV stock exchange (ISIN NL0009391242  ticker: HYDRA.)",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.31,0.11,0.58,True,English,"['Hydratec Industries N', 'Record profit', 'higher raw material prices', ""Hightech Components' operating result"", 'higher energy prices', 'raw material savings', 'solid, consistent development', 'international energy crisis', 'Supply chain issues', 'global chip shortage', 'volatile exchange rates', 'supply chain uncertainties', 'last Covid-19 lockdown', ""Hightech Components' revenue"", 'Bart Aangenendt CEO', 'poultry market share', 'electricity prices', 'raw materials', 'Operating costs', 'last year', 'Key figures', 'Net result', 'Solvency ratio', 'Industrial Systems', 'considerable increase', 'price increases', 'sea freight', 'ongoing projects', 'same level', 'product mix', 'past 25 years', 'turbulent period', 'highest point', 'Wage costs', 'order books', 'minor loss', 'other regions', 'previous years', 'promising start', 'food market', 'significant extent', 'promising position', 'good result', 'Current societal', '2022 Annual Report', 'Thursday 16 March', 'Wednesday 17 May', 'non-recurring income', 'other reserves', 'good start', 'market position', 'financing policies', 'Hellevoetsluis site', 'profitable operations', 'other locations', 'trade restrictions', 'concrete pronouncements', 'gross margin', 'technical challenges', 'economic challenges', 'general meeting', 'continuing inflation', 'rising inflation', 'turbulent year', '2022 financial year', '2023 financial year', 'marked rise', 'mobility market', 'growing need', 'Hydratec Industries', '2021 Growth Revenue', 'record revenue', 'macroeconomic developments', 'markets', 'ROI', 'Earnings', 'percentage', 'health', 'production', 'Poland', 'commitment', 'employees', 'trust', 'shareholders', 'customers', 'reason', 'confidence', 'future', 'society', 'January', 'enthusiasm', 'ambition', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'Europe', 'gas', 'decades', 'fears', 'recession', 'performance', 'orders', 'instance', 'importance', 'chicken', 'foodstuff', 'availability', 'water', 'speed', 'solutions', 'partnership', 'circumstances', 'opportunities', 'shortages', 'labour', 'automation', 'focus', 'innovations', 'waste', 'close', 'trading', 'audit', 'Amersfoort', 'proposal', 'payment', 'line', 'policy', 'tax', 'cash', 'Expectations', 'companies', 'delay', 'Factors', 'situation', 'uncertainty', 'changes', 'personnel', 'investment', 'activities', 'view']",2023-03-02,2023-03-03,marketscreener.com

XTEND-Kids evaluates efficacy  safety and pharmacokinetics in 74 previously treated patients <12 years of age with severe haemophilia A.About efanesoctocog alfaEfanesoctocog alfa (formerly BIVV001) is a novel and investigational recombinant factor VIII therapy with the potential to deliver near-normal factor activity levels for a significant part of the week  extending bleed protection in a once-weekly dose for people with haemophilia A. Efanesoctocog alfa builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN® polypeptides to potentially extend its time in circulation.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are the third fastest growing therapeutic class in 2021  with a 14% increase in revenues representing USD 45.8 billionin 2021  with a 14% increase in revenues representing USD 45.8 billion First conclusive data reinforce Mithra's intent to acquire BCI Pharma's IP rights and finalize the acquisition option to develop new tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of endometriosis  female cancers and other diseases.Liege  Belgium  2 March 2023 - 7:30 CET - Mithra (Euronext Brussels: MITRA)  a company dedicated to Women's Health  today announces the first conclusive data of the preclinical studies conducted in partnership with BCI Pharma  an innovative bio-pharmaceutical company  on inhibitors of tyrosine kinases  a new development axis notably indicated in the treatment of many pathologies including endometriosis  oncology and inflammatory disorders. BCI Pharma owns a proprietary kinase technology platform and focuses on small molecule drug discovery.In November 2021  Mithra announced the diversification of its asset-based pipeline through a partnership with BCI Pharma. Mithra has already contributed to fund 450 000 EUR for the preclinical development to launch and confirm the therapeutic potential of innovative inhibitors of CSF-1R kinase. Primary focus is on endometriosis and cancer  while potentially also targeting orphan indications such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).The first preclinical data have demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity. The lead compound  a potent and selective inhibitor of CSF-1R  was well tolerated. Also  data have shown that it significantly modulated the tumor microenvironment  tumor-associated macrophages populations and significantly decreased tumor growth in the most widely used preclinical model in immuno-oncology. Additional preclinical studies are currently ongoing to demonstrate the potential for combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors in a range of tumor models.With regard to endometriosis  the use of a potent inhibitor of CSF-1R in a preclinical model resulted in promising findings as a treatment with the lead compound induced a lower number of endometriotic cysts  reduced pain and improved the overall well-being in animals with endometriosis.Finally  regarding the treatment of inflammation  additional preclinical data have shown an inhibitory effect on the production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and TNFα in a well-established model used as an in vivo screening for candidate compounds designed for the treatment of inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases  such as neurodegenerative diseases  multiple sclerosis or psoriasis  for example.Through consideration of its advanced asset-based pipeline  which includes the successfully launched Estelle®  the first Estetrol-based product oral contraceptive and Myring®  the vaginal contraceptive ring  as well as the recent advances to pave the way for the commercialisation of Donesta®  a novel product candidate for the treatment of post-menopausal symptoms  Mithra reinforces its interests to further pursue clinical development and accelerate the next acquisition steps of this partnership.Throughout this collaboration  Mithra intends to strengthen its leadership position in women's health with a new innovative development axis in a fast-growing market led by inhibitors of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) kinase. The innovative class of tyrosine kinases inhibitors represents the third fastest growing therapeutic class in 2021  with a 14% increase in revenues to USD 45.8 billion.Under the terms of the contract  Mithra has an option to acquire patents covering tyrosine kinases inhibitors series with upfront payment of EUR 2.25 million on execution of option  following the first results conducted by BCI Pharma. Mithra will fund the preclinical and clinical development with a focus on female cancers and endometriosis  while potentially targeting other orphan indications  such as metastatic breast cancer (TNBC).Dominique Surleraux  CEO at BCI Pharma said:""Receiving these first conclusive results are great! It's been 10 years since the founding of BCI Pharma and we're glad to kick off 2023 with such promising news. Partnering with Mithra  a major pharmaceutical company with solid experience in women's health  is a significant opportunity for both companies. As of today  this fruitful partnership generated a solid and broad intellectual property. The therapeutic potential showcased by these data reinforce our confidence in an upcoming partnership that should provide answers to therapeutic areas seeking new treatments solutions for cancer  endometriosis and fibrosis.""Graham Dixon  CSO Mithra Women's Health  commented: ""We're glad to say that these first conclusive data confirm that we are on the right track with BCI Pharma. These preclinical studies were fundamental to assess our interest in acquiring the patents relating to the development programs on innovative inhibitors of tyrosine kinase (CSF-1R). As demonstrated by these results  the therapeutic potential of tyrosine kinase is broad and promising. At this stage  we strongly believe this innovative development is an opportunity to fill therapeutic gaps on the market and be a response to unmet medical needs in the treatment of oncology  inflammatory conditions and endometriosis. We are looking forward to pursuing further clinical development and accelerate the next steps of this partnership that will strengthen our leadership position in women's health and beyond  as the IP acquired for this new innovation axis will consist in a composition of matter patents  which are the securest form of IP.""Leon Van Rompay  CEO Mithra Women's Health  said: ""We are very much enthused with the progress of this collaboration and the first conclusive data in therapeutic areas of high unmet need which should offer significant future partnering opportunities. Upon execution of the acquisition expected in the second quarter of 2023  Mithra R&D E4 asset-based activity will be complemented and strengthened with a novel  sound  and broad development platform based on tyrosine kinases inhibitors which have great interest within the life sciences industry.""",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.72,0.1,0.18,True,English,"['Mithra Pharmaceuticals S A', 'compelling initial preclinical data', 'novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors', 'research collaboration', 'BCI Pharma', 'third fastest growing therapeutic class', 'first Estetrol-based product oral contraceptive', 'small molecule drug discovery', 'proprietary kinase technology platform', 'triple negative breast cancer', 'new tyrosine kinase inhibitors', 'new innovative development axis', 'vaginal contraceptive ring', 'new development axis', 'novel product candidate', 'new treatments solutions', 'tumor-associated macrophages populations', 'colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor', 'first conclusive results', 'First conclusive data', 'next acquisition steps', 'promising anti-tumor activity', 'metastatic breast cancer', 'major pharmaceutical company', 'broad intellectual property', 'immune checkpoint inhibitors', 'advanced asset-based pipeline', 'first preclinical data', 'Additional preclinical studies', 'additional preclinical data', 'innovative bio-pharmaceutical company', 'other orphan indications', 'kinases inhibitors series', 'innovative class', 'growing market', 'CSO Mithra Women', 'first results', 'therapeutic areas', 'therapeutic potential', 'proprietary inhibitors', 'preclinical development', 'other diseases', 'candidate compounds', 'innovative inhibitors', 'promising findings', 'promising news', 'CSF-1R kinase', 'CSF-1R) kinase', 'broad potential', 'different pathologies', 'BCI Pharma', 'IP rights', 'female cancers', 'Euronext Brussels', 'many pathologies', 'selective inhibitor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor growth', 'tumor models', 'lower number', 'endometriotic cysts', 'overall well-being', 'inhibitory effect', 'proinflammatory cytokines', 'vivo screening', 'autoimmune diseases', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'multiple sclerosis', 'recent advances', 'post-menopausal symptoms', 'leadership position', 'upfront payment', 'Dominique Surleraux', 'significant opportunity', 'Graham Dixon', 'preclinical model', 'acquisition option', 'Primary focus', 'lead compound', 'potent inhibitor', 'solid experience', 'fruitful partnership', 'upcoming partnership', 'endometriosis', 'disorders', '14% increase', 'revenues', 'USD', 'intent', 'Liege', 'Belgium', '2 March', '7:30 CET', 'MITRA', 'Health', 'oncology', 'November', 'diversification', 'TNBC', 'combinations', 'range', 'regard', 'use', 'pain', 'animals', 'inflammation', 'production', 'IL-1β', 'TNFα', 'conditions', 'example', 'consideration', 'Estelle®', 'Myring®', 'way', 'commercialisation', 'Donesta®', 'interests', 'collaboration', 'terms', 'contract', 'patents', 'execution', 'CEO', '10 years', 'founding', 'companies', 'today', 'confidence', 'answers', 'fibrosis', '8', '45']",2023-03-02,2023-03-03,marketscreener.com

I thank all the teams for their dedication and together we look forward to 2023 with confidence  perfectly positioned to seize future growth opportunities.”Story continues€m except %Q4 2021 Q4 2022 Organicchange Reportedchange FY2021 FY2022 Organicchange Reported change Sales by region France 111 120 +9.1% +8.1% 341 414 +23.3% +21.3% EMEA4 90 105 +16.2% +16.8% 285 377 +31.1% +32.2% Americas 46 52 +2.6% +14.3% 143 184 +16.0% +29.3% APAC5 67 55 -19.6% -18.1% 270 231 -20.0% -14.4% Sales by Brand Sandro 154 165 +4.9% +7.1% 498 582 +13.3% +16.9% Maje 118 124 +3.1% +4.8% 407 467 +11.4% +14.8% Other brands6 42 43 +5.0% +4.5% 134 156 +17.9% +17.0% TOTAL 314 332 +4.2% +5.9% 1 039 1 206 +13.1% +16.1%SALES BREAKDOWN BY REGIONIn France  sales are up by +23% organic compared to 2021 and exceed 2019 level. This growth was driven exclusively by like-for-like  and mainly in physical stores (in Paris  thanks to local customers and tourists  but also in the rest of France). This performance is all the more impressive given that it includes a -5.5 points drop in the discount rate over the year. Digital sales are in line with 2021  with more qualitative sales thanks to a reduction in the number of promotional operations.The physical shop network optimization plan is coming to an end and the number of stores openings in France picked up in the fourth quarter with five net openings.The EMEA region recorded the strongest growth of the Group with an organic increase of 31% compared to 2021  driven by the largest markets such as the UK  Spain  Germany  Italy  and the Middle East. This performance was driven by brick & mortar as well as digital sales  which grew by +12% compared to 2021. The region is +9% ahead of 2019.The reduction of the discount rate is -3pts in 2022 and -12pts over two years. After some net POS closures in the first nine months of the year  the network regained growth momentum with eight net openings in the fourth quarter.In APAC  the Group recorded a -20% decline in organic sales vs 2021  mainly due to the sanitary situation in Mainland China. After a first part of the year heavily impacted by the COVID restrictions (stores and warehouse closures for long periods  and a drop in traffic)  the fourth quarter was strongly penalized by a spike in positive cases  following the lifting of the anti-COVID restrictions  and resulting in store closures (30% of the network closed or on reduced hours in December).Outside Mainland China  the region performed well  particularly in Australia with a fully reopened network  in Korea driven by strong local demand  and in Singapore and Malaysia which benefited from a return of tourists. The region continued to expand with four net openings over the year  to seize opportunities linked to the market recovery.In Americas  sales increased by +16% organically compared to 2021  driven entirely by like-for-like growth (+17%). Growth was homogeneous in all markets: United States  Canada and Mexico. Digital sales continued their excellent momentum (+21%).The pre-pandemic level was largely exceeded (+15% compared to 2019 in organic terms). The average discount rate fell by -5pts in 2022 and -17pts in two years. The region continued to expand with three net openings in the year.Unless stated otherwise  all figures used to analyze the performance are disclosed by taking into account the impact of the application of IFRS 16.KEY FIGURES (€m) 2021retreated 2022 Changeas reported Sales 1 038.6 1 205.8 +16.1% Adjusted EBITDA 245.7 266.6 +8.5% Adjusted EBIT 95.7 110.5 +15.4% Net Income Group Share 23.9 51.3 +114.4% EPS7 (€) 0.32 0.68 +113.1% Diluted EPS8 (€) 0.32 0.65 +102.0% FCF 69.8 34.3 -50.9%2022 CONSOLIDATED RESULTSAdjusted EBITDA increased by €21m from €246m in 2021 to €267m in 2022 (adjusted EBITDA margin of 22% of sales)  thanks to Sales growth  combined with a 0.8 point increase in management gross margin (74.4%) and continued rigorous cost management throughout the year.Improvement in gross margin was driven by a significant progress on our full price strategy  deliberately reducing the proportion of promotional sales (with a reduction in the discount rate of 4 points in 2022 and 9 points over two years).Total Opex (store costs9 and general and administrative expenses SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased by 0.8 point. The sanitary situation in China and inflation weigh on store costs  partly offset by better SG&A absorption. In addition  in the 2022 accounts  marketing traffic costs (0.8 point) were reclassified from SG&A to store costs.Depreciation  amortization  and provisions at -€156m in 2022  compared with -€150m in 2021. Excluding IFRS 16  depreciation and amortization slightly decreased in absolute value  and represent 4.1% of sales in 2022 (compared to 4.8% in 2021).As a result  adjusted EBIT increased by €15m  from €96m in 2021 to €111m in 2022. The adjusted EBIT margin is 9.2% in 2022 (in line with 2021)  a very satisfactory performance in the second half of the year  reaching 10.2%.Other non-current expenses went down to -€12m in 2022 (compared to -€26m in 2021) and consisted mainly of store impairments  with no cash impact.Despite the context  the Group has managed to reduce its financial expenses from -€27m in 2021 to -€24m in 2022 (including respectively -€12m and -11m€ of interests on lease liabilities) thanks to the reduction in the average debt outstanding.Income tax at -€17m in 2022 compared to -€12m in 2021  reflecting the growth of pre-tax income.Net income - Group share doubles in 2022 to reach €51m.2022 FREE CASH FLOW AND NET FINANCIAL DEBTThe Group generated €34m of free cash flow in 2022  with a good performance in the second half of the year (€29m).Working capital requirements increased from €134m in 2021 to €178m in 2022  due to an increase in inventories to accompany the growth of sales expected in 2023  combined to a restocking in China due to health constraints and to the impact of inflation. Working capital weight on total sales is 15% in 2022  compared with 13% in 2021 and 18% in 2020.At the same time  the Group maintained a strict control on its investments throughout the year  reaching €45m1 in 2022  nearly stable compared to 2021 (€43m) and better absorbed in terms of weight on sales by half a point.Net financial debt decreased by €25m  from €318m at 31 December 2021 to €293m at 31 December 2022. This decrease  combined with the improvement in adjusted EBITDA  results in a decrease in the net financial debt/EBITDA10 ratio from 2.5x at 31 December 2021 to 1.9x at 31 December 2022.FINANCIAL OUTLOOKFor the year 2023  SMCP expects a mid- to high-single digit sales growth compared to 2022. In terms of profitability  the Group aims to improve its adjusted EBIT margin (as a % of sales).The Group's mid-term financial ambitions are:- Mid- to high-single digit sales growth until 2026 and mid-single digit growth after 2026;- Continue to selectively grow the physical network  measured not only in terms of number of POS but also in terms of total selling surface;- Gross margin ratio at 75% by continuing the full-price strategy and optimizing inventories;- Better absorption of store costs and SG&A.This will allow SMCP group to target an adjusted EBIT margin of 12% by 2026  then growing by around 0.5 point per year for the following years.OTHER INFORMATIONClosing of the annual accountsThe Board of Directors met on March 1st to approve the consolidated accounts for the year 2022. The review procedures have been carried out by the statutory auditors and the related report is being issued.Evolution of the shareholder s’ situationThe Board of Directors of SMCP has taken note of GLAS’ communication dated March 1st  2023  according to which GLAS  acting as Trustee in respect of the bonds exchangeable for SMCP shares issued by European TopSoho S.à r.l. in 2018  has indicated that it is initiating a process to sell the 37% of the Company’s capital pledged in the context of the above-mentioned bond issue. The Company welcomes this first step  which could allow SMCP to regain a stable shareholding structure on which it could rely to pursue its development strategy. GLAS further indicated that the process should last several months and that it is not yet possible to assess whether it will trigger a mandatory takeover bid.The Board of Directors has entrusted the ad hoc Committee established in January 2022  composed of Ms. Orla Noonan  Mr. Xavier Véret and Mr. Christophe Cuvillier  all of whom are independent directors within the meaning of the Afep-MEDEF Code  with the task of monitoring developments in this process  while ensuring that the interests of the Company  its employees and all of its shareholders are strictly respected.The Company has appointed Rothschild & Co as financial advisor to assist in this process.Board compositionJean Loez was elected by the social and economic committee as a board member representing the employees to replace Marina Dithurbide.A conference call with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 9:00 a.m. (Paris time). Related slides will also be available on the website (www.smcp.com)  in the Finance section.FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSThe Group uses certain key financial and non-financial measures to analyze the performance of its business. The principal performance indicators used include the number of its points of sale  like-for-like sales growth  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin.Number of points of saleThe number of the Group’s points of sale comprises total retail points of sale open at the relevant date  which includes (i) directly-operated stores  including free-standing stores  concessions in department stores  affiliate-operated stores  factory outlets and online stores  and (ii) partnered retail points of sale.Organic sales growthOrganic sales growth refers to the performance of the Group at constant currency and scope  i.e. excluding the acquisition of Fursac.Like-for-like sales growthLike-for-like sales growth corresponds to retail sales from directly operated points of sale on a like-for-like basis in a given period compared with the same period in the previous year  expressed as a percentage change between the two periods. Like-for-like points of sale for a given period include all of the Group’s points of sale that were open at the beginning of the previous period and exclude points of sale closed during the period  including points of sale closed for renovation for more than one month  as well as points of sale that changed their activity (for example  Sandro points of sale changing from Sandro Femme to Sandro Homme or to a mixed Sandro Femme and Sandro Homme store).Like-for-like sales growth percentage is presented at constant exchange rates (sales for year N and year N-1 in foreign currencies are converted at the average N-1 rate  as presented in the annexes to the Group's consolidated financial statements as of December 31 for the year N in question).Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA marginAdjusted EBITDA is defined by the Group as operating income before depreciation  amortization  provisions and charges related to share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIP). Consequently  Adjusted EBITDA corresponds to EBITDA before charges related to LTIP.Adjusted EBITDA is not a standardized accounting measure that meets a single generally accepted definition. It must not be considered as a substitute for operating income  net income  cash flow from operating activities  or as a measure of liquidity.Adjusted EBITDA margin corresponds to adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales.Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT marginAdjusted EBIT is defined by the Group as earning before interests and taxes and charges related to share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIP). Consequently  Adjusted EBIT corresponds to EBIT before charges related to LTIP.Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT divided by net sales.Management Gross marginManagement gross margin corresponds to the sales after deducting rebates and cost of sales only. The accounting gross margin (as appearing in the accounts) corresponds to the sales after deducting the rebates  the cost of sales and the commissions paid to the department stores and affiliates.Retail MarginRetail margin corresponds to the management gross margin after taking into account the points of sale’s direct expenses such as rent  personnel costs  commissions paid to the department stores and other operating costs.The table below summarizes the reconciliation of the management gross margin and the retail margin with the accounting gross margin as included in the Group’s financial statements for the following periods:(€m) – excluding IFRS 16 2021 2022 Gross margin (as appearing in the account) 658.4 769.2 Readjustment of the commissions and other adjustments 106.3 128.3 Management Gross margin 764.7 897.5 Direct costs of point of sales -419.7 -514.5 Retail margin 345.1 383.0Net financial debtNet financial debt represents the net financial debt portion bearing interest.

No factor VIII inhibitors were observed in the 74 children enrolled in the study  of which 65 experienced at least 50 exposure days. Efanesoctocog alfa provided high sustained factor VIII levels throughout the weekly dosing interval with a median annualised bleeding rate (ABR) of 0.00 (interquartile range: 0.00-1.02) and an estimated mean ABR (95% confidence interval) of 0.89 (0.56-1.42).Haemophilia A is a rare  genetic disorder in which the ability of a person's blood to clot is impaired due to a lack of factor VIII. Haemophilia A occurs in about one in 5 000 male births annually  and more rarely in females. People with haemophilia can experience bleeding episodes that can cause pain  irreversible joint damage and life-threatening haemorrhages.Despite advancements in treatment made in recent years  a large unmet medical need still exists and requires further improvement in the standard of care. Efanesoctocog alfa is a new class of factor VIII replacement therapy decoupled of von Willebrand factor  providing high sustained factor activity levels with a once-weekly prophylactic treatment regimen.""These data confirm that efanesoctocog alfa has the potential to become a new standard of care for haemophilia A with higher protection for longer across treatment scenarios for all age groups "" said Anders Ullman  MD  PhD  Head of Research & Development and Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer at Sobi. ""We are excited to move ahead with regulatory submission in the EU and look forward to sharing these results at a future medical meeting.""Combined with the XTEND-1 phase 3 trial  these results will provide the basis for regulatory submission in the EU. Efanesoctocog alfa was granted orphan designation by the European Commission in June 2019 and the medicine was recently approved in the US.About XTEND-KidsXTEND-Kids is an open-label  non-randomised interventional  single-arm study. Participants received a weekly prophylactic dose of efanesoctocog alfa for 52 weeks. XTEND-Kids evaluates efficacy  safety and pharmacokinetics in 74 previously treated patients <12 years of age with severe haemophilia A.About efanesoctocog alfaEfanesoctocog alfa (formerly BIVV001) is a novel and investigational recombinant factor VIII therapy with the potential to deliver near-normal factor activity levels for a significant part of the week  extending bleed protection in a once-weekly dose for people with haemophilia A. Efanesoctocog alfa builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN® polypeptides to potentially extend its time in circulation. It is the only therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which is believed to impose a half-life limitation on current factor VIII therapies. It is approved as ALTUVIIIO [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein-ehtl] in the US.XTEN® is a registered trademark of Amunix Pharmaceuticals  Inc.About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialisation of Alprolix® and Elocta®/Eloctate®. The companies also collaborate on the development and commercialisation of efanesoctocog alfa. Sobi has final development and commercialisation rights in the Sobi territory (essentially Europe  North Africa  Russia and most Middle Eastern markets).

The acquisition enriches Ipsen’s Rare Disease portfolio  with promising therapeutics for pediatric and adult rare cholestatic-liver diseases  innovative pipeline potential  as well as scientific and commercial capabilities. Pursuant to the transaction  Ipsen acquires all the issued and outstanding shares at a price of $42.00 per share in cash plus one non-transferable contingent value right (CVR) of $10.00 per share.“The acquisition of Albireo will greatly strengthen our portfolio in rare diseases ” said David Loew  Chief Executive Officer of Ipsen. “I am excited to welcome new colleagues to Ipsen  who led the innovation on the development of novel bile acid modulators  like Bylvay  to treat rare liver diseases in children and adults. With Ipsen’s global presence  together we will be able to bring the full potential of the approved medicines to patients around the world.”Lead medicine  Bylvay  is a potent once-daily ileal bile acid transport inhibitor (IBATi) that received regulatory approvals in 2021 in the U.S. for the treatment of pruritus in patients three months of age and older with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) 1 and in the E.U. for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older.2In addition to the lead indication  Bylvay was accepted for Priority Review by the U.S. FDA for pediatric and adult Alagille syndrome (ALGS) in February 2023 with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of June 15  2023. A variation seeking authorization for ALGS was also submitted to the EMA in 2022  which has been validated for review. In a third indication  the rare pediatric cholestatic liver disease  biliary atresia (BA)  Bylvay is in late-stage development with the Phase III BOLD (Biliary atresia and the use of Odevixibat in treating Liver Disease) trial. This is the first  prospective  double-blind clinical trial in this patient population. Bylvay has orphan exclusivity for the approved indications in PFIC in the U.S. and E.U.  and orphan drug designations have been granted in both ALGS and BA indications in the U.S. and E.U.As part of the transaction  Ipsen has also acquired A3907 and A2342  two clinical-stage assets in Albireo’s pipeline. A3907 is a novel oral systemic apical sodium-dependent bile-acid transporter inhibitor currently in Phase II clinical development for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).3 A2342 is an oral systemic sodium-taurocholate co-transporting peptide (NTCP) inhibitor being evaluated for viral and cholestatic diseases in a Phase I trial.As of 2 March 2023  close of business  Albireo’s common stock will cease to be traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market and will be subsequently deregistered.ENDSAbout Bylvay® (odevixibat)Bylvay is a potent  non-systemic ileal bile-acid transport inhibitor (IBATi). It is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of pruritus in patients three months of age and older with PFIC1  where it has orphan exclusivity. Bylvay was launched in the U.S. in 2021  where it is supported by a program designed to assist with access to treatment and patient support. Bylvay is also approved in the E.U. for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older.2 It has launched in over nine countries and has secured public reimbursement across several major markets including Germany  Italy  the U.K.  France and Belgium.View full E.U. prescribing information here: Bylvay  INN-odevixibat (europa.eu)View full U.S. prescribing information here: label (fda.gov)About BOLDBOLD (NCT04336722) is a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bylvay (odevixibat) in children who have biliary atresia and have undergone a Kasai procedure before age three months. Children in the treatment arm receive Bylvay 120 μg/kg orally once daily for 24 months. The primary efficacy endpoint is improvement in the proportion of patients who are alive and have not undergone a liver transplant after two years of treatment compared to placebo  and secondary outcome measures include time to onset of any sentinel events  total bilirubin levels and sBA levels.About PFICPFIC is a spectrum4-7 of autosomal recessive genetic disorders in which cholestasis may lead to end-stage liver disease.8 The estimated global incidence of PFIC is 1 in 100 000 live births.8 Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 500 PFIC patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment. Subtypes PFIC1  PFIC2 and PFIC3 are the most common.8 In addition  other rare forms of PFIC exist with varying degrees of cholestasis.9 Patients with PFIC have impaired bile flow  or cholestasis  and the resulting bile build-up in liver cells causes liver disease and symptoms. The most debilitating symptom of PFIC is pruritus (itching)  which may be so severe that it leads to skin mutilation  loss of sleep  irritability  poor attention and impaired school performance.7 Up to 80% of PFIC patients suffer from severe pruritus  associated with abrasions  skin mutilation  hemorrhage or scarring.10About ALGSALGS is an inherited rare  genetic disorder that can affect multiple organ systems in the body including the liver  heart  skeleton  eyes and kidneys. Liver damage may result from having fewer than normal  narrowed or malformed bile ducts  which leads to toxic bile acid build-up  which in turn can cause scarring and progressive liver disease.11 Approximately 95% of patients with the condition present with chronic cholestasis  usually within the first three months of life and as many as 88% also present with severe  intractable pruritus.12 13 The estimated global incidence of ALGS is 3 in 100 000 live births.14 Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 1 300 patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment.About BABA is a rare pediatric liver disease. Symptoms typically develop about two to eight weeks after birth and there are no approved pharmacological therapies. Damaged or absent bile ducts outside the liver result in bile and bile acids being trapped inside the liver  quickly resulting in cirrhosis and liver failure requiring liver transplantation. At the time of diagnosis  a hepatic portoenterostomy (HPE) called Kasai procedure is performed to create a conduit allowing biliary drainage. The rate of success in re-establishing bile flow is dependent on the age of the infant when the HPE is performed. Kasai procedure is not curative and most patients who have BA have progressive disease  with at least 80% requiring liver transplantation by age 20 years.15 Of those who survive into the third decade after birth  almost all have portal hypertension or other complications of cirrhosis.16 New therapies are therefore needed to delay or avoid the need for liver transplantation following Kasai procedure.17 There are currently no approved pharmacological treatments for biliary atresia. There is an estimated incidence of 5-6 per 100 000 live births worldwide with BA.18 Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 750 patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment.About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

Sébastien Ladet  Chief Executive Officer of Affluent Medical  said: ""I truly thank all the shareholders  and especially our reference shareholder Truffle Capital  who demonstrated their confidence with their participation to this capital increase that contributed to its great success. The funds raised give us the resources to execute our business plan towards the next important 2023 clinical milestones for our three devices  to prepare the industrialization steps of KaliosTM and Artus for commercial launch at the end of 2025. When our products reach the market  millions of patients around the world will be able to benefit from these innovative therapeutic solutions  unparalleled on the market today. Our medical devices will promote a better quality of life for patients  significantly altered by their severe pathologies: heart mitral valve disease and severe urinary incontinence."" Results of the Capital Increase At the end of the subscription period that ended on February 27  2023  total demand amounted to 12 666 818 ABSARs  corresponding to approximately €17.1 million  i.e. an oversubscription rate of 131.5% before the extension clause was exercised: subscription orders made on an irreducible basis amounted to approximately €11.0 million  corresponding to 8 183 487 ABSARs and approximately 80.7% of ABSARs to be issued – They have been fully allocated;reducible subscription orders amounted to approximately €3.8 million  corresponding to 2 819 165 ABSARs and approximately 19.3% of ABSARs to be issued – They are allocated approximatively to €2.7 million;open subscriptions totaled €2.3 million  corresponding to 1 664 166 ABSARs (including the subscription commitments of the 10 investors who had irrevocably committed to subscribe for the Capital Increase  in a total amount of €2 060 000  the ABSARs that would not have been subscribed for at the end of the subscription period on an irreducible  reducible or open basis in order to carry out the Capital Increase at 100%). Given the high demand for subscriptions on an irreducible and reducible basis  the open subscriptions cannot be allocated. The Company thus decided to partially exercise the extension clause allowing for the creation of additional 512 428 ABSARs  and therefore the allocation of some of the subscriptions on a reducible basis. The gross amount of the Capital Increase is therefore €13 697 707.50 through the issue of 10 146 450 ABSARs at a unit subscription price of €1.35. The net proceeds of the Capital Increase (excluding the potential exercise of the redeemable warrants - BSARs)  in the amount of €12.9 million  will enable Affluent Medical to extend the Company's cash horizon to November 2023 and will be used to: initiate and potentially finalize patient enrollment for the Minerva pilot study of the Epygon transcatheter mitral valve replacement medical device and the development of associated ancillaries;finalize the enrollment of patients in the Optimise II clinical trial and the preparation of the industrialization of the Kalios TM medical device for mitral valve repair;finalize the validations of the Artus medical device for the treatment of moderate to severe urinary incontinence and the start of the Dry pilot study;repay the Group's financial debts (Bpifrance innovation loan  Bpifrance repayable advances for the Mivana project and various state-guaranteed loans). The settlement-delivery of the new shares and BSARs is scheduled for March 6  2023. The new shares and BSARs will be admitted to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris from March 6  2023. The new shares will be admitted on the same quotation line as existing shares under the ISIN code: FR0013333077  and BSARs will be admitted to a separate quotation line under the ISIN code: FR001400FL38. As a reminder  the BSARs may be exercised at any time until December 31  2025.(8) BSARs will give the right to subscribe for one (1) new share (the ""Exercise Ratio"")  subject to payment of an exercise price of: €1.50 between March 6  2023 and December 5  2023; then€1.95 between December 6  2023 and December 31  2025. If all of the BSARs are exercised at the respective prices of €1.50 and €1.95 per new share  the gross amount of the capital increase would reach €1.9 million and €2.5 million  respectively. New shares resulting from the exercise of BSARs will be subject to periodic requests for admission to trading on the Euronext Paris market on the same quotation line as the Company's existing shares under the same ISIN code FR0013333077. Company financing beyond November 2023 The Company will continue to face the challenge of its financing beyond November 2023  with an estimated net uncovered shortfall of €3.3 million at 12 months. Affluent Medical intends as a priority to remedy this shortfall by seeking new financing solutions  in particular through the implementation of a venture loan in the amount of €6 million  for which discussions have been initiated  through a capital increase depending on market conditions  or through non-dilutive financing within the framework of an innovation aid scheme in the form of subsidies and reimbursable advances aimed at financing clinical programs.

Find out more at www.benchmarkplc.com Management Report The Group delivered excellent performance in the first three months of the year translating into a 36% growth in revenue and 61% growth in Adjusted EBITDA excluding fair value movements from biological assets. Performance was good across all business areas  with each business area reporting improved revenues and Adjusted EBITDA excluding fair value movements from biological assets when compared to the same period last year. On a constant exchange rate basis  Group revenue and Adjusted EBITDA excluding fair value movements were up 29% and 56% respectively. Other operating costs were £11.8m  a 18% increase from the prior year (Q1 FY22: £9.9m) due to cost inflation and the impact of forex movements. By business area  operating costs increased more significantly in Genetics reflecting the investment in growth vectors including SPR shrimp  tilapia and salmon in Chile. R&D expenses for the Group of £1.6m were in line with the prior year. Total R&D investment including capitalised development costs was £1.6m (Q1 FY22: £2.3m)  reflecting commercialisation of SPR shrimp during the previous year for which costs are no longer capitalised. Adjusted EBITDA (excluding fair value movement from biological assets) was £12.1m (Q1 FY22: £7.5m) driven by higher revenues  increased asset utilisation and ongoing cost control. As a result  the Group achieved an Adjusted EBITDA margin (excluding fair value movement from biological assets) of 22% (Q1 FY22: 19%). Depreciation and amortisation increased 13% from the comparative period last year to £10.1m (Q1 FY22: £8.9m) as a result of investment in the businesses and £0.5m impairment of intangible assets in the Health business area which are no longer being utilised. Exceptional costs incurred in the period of £1.0m (Q1 FY22: £nil) related to costs associated with the listing on Euronext Growth Oslo and preparation for up-listing on the Oslo stock exchange. However  despite these increased costs  the Group reported only a small operating loss of £0.1m  a significant improvement from the £1.5m loss in Q1 FY22. Net finance income in the period was £0.2m (Q1 FY22: £2.2m expense)  with a £2.5m credit relating to the ineffectively hedged portion of the movement in the fair value of derivate instruments and a lower amortisation charge on capitalised borrowing fees of £0.1m (Q1 FY22: £0.3m charge) offsetting the increased interest charges (-£0.3m) following the refinancing exercise. The Group reported a small profit before tax of £0.1m (Q1 FY22: loss before tax £3.7m); the loss after tax for the period was £0.7m (Q1 FY22: loss after tax £5.1m). The Group's improved result translated in a significantly higher net operating cash inflow from operating activities for the period at £8.1m (Q1 FY22: inflow £1.1m). This was after an increase in working capital of £0.8m and tax payments of £1.5m in the period. Net cash used in investing activities was £2.2m (Q1 FY22: £2.6m) of which capex was £1.9m (Q1 FY22: £2.5m). Capex in the period related to investment in Genetics (£1.3m)  Nutrition (£0.4m) and in Health (£0.2m). Net cash inflow from financing activities was £2.2m  with net proceeds from the fundraise in December 2022 of £11.6m being offset by £4.4m repayment of debt  £0.6m of capitalised borrowing fees  £2.2m of interest paid and £2.2m of lease payments. Net increase in cash in the quarter was £8.1m to leave the period end cash position at £42.8m and liquidity of £62.8m. Advanced Nutrition Advanced Nutrition revenues were £22.7m  up 19% with sales higher in all product areas  also aided by favourable forex rates in the period (revenues increased at CER by 4%). By product area  sales of Artemia were +23%  Diets +10% and Health +27% higher than Q1 FY22. Q1 FY23 Adjusted EBITDA was £5.3m  up by 23% reflecting improved asset utilisation and ongoing cost discipline. Adjusted EBITDA margin was consistent at 23% (Q1 FY22: 23%). Notably  the Company's good performance in Advanced Nutrition was delivered against a backdrop of soft market conditions entering into FY23 affected by weather conditions in Thailand  Attachments Original LinkOriginal DocumentPermalink Disclaimer Benchmark Holdings plc published this content on 02 March 2023 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

As previousl…,Saint-Herblain (France)  March 2  2023 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today announced additional data from remaining clinical studies and an update on regulatory submissions for its inactivated COVID-19 vaccine  VLA2001. As previously announced  Valneva will not invest in further development of the vaccine  in the absence of a new partnership1. It is  however  completing remaining clinical studies and submissions as agreed with regulators.On February 23  2023  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a positive opinion for the use of VLA2001 in adults 18 to 50 years of age as a booster dose to be given at least seven months following primary vaccination (the second dose) with VLA2001 (homologous booster dose) or with an adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose).Valneva also provided an update on its pivotal Phase 3 Study COV-Compare (VLA2001-301). In this study  neutralizing antibodies on Day 208 (six months after the second dose of the primary vaccination with VLA2001) were non-inferior compared to the active comparator AZD1222  an adenoviral vector vaccine. The fold decline of neutralizing antibodies over six months after a second vaccination with VLA2001 was similar to the active comparator  and less pronounced than for other licensed COVID-19 vaccines2 3. The T-cell response against the spike protein elicited upon vaccination with VLA2001 was in the same range as for the active comparator. Moreover  T-cell reactivity against the nucleocapsid and membrane protein was induced upon vaccination with VLA2001.Additionally  results from VLA2001-304  a Phase 3 study in older adults  56 years of age and above  showed that VLA2001 was well tolerated by these participants when administered as a two-dose or three-dose immunization  thus confirming the previously reported favorable safety profile of VLA20014. In this age group  a two-dose vaccination with VLA2001 was inferior in terms of geometric mean titers and seroconversion rates compared to younger adults aged 30 years and above. After two doses  immunogenicity in older adults was at a level which could be correlated with 60-70% vaccine efficacy against ancestral SARS-CoV-25. A third dose of VLA2001 further increased immunogenicity in participants aged 56 years and above to the titers associated with vaccine efficacy of >90% against ancestral SARS-CoV-26 7.Finally  VLA2001’s shelf life was recently extended to 21 months compared to 18 months previously. The Company will continue to submit data to further extend it.About VLA2001VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which was upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).VLA2001 was the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe8 and the only whole virus  inactivated  COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom9 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates10 and Kingdom of Bahrain11. Valneva signed agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States and the Kingdom of Bahrain12. In August 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations for use of VLA200113. In light of current order levels and existing inventories  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine and is continuing discussions on the potential sale of some of the remaining inventory. VLA2001 currently has a 21-month shelf life and the Company will continue to submit data to further extend it.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases.

We have secured several important commercial wins this year  most recently with Petrobras and LLOG  showcasing the excellence of our innovative solutions.Finally  we delivered a strong set of results fully in line with our objectives  with an EBITDA of €715 million over the Full Year 2022  a positive Free Cash Flow of €185 million for the Second Half  both driven by a strong Fourth Quarter performance  enabling us to reduce Net Debt (a) (b). In 2023  which will be a key year in the New Vallourec plan  we expect to continue on this positive trajectory with a further increase in EBITDA  positive Free Cash Flow generation  and further reduction in Net Debt (a) (b).I am extremely proud to be at the helm of Vallourec to lead its transformation  and together with our committed employees  look forward to the coming year with confidence and enthusiasm.”KEY DATAin € million Q4 2022 Q4 2021 % change FY 2022 FY 2021 % change Tubes volume sold(thousand tonnes) 514 510 1% 1 804 1 640 10% Iron ore volume sold(million tonnes) 1.4 1.7 (13)% 4.0 8.1 (50)% Group Revenues 1 541 1 064 45% 4 883 3 442 42% Group EBITDA 312 136 +€176m 715 492 +€223m (as a % of revenue) 20.2% 12.8% +7.4p.p. 14.6% 14.3% +0.3p.p.

The increase in Group revenues reflects:1% volume increase mainly driven by Oil & Gas in North America31% price/mix effect(1)% Mine and Forest13% currency effect mainly related to weaker EUR/USD and EUR/BRLFor the Full Year  revenues totaled €4 883 million  up 42% year-on-year and by 28.5% at constant exchange rates. The increase in Group revenues reflects:9% volume increase mainly driven by Oil & Gas in North America and to a lesser extent in the Middle East25% price/mix effect(6)% Mine and Forest13% currency effect mainly related to weaker EUR/USD and EUR/BRLQ4 2022 Consolidated Results AnalysisIn the Fourth Quarter of 2022  EBITDA amounted to €312 million compared with €136 million in Q4 2021; the EBITDA margin reached 20.2% of revenues versus 12.8% in Q4 2021. For the Group  the EBITDA increase reflects:An industrial margin of €415 million  or 26.9% of revenues   versus €219 million or 20.6% of revenues in Q4 2021. The positive contribution of the Oil & Gas market in North America  both in prices and volumes  was partially offset by the negative impact of the lower mine and forest activity.Sales  general and administrative costs (SG&A) of € 8 9 million or 5.8% of revenue s   versus 7.8% in Q4 2021.Operating income was positive at €164 million  compared to €75 million in Q4 2021. In Q4 2022  the Group booked restructuring charges amounting to €56 million mainly related to restructuring measures in Germany and France  consultancy fees and dismantling costs in France  as well as impairment charges of €36 million  predominantly related to the German tube plants.Financial income was negative at €(60) million  compared with €(25) million in Q4 2021 driven by FX losses among others; net interest expenses in Q4 2022 stood at €(25) million compared to €(21) million in Q4 2021.Income tax amounted to €(9) million compared to €40 million in Q4 2021.This resulted in positive net income  Group share  of €78 million  compared to €89 million in Q4 2021.Full Year 2022 consolidated results analysisOver the Full Year 2022  EBITDA amounted to €715 million  a €223 million increase year-on-year  resulting in an EBITDA margin of 14.6%. The EBITDA increase reflects:An industrial margin of €1 076 million or 22% of revenues   up €239 million compared with FY 2021. The positive contribution of the Oil & Gas market in North America  both in prices and volumes  was partially offset by the negative impact of the temporary suspension of the mine operations.Sales  general and administrative costs (SG&A) of €349 million  or 7.2% of revenues  versus €316 million and 9.2% of revenues in FY 2021.Operating income was negative at €(122) million compared with €374 million in FY 2021  resulting mainly from provisions related to the adaptation measures (European social plans and associated fees) and  to a lesser extent  from provisions for non-recurring costs related to the iron ore mine incident.Financial income was negative at €(111) million  compared with €(236) million in FY 2021; net interest expenses in FY 2022 stood at €(95) million reflecting the new balance sheet structure.Income tax amounted to €(113) million mainly related to North America and Brazil.As a result  net income  Group share  amounted to €(366) million  compared to €40 million in FY 2021.RESULTS ANALYSIS BY SEGMENTTUBESIn Q4 2022  Tubes revenues were up 49% predominately due to higher prices. Tubes EBITDA increased from €86 million to €285 million driven by an increased EBITDA margin of 19.4%.For the Full Year 2022  Tubes revenues increased by 54% predominately due to higher prices. EBITDA rose significantly from €148 million to €638 million based on a 10% increase in volumes  coupled with a 40% increase in the average selling price per tonne.MINE AND FORESTIn Q4 2022  the iron ore mine production reached 1.4 million tonnes  compared to 1.7 million tonnes in Q4 2021. For the Full Year 2022  the mine produced 4.0 million tonnes  compared to 8.1 million tonnes over the Full Year 2021  significantly reduced as a consequence of the waste pile slippage incident at the beginning of 2022.Mine and Forest revenue in Q4 2022 reached €70 million  slightly down by 3% year-on-year. For the Full Year 2022  the Mine and Forest revenue amounted to €245 million  a 48% decrease compared to FY 2021.In Q4 2022  Mine and Forest EBITDA decreased from €41 million to €22 million due to lower volumes and lower prices reducing the EBITDA margin to 31%. For the Full Year 2022  Mine and Forest EBITDA decreased strongly from €358 million to only €113 million due to 50% lower volumes and lower prices.CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL POSITIONCash flow from operating activitiesIn Q4 2022  cash flow from operating activities improved to €161 million  compared to €10 million in Q4 2021; higher EBITDA and lower income tax cash-out more than offset the increase in restructuring cash-out and in financial interest paid.For the Full Year 2022  cash flow from operating activities was €330 million compared to €26 million in FY 2021. The improvement was predominantly related to increased EBITDA and lower income tax.Operating working capital requirementIn Q4 2022  the operating working capital requirement decreased by €183 million  versus a decrease of €61 million in Q4 2021. The net working capital requirement stood at 80 days of sales  compared to 84 days in Q4 2021.For the Full Year 2022  working capital increased by €355 million versus an increase of €172 million in FY 2021.CapexCapital expenditure was €78 million in Q4 2022  compared with €54 million in Q4 2021  and €191 million in FY 2022 compared to €138 million in FY 2021.Free cash floweAs a result  in Q4 2022 free cash flow was €266 million versus €17 million in Q4 2021 (a).Free cash flow for the Full Year of 2022 was negative at €(216) million  compared with negative €(284) million in FY 2021  after a €355 million working capital increase over the year. (a)Asset disposals and other itemsIn Q4 2022  asset disposals and other items amounted to €98 million  compared with €19 million in Q4 2021. These amounts reflected €45 million in non-cash items including accrued interest and fair value adjustments on debt. Additionally  these amounts reflected a €53 million change in cash items  including €26 million for disposal on assets and other items.Over the Full Year of 2022  asset disposals and other items amounted to €44 million.Net debt and liquidityAs of December 31  2022  net debt stood at €1 130 million  compared with €1 493 million on September 30  2022.

Operations were partially restarted in May using alternative waste piles  albeit at lower-than-normal capacity levels. Volumes sold in 2022 amounted to 4.0 million tonnes  slightly ahead of estimates given at the Q3 2022 results release.Permissions have been secured to continue using alternative waste piles until the beginning of Q2 2023. In parallel  the Group has finalized all civil works required to achieve a minimum safety factor and applied for its release. The solidity of the structure was confirmed during the rainy season.For Q1 2023  Vallourec estimates production of approximately 1.5 million tonnes. The release of the core waste pile and resumption of normal operations is expected at the beginning of Q2 2023.NEW VALLOUREC PLAN ON TRACK WITH NEW INITIATIVES ADDEDThe New Vallourec plan  announced in May 2022  remains fully on track. The plan aims to generate €230 million of recurring EBITDA uplift and around €20 million CAPEX reduction with the full impact starting in Q2 2024. It will contribute to making the Group cycle-proof and generating positive Free Cash Flow  before change in working capital  even at the bottom of the cycle. (a) fIn 2022 firm social agreements were secured in France  Germany  and the UK  substantially de-risking the plan and allowing our teams to focus on execution. Employees at the sites to be closed or downsized will begin to leave the company in Q1 of 2023 with the last wave of departures in 2024. The industrial CAPEX plan in Brazil is on track to ensure the full transfer of Oil & Gas volumes from Germany throughout the course of 2023.In February 2023 we signed a contract to sell our Mülheim site for €40 million (c). The sale process for our much larger site in Duesseldorf-Rath is ongoing. gMoreover  we are implementing New Vallourec initiatives in other geographies  including Brazil  as well as production increases in the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.In addition  a value-over-volume strategy incorporates portfolio rationalization to drive profitable growth. Vallourec aims to achieve best-in-class profitability levels and close the margin gap with peers over the cycle.OUTLOOK 2023Based on our market assumptions  as well as our progress throughout 2022  we are confident that 2023 will see a further significant enhancement in our financial results  with notably:An improvement in EBITDA  which will be driven by both our Tubes business and Mine and Forest businessAfter a positive Free Cash Flow generation in H2 2022  our ambition is to be also Free Cash Flow positive for the Full Year 2023. This is despite CAPEX of around 220 million euros and the expected one-time New Vallourec restructuring cash outflows of about 350 million euros (a) 7And we expect further Net Debt reduction in 2023 (b)hInformation and Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release includes forward-looking statements.

The XTEND-Kids phase 3 pivotal study evaluating the safety  efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ALTUVIIIO as once-weekly prophylaxis in previously treated patients <12 years of age with severe hemophilia A met its primary endpoint of safety  with no FVIII inhibitors detected in 74 children  with more than 50 children experiencing at least 50 exposure days  nearly a full year of treatment. The completion of XTEND-Kids represents the final milestone needed for regulatory submission in the EU.Karin Knobe  MD  PhDTherapeutic Area Head  Rare Diseases and Rare Blood Disorders  Sanofi“At Sanofi  we never settle. We work alongside patients  caregivers  and advocacy organizations to understand the needs of the hemophilia community and pursue first-in-class technologies to meet those needs. We strive for a future where every child with hemophilia can play without fear  travel free from a rigid treatment schedule  and pursue their dreams unencumbered by worry.”Hemophilia A is a rare  lifelong condition in which the ability of a person’s blood to clot properly is impaired  leading to excessive bleeds and spontaneous bleeds into joints that can result in joint damage and chronic pain  and potentially impact quality of life. The severity of hemophilia is determined by the level of clotting factor activity in a person’s blood  and there is a negative correlation between risk of bleeding and factor activity levels.ALUTVIIIO is a first-in-class  high-sustained FVIII therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine prophylaxis  on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes  and perioperative management of bleeding in adults and children in February 2023. Granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA in May 2022 – the first FVIII therapy to receive this designation—ALTUVIIIO also received Fast Track designation in February 2021 and Orphan Drug designation in 2017. The European Commission granted Orphan Drug designation in June 2019.About XTEND-KidsThe XTEND-Kids study (NCT04759131) was an open-label  non-randomized interventional study of the safety  efficacy  and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly ALTUVIIIO in previously treated patients younger than 12 years of age with severe hemophilia A. Patients received once-weekly ALTUVIIIO prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for 52 weeks which provided high-sustained FVIII levels throughout the weekly dosing interval with a median (IQR) annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of 0.00 (0.00  1.02) and an estimated mean (95% CI) ABR of 0.89 (0.56 ; 1.42). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of inhibitor development (baseline to 52 weeks). No inhibitors were detected in this study.About ALTUVIIIO™ALTUVIIIO [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein-ehtl] is a first-in-class high-sustained factor VIII therapy that is designed to extend protection from bleeds with once-weekly prophylactic dosing for adults and children with hemophilia A. ALTUVIIIO has a 3 to 4 fold longer half-life relative to standard and extended half-life factor VIII products  providing high-sustained factor activity levels throughout (≥40%) for most of the week and at 15% at the end of the dosing interval. ALTUVIIIO is the first factor VIII therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which imposes a half-life limitation on earlier generation factor VIII therapies. ALTUVIIIO builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN® polypeptides to extend its time in circulation. XTEN® is a registered trademark of Amunix Pharmaceuticals  Inc.About the XTEND Clinical ProgramsThe XTEND clinical program is comprised of two Phase 3 trials in hemophilia A: XTEND-1 in people 12 years or older and XTEND-Kids in children younger than 12 years old. There is also an ongoing extension study (XTEND-ed).The Phase 3 XTEND-1 study (NCT04161495) was an open-label  non-randomized interventional study assessing the safety  efficacy  and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly ALTUVIIIO in people 12 years of age or older (n=159) with severe hemophilia A who were previously treated with factor VIII replacement therapy. The study consisted of two parallel treatment arms — the prophylaxis Arm A (n=133)  in which patients who had received prior factor VIII prophylaxis were treated with once-weekly intravenous ALTUVIIIO prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for 52 weeks  and the on-demand Arm B (n=26)  in which patients who had received prior on-demand factor VIII therapy began with 26 weeks of on-demand ALTUVIIIO (50 IU/kg)  then switched to once-weekly prophylaxis with ALTUVIIIO (50 IU/kg) for an additional 26 weeks.The primary efficacy endpoint of XTEND-1 was the mean annualized bleeding rate (ABR) in Arm A  and the key secondary endpoint was an intra-patient comparison of ABR during the ALTUVIIIO weekly prophylaxis treatment period versus the prior factor VIII prophylaxis ABR for a subset of participants in Arm A who had participated in a previous observational study (Study 242HA201/OBS16221).The XTEND-Kids study (NCT04759131) was an open-label  non-randomized interventional study of the safety  efficacy  and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly ALTUVIIIO in previously treated patients younger than 12 years of age with severe hemophilia A. Patients received once-weekly ALTUVIIIO prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for 52 weeks.

Big Apple takes bite out of Irish market with CRH and Flutter moves,North America accounted for three-quarters of the group’s $5.6 billion (€5.3 billion) of earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) last year. The hope is that CRH will benefit from how US stocks typically trade at a premium ,CRH is moving its primary listing to the US and it looks like Flutter will follow. What does this mean for the Irish market? Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty ImagesThe reaction among investors was unambiguous and swift when CRH  the largest company on the Iseq  revealed on Thursday it plans to move its primary stock listing to the US and accelerate its share buyback programme. Its stock jumped as much as 11.7 per cent during the day  adding €3.89 billion to its market value.Few would have been happier than 4 per cent-shareholder  Swedish activist investor Cevian Capital  which first disclosed it had built up a stake in 2019 and has been pressing ever since for the company to reach its “full potential”. (CRH’s shares have almost doubled since Cevian made its presence on the shareholder register known.)CRH has been laying the groundwork for a US listing for some time  having moved from reporting figures in euros to dollars three years ago  given the world’s largest economy  where it is the biggest roadbuilder  had become its main source of profits. North America accounted for three-quarters of the group’s $5.6 billion (€5.3 billion) of earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) last year.The hope is that CRH will benefit from how US stocks typically trade at a premium  relative to earnings  to their European peers.READ MOREWill the protocol deal bring prosperity to Northern Ireland? Listen | 44:30Thursday’s stock jump doesn’t even begin to close the gap  Ian Hunter  an analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald Ireland  said in a note to clients on Friday  noting that with the company trading at an enterprise value of 7.9 times ebitda  it is still changing hands at a 26 per cent discount to peers  who are predominantly based in the US.“We believe that given its current positioning in the market  growth prospects and balance sheet strength  it should at least trade at or close to parity ” he said.CRH group chief executive Albert Manifold has also pitched to investors that a US listing would help the group to capitalise on massive US infrastructure funding and subsidies initiatives – under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  the CHIPS and Science Act  and the Inflation Reduction Act that have been signed into law by president Joe Biden in the past 16 months.CRH isn’t alone. Flutter Entertainment  the owner of Paddy Power and Betfair  said in the middle of last month that it was looking at taking on a US stock market quotation. The expectation is that it will eventually move its main listing there – enabling it  like CRH  to chase the prize of being included in influential US stock indices.The huge success of FanDuel  the fast-growing US fantasy sports website in which Flutter accumulated a 95 per cent stake since the country’s supreme court moved in May 2018 to strike down a federal law banning the commercial sports betting  is gradually pulling Flutter’s centre of gravity across the Atlantic. The US accounted for a third of total revenues last year of £7.7 billion (€8.6 billion).Flutter Entertainment  the owner of the Paddy Power and Betfair  said in the middle of last month that it was looking at taking on a US stock market quotation. Photograph: Michael Stephens/PA WireBoth CRH and Flutter  led by chief executive Peter Jackson  seem happy to shrug off the cautionary tale offered by Fyffes spin-off Total Produce. It ditched its Irish listing in mid-2021 in favour of the Big Apple as it merged with Dole Foods to create Dole plc  only to see its stock slump 40 per cent by the end of last year.CRH  formed in 1970 through the merger of the already publicly quoted Irish Cement and Roadstone companies  had already moved its primary listing to London in late 2011. The merger of Paddy Power with Betfair in early 2016 saw the combined entity also opt for the UK capital for its main listing (before the corporate name change to Flutter).Both CRH and Flutter plan to keep their headquarters and tax residency in Ireland. And stockbrokers in Dublin are clinging to hopes that both companies will also keep their secondary listings here. Dublin  they argue  has become a more important hub for European investors to trade the stock since Brexit.But the developments raise further questions about the future of the Euronext Dublin cash equities market.A triple whammy over the past two decades of Irish pension funds being pressed to lower their exposure to Irish equities  foreign takeovers of the main local investment players  and a shift by the industry from active stock-picking to passive investment  has conspired to make initial public offerings (IPOs) less attractive.Only three companies – Uniphar  Corre Energy  and HealthBeacon – have floated in Dublin in the past four years. The further diminution of the Irish market by the moves by CRH and Flutter is hardly encouraging.Keeping companies on the market has been even more difficult. Green Reit  Hibernia Reit  CPL Resources  Applegreen and Yew Grove have been acquired off the market in the past four years. Aryzta and Tullow Oil have scrapped their local listings.Who else might have their eyes on the attractions of Wall Street? Glanbia  the purveyor of protein shakes and bars through the Optimum Nutrition and SlimFast brands  has to be top of the list  having said this week that it is changing the currency in which it reports its figures to dollars. Some 82 per cent of its revenues were generated in the US last year.[ Glanbia’s Optimum Nutrition becomes company’s first billion dollar brand ]Kerry Group  which had been plotting moving its main listing to New York when it was in talks in late 2019 to buy a US nutrition business  currently generates almost 40 per cent of its sales in that market.It hasn’t been missed that Albert Manifold and Peter Jackson have been the two best paid Iseq CEOs in recent times and each has seen his remuneration receive push-back from shareholder advisory firms in the past. This will be less of issue when the companies are trading on Wall Street.It might be too late for Manifold  who received a record €13.9 million package for an Iseq company in 2021 and is on track to see his contact come to an end next year when he reaches 62. Not so for his successor.[ How Ireland’s top CEOs were paid in 2021 as their salaries soared by 27% ],neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,mixed,0.35,0.14,0.51,True,English,"['Big Apple', 'Irish market', 'bite', 'CRH', 'Flutter', 'CRH group chief executive Albert Manifold', 'growing US fantasy sports website', 'chief executive Peter Jackson', 'Euronext Dublin cash equities market', 'massive US infrastructure funding', 'influential US stock indices', 'main local investment players', 'US stock market quotation', 'commercial sports betting', 'share buyback programme', 'Swedish activist investor', 'balance sheet strength', 'president Joe Biden', 'initial public offerings', 'past two decades', 'past four years', '26 per cent discount', 'Michael M Santiago', 'Inflation Reduction Act', 'Irish pension funds', 'Cantor Fitzgerald Ireland', '95 per cent stake', 'primary stock listing', 'Infrastructure Investment', 'Irish equities', 'US listing', 'past 16 months', '4 per cent-shareholder', 'US stocks', 'The US', 'passive investment', 'main listing', 'Irish market', 'main source', 'stock jump', 'Michael Stephens', 'primary listing', 'market value', 'Jobs Act', 'Science Act', 'Irish listing', 'Irish Cement', 'Getty Images', 'full potential', 'shareholder register', 'reporting figures', 'largest economy', 'biggest roadbuilder', 'North America', 'protocol deal', 'Northern Ireland', 'Ian Hunter', 'enterprise value', 'current positioning', 'growth prospects', 'subsidies initiatives', 'Paddy Power', 'last month', 'huge success', 'supreme court', 'total revenues', 'PA Wire', 'cautionary tale', 'Fyffes spin-off', 'Total Produce', 'Big Apple', 'Dole Foods', 'Dole plc', 'last year', 'combined entity', 'UK capital', 'corporate name', 'secondary listings', 'important hub', 'triple whammy', 'foreign takeovers', 'active stock-picking', 'Corre Energy', 'Green Reit', 'Hibernia Reit', 'CPL Resources', 'Yew Grove', 'Tullow Oil', 'Cevian Capital', 'European peers', 'federal law', 'Roadstone companies', 'tax residency', 'three companies', 'largest company', 'European investors', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Photograph', 'reaction', 'Iseq', 'Thursday', 'shares', 'presence', 'groundwork', 'time', 'euros', 'dollars', 'world', 'profits', 'three-quarters', 'earnings', 'interest', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'ebitda', 'hope', 'premium', 'READ', 'prosperity', 'Listen', 'gap', 'analyst', 'note', 'clients', 'Friday', 'hands', 'parity', 'CHIPS', 'owner', 'Betfair', 'middle', 'expectation', 'prize', 'FanDuel', 'country', 'May', 'centre', 'gravity', 'Atlantic', 'third', 'favour', 'end', 'merger', 'London', 'headquarters', 'stockbrokers', 'Brexit', 'developments', 'questions', 'future', 'exposure', 'shift', 'industry', 'IPOs', 'Uniphar', 'HealthBeacon', 'diminution', 'moves', 'Applegreen', 'Aryzta', '7']",2023-03-03,2023-03-03,irishtimes.com
