The previous deadline was January 7  which  Gabunia said  gave investors an “extremely short” time period for filing the necessary documents.“The last information from [EU authorities] was that the opportunity to file has been extended until the end of July. All the big investors with many  many individuals behind them who have applied have not yet received an answer ” Gabunia noted.European regulators authorized the release of “certain frozen funds and economic resources” that belong to Russian investors by granting a general license to Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD) at the end of December. The assets in question are held at Belgium’s Euroclear and Luxemburg’s Clearstream clearing houses.Both ceased transactions with NSD's accounts on February 28  shortly after the start of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine  and on June 3  blocked the NSD's accounts following its inclusion on the Ukraine-related EU sanctions list.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,negative,0.01,0.49,0.5,negative,0.0,0.06,0.94,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'EU', 'deadline', 'Ukraine-related EU sanctions list', 'respective clearing systems', 'short” time period', 'National Settlement Depository', 'Clearstream clearing houses', 'certain frozen funds', 'sanctioned Russian investors', 'Russian Banks', 'Non-sanctioned investors', 'Deputy Chairman', 'last information', 'big investors', 'economic resources', 'general license', 'military operation', 'business section', 'Russian assets', 'previous deadline', 'necessary documents', 'many individuals', 'European regulators', 'Philipp Gabunia', 'end', 'July', 'Belgium', 'Luxembourg', 'filing', 'meeting', 'Association', 'Friday', 'release', 'January', 'opportunity', 'answer', 'NSD', 'December', 'question', 'Euroclear', 'Luxemburg', 'transactions', 'accounts', 'February', 'start', 'June', 'inclusion', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-03-03,2023-03-04,rt.com

Matters to be resolved at the Bittium Corporation Annual General Meeting 2023 Agenda items 7 to 17 cover proposals of the Board of Directors of Bittium Corporation or the three largest shareholders of Bittium Corporation to the Annual General Meeting in accordance with the notice of the Meeting. In addition  the item 9 includes resolution on the discharge from liability of the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO. ""Abstain from voting"" means casting an empty vote  in which case the shares are considered to be represented in the item  which is relevant e.g.  in resolutions requiring a qualified majority (e.g. agenda items 16 and 17). In qualified majority items all shares represented at the Meeting are taken into account and abstaining from voting thus has the same effect as votes Against/No. Abstaining from voting therefore affects the voting result. Shareholders should be aware of this  especially if casting a vote against is not their intention. Advance votes ""Against"" the proposals cannot be cast in items 12  13 and 15  where it is not possible to oppose the proposal without making a counterproposal.

However  the Company together with its subsidiaries  cannot at any moment own and/or hold as pledge more than 10 percent of all the shares in the Company.The Company's own Series A shares may be purchased based on the authorization only by using non-restricted equity  which consequently reduces the amount of the funds available for distribution of profits. The Company's own Series A shares may be purchased for a price quoted in public trading on the purchase day or for a price otherwise determined by the market.The shares may be purchased under the proposed authorization to develop the capital structure of the Company.

He also pointed out that the global reshuffling of economic gravity is providing an opportunity for the UAE to position itself as a key player in the global value chain. Furthermore  the rise of protectionism around the world  accelerated by the pandemic  is expected to cost around $3 trillion by 2025 to the global economy. To avoid the negative impact of these trends  the UAE is redefining supply chains and forging new partnerships.He added that in 2021  the UAE achieved a remarkable 17% growth in trade figures  reaching a total of Dhs2.3 trillion. The country also established three new trade agreements with partners  in addition to existing agreements within the Arab world. Furthermore  Dr Al Zeyoudi emphasized the UAE’s commitment to sustainability  stating that 25% of all power in the country comes from clean energy sources  and 75% is considered one of the cleanest conventional sources of energy. Dr Al Zeyoudi expressed his trust and confidence in the UAE’s ability to continue attracting investments and achieving strong trade growth in the coming year.Meanwhile  Samaila Zubairu  CEO of the Africa Finance Corporation  highlighted the growth of the electric mobility market to $50 billion by 2050  and the need for 2.5 million tonnes of minerals and metals for electric vehicles and batteries  many of which are located in Africa. He emphasised the need to improve processing and bring voluntary carbon markets to life during COP28  and encouraged companies to participate in achieving net zero targets.Chris Cox  Global Head of Trade and Working Capital Solutions at Citi  spoke about the challenges of the global supply chain  and emphasized the importance of digitization and logistics incentives  as trade remains fragmented. Cox also highlighted the significant growth in supply chain financing solutions. Cox mentioned the importance of supporting SMEs through development agencies focused on sustainability  and Citi’s commitment to increasing the pool of capital available to them.According to James Zhan  Senior Director of Investment and Enterprise at UNCTAD  global trade can be harnessed for sustainable growth through investment. Despite the recent trends of slowbalization and fraglobalization  there is still demand for climate transformation and rapid growth in financing. Policy-driven investment  such as the EU’s $300 billion investment and the US’s efforts in Africa  is driving things forward.Separately  global experts discussed  in a session titled “Growth Opportunities in Times of Decarbonization”  diversification and innovation  economic growth and job creation for a healthier climate  at the Investopia Conference 2023.The discussion led by Mrs. Lieve Mostrey  Chairperson and CEO  Euroclear; and Sanjeev Gupta  Executive Chairman  GFG Alliance  touched upon how transition to net-zero emissions will be slow due to fast-growing emerging markets. The challenge of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 is a topic of great importance leading up to COP28. The discussion often focuses on what this means for consumers and industries  but it is equally important to consider how we can accelerate the pace of decarbonization.The panellists as well focused on the key challenge in finding ways to clean up production processes for industries like steel and aluminium. There is currently a lot of investment in hydrogen  particularly in the building sector.During the panel discussion  Lieve Mostrey highlighted that Euroclear is a financial market infrastructure with 36T EUR worth of securities on their books and annual transactions over a quadrillion Euros  which connects people and companies in need of funding with international investors. They are able to accelerate foreign direct investment at a cheaper cost and provide ESG data to investment funds to support investments in the ESG space. Mostrey pointed out that Euroclear can contribute to funding cycles that accelerate the transition and facilitate between western and developing markets  especially green issuance  in a leaner  more certain  and safer way. This can help address the needs of developing countries  including the need for a $100 billion lost and damage fund to accelerate the transition  particularly in Africa.Sanjeev Gupta discussed the challenges in the steel industry due to its high carbon emissions. With India’s population continuing to grow  there will be an explosion of demand for steel  further adding to global emissions. Gupta emphasised the need for a solution  such as shifting from coal to natural gas and hydrogen.In conclusion  Lieve Mostrey and Sanjeev Gupta expressed their commitment to contributing to the decarbonization efforts required for a sustainable future.,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,mixed,0.38,0.3,0.31,True,English,"['Investopia conference', 'UAE', 'commitment', 'sustainability', 'Dr Thani Al Zeyoudi', 'session moderator Maria Ramos', 'supply chain financing solutions', 'three new trade agreements', 'Dr Al Zeyoudi', 'cleanest conventional sources', 'net zero targets', 'financial market infrastructure', '36T EUR worth', 'Working Capital Solutions', 'global value chain', 'global supply chain', 'electric mobility market', 'growing emerging markets', 'clean energy sources', 'Africa Finance Corporation', 'Mrs. Lieve Mostrey', 'foreign direct investment', 'strong trade growth', 'supply chains', 'new partnerships', 'existing agreements', 'electric vehicles', 'Foreign Trade', 'carbon markets', 'developing markets', 'Global Head', 'global reshuffling', 'global economy', 'global experts', 'global trade', 'Investopia Conference', 'Abu Dhabi', 'industry leaders', '2-3 March', 'Samaila Zubairu', 'James Zhan', 'Senior Director', 'economic gravity', 'key player', 'negative impact', 'coming year', '2.5 million tonnes', 'logistics incentives', 'development agencies', 'climate transformation', 'job creation', 'healthier climate', 'Sanjeev Gupta', 'Executive Chairman', 'GFG Alliance', 'net-zero emissions', 'production processes', 'building sector', 'annual transactions', 'quadrillion Euros', 'international investors', 'cheaper cost', 'ESG data', 'ESG space', 'green issuance', 'safer way', 'developing countries', 'damage fund', 'trade figures', 'year growth', 'remarkable 17% growth', 'significant growth', 'sustainable growth', 'rapid growth', 'Growth Opportunities', 'economic growth', 'Chris Cox', 'recent trends', 'key challenge', 'funding cycles', 'Policy-driven investment', 'investment funds', 'Arab world', 'great importance', 'panel discussion', '$300 billion investment', '$100 billion', 'UAE', 'role', 'Borders', 'Power', 'Minister', 'State', 'Citi', 'President', 'CEO', 'Enterprise', 'UNCTAD', 'question', 'country', 'opportunity', 'protectionism', 'pandemic', 'total', 'Dhs', 'addition', 'commitment', 'sustainability', 'trust', 'confidence', 'investments', 'need', 'minerals', 'metals', 'batteries', 'processing', 'voluntary', 'life', 'COP28', 'companies', 'challenges', 'digitization', 'SMEs', 'pool', 'slowbalization', 'fraglobalization', 'demand', 'efforts', 'things', 'Times', 'Decarbonization', 'diversification', 'innovation', 'Chairperson', 'Euroclear', 'transition', 'topic', 'consumers', 'industries', 'panellists', 'ways', 'steel', 'aluminium', 'lot', 'hydrogen', 'securities', 'books', 'people', 'western', 'certain', '2050']",2023-03-04,2023-03-04,gulftoday.ae

The new article 4a will be worded as follows:“The Board of Directors is authorised to increase the share capital by issuing new shares in one or more tranches with pre-emption rights for the Company’s existing shareholders and at a total nominal value of up to DKK 100 000 000  subject  however  to paragraph 3. The new shares must be paid in cash. The authorisation shall apply for the period until and including 29 March 2028.Further  the Board of Directors is authorised to increase the share capital by issuing new shares in one or more tranches without pre-emption rights for the Company’s existing shareholders and at a total nominal value of up to DKK 100 000 000  subject  however  to paragraph 3  provided that the increase takes place at market value. The new shares may be paid in cash or by contribution of assets other than cash. The authorisation shall apply for the period until and including 29 March 2028.The authorisations of the Board of Directors pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 apply to a total issue of new shares at an aggregate nominal value not exceeding DKK 100 000 000.In the case of a share capital increase pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2  the new shares shall be issued in the name of the holder and be paid in full. The shares shall be negotiable and shall in all other respects bear the same rights as the existing shares  for example in terms of redeemability and restrictions on negotiability. The new shares shall entitle the holder to dividend from the time decided by the Board of Directors  however  not later than as from the financial year following the increase. The Board of Directors shall decide the terms and conditions for increases of the share capital that are implemented in accordance with the authorizations in paragraphs 1 and 2.”The proposed amendments to the articles of association is available on the company’s website  www.flsmidth.com.8.2 – Treasury sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that it be authorized until the next Annual General Meeting to let the company acquire treasury shares equivalent to a total of 10% of the company’s share capital at the time of the authorization  provided that the company’s total holding of treasury shares at no point exceeds 10% of the company’s share capital. The consideration must not deviate by more than 10% from the official price quoted on Nasdaq Copenhagen at the time of acquisition.Shareholder Proposal (AkademikerPension and LD Fonde)Shareholder  AkademikerPension and LD Fonde  proposes that the Board of Directors shall communicate the company’s efforts to respect human rights and labour rights in accordance with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs)  and in alignment with the forthcoming Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  the company shall perform and publish a double materiality assessment identifying which  if any  human rights related financial risks the company has identified  and how it seeks to address these. The disclosed information shall be updated and published at least once a year at reasonable cost  omitting proprietary information. The disclosed information shall be made public before the Annual General Meeting notice starting in 2024 and may be included in the existing reporting suite.The proposing shareholder’s full motivation for the proposal:The pressure on companies to demonstrate respect for human rights is increasing as the link between long-term value creation and a prudent approach to human rights risks is becoming more and more established.It is therefore increasingly important for companies and investors alike that companies demonstrate that they understand and navigate the business opportunities and risks related to the corporate duty to respect human rights and labour rights throughout the entire value chain. Failure to do so may leave the company vulnerable to operational disruptions  litigation risk and increased scrutiny by supervisory authorities as well as reputational risk and loss of license to operate in eyes of customers  employees  investors  and business partners.The corporate duty to respect human rights is derived from the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs)  adopted in 2011. The UNGPs have set out the international standard of practice for companies to respect international human rights (including labour rights) by identifying  preventing  mitigating  remedying  and accounting for human rights impacts associated with their business activities – commonly known as human rights due diligence. Companies that are operationg (directly or through the value chain) in conflict-affected areas are  furthermore  expected to perform heightened human rights due diligence in light of the increased risk of human rights violations in these areas.Though a soft law requirement under international law  the corporate duty to respect human rights has been an expectation of companies since the UNGPs was adopted in 2011. This is particularly the case for companies that publicly subscribe to these international norms.The expectation has in recent years been underlined by the European Union’s introduction of a range of regulatory initiatives which  in different ways  seek to address the impacts that businesses have on human rights and labour rights. Two of the main developments in this area are the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)  which includes a mandatory due diligence obligation with respect to human rights  and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  which concerns disclosures on a range of sustainability matters including human rights from a double materiality perspective. The EU regulatory initiatives are largely based on the corporate duty to respect human rights as described in the UNGPs  though the human rights due diligence requirement under the UNGPs will likely be more comprehensive than the national implementation of the EU directive.Though the corporate duty to respect human rights has been long-established  studies show that companies have not taken the necessary steps to demonstrate sufficient implementation of human rights due diligence processes in their operations. The Danish Institute for Human Rights (DIHR) has examined the public reporting of a number of large Danish companies and provided an analysis of the human rights policies and disclosed human rights due diligence practices of these companies in 2020  and again in 2022. The analyses indicate that more progress needs to be made in this are. This is also the case for FLSmidth.FLSmidth is a signatory to the UN Global Compact and has committed to respecting human rights in line with the UNGPs. This includes identifying  mitigating  and remedying adverse impacts in the entire value chain  both on the supply side and on the customer side. Given that FLSmidth through its business partners operate in conflict-affected geographic territories and depend on sectors with a high risk of adverse impacts on human rights  it is important that the company can account for the necessary due diligence processes applied to handle these risks.Furthermore  FLSmidth already employs and discloses a well-developed risk management process and identifies several risk topics that are potentially related to human rights risks  such as supply chain  compliance  geo-politics  safety  sustainability  and attracting and retaining employees  but currently with no or limited connection to this in its human rights disclosures and sustainability report.By strengthening its ability to document its human rights due diligence and risk management processes  FLSmidth would stand to benefit. Not by pre-empting the regulatory requirements in the EU legislation  but by staying ahead of the curve in order to gain a competitive advantage.The Board of Directors’ positionThe Board of Directors has had a good and constructive dialogue with AkademikerPension and LD Fonde about the precise wording of the proposal and the Board of Directors supports the proposal.Any other businessAdoption requirementsThe proposal set forth in item 8.1 of the agenda must be adopted by at least 2/3 of both the votes cast and of the share capital represented at the general meeting. The remaining proposals on the agenda can be adopted by a simple majority of votes.

Today  our teams’ mobilization and hard work are bearing fruit: 84% of our hotels have already successfully risen to the challenge.Collective Mobilization to Lead Industry Best PracticesCommitted to reducing our environmental impact – aligned with the evolving expectations of guests who increasingly look for more responsible kinds of accommodation – we went beyond local legislation and decided to strengthen our governance  deploying a global action plan in head offices and hotels. The aim? Eliminate single-use plastic items in the guest experience and offer eco-responsible alternatives for 46 plastic items  while contributing to a concrete change of mindset. By mobilizing all the teams at a local  regional and global level  at the end of 2020  our hotels had removed all plastic straws  stirrers  cotton buds  individual amenities and cups – and are more committed than ever to take their efforts further.In December  we launched the ‘Our Planet  Our Commitment’ mini-series to share stories about how our hotel teams around the world protect and preserve biodiversity. Now we’re showcasing their initiatives to find sustainable alternatives to single-use plastic.Dive into the Eco-initiatives Implemented at Fairmont Maldives  Sirru Fen FushiSituated on the remote Maldivian atoll of Shaviyani  Fairmont Maldives  Sirru Fen Fushi is a natural paradise abundant with indigenous flora and fauna – home to more than 400 marine species  as well as various land birds and tropical trees. Understanding the need to preserve the surrounding environment and resources  the hotel prioritizes eco-friendly initiatives. In this episode  find out more about the teams’ initiatives and local synergies from Sustainability Manager  Samuel Dixon.Stepping Up Efforts to Reduce the Impact of PlasticDrinking water production : To further minimize the need for single-use plastic items  the hotel has an on-site Reverse Osmosis Water Treatment Plant that produces drinking water for guests and team members  which is served in reusable Fairmont-branded glass bottles.: To further minimize the need for single-use plastic items  the hotel has an on-site Reverse Osmosis Water Treatment Plant that produces drinking water for guests and team members  which is served in reusable Fairmont-branded glass bottles.

Big Apple takes bite out of Irish market with CRH and Flutter moves,Market Beat: The direction of travel set by the two heavyweights can hardly be seen as good news for Euronext Dublin,CRH is moving its primary listing to the US and it looks like Flutter will follow. What does this mean for the Irish market? Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty ImagesThe reaction among investors was unambiguous and swift when CRH  the largest company on the Iseq  revealed on Thursday it plans to move its primary stock listing to the US and accelerate its share buyback programme. Its stock jumped as much as 11.7 per cent during the day  adding €3.89 billion to its market value.Few would have been happier than 4 per cent-shareholder  Swedish activist investor Cevian Capital  which first disclosed it had built up a stake in 2019 and has been pressing ever since for the company to reach its “full potential”. (CRH’s shares have almost doubled since Cevian made its presence on the shareholder register known.)CRH has been laying the groundwork for a US listing for some time  having moved from reporting figures in euros to dollars three years ago  given the world’s largest economy  where it is the biggest roadbuilder  had become its main source of profits. North America accounted for three-quarters of the group’s $5.6 billion (€5.3 billion) of earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) last year.The hope is that CRH will benefit from how US stocks typically trade at a premium  relative to earnings  to their European peers.READ MOREWill the protocol deal bring prosperity to Northern Ireland? Listen | 44:30Thursday’s stock jump doesn’t even begin to close the gap  Ian Hunter  an analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald Ireland  said in a note to clients on Friday  noting that with the company trading at an enterprise value of 7.9 times ebitda  it is still changing hands at a 26 per cent discount to peers  who are predominantly based in the US.“We believe that given its current positioning in the market  growth prospects and balance sheet strength  it should at least trade at or close to parity ” he said.CRH group chief executive Albert Manifold has also pitched to investors that a US listing would help the group to capitalise on massive US infrastructure funding and subsidies initiatives – under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  the CHIPS and Science Act  and the Inflation Reduction Act that have been signed into law by president Joe Biden in the past 16 months.CRH isn’t alone. Flutter Entertainment  the owner of Paddy Power and Betfair  said in the middle of last month that it was looking at taking on a US stock market quotation. The expectation is that it will eventually move its main listing there – enabling it  like CRH  to chase the prize of being included in influential US stock indices.The huge success of FanDuel  the fast-growing US fantasy sports website in which Flutter accumulated a 95 per cent stake since the country’s supreme court moved in May 2018 to strike down a federal law banning the commercial sports betting  is gradually pulling Flutter’s centre of gravity across the Atlantic. The US accounted for a third of total revenues last year of £7.7 billion (€8.6 billion).Flutter Entertainment  the owner of the Paddy Power and Betfair  said in the middle of last month that it was looking at taking on a US stock market quotation. Photograph: Michael Stephens/PA WireBoth CRH and Flutter  led by chief executive Peter Jackson  seem happy to shrug off the cautionary tale offered by Fyffes spin-off Total Produce. It ditched its Irish listing in mid-2021 in favour of the Big Apple as it merged with Dole Foods to create Dole plc  only to see its stock slump 40 per cent by the end of last year.CRH  formed in 1970 through the merger of the already publicly quoted Irish Cement and Roadstone companies  had already moved its primary listing to London in late 2011. The merger of Paddy Power with Betfair in early 2016 saw the combined entity also opt for the UK capital for its main listing (before the corporate name change to Flutter).Both CRH and Flutter plan to keep their headquarters and tax residency in Ireland. And stockbrokers in Dublin are clinging to hopes that both companies will also keep their secondary listings here. Dublin  they argue  has become a more important hub for European investors to trade the stock since Brexit.But the developments raise further questions about the future of the Euronext Dublin cash equities market.A triple whammy over the past two decades of Irish pension funds being pressed to lower their exposure to Irish equities  foreign takeovers of the main local investment players  and a shift by the industry from active stock-picking to passive investment  has conspired to make initial public offerings (IPOs) less attractive.Only three companies – Uniphar  Corre Energy  and HealthBeacon – have floated in Dublin in the past four years. The further diminution of the Irish market by the moves by CRH and Flutter is hardly encouraging.Keeping companies on the market has been even more difficult. Green Reit  Hibernia Reit  CPL Resources  Applegreen and Yew Grove have been acquired off the market in the past four years. Aryzta and Tullow Oil have scrapped their local listings.Who else might have their eyes on the attractions of Wall Street? Glanbia  the purveyor of protein shakes and bars through the Optimum Nutrition and SlimFast brands  has to be top of the list  having said this week that it is changing the currency in which it reports its figures to dollars. Some 82 per cent of its revenues were generated in the US last year.[ Glanbia’s Optimum Nutrition becomes company’s first billion dollar brand ]Kerry Group  which had been plotting moving its main listing to New York when it was in talks in late 2019 to buy a US nutrition business  currently generates almost 40 per cent of its sales in that market.It hasn’t been missed that Albert Manifold and Peter Jackson have been the two best paid Iseq CEOs in recent times and each has seen his remuneration receive push-back from shareholder advisory firms in the past. This will be less of issue when the companies are trading on Wall Street.It might be too late for Manifold  who received a record €13.9 million package for an Iseq company in 2021 and is on track to see his contact come to an end next year when he reaches 62.

ALS-4 is a first-in-class small molecule anti-virulence …,Regulatory News:Aptorum Group Limited (Nasdaq: APM  Euronext Paris: APM) (“Aptorum Group” or “Aptorum”)  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company  announces the completion of the Pre-IND discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration (“US FDA”). ALS-4 is a first-in-class small molecule anti-virulence drug targeting infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus  including but not limited to Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (“MRSA”).Upon the completion of ALS-4’s respective Phase I clinical trials in Canada  ALS-4 has been targeting to obtain the necessary IND clearance for Phase II clinical trials in the United States. The Pre-IND discussions with US FDA focused on overall development plan in preparation for the IND application of ALS-4 targeting Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI) initially. With the positive feedback on the overall development strategy from the US FDA  Aptorum is now proceeding towards the IND submission of ALS-4.Dr. Clark Cheng  Chief Medical Officer and Executive Director of Aptorum Group  commented: “We are pleased to announce the completion of Pre-IND discussions with the US FDA which represents another key milestone the company’s strategic goals for the year of 2023 and for the eventual objective to deliver an exciting novel potential therapeutic solution for the unmet needs of MRSA related infections in human. With additional supportive information from US FDA on the Phase 2 clinical development of ALS-4  it is also the continued focus of Aptorum Group to embark on the exciting Phase 2 clinical trials for ALS-4  subject to further US FDA’s clearance of the IND application”.About ALS-4As part of Aptorum Group’s infectious disease platform  ALS-4 is a novel first-in-class orally administered small molecule drug based on an anti-virulence approach targeting staphylococcus aureus including MRSA. ALS-4 targets the antimicrobial resistant properties of the bacteria and is believed to render the bacteria highly susceptible to the host’s immune clearance. ALS-4 is targeted for potential administration on a standalone or on a combination basis with other existing antibiotics such as vancomycin. ALS-4 has completed its first-in-human Phase I trial which was a randomized  double-blinded  placebo-controlled  single and multiple ascending dose studies (“SAD” and “MAD” respectively) designed to evaluate safety  tolerability  and pharmacokinetics of orally administered ALS-4 in a total of 72 healthy male and female adult volunteers. No Serious Adverse Events were observed on ALS-4 and no relevant clinical changes in respect of vital signs; ECG  clinical laboratory test results and physical examinations were observed compared to the relevant baseline in both SAD (25-200mg) and MAD (50-100mg).About Aptorum GroupAptorum Group Limited (Nasdaq: APM  Euronext Paris: APM) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutic assets to treat diseases with unmet medical needs  particularly in oncology (including orphan oncology indications)  autoimmune and infectious diseases.

In our canned and frozen activities  both retail and foodservice  our innovations and the policy of price increases  designed to compensate for rising production costs  have enabled us to maintain the group's profitability.In Europe  although our fresh segment is more sensitive to the overall decline in consumption  the recovery and innovation plans initiated in our core businesses are on an encouraging trajectory  particularly in the ready-to-use fresh segment. In North America  the refocusing of activities on valued segments is continuing in parallel with the adaptation of in the industrial set up on the East Coast of the United States.In all zones  the teams are mobilizing to offset the impact of the inflationary shock in the short term and to ensure our medium-term growth relays  enabling the group  in an environment that is more uncertain and volatile than ever  to confirm the annual objectives announced in October 2022.Story continuesOur mission  to inspire the transition toward a plant-based diet  guides us in the long term towards becoming a positive impact company. More than ever we are convinced that performance can only be called such if it has a positive impact. The price increase agreements signed in France  based on a strong commitment to ""trickle down"" to our farming partners  the B Corp certification of our Bonduelle Fresh Americas business unit  the development of our renewable energy supplies linked to a long-standing policy of sobriety and decarbonization  and the successful relocation in Europe of pulses cultivation channels  all demonstrate the relevance of our roadmaps.*******The 2022-2023 half-year financial statements were approved by the General Partner  then reviewed by the Supervisory Board of March 2  2023 and by the Statutory Auditors.Significant Results(in € millions) 1st HY2022-2023 1st HY2021-2022 Variation Revenue 1 243.4 1 094.6 13.6% Current operating income 43.1 27.6 56.1% Current operating margin 3.5% 2.5% 94 bps Consolidated net income 20.0 24.0 -16.5% Gearing (1) exclud.

A limited decline in volumes over the period is explained by the quotas applied to certain products following a deficit harvest.The frozen activity showed positive volume growth both in food service  which is continuing its post-covid recovery  and in retail (success of recent innovations launched  in particular under the Cassegrain brand).The ready-to-use fresh segment (salad bags and processed)  where cost increases  and therefore price increases  are more limited  showed growth in value and a stability in volumes. Supply difficulties and less dynamic markets in salads were offset over the period by a particularly dynamic summer season in processed segment.Non-Europe ZoneThe Non-Europe Zone revenue representing 40.6% of the business activity in the 1st half year  posted +17.0% at current exchange rates and -3.4% on a like for like basis(2).In an uncertain geopolitical context  the Eurasia zone posted higher revenue (canned and frozen)  linked to price increases  with volumes in this area slightly down on the previous year.In North America  the ready-to-use fresh segment declined over the period  impacted on the one hand by the loss of contracts in the 2nd half of financial year 2021-2022  by a salad segment that was itself in decline  and on the other hand by an agronomic crisis affecting salad yields in the Salinas region  generating a significant shortage of products and a rise in purchase prices. In this context  the Bonduelle Group decided to adapt its manufacturing set up on the East Coast of the United States to the expected level of activity and refocused on profitable business segments (see below).Operating incomeThe Bonduelle Group's recurring operating profitability for the first half of 2022-2023 stands at € 43.1 million  up 56.1% on reported figures and 60.9% on a like for like basis(2) with a particularly favorable seasonality effect in the first half year. The current operating margin was at 3.5%  up 94 bps when compared to the first half year of last financial year on reported figures and 130 bps on a like for like basis(2).In the Europe Zone  price increases  mainly in long life technologies (canned and frozen)  helped offset inflation and maintain profitability in the first half year. Thus  the margin operating income increased to € 42.5 million on reported figures (€ 36.3 million for the same period last year) representing a current operating margin of 5.7% on reported figures (5.8% on a like for like basis(2)  compared with 5.5% for the same period last year).In the Non-Europe zone  the current operating profitability stands at € 0.6 million  representing a current operating margin of 0.1% on reported figures (respectively € 1.1 million and 0.3% on a like for like basis(2)) compared to € -8.7 million over the same period last financial year.The ongoing negative contribution of Bonduelle Fresh Americas (BFA)  despite the first effects of implemented initiatives  limited the region's profitability  which was offset by the results of the Eurasia zone  with beneficial currency effects improving the competitiveness of Bonduelle EurAsia Markets (BEAM) in its segments.After taking into account non-recurring expenses of € 1.5 million linked to costs and fees related to the reorganization of the Florence site (New Jersey  USA)  operating profitability stands at € 41.5 million on reported figures compared to € 24.6 million at the end of the first half year of previous financial year.Net resultThe net financial result stands at € -17.5 million against € -8.7 million last financial year. Despite a positive volume effect linked to the group debt reduction following the partial disposal of its canned and frozen activity in North America at the end of last year  financial expenses increased due to the rapid rise of interest rates in the main currencies in which the Bonduelle Group refinances its activities  particularly outside the Eurozone.Moreover  the group recorded foreign exchange losses mainly related to the extreme volatility of the Russian ruble (€ -4.5 million)  whose impact is more than offset by recorded competitiveness gains in current operating profitability.The tax charge increase (€ 13.1 million compared with € 4.6 million in the first half of previous year) is due to the non-capitalization of Bonduelle Fresh Americas’ losses over the period.After taking into account the financial result  the result of the equity method accounted companies (including this year 35% of the net result of Nortera Foods) and the tax charge  the net result of the continuing activities amounts to € 14.4 million i.e. 1.2% of the revenue  increasing to 35.3% compared to the same period last year.The consolidated net result amounted to € 20 million against € 24 million the previous year. It includes the result of discontinued operations  i.e. for the first 6 months of 2022-2023 financial year  a favorable adjustment of the sale price of 65% of the BALL business unit for an amount of € 5.6 million and  for the previous period  i.e. the first half of 2021-2022  100% of the net result of Nortera Foods representing € 13.3 million.Financial situationThe Bonduelle Group’s net financial debt stood on December 31  2022 at € 556.7 million against € 909.9 million over the same period last financial year  excluding the impact of the application of IFRS 16  i.e. a debt-to-equity ratio (gearing(1)) of 68.1% (118.6% last financial year). The decrease in debt is explained by the partial disposal of the long life activity in North America (BALL) in June 2022  partly offset by the increase in working capital requirements  which is itself linked to the increase in the value of inventories due to inflation. Finally  the average cost of debt  excluding IFRS 16  in a context of significantly higher interest rates  stands at 3.93%  up from the first half of the previous financial year (1.59%).Restated from IFRS 16  the group’s net financial debt stands at € 633.9 million and the gearing(1) ratio at 79.0%.It should be noted that the seasonal nature of the business (summer agricultural crops) results in a high level of debt on December 31  which is not representative of the average level of debt or the one observed at the end of the financial year.Other significant informationAdaptation of the American industrial set upIn order to improve its competitiveness in the ready-to-use fresh produce market in the United States and to refocus its activity on its valued segments  the Bonduelle Group is adapting the industrial structure of its activity on the East Coast of the United States.Thus  the manufacturing activities in Florence (New Jersey) will be merged in the coming months with the Swedesboro site  also in New Jersey. This operation aims to optimize the production of all products for customers nationally  while achieving gains in efficiency and coverage of fixed costs.The current Florence site will be converted into a warehouse for the East Coast  maintaining these jobs on the site and all current Florence production workers will be offered a position in Swedesboro. The net impact of this reorganization  estimated to date between € 6.0 million and € 8.0 million and of which € 1.3 million has already been noted in the first half year  will be recorded in the 2022-2023 fiscal year under non-recurring items.Amendment of the green syndicated loan of € 400 millionOn February 6  2023  the Bonduelle Group signed an amendment to its € 400 million syndicated revolving credit facility (RCF) with its banking partners  thereby securing an essential source of financing  which is particularly well suited to the seasonal nature of the group's financing needs  and on very competitive terms  despite the current unstable economic environment. This arrangement provides for a two-year extension  bringing the maturity from 2026 to 2028  with two one-year extension options  bringing the final maturity of the loan to February 2030.The financial terms of this credit line include Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) indicators in line with the group's mission and purpose  both in terms of B Corp certification and in terms of reducing its carbon footprint and contributing  with its agricultural partners  to a regenerative agriculture.This operation demonstrates once again the confidence shown by the banking partners in supporting the Bonduelle Group's development over the long term.Universal Registration Document publicationThe Universal Registration Document (URD) for the 2021-2022 financial year can be consulted on the website www.bonduelle.com.For the second year  the group is also publishing an integrated report  also available on the website  describing Bonduelle's business model and its approach in terms of financial and non-financial performance.OutlooksBonduelle  like the worldwide food industry  is facing a fragile  volatile and uncertain consumer environment  fueled by unprecedented past and future inflation  particularly for agricultural products  which once again makes significant price increases essential.Nevertheless  given the performance achieved in the first half year  which benefited from the favorable seasonal nature of profitability  the Bonduelle Group expects  for the whole financial year  a revenue growth of around 8.0% and a stable current operating margin compared to the previous year  both at constant currency exchange rate and scope consolidation basis  in line with the guidance disclosed at the beginning of fiscal year.(1) net debt / equity(2) at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis. The revenues in foreign currency over the given period are translated into the rate of exchange for the comparable period. The impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments is restated as followsFor businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period  revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded. In the specific case of the loss of control of the long life activities in North America  the IFRS 5 standard having been applied to the historical data  the revenue is already restated in the historical elements;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year  revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.Alternative performance indicators : the group presents in its financial notices performance indicators not defined by accounting standards.

T…,"Phase 3 North American Study topline safety results support overall good safety profile of Donesta ®   Mithra's next generation Estetrol (E4)-based product candidate for menopause  as consistently demonstrated in previous E4 studies.  Mithra's next generation Estetrol (E4)-based product candidate for menopause  as consistently demonstrated in previous E4 studies. Topline safety results were demonstrated for the treatment of post-menopausal women aged 40-65 years with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms with key secondary endpoints achieved  including E4's beneficial effect on cholesterol profile and on bone turnover biomarkers. These highlights will be presented during the webcast dedicated to Mithra's 2022 full year results.These results will support the filing with U.S. regulatory agency anticipated by end of H1 2023 for a market authorization in H1 2024  whereas primary safety data are anticipated in H1 2024 for Europe with a market authorization in H1 2025.Full dataset analysis is still in progress.Liege  Belgium  3 March 2023 - 19:00 CET - Mithra (Euronext Brussels: MITRA)  a company dedicated to Women's Health  today announced positive topline safety results from the Phase 3 Donesta® pivotal E4 COMFORT clinical trial in the United States and Canada aiming at evaluating the efficacy and safety of Donesta® for the treatment of Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS) in post-menopausal women. Donesta® is Mithra's next generation orally-administered Estetrol (E4)-based hormone therapy product candidate.The Phase 3 Clinical Program carried out in 2 550 postmenopausal women (40-65 years) includes two pivotal studies: one in North America (C302) and a second in 14 countries in Europe  Latin America and Russia (C301). Both trials are randomized  multicentre  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials. Early 2022  Mithra announced the topline efficacy results of both trials  which demonstrated a meaningful reduction in VMS from baseline and compared to placebo with all co-primary efficacy endpoints statistically (all p<0.05) met.Previous E4 studies have demonstrated the overall's safety profile of Estetrol. Whereas the full dataset analysis is still in progress  these topline safety results not only confirm Donesta®'s safety profile in the treatment of VMS  but also delineate further E4's unique benefit/risk profile for postmenopausal women.In the C302 trial  safety data were captured up to 12 months of treatment either with the 15 mg and 20 mg E4 doses compared to placebo (efficacy part) or open-label with the 20 mg E4 dose (safety part). These topline safety results  evaluated general safety and secondary endpoints such as health-related quality of life  treatment satisfaction  lipid and glucose metabolism and endometrial safety in hysterectomized and non-hysterectomized women.Among the highlights of these results  the study confirmed previous clinical and biochemical evidence with minimal changes in hemostasis parameters and hepatic markers  E4's positive influence on bone turnover markers and beneficial effect on cholesterol profile. These results contribute to showcase the unique profile of E4.At a daily dose of 15 mg or 20 mg  Donesta® was well tolerated in hysterectomized women. In non-hysterectomized women  as expected for an estrogen administered alone  endometrial proliferation was observed and confirmed the need of adding a progestogen to curb related events in this population. Therefore  once the estrogen was first administrated and followed with the administration of progesterone  endometrial thickening was  partially to completely  reversed within a two-week treatment. Most of the treatment emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in intensity.On Tuesday March 7th at 09:00 CET  highlights of these results will be presented during the live webcast for 2022 financial and operating results.The live webcast can be accessed on the Mithra investor's section or by clicking here. A replay will be available shortly after the close of the call.The European study C301 is still ongoing with primary safety data anticipated for H1 2024. Barring any unforeseen event  Mithra confirms its ambition to achieve marketing authorization for Donesta® in H1 2024 for the United States and in H1 2025 for Europe. A marketing authorization that was initially anticipated in Q4 2024 and moved to H1 2025 owing to a slow recruitment.Graham Dixon  CSO Mithra Women's Health  commented:""These safety results show Donesta®'s complete profile to safely and effectively treat menopausal symptoms. At the beginning of 2024  the European study (C301) should reinforce the unique safety profile of E4  supporting further the fantastic therapeutic potential of this molecule. After having successfully signed the licence agreement with Gedeon Richter for the commercialization of Donesta® in Europe  these topline safety results will support the upcoming regulatory filing process and bring us closer to a marketing authorization in North America.""",neutral,0.05,0.95,0.0,mixed,0.41,0.18,0.41,True,English,"['Mithra Pharmaceuticals S A', 'promising topline safety results', 'Donesta® Phase 3 Study', 'North America', 'Estetrol (E4)-based hormone therapy product candidate', 'next generation Estetrol (E4)-based product candidate', 'Phase 3 Donesta® pivotal E4 COMFORT clinical trial', 'Phase 3 North American Study topline safety results', 'randomized, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials', 'moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms', 'U.S. regulatory agency', 'upcoming regulatory filing process', 'treatment emergent adverse events', 'Phase 3 Clinical Program', 'positive topline safety results', 'two pivotal studies', 'previous E4 studies', 'bone turnover biomarkers', 'Full dataset analysis', 'fantastic therapeutic potential', '2022 full year results', 'topline efficacy results', 'bone turnover markers', 'primary safety data', '20 mg E4 doses', 'key secondary endpoints', 'good safety profile', 'unique benefit/risk profile', 'primary efficacy endpoints', 'unique safety profile', 'The European study', 'previous clinical', 'C302 trial', 'CSO Mithra Women', 'to 12 months', 'positive influence', 'unique profile', 'related events', 'menopausal symptoms', 'safety part', 'general safety', 'endometrial safety', 'operating results', 'hepatic markers', 'daily dose', 'cholesterol profile', 'complete profile', 'efficacy part', 'post-menopausal women', 'beneficial effect', 'market authorization', 'Euronext Brussels', 'United States', '2,550 postmenopausal women', '40-65 years', 'Latin America', 'meaningful reduction', 'health-related quality', 'glucose metabolism', 'biochemical evidence', 'minimal changes', 'hemostasis parameters', 'endometrial proliferation', 'endometrial thickening', 'unforeseen event', 'marketing authorization', 'slow recruitment', 'Graham Dixon', 'licence agreement', 'Gedeon Richter', 'treatment satisfaction', 'two-week treatment', 'hysterectomized women', 'live webcast', 'Tuesday March', 'E4.', 'Mithra investor', '15 mg', 'Donesta ®', '3 March', 'overall', 'menopause', 'highlights', 'H1', 'progress', 'Liege', 'Belgium', '19:00 CET', 'MITRA', 'company', 'Canada', 'VMS', '14 countries', 'Russia', 'Both', 'baseline', 'label', 'lipid', 'estrogen', 'need', 'progestogen', 'population', 'administration', 'progesterone', 'intensity', '09:00 CET', '2022 financial', 'section', 'replay', 'close', 'call', 'C301', 'ambition', 'Q4', 'beginning', 'molecule', 'commercialization']",2023-03-03,2023-03-04,marketscreener.com

Not only is their customer growth Stateside but  more importantly  they think their shares will be valued higher there  making it easier to raise capital for expansion and investment.Market sources say that Dublin doesn’t have the same reputation for investor appetite that other markets have. Until now  that has mostly affected where technology or healthcare firms decide to list. But now it has affected CRH and Flutter because of how their businesses have developed internationally.CRH wants to take full advantage of the US infrastructure spending bonanza unleashed by President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better plan. Flutter has struck gold with its FanDuel brand as American states have relaxed their gambling laws in recent years.The writing has been on the wall for Euronext Dublin over the last few yearsThe dual Dublin-London listing arrangement each has relied on has been judged substandard. Based on positive stock price moves after the announcements  shareholders are likely to agree at annual general meetings on the proposals next month.The writing has been on the wall for Euronext Dublin over the last few years as other listing venues welcomed hundreds of new companies to the stock markets and exiting companies raised billions in capital. Even tiny Oslo Bors had 60 new listings in 2021.Yet while Dublin captured higher trading volumes  notably among dual-listed companies like Ryanair and Smurfit Kappa  it has consistently failed to attract new listings.Expand Close Ryanair / FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp RyanairApart from Uniphar  Corre Energy  HealthBeacon and Engage XR no companies have come to market in Dublin in the last four years.In fact  the traffic has been in the other direction  with private buy-outs  acquisitions and de-listings dominating the news for Irish-listed companies.Green Reit  Yew Grove Reit  Hibernia Reit  CPL and Applegreen have all been taken off market  while Aryzta opted for a single listing in Switzerland. Dole listed in New York in 2021  taking out Total Produce in the transaction.Greencore  DCC and Grafton Group have all given up Dublin primary listings  too  opting to emphasise their London shares instead.Brexit was supposed to send an exodus of London-listed companies to Dublin  but apart from Hammerson  nobody showed up.Expand Close Euronext Dublin CEO Daryl Byrne. Photo: Orla Murray/Coalesce / FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp Euronext Dublin CEO Daryl Byrne. Photo: Orla Murray/CoalesceRyanair delisted from London for Brexit-related reasons and remains one of the top-traded shares  but it’s an exception. Most other Euronext Dublin stocks are midcaps or smallcaps. The equities market is fairly moribund.It’s not for lack of trying  though. Euronext Dublin CEO Daryl Byrne works closely with local brokers and the Government  but the domestic pool of institutional investors is limited  which puts a cap on the potential here.And while Euronext carries on gamely with its IPO Ready programme to assist companies that want to come to the stock market  hardly any candidates have graduated to a listing.Private capital is pouring into the domestic economyThat isn’t to say there isn’t investor interest in Irish companies. On the contrary  private capital is pouring into the domestic economy  especially in sexy sectors like tech and life sciences.But the exit plan is rarely an IPO. Instead the big deals are trade sales. Even those private equity firms that use public markets as part of their exit strategies – like Poolbeg Pharma backer Raglan Capital – the destination is usually the Nasdaq  which is simply a better shop window .But while that kind of deal can be very attractive to owners and early investors  it kills the pipeline for public listings.With the big stalwarts of the Irish Stock Exchange now looking for greener pastures  it’s hard to see Dublin’s equity market thriving.,negative,0.01,0.12,0.87,mixed,0.23,0.23,0.54,True,English,"['next CRH', 'Euronext Dublin', 'critical scale', 'Flutter', 'market', 'Most other Euronext Dublin stocks', 'dual Dublin-London listing arrangement', 'US infrastructure spending bonanza', 'major Irish success story', 'Building materials giant CRH', 'positive stock price moves', 'primary stock market listings', 'Whatsapp Euronext Dublin CEO', 'CEO Albert Manifold', 'President Joe Biden', 'annual general meetings', 'tiny Oslo Bors', 'Poolbeg Pharma backer', 'initial public offerings', 'higher trading volumes', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'Yew Grove Reit', 'Dublin primary listings', 'other listing venues', 'Irish stock market', 'IPO Ready programme', 'Euronext Dublin spokesperson', 'private equity firms', 'Paddy Power-owner Flutter', 'biggest growth market', 'last four years', 'major names', 'stock markets', 'other markets', 'other direction', 'multiple listings', '60 new listings', 'US listing', 'Irish companies', 'higher valuations', 'customer growth', 'healthcare firms', 'public markets', 'listing arrangements', 'Green Reit', 'Hibernia Reit', 'single listing', 'The US', 'Whatsapp Ryanair', 'private sales', 'private buy-outs', 'Market sources', 'biggest companies', 'United States', 'deeper pools', 'similar proposal', 'clear logic', 'domestic ecosystem', 'terminal decline', 'pan-European company', 'many others', 'impending departures', 'same reputation', 'investor appetite', 'similar reasons', 'full advantage', 'FanDuel brand', 'American states', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'Corre Energy', 'Engage XR', 'New York', 'Total Produce', 'Grafton Group', 'Daryl Byrne', 'Brexit-related reasons', 'local brokers', 'domestic pool', 'institutional investors', 'domestic economy', 'investor interest', 'sexy sectors', 'life sciences', 'big deals', 'trade sales', 'exit strategies', 'recent years', 'equities market', 'Private capital', 'new companies', 'exiting companies', 'dual-listed companies', 'Irish-listed companies', 'London-listed companies', 'exit plan', 'Raglan Cap', 'London shares', 'plans', 'Atlantic', 'shareholders', 'delistings', 'future', 'Paris', 'Milan', 'couple', 'implications', 'business', 'majority', 'expansion', 'investment', 'technology', 'gold', 'laws', 'writing', 'wall', 'announcements', 'proposals', 'hundreds', 'Facebook', 'Twitter', 'Email', 'Uniphar', 'HealthBeacon', 'fact', 'traffic', 'acquisitions', 'de-listings', 'news', 'CPL', 'Applegreen', 'Aryzta', 'Switzerland', 'Dole', 'transaction', 'Greencore', 'DCC', 'exodus', 'Hammerson', 'Photo', 'Coalesce', 'exception', 'midcaps', 'smallcaps', 'lack', 'Government', 'potential', 'candidates', 'contrary']",2023-03-03,2023-03-04,independent.ie

The new article 4a will be worded as follows:“The Board of Directors is authorised to increase the share capital by issuing new shares in one or more tranches with pre-emption rights for the Company’s existing shareholders and at a total nominal value of up to DKK 100 000 000  subject  however  to paragraph 3.

The new shares may be paid in cash or by contribution of assets other than cash. The authorisation shall apply for the period until and including 29 March 2028.The authorisations of the Board of Directors pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 apply to a total issue of new shares at an aggregate nominal value not exceeding DKK 100 000 000.In the case of a share capital increase pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2  the new shares shall be issued in the name of the holder and be paid in full. The shares shall be negotiable and shall in all other respects bear the same rights as the existing shares  for example in terms of redeemability and restrictions on negotiability. The new shares shall entitle the holder to dividend from the time decided by the Board of Directors  however  not later than as from the financial year following the increase. The Board of Directors shall decide the terms and conditions for increases of the share capital that are implemented in accordance with the authorizations in paragraphs 1 and 2.”The proposed amendments to the articles of association is available on the company’s website  www.flsmidth.com.8.2 – Treasury sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that it be authorized until the next Annual General Meeting to let the company acquire treasury shares equivalent to a total of 10% of the company’s share capital at the time of the authorization  provided that the company’s total holding of treasury shares at no point exceeds 10% of the company’s share capital. The consideration must not deviate by more than 10% from the official price quoted on Nasdaq Copenhagen at the time of acquisition.Shareholder Proposal (AkademikerPension and LD Fonde)Shareholder  AkademikerPension and LD Fonde  proposes that the Board of Directors shall communicate the company’s efforts to respect human rights and labour rights in accordance with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs)  and in alignment with the forthcoming Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  the company shall perform and publish a double materiality assessment identifying which  if any  human rights related financial risks the company has identified  and how it seeks to address these. The disclosed information shall be updated and published at least once a year at reasonable cost  omitting proprietary information. The disclosed information shall be made public before the Annual General Meeting notice starting in 2024 and may be included in the existing reporting suite.The proposing shareholder’s full motivation for the proposal:The pressure on companies to demonstrate respect for human rights is increasing as the link between long-term value creation and a prudent approach to human rights risks is becoming more and more established.It is therefore increasingly important for companies and investors alike that companies demonstrate that they understand and navigate the business opportunities and risks related to the corporate duty to respect human rights and labour rights throughout the entire value chain. Failure to do so may leave the company vulnerable to operational disruptions  litigation risk and increased scrutiny by supervisory authorities as well as reputational risk and loss of license to operate in eyes of customers  employees  investors  and business partners.The corporate duty to respect human rights is derived from the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs)  adopted in 2011. The UNGPs have set out the international standard of practice for companies to respect international human rights (including labour rights) by identifying  preventing  mitigating  remedying  and accounting for human rights impacts associated with their business activities – commonly known as human rights due diligence. Companies that are operationg (directly or through the value chain) in conflict-affected areas are  furthermore  expected to perform heightened human rights due diligence in light of the increased risk of human rights violations in these areas.Though a soft law requirement under international law  the corporate duty to respect human rights has been an expectation of companies since the UNGPs was adopted in 2011. This is particularly the case for companies that publicly subscribe to these international norms.The expectation has in recent years been underlined by the European Union’s introduction of a range of regulatory initiatives which  in different ways  seek to address the impacts that businesses have on human rights and labour rights. Two of the main developments in this area are the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)  which includes a mandatory due diligence obligation with respect to human rights  and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  which concerns disclosures on a range of sustainability matters including human rights from a double materiality perspective. The EU regulatory initiatives are largely based on the corporate duty to respect human rights as described in the UNGPs  though the human rights due diligence requirement under the UNGPs will likely be more comprehensive than the national implementation of the EU directive.Though the corporate duty to respect human rights has been long-established  studies show that companies have not taken the necessary steps to demonstrate sufficient implementation of human rights due diligence processes in their operations. The Danish Institute for Human Rights (DIHR) has examined the public reporting of a number of large Danish companies and provided an analysis of the human rights policies and disclosed human rights due diligence practices of these companies in 2020  and again in 2022. The analyses indicate that more progress needs to be made in this are. This is also the case for FLSmidth.FLSmidth is a signatory to the UN Global Compact and has committed to respecting human rights in line with the UNGPs. This includes identifying  mitigating  and remedying adverse impacts in the entire value chain  both on the supply side and on the customer side. Given that FLSmidth through its business partners operate in conflict-affected geographic territories and depend on sectors with a high risk of adverse impacts on human rights  it is important that the company can account for the necessary due diligence processes applied to handle these risks.Furthermore  FLSmidth already employs and discloses a well-developed risk management process and identifies several risk topics that are potentially related to human rights risks  such as supply chain  compliance  geo-politics  safety  sustainability  and attracting and retaining employees  but currently with no or limited connection to this in its human rights disclosures and sustainability report.By strengthening its ability to document its human rights due diligence and risk management processes  FLSmidth would stand to benefit. Not by pre-empting the regulatory requirements in the EU legislation  but by staying ahead of the curve in order to gain a competitive advantage.The Board of Directors’ positionThe Board of Directors has had a good and constructive dialogue with AkademikerPension and LD Fonde about the precise wording of the proposal and the Board of Directors supports the proposal.Any other businessAdoption requirementsThe proposal set forth in item 8.1 of the agenda must be adopted by at least 2/3 of both the votes cast and of the share capital represented at the general meeting. The remaining proposals on the agenda can be adopted by a simple majority of votes.

The Audit Committee has informed the Board of Directors that it has not been influenced by third parties and is not subject to any agreements with third parties that restrict the general meeting’s election of specific auditors or audit firms.Proposals from the Board of DirectorsThe Board of Directors submits the following proposals:8.1 – Amendment of the articles of associationThe Board of Directors proposes that the existing authorisations granted in article 4a of the Articles of Association to the Board of Directors to increase the company’s share capital be extended so that they are applicable until and including 29 March 2028. The new article 4a will be worded as follows:“The Board of Directors is authorised to increase the share capital by issuing new shares in one or more tranches with pre-emption rights for the Company’s existing shareholders and at a total nominal value of up to DKK 100 000 000  subject  however  to paragraph 3. The new shares must be paid in cash. The authorisation shall apply for the period until and including 29 March 2028.Further  the Board of Directors is authorised to increase the share capital by issuing new shares in one or more tranches without pre-emption rights for the Company’s existing shareholders and at a total nominal value of up to DKK 100 000 000  subject  however  to paragraph 3  provided that the increase takes place at market value. The new shares may be paid in cash or by contribution of assets other than cash. The authorisation shall apply for the period until and including 29 March 2028.The authorisations of the Board of Directors pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 apply to a total issue of new shares at an aggregate nominal value not exceeding DKK 100 000 000.In the case of a share capital increase pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2  the new shares shall be issued in the name of the holder and be paid in full. The shares shall be negotiable and shall in all other respects bear the same rights as the existing shares  for example in terms of redeemability and restrictions on negotiability. The new shares shall entitle the holder to dividend from the time decided by the Board of Directors  however  not later than as from the financial year following the increase. The Board of Directors shall decide the terms and conditions for increases of the share capital that are implemented in accordance with the authorizations in paragraphs 1 and 2.”The proposed amendments to the articles of association is available on the company’s website  www.flsmidth.com.8.2 – Treasury sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that it be authorized until the next Annual General Meeting to let the company acquire treasury shares equivalent to a total of 10% of the company’s share capital at the time of the authorization  provided that the company’s total holding of treasury shares at no point exceeds 10% of the company’s share capital. The consideration must not deviate by more than 10% from the official price quoted on Nasdaq Copenhagen at the time of acquisition.Shareholder Proposal (AkademikerPension and LD Fonde)Shareholder  AkademikerPension and LD Fonde  proposes that the Board of Directors shall communicate the company’s efforts to respect human rights and labour rights in accordance with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs)  and in alignment with the forthcoming Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  the company shall perform and publish a double materiality assessment identifying which  if any  human rights related financial risks the company has identified  and how it seeks to address these. The disclosed information shall be updated and published at least once a year at reasonable cost  omitting proprietary information. The disclosed information shall be made public before the Annual General Meeting notice starting in 2024 and may be included in the existing reporting suite.The proposing shareholder’s full motivation for the proposal:The pressure on companies to demonstrate respect for human rights is increasing as the link between long-term value creation and a prudent approach to human rights risks is becoming more and more established.It is therefore increasingly important for companies and investors alike that companies demonstrate that they understand and navigate the business opportunities and risks related to the corporate duty to respect human rights and labour rights throughout the entire value chain. Failure to do so may leave the company vulnerable to operational disruptions  litigation risk and increased scrutiny by supervisory authorities as well as reputational risk and loss of license to operate in eyes of customers  employees  investors  and business partners.The corporate duty to respect human rights is derived from the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs)  adopted in 2011. The UNGPs have set out the international standard of practice for companies to respect international human rights (including labour rights) by identifying  preventing  mitigating  remedying  and accounting for human rights impacts associated with their business activities – commonly known as human rights due diligence. Companies that are operationg (directly or through the value chain) in conflict-affected areas are  furthermore  expected to perform heightened human rights due diligence in light of the increased risk of human rights violations in these areas.Though a soft law requirement under international law  the corporate duty to respect human rights has been an expectation of companies since the UNGPs was adopted in 2011. This is particularly the case for companies that publicly subscribe to these international norms.The expectation has in recent years been underlined by the European Union’s introduction of a range of regulatory initiatives which  in different ways  seek to address the impacts that businesses have on human rights and labour rights. Two of the main developments in this area are the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)  which includes a mandatory due diligence obligation with respect to human rights  and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  which concerns disclosures on a range of sustainability matters including human rights from a double materiality perspective. The EU regulatory initiatives are largely based on the corporate duty to respect human rights as described in the UNGPs  though the human rights due diligence requirement under the UNGPs will likely be more comprehensive than the national implementation of the EU directive.Though the corporate duty to respect human rights has been long-established  studies show that companies have not taken the necessary steps to demonstrate sufficient implementation of human rights due diligence processes in their operations. The Danish Institute for Human Rights (DIHR) has examined the public reporting of a number of large Danish companies and provided an analysis of the human rights policies and disclosed human rights due diligence practices of these companies in 2020  and again in 2022. The analyses indicate that more progress needs to be made in this are. This is also the case for FLSmidth.FLSmidth is a signatory to the UN Global Compact and has committed to respecting human rights in line with the UNGPs. This includes identifying  mitigating  and remedying adverse impacts in the entire value chain  both on the supply side and on the customer side. Given that FLSmidth through its business partners operate in conflict-affected geographic territories and depend on sectors with a high risk of adverse impacts on human rights  it is important that the company can account for the necessary due diligence processes applied to handle these risks.Furthermore  FLSmidth already employs and discloses a well-developed risk management process and identifies several risk topics that are potentially related to human rights risks  such as supply chain  compliance  geo-politics  safety  sustainability  and attracting and retaining employees  but currently with no or limited connection to this in its human rights disclosures and sustainability report.By strengthening its ability to document its human rights due diligence and risk management processes  FLSmidth would stand to benefit. Not by pre-empting the regulatory requirements in the EU legislation  but by staying ahead of the curve in order to gain a competitive advantage.The Board of Directors’ positionThe Board of Directors has had a good and constructive dialogue with AkademikerPension and LD Fonde about the precise wording of the proposal and the Board of Directors supports the proposal.Any other businessAdoption requirementsThe proposal set forth in item 8.1 of the agenda must be adopted by at least 2/3 of both the votes cast and of the share capital represented at the general meeting. The remaining proposals on the agenda can be adopted by a simple majority of votes. The Remuneration Report set forth in item 5 of the agenda is only subject to an advisory vote in accordance with the Danish Companies Act.Size of the share capital and the shareholders’ voting rightsThe company’s share capital amounts to nominally DKK 1 153 000 000  divided into shares of DKK 20 each.

Comments from Guillaume Debrosse  Chief Executive Officer: “The performance of the first half of the year reveals the complementary nature of our activities in an unprecedented global inflationary context. In our canned and frozen activities  both retail and foodservice  our innovations and the policy of price increases  designed to compensate for rising production costs  have enabled us to maintain the group's profitability. In Europe  although our fresh segment is more sensitive to the overall decline in consumption  the recovery and innovation plans initiated in our core businesses are on an encouraging trajectory  particularly in the ready-to-use fresh segment. In North America  the refocusing of activities on valued segments is continuing in parallel with the adaptation of in the industrial set up on the East Coast of the United States. In all zones  the teams are mobilizing to offset the impact of the inflationary shock in the short term and to ensure our medium-term growth relays  enabling the group  in an environment that is more uncertain and volatile than ever  to confirm the annual objectives announced in October 2022. Our mission  to inspire the transition toward a plant-based diet  guides us in the long term towards becoming a positive impact company. More than ever we are convinced that performance can only be called such if it has a positive impact. The price increase agreements signed in France  based on a strong commitment to ""trickle down"" to our farming partners  the B Corp certification of our Bonduelle Fresh Americas business unit  the development of our renewable energy supplies linked to a long-standing policy of sobriety and decarbonization  and the successful relocation in Europe of pulses cultivation channels  all demonstrate the relevance of our roadmaps. ******* The 2022-2023 half-year financial statements were approved by the General Partner  then reviewed by the Supervisory Board of March 2  2023 and by the Statutory Auditors.

IFRS 16 0.68 1.19 Revenue The Bonduelle Group's revenue for the 1st half of financial year 2022-2023 amounted to € 1 243.4 million  compared with € 1 094.6 million for the 1st half of the previous financial year which represents a growth of +13.6% at current exchange rates and +6.1% on a like for like basis(2) with favorable currency variations boosting sales growth by +7.5%.

The policy of price increase intended to partially compensate for inflations in production costs continues  particularly in canned and frozen activities. A limited decline in volumes over the period is explained by the quotas applied to certain products following a deficit harvest. The frozen activity showed positive volume growth both in food service  which is continuing its post-covid recovery  and in retail (success of recent innovations launched  in particular under the Cassegrain brand). The ready-to-use fresh segment (salad bags and processed)  where cost increases  and therefore price increases  are more limited  showed growth in value and a stability in volumes. Supply difficulties and less dynamic markets in salads were offset over the period by a particularly dynamic summer season in processed segment. Non-Europe Zone The Non-Europe Zone revenue representing 40.6% of the business activity in the 1st half year  posted +17.0% at current exchange rates and -3.4% on a like for like basis(2). In an uncertain geopolitical context  the Eurasia zone posted higher revenue (canned and frozen)  linked to price increases  with volumes in this area slightly down on the previous year. In North America  the ready-to-use fresh segment declined over the period  impacted on the one hand by the loss of contracts in the 2nd half of financial year 2021-2022  by a salad segment that was itself in decline  and on the other hand by an agronomic crisis affecting salad yields in the Salinas region  generating a significant shortage of products and a rise in purchase prices. In this context  the Bonduelle Group decided to adapt its manufacturing set up on the East Coast of the United States to the expected level of activity and refocused on profitable business segments (see below). Operating income The Bonduelle Group's recurring operating profitability for the first half of 2022-2023 stands at € 43.1 million  up 56.1% on reported figures and 60.9% on a like for like basis(2) with a particularly favorable seasonality effect in the first half year. The current operating margin was at 3.5%  up 94 bps when compared to the first half year of last financial year on reported figures and 130 bps on a like for like basis(2). In the Europe Zone  price increases  mainly in long life technologies (canned and frozen)  helped offset inflation and maintain profitability in the first half year. Thus  the margin operating income increased to € 42.5 million on reported figures (€ 36.3 million for the same period last year) representing a current operating margin of 5.7% on reported figures (5.8% on a like for like basis(2)  compared with 5.5% for the same period last year). In the Non-Europe zone  the current operating profitability stands at € 0.6 million  representing a current operating margin of 0.1% on reported figures (respectively € 1.1 million and 0.3% on a like for like basis(2)) compared to € -8.7 million over the same period last financial year. The ongoing negative contribution of Bonduelle Fresh Americas (BFA)  despite the first effects of implemented initiatives  limited the region's profitability  which was offset by the results of the Eurasia zone  with beneficial currency effects improving the competitiveness of Bonduelle EurAsia Markets (BEAM) in its segments. After taking into account non-recurring expenses of € 1.5 million linked to costs and fees related to the reorganization of the Florence site (New Jersey  USA)  operating profitability stands at € 41.5 million on reported figures compared to € 24.6 million at the end of the first half year of previous financial year. Net result The net financial result stands at € -17.5 million against € -8.7 million last financial year. Despite a positive volume effect linked to the group debt reduction following the partial disposal of its canned and frozen activity in North America at the end of last year  financial expenses increased due to the rapid rise of interest rates in the main currencies in which the Bonduelle Group refinances its activities  particularly outside the Eurozone. Moreover  the group recorded foreign exchange losses mainly related to the extreme volatility of the Russian ruble (€ -4.5 million)  whose impact is more than offset by recorded competitiveness gains in current operating profitability. The tax charge increase (€ 13.1 million compared with € 4.6 million in the first half of previous year) is due to the non-capitalization of Bonduelle Fresh Americas’ losses over the period. After taking into account the financial result  the result of the equity method accounted companies (including this year 35% of the net result of Nortera Foods) and the tax charge  the net result of the continuing activities amounts to € 14.4 million i.e. 1.2% of the revenue  increasing to 35.3% compared to the same period last year. The consolidated net result amounted to € 20 million against € 24 million the previous year. It includes the result of discontinued operations  i.e. for the first 6 months of 2022-2023 financial year  a favorable adjustment of the sale price of 65% of the BALL business unit for an amount of € 5.6 million and  for the previous period  i.e. the first half of 2021-2022  100% of the net result of Nortera Foods representing € 13.3 million. Financial situation The Bonduelle Group’s net financial debt stood on December 31  2022 at € 556.7 million against € 909.9 million over the same period last financial year  excluding the impact of the application of IFRS 16  i.e. a debt-to-equity ratio (gearing(1)) of 68.1% (118.6% last financial year). The decrease in debt is explained by the partial disposal of the long life activity in North America (BALL) in June 2022  partly offset by the increase in working capital requirements  which is itself linked to the increase in the value of inventories due to inflation. Finally  the average cost of debt  excluding IFRS 16  in a context of significantly higher interest rates  stands at 3.93%  up from the first half of the previous financial year (1.59%). Restated from IFRS 16  the group’s net financial debt stands at € 633.9 million and the gearing(1) ratio at 79.0%. It should be noted that the seasonal nature of the business (summer agricultural crops) results in a high level of debt on December 31  which is not representative of the average level of debt or the one observed at the end of the financial year. Other significant information Adaptation of the American industrial set up In order to improve its competitiveness in the ready-to-use fresh produce market in the United States and to refocus its activity on its valued segments  the Bonduelle Group is adapting the industrial structure of its activity on the East Coast of the United States. Thus  the manufacturing activities in Florence (New Jersey) will be merged in the coming months with the Swedesboro site  also in New Jersey. This operation aims to optimize the production of all products for customers nationally  while achieving gains in efficiency and coverage of fixed costs. The current Florence site will be converted into a warehouse for the East Coast  maintaining these jobs on the site and all current Florence production workers will be offered a position in Swedesboro. The net impact of this reorganization  estimated to date between € 6.0 million and € 8.0 million and of which € 1.3 million has already been noted in the first half year  will be recorded in the 2022-2023 fiscal year under non-recurring items. Amendment of the green syndicated loan of € 400 million On February 6  2023  the Bonduelle Group signed an amendment to its € 400 million syndicated revolving credit facility (RCF) with its banking partners  thereby securing an essential source of financing  which is particularly well suited to the seasonal nature of the group's financing needs  and on very competitive terms  despite the current unstable economic environment. This arrangement provides for a two-year extension  bringing the maturity from 2026 to 2028  with two one-year extension options  bringing the final maturity of the loan to February 2030. The financial terms of this credit line include Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) indicators in line with the group's mission and purpose  both in terms of B Corp certification and in terms of reducing its carbon footprint and contributing  with its agricultural partners  to a regenerative agriculture. This operation demonstrates once again the confidence shown by the banking partners in supporting the Bonduelle Group's development over the long term. Universal Registration Document publication The Universal Registration Document (URD) for the 2021-2022 financial year can be consulted on the website www.bonduelle.com. For the second year  the group is also publishing an integrated report  also available on the website  describing Bonduelle's business model and its approach in terms of financial and non-financial performance. Outlooks Bonduelle  like the worldwide food industry  is facing a fragile  volatile and uncertain consumer environment  fueled by unprecedented past and future inflation  particularly for agricultural products  which once again makes significant price increases essential. Nevertheless  given the performance achieved in the first half year  which benefited from the favorable seasonal nature of profitability  the Bonduelle Group expects  for the whole financial year  a revenue growth of around 8.0% and a stable current operating margin compared to the previous year  both at constant currency exchange rate and scope consolidation basis  in line with the guidance disclosed at the beginning of fiscal year. (1) net debt / equity(2) at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis. The revenues in foreign currency over the given period are translated into the rate of exchange for the comparable period. The impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments is restated as follows For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period  revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded. In the specific case of the loss of control of the long life activities in North America  the IFRS 5 standard having been applied to the historical data  the revenue is already restated in the historical elements;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year  revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.

In our canned and frozen activities  both retail and foodservice  our innovations and the policy of price increases  designed to compensate for rising production costs  have enabled us to maintain the group's profitability.In Europe  although our fresh segment is more sensitive to the overall decline in consumption  the recovery and innovation plans initiated in our core businesses are on an encouraging trajectory  particularly in the ready-to-use fresh segment. In North America  the refocusing of activities on valued segments is continuing in parallel with the adaptation of in the industrial set up on the East Coast of the United States.In all zones  the teams are mobilizing to offset the impact of the inflationary shock in the short term and to ensure our medium-term growth relays  enabling the group  in an environment that is more uncertain and volatile than ever  to confirm the annual objectives announced in October 2022.Our mission  to inspire the transition toward a plant-based diet  guides us in the long term towards becoming a positive impact company. More than ever we are convinced that performance can only be called such if it has a positive impact. The price increase agreements signed in France  based on a strong commitment to ""trickle down"" to our farming partners  the B Corp certification of our Bonduelle Fresh Americas business unit  the development of our renewable energy supplies linked to a long-standing policy of sobriety and decarbonization  and the successful relocation in Europe of pulses cultivation channels  all demonstrate the relevance of our roadmaps.*******The 2022-2023 half-year financial statements were approved by the General Partner  then reviewed by the Supervisory Board of March 2  2023 and by the Statutory Auditors.Significant Results(in € millions) 1st HY2022-2023 1st HY2021-2022 Variation Revenue 1 243.4 1 094.6 13.6% Current operating income 43.1 27.6 56.1% Current operating margin 3.5% 2.5% 94 bps Consolidated net income 20.0 24.0 -16.5% Gearing (1) exclud.

A limited decline in volumes over the period is explained by the quotas applied to certain products following a deficit harvest.The frozen activity showed positive volume growth both in food service  which is continuing its post-covid recovery  and in retail (success of recent innovations launched  in particular under the Cassegrain brand).The ready-to-use fresh segment (salad bags and processed)  where cost increases  and therefore price increases  are more limited  showed growth in value and a stability in volumes. Supply difficulties and less dynamic markets in salads were offset over the period by a particularly dynamic summer season in processed segment.Non-Europe ZoneThe Non-Europe Zone revenue representing 40.6% of the business activity in the 1st half year  posted +17.0% at current exchange rates and -3.4% on a like for like basis(2).In an uncertain geopolitical context  the Eurasia zone posted higher revenue (canned and frozen)  linked to price increases  with volumes in this area slightly down on the previous year.In North America  the ready-to-use fresh segment declined over the period  impacted on the one hand by the loss of contracts in the 2nd half of financial year 2021-2022  by a salad segment that was itself in decline  and on the other hand by an agronomic crisis affecting salad yields in the Salinas region  generating a significant shortage of products and a rise in purchase prices. In this context  the Bonduelle Group decided to adapt its manufacturing set up on the East Coast of the United States to the expected level of activity and refocused on profitable business segments (see below).Operating incomeThe Bonduelle Group's recurring operating profitability for the first half of 2022-2023 stands at € 43.1 million  up 56.1% on reported figures and 60.9% on a like for like basis(2) with a particularly favorable seasonality effect in the first half year. The current operating margin was at 3.5%  up 94 bps when compared to the first half year of last financial year on reported figures and 130 bps on a like for like basis(2).In the Europe Zone  price increases  mainly in long life technologies (canned and frozen)  helped offset inflation and maintain profitability in the first half year. Thus  the margin operating income increased to € 42.5 million on reported figures (€ 36.3 million for the same period last year) representing a current operating margin of 5.7% on reported figures (5.8% on a like for like basis(2)  compared with 5.5% for the same period last year).In the Non-Europe zone  the current operating profitability stands at € 0.6 million  representing a current operating margin of 0.1% on reported figures (respectively € 1.1 million and 0.3% on a like for like basis(2)) compared to € -8.7 million over the same period last financial year.The ongoing negative contribution of Bonduelle Fresh Americas (BFA)  despite the first effects of implemented initiatives  limited the region's profitability  which was offset by the results of the Eurasia zone  with beneficial currency effects improving the competitiveness of Bonduelle EurAsia Markets (BEAM) in its segments.After taking into account non-recurring expenses of € 1.5 million linked to costs and fees related to the reorganization of the Florence site (New Jersey  USA)  operating profitability stands at € 41.5 million on reported figures compared to € 24.6 million at the end of the first half year of previous financial year.Net resultThe net financial result stands at € -17.5 million against € -8.7 million last financial year. Despite a positive volume effect linked to the group debt reduction following the partial disposal of its canned and frozen activity in North America at the end of last year  financial expenses increased due to the rapid rise of interest rates in the main currencies in which the Bonduelle Group refinances its activities  particularly outside the Eurozone.Moreover  the group recorded foreign exchange losses mainly related to the extreme volatility of the Russian ruble (€ -4.5 million)  whose impact is more than offset by recorded competitiveness gains in current operating profitability.The tax charge increase (€ 13.1 million compared with € 4.6 million in the first half of previous year) is due to the non-capitalization of Bonduelle Fresh Americas’ losses over the period.After taking into account the financial result  the result of the equity method accounted companies (including this year 35% of the net result of Nortera Foods) and the tax charge  the net result of the continuing activities amounts to € 14.4 million i.e. 1.2% of the revenue  increasing to 35.3% compared to the same period last year.The consolidated net result amounted to € 20 million against € 24 million the previous year. It includes the result of discontinued operations  i.e. for the first 6 months of 2022-2023 financial year  a favorable adjustment of the sale price of 65% of the BALL business unit for an amount of € 5.6 million and  for the previous period  i.e. the first half of 2021-2022  100% of the net result of Nortera Foods representing € 13.3 million.Financial situationThe Bonduelle Group’s net financial debt stood on December 31  2022 at € 556.7 million against € 909.9 million over the same period last financial year  excluding the impact of the application of IFRS 16  i.e. a debt-to-equity ratio (gearing(1)) of 68.1% (118.6% last financial year). The decrease in debt is explained by the partial disposal of the long life activity in North America (BALL) in June 2022  partly offset by the increase in working capital requirements  which is itself linked to the increase in the value of inventories due to inflation. Finally  the average cost of debt  excluding IFRS 16  in a context of significantly higher interest rates  stands at 3.93%  up from the first half of the previous financial year (1.59%).Restated from IFRS 16  the group’s net financial debt stands at € 633.9 million and the gearing(1) ratio at 79.0%.It should be noted that the seasonal nature of the business (summer agricultural crops) results in a high level of debt on December 31  which is not representative of the average level of debt or the one observed at the end of the financial year.Other significant informationAdaptation of the American industrial set upIn order to improve its competitiveness in the ready-to-use fresh produce market in the United States and to refocus its activity on its valued segments  the Bonduelle Group is adapting the industrial structure of its activity on the East Coast of the United States.Thus  the manufacturing activities in Florence (New Jersey) will be merged in the coming months with the Swedesboro site  also in New Jersey.
