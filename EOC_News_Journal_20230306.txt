He also pointed out that the global reshuffling of economic gravity is providing an opportunity for the UAE to position itself as a key player in the global value chain. Furthermore  the rise of protectionism around the world  accelerated by the pandemic  is expected to cost around $3 trillion by 2025 to the global economy. To avoid the negative impact of these trends  the UAE is redefining supply chains and forging new partnerships.He added that in 2021  the UAE achieved a remarkable 17% growth in trade figures  reaching a total of Dhs2.3 trillion. The country also established three new trade agreements with partners  in addition to existing agreements within the Arab world. Furthermore  Dr Al Zeyoudi emphasized the UAE’s commitment to sustainability  stating that 25% of all power in the country comes from clean energy sources  and 75% is considered one of the cleanest conventional sources of energy. Dr Al Zeyoudi expressed his trust and confidence in the UAE’s ability to continue attracting investments and achieving strong trade growth in the coming year.Meanwhile  Samaila Zubairu  CEO of the Africa Finance Corporation  highlighted the growth of the electric mobility market to $50 billion by 2050  and the need for 2.5 million tonnes of minerals and metals for electric vehicles and batteries  many of which are located in Africa. He emphasised the need to improve processing and bring voluntary carbon markets to life during COP28  and encouraged companies to participate in achieving net zero targets.Chris Cox  Global Head of Trade and Working Capital Solutions at Citi  spoke about the challenges of the global supply chain  and emphasized the importance of digitization and logistics incentives  as trade remains fragmented. Cox also highlighted the significant growth in supply chain financing solutions. Cox mentioned the importance of supporting SMEs through development agencies focused on sustainability  and Citi’s commitment to increasing the pool of capital available to them.According to James Zhan  Senior Director of Investment and Enterprise at UNCTAD  global trade can be harnessed for sustainable growth through investment. Despite the recent trends of slowbalization and fraglobalization  there is still demand for climate transformation and rapid growth in financing. Policy-driven investment  such as the EU’s $300 billion investment and the US’s efforts in Africa  is driving things forward.Separately  global experts discussed  in a session titled “Growth Opportunities in Times of Decarbonization”  diversification and innovation  economic growth and job creation for a healthier climate  at the Investopia Conference 2023.The discussion led by Mrs. Lieve Mostrey  Chairperson and CEO  Euroclear; and Sanjeev Gupta  Executive Chairman  GFG Alliance  touched upon how transition to net-zero emissions will be slow due to fast-growing emerging markets. The challenge of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 is a topic of great importance leading up to COP28. The discussion often focuses on what this means for consumers and industries  but it is equally important to consider how we can accelerate the pace of decarbonization.The panellists as well focused on the key challenge in finding ways to clean up production processes for industries like steel and aluminium. There is currently a lot of investment in hydrogen  particularly in the building sector.During the panel discussion  Lieve Mostrey highlighted that Euroclear is a financial market infrastructure with 36T EUR worth of securities on their books and annual transactions over a quadrillion Euros  which connects people and companies in need of funding with international investors. They are able to accelerate foreign direct investment at a cheaper cost and provide ESG data to investment funds to support investments in the ESG space. Mostrey pointed out that Euroclear can contribute to funding cycles that accelerate the transition and facilitate between western and developing markets  especially green issuance  in a leaner  more certain  and safer way. This can help address the needs of developing countries  including the need for a $100 billion lost and damage fund to accelerate the transition  particularly in Africa.Sanjeev Gupta discussed the challenges in the steel industry due to its high carbon emissions. With India’s population continuing to grow  there will be an explosion of demand for steel  further adding to global emissions. Gupta emphasised the need for a solution  such as shifting from coal to natural gas and hydrogen.In conclusion  Lieve Mostrey and Sanjeev Gupta expressed their commitment to contributing to the decarbonization efforts required for a sustainable future.,neutral,0.07,0.92,0.0,mixed,0.38,0.3,0.31,True,English,"['Global Value Chain', 'key player', 'UAE', 'Dr Thani Al Zeyoudi', 'session moderator Maria Ramos', 'supply chain financing solutions', 'three new trade agreements', 'Dr Al Zeyoudi', 'cleanest conventional sources', 'net zero targets', 'financial market infrastructure', '36T EUR worth', 'Working Capital Solutions', 'global value chain', 'global supply chain', 'electric mobility market', 'growing emerging markets', 'clean energy sources', 'Africa Finance Corporation', 'Mrs. Lieve Mostrey', 'foreign direct investment', 'strong trade growth', 'supply chains', 'new partnerships', 'existing agreements', 'electric vehicles', 'Foreign Trade', 'carbon markets', 'developing markets', 'Global Head', 'global reshuffling', 'global economy', 'global experts', 'global trade', 'Investopia Conference', 'Abu Dhabi', 'industry leaders', '2-3 March', 'Samaila Zubairu', 'James Zhan', 'Senior Director', 'economic gravity', 'key player', 'negative impact', 'coming year', '2.5 million tonnes', 'logistics incentives', 'development agencies', 'climate transformation', 'job creation', 'healthier climate', 'Sanjeev Gupta', 'Executive Chairman', 'GFG Alliance', 'net-zero emissions', 'production processes', 'building sector', 'annual transactions', 'quadrillion Euros', 'international investors', 'cheaper cost', 'ESG data', 'ESG space', 'green issuance', 'safer way', 'developing countries', 'damage fund', 'trade figures', 'year growth', 'remarkable 17% growth', 'significant growth', 'sustainable growth', 'rapid growth', 'Growth Opportunities', 'economic growth', 'Chris Cox', 'recent trends', 'key challenge', 'funding cycles', 'Policy-driven investment', 'investment funds', 'Arab world', 'great importance', 'panel discussion', '$300 billion investment', '$100 billion', 'UAE', 'role', 'Borders', 'Power', 'Minister', 'State', 'Citi', 'President', 'CEO', 'Enterprise', 'UNCTAD', 'question', 'country', 'opportunity', 'protectionism', 'pandemic', 'total', 'Dhs', 'addition', 'commitment', 'sustainability', 'trust', 'confidence', 'investments', 'need', 'minerals', 'metals', 'batteries', 'processing', 'voluntary', 'life', 'COP28', 'companies', 'challenges', 'digitization', 'SMEs', 'pool', 'slowbalization', 'fraglobalization', 'demand', 'efforts', 'things', 'Times', 'Decarbonization', 'diversification', 'innovation', 'Chairperson', 'Euroclear', 'transition', 'topic', 'consumers', 'industries', 'panellists', 'ways', 'steel', 'aluminium', 'lot', 'hydrogen', 'securities', 'books', 'people', 'western', 'certain', '2050']",2023-03-04,2023-03-06,gulftoday.ae

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230306005650/en/Carbios joins Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s circular economy networkCarbios (Euronext Growth Paris: ALCRB) (Paris:ALCRB)  a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological technologies to reinvent the life cycle of plastics and textiles  announces its membership of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Network. Carbios shares the Foundation’s commitment to accelerate the transition to a circular economy  especially in the areas of plastics and fashion. By joining the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Network  Carbios will connect with other leaders within the Foundation’s leading circular economy network of businesses  policymakers  academia  innovators  and thought leaders worldwide.“Becoming a member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Network is an important step for Carbios’ development  and an obvious one given our shared commitment to a circular economy ” said Emmanuel Ladent  Chief Executive Officer of Carbios. “With access to ideas  thought leaders and new collaborators  we’re excited to leverage the Foundation’s network of experts to support market access for our innovative solutions for reducing plastic pollution.”“Carbios is a highly respected organization with the ability to deliver impact and a high level of organizational buy-in. We welcome Carbios as a Network Member and look forward to supporting the company on its circular economy journey "" said Katie Attrill  Network Manager at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.Carbios fully adheres to Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s vision for a circular economy for plastic. Its revolutionary biorecycling and biodegradation technologies already match the actions defined by the Foundation:Eliminate all problematic and unnecessary plastic items Innovate to ensure that the plastics we do need are reusable  recyclable  or compostable Circulate all the plastic items we use to keep them in the economy and out of the environmentThrough ambitious collaborative projects  plastics and fashion are two topic areas for the Foundation and are also at the heart of Carbios’ activities. Providing actionable solutions to support brands’ ambitious commitments for sustainable packaging and textile industries  Carbios has founded two consortiums: one in the packaging industry established with L’Oréal in 2019  which has since been joined by Nestlé Waters  PepsiCo and Suntory Beverage & Food Europe; another created in 2022 in the textile industry with apparel and fashion brands On  Patagonia  PUMA  PVH Corp. and Salomon. Together  the consortium members develop solutions promoting the recyclability and circularity of their products.Joining the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Network takes Carbios' circular economy actions one step further. Carbios recently underscored its commitment to circularity and environmental responsibilities by publishing its first Sustainability Report at the end of 20222. In 2019  Carbios’ biorecycling and biodegradable solutions were among the first innovations to be labelled “Efficient Solution” by the Solar Impulse Foundation3.About CarbiosEstablished in 2011 by Truffle Capital  Carbios is a green chemistry company  developing biological and innovative processes. Through its unique approach of combining enzymes and plastics  Carbios aims to address new consumer expectations and the challenges of a broad ecological transition by taking up a major challenge of our time: plastic and textile pollution. Carbios deconstructs any type of PET (the dominant polymer in bottles  trays  textiles made of polyester) into its basic components which can then be reused to produce new PET plastics with equivalent quality to virgin ones. This PET innovation  the first of its kind in the world  was recently recognized in a scientific paper published on the front cover of the prestigious journal Nature. Carbios successfully started up its demonstration plant in Clermont-Ferrand in 2021. It has now taken another key step towards the industrialization of its process with the construction of a first-of-a-kind unit in partnership with Indorama Ventures.In 2017  Carbios and L’Oréal co-founded a consortium to contribute to the industrialization of its proprietary recycling technology. Committed to developing innovative solutions for sustainable development  Nestlé Waters  PepsiCo and Suntory Beverage & Food Europe joined this consortium in April 2019. In 2022  Carbios signed an agreement with On  Patagonia  PUMA  and Salomon  to develop solutions promoting the recyclability and circularity of their products. PVH Corp. joined this consortium in January 2023.The Company has also developed an enzymatic biodegradation technology for PLA-based (a bio sourced polymer) single-use plastics. This technology can create a new generation of plastics that are 100% compostable in domestic conditions  integrating enzymes at the heart of the plastic product.For more information  please visit www.carbios.com/en / Twitter: Carbios LinkedIn: Carbios Instagram: insidecarbiosCarbios (ISIN FR0011648716/ALCRB) is eligible for the PEA-PME  a government program allowing French residents investing in SMEs to benefit from income tax rebates.Translation is for information purposes only.In case of discrepancy between the French and the English version of this press release  the English version shall prevail1 https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/plastics/overview2 Cf. press release dated 15 December 20223 The Solar Impulse Foundation has identified over a thousand clean and profitable solutions that are economically viable and can be implemented on a large scale.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230306005650/en/CARBIOSMelissa FlauraudPress Relationsmelissa.flauraud@carbios.comBenjamin AudebertInvestor Relationscontact@carbios.com+33 (0)4 73 86 51 76Press Relations (Europe)IconicMarie-Virginie Kleinmvk@iconic-conseil.com+33 (0)1 44 14 99 96Press Relations (U.S.)Rooney PartnersKate L.

They will be immediately fungible with the existing shares of the Company already traded on Euronext Growth Paris and will be tradable  from that date  on the same line as those shares under the same ISIN code (FR0011052257 - Symbol: ALGBE).Subscription price of the New SharesThe subscription price has been set at €2.07 per New Share  comprising a par value of €0.05 and a share premium of €2.02  representing a discount of 25.7% on the closing price on 3 March 2023 (€2.785).Subscription periodThe subscription period for the New Shares will run from 10 March 2023 to 24 March 2023 inclusive.Terms of subscriptionSubscription for the New Shares will be reserved  by preference  to (i) holders of existing shares registered in their securities account at close of trading on 7 March 2023  to whom one PSR per existing share held will be allocated on 8 March 2023  and (ii) transferees of PSRs.Holders of PSRs may subscribe:to their statutory entitlement on an irreducible basis  at the rate of 6 New Shares per 25 existing shares held for additional shares on a reducible basis  for the number of New Shares they wish to buy in addition to their statutory entitlement to New Shares resulting from the exercise of their PSRs on an irreducible basis. Only the New Shares not covered by subscriptions on an irreducible basis will be allocated among subscribers on a reducible basis  within the limit of their requests and in proportion to the number of existing shares whose PSRs have been exercised in order to subscribe on an irreducible basis.The PSRs may only be exercised in a number allowing the subscription of a whole number of New Shares. Holders of PSRs not holding a sufficient number of existing shares to obtain a whole number of New Shares by way of irreducible subscription will have to buy the number of PSRs required to subscribe for a whole number of New Shares on Euronext Growth Paris.Fractional PSRs may be sold on Euronext Growth Paris during the PSR trading period.To exercise their PSRs  holders must make a request to their authorised financial intermediary at any time between 10 March 2023 and 24 March 2023 inclusive and pay the corresponding subscription price. PSRs not exercised will automatically lapse at the end of the subscription period  i.e. on 24 March 2023 at the close of trading. The funds paid in respect of subscriptions will be pooled by Société Générale Securities Services  which will be responsible for drawing up the certificate of deposit of the funds recording the completion of the capital increase and the issue of the New Shares.Requests to subscribe on an unrestricted basisIn addition to the possibility of subscribing on an irreducible and reducible basis in accordance with the terms and conditions specified  any natural or legal person  whether or not they hold PSRs  may subscribe to the Offering on an unrestricted basis.Persons wishing to subscribe on an unrestricted basis must send their request to their authorised financial intermediary at any time during the subscription period and pay the corresponding subscription price.Pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 225-134 of the French Commercial Code  subscriptions on an unrestricted basis will only be honoured if the subscriptions on an irreducible basis and on a reducible basis do not cover the entirety of the Offering  in which case the Board of Directors will have the option of freely allocating New Shares not subscribed  in whole or in part  among the persons (shareholders or third parties) of its choice who have submitted requests for subscriptions on an unrestricted basis.Theoretical value of PSR€.0138 (based on the closing share price on 3 March 2023  i.e. €2.785). The subscription price of the New Shares represents a discount of 21.79% on the theoretical value after detachment of the PSR.Listing of PSRsThe PSRs will be listed and traded on Euronext Growth Paris under ISIN code FR001400GG91 between 8 March 2023 and 22 March 2023 inclusive. If they are not used to subscribe for New Shares or sold  they will lapse at the end of the subscription period and their value will be nil.PSRs in respect of treasury shares held by the CompanyPursuant to Article L. 225-206 of the French Commercial Code  the Company may not subscribe for its own shares. PSRs corresponding to treasury shares held by the Company at 8 March 2023 will be sold on Euronext Growth Paris before the end of their trading period under the conditions provided for by Article L. 225-210 of the French Commercial Code.Limit on Offering amountIn the event that the subscriptions received on an irreducible basis  on a reducible basis and on an unrestricted basis do not absorb the entirety of the Offering  the Board of Directors may limit the amount of the Offering to the amount of subscriptions received  in accordance with Article L. 225-134 of the French Commercial Code  provided that subscriptions received represent at least €5 604 426 corresponding to 75% of the initial gross amount of the Offering.Subscription and underwriting commitmentsMarc Delcourt  Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of the Company  has undertaken to subscribe for €0.16m.The L'OREAL Group  through its BOLD (Business Opportunities for L'Oréal Development) private equity fund  has undertaken  subject to certain conditions  to subscribe in proportion to its share of the Company's capital (i.e. 13.1%)  for around €980 000.The Company is not aware of the intentions of its other shareholders.In addition  pursuant to irrevocable undertakings given to the Company  12 qualified investors (the ""Underwriters"") have undertaken to subscribe for the New Shares that have not been subscribed for on an irreducible basis  on a reducible basis and on an unrestricted basis  at the end of the subscription period in a maximum amount of €4 482 500  representing a maximum of approximately 60% of the Offering. The New Shares not covered by subscriptions on an irreducible  reducible and unrestricted basis will be distributed and allocated to the Underwriters in proportion to their underwriting commitments and within the limit of 75% of the initial gross amount of the Offering.The underwriting commitments of the Underwriters are summarised below:Amount underwritten Alpha Blue Ocean €3 000 000 Nice & Green €500 000 Dynasty AM €300 000 Sully Patrimoine €200 000 Jerome Marsac €142 500 Diede Van Den Ouden €120 500 Other Underwriters €219 500 Total €4 482 500In respect of these underwriting commitments  the Underwriters will receive a fee in the aggregate amount of €224 125 out of the gross proceeds of the Offering. This fee will be payable in full regardless of the number of New Shares actually purchased by the Underwriters within the framework of the Offering. If the Offering is 75% subscribed  this fee would represent 3.99% of the gross proceeds. If the Offering is 100% subscribed  this fee would represent 2.99% of the gross proceeds.Furthermore  in case the Underwriters should subscribe to New Shares pursuant to their irrevocable undertakings  an additional fee representing 1% of the amount of the undertakings should be paid by the Company.Net proceeds from the OfferingAssuming full subscription of the Offering (i.e. an amount of €7.5 million) including 100% of commitments from the Underwriters  the total net proceeds of the Offering (corresponding to the gross amount less all financial  legal and communication fees relating to the Offering) would be approximately €6.9 million. Assuming subscription of the Offering in the proportion of 75% (i.e. an amount of €5.6 million) including 75% of commitments from the Underwriters  the total net proceeds of the Offering (corresponding to the gross amount less all fees relating to the Offering) would be approximately €5.1 million.Retention and lock-up undertakingsNo forbearance or retention commitment has been made.GuaranteeThe Offering is not subject to a performance guarantee within the meaning of Article L. 225-145 of the French Commercial Code. However  it is stipulated that the Company has received subscription undertakings from some of its historical shareholders and underwriting commitments from the Underwriters enabling it to reach the threshold of 75% of the Offering.Provisional Offering timetable6 March 2023 Decision of the Board of Directors to launch and set the terms of the OfferingPublication of the press release announcing the launch of the Offering 7 March 2023 Accounting day after which holders of existing shares registered in their securities accounts will be allocated preferential subscription rights 8 March 2023 Detachment of the PSRsStart of trading of the PSRs on Euronext Growth Paris at the start of tradingPublication in the BALO of the notice relating to the Offering pursuant to Articles R. 225-120 et seq. of the French Commercial Code 10 March 2023 Opening of the subscription period 22 March 2023 End of listing of the PSRs on Euronext Growth Paris 24 March 2023 Closing of the subscription period 29 March 2023 Meeting of the Board of Directors to issue the New Shares and decide on the possible exercise of the Extension ClausePublication of the press release announcing the final amount of the Offering 31 March 2023 Settlement-delivery of the New SharesAdmission of the New Shares to trading on Euronext Growth ParisImpact of Offering on existing shareholdingsFor information purposes  the impact of the issuance of the New Shares on the shareholding of a shareholder holding 1% of the Company's share capital prior to the Offering and not subscribing for the Offering would be as follows:Shareholding (%) Undiluted basis Diluted basis2 Before issuance of the New Shares via the Offering3 1% 0.83% After issuance of 3 609 936 New Shares via the Offering 0.81% 0.67% After issuance of 2 707 452 New Shares via the Offering if limited to 75% 0.85% 0.70% After issuance of 3 864 734 New Shares via the Offering with full exercise of the Extension Clause 0.80% 0.66%Impact of the Offering on equityAs a guideline  the impact of the issuance of the New Shares on the Company's equity (calculated on the basis of consolidated equity at 31 December 2022) would be as follows:Undiluted basis Diluted basis4 Before issuance of the New Shares via the Offering5 €5 373 163 €22 724 669 After issuance of 3 609 936 New Shares via the Offering €12 845 731 €30 197 237 After issuance of 2 707 452 New Shares via the Offering if limited to 75% €10 977 589 €28 329 668 After issuance of 3 864 734 New Shares via the Offering with full exercise of the Extension Clause €13 373 162 €30 724 668Impact of Offering on shareholding structureThe following table shows the breakdown of capital before and after completion of the Offering based on the following assumptions: (i) no shareholder of the Company  with the exception of those who have undertaken to do so (see paragraph above entitled ""Subscription and underwriting commitments"")  exercises their PSRs and (ii) the Offering is completed in the proportion of 100% of the amount initially planned.Before completion of the Offering After completion of the Offering Number of shares and theoretical voting rights Percentage of capital and theoretical voting rights Number of shares and theoretical voting rights Percentage of capital and theoretical voting rights BOLD Business Opportunities for L'Oréal Development 1 972 206 13.11% 2 445 535 13.11% Marc Delcourt 389 748 2.59% 467 042 2.50% Treasury shares 8 729 0.06% 8 729 0.05% Free float 12 670 726 84.24% 15 730 039 84.34% TOTAL 15 041 409 100% 18 651 345 100%Risk factorsThe Company notes that the risk factors relating to the Company and its business are set out in its 2022 half-year financial report and 2021 annual financial report  which are available free of charge on the Company's website).The materialisation of some or all of these risks could have an adverse impact on the Company's business  financial position  results  development or outlook.

They will be immediately fungible with the existing shares of the Company already traded on Euronext Growth Paris and will be tradable  from that date  on the same line as those shares under the same ISIN code (FR0011052257 – Symbol: ALGBE).Subscription price of the New SharesThe subscription price has been set at €2.07 per New Share  comprising a par value of €0.05 and a share premium of €2.02  representing a discount of 25.7% on the closing price on 3 March 2023 (€2.785).Subscription periodThe subscription period for the New Shares will run from 10 March 2023 to 24 March 2023 inclusive.Terms of subscriptionSubscription for the New Shares will be reserved  by preference  to (i) holders of existing shares registered in their securities account at close of trading on 7 March 2023  to whom one PSR per existing share held will be allocated on 8 March 2023  and (ii) transferees of PSRs.Holders of PSRs may subscribe:to their statutory entitlement on an irreducible basis  at the rate of 6 New Shares per 25 existing shares held for additional shares on a reducible basis  for the number of New Shares they wish to buy in addition to their statutory entitlement to New Shares resulting from the exercise of their PSRs on an irreducible basis. Only the New Shares not covered by subscriptions on an irreducible basis will be allocated among subscribers on a reducible basis  within the limit of their requests and in proportion to the number of existing shares whose PSRs have been exercised in order to subscribe on an irreducible basis.The PSRs may only be exercised in a number allowing the subscription of a whole number of New Shares. Holders of PSRs not holding a sufficient number of existing shares to obtain a whole number of New Shares by way of irreducible subscription will have to buy the number of PSRs required to subscribe for a whole number of New Shares on Euronext Growth Paris.Fractional PSRs may be sold on Euronext Growth Paris during the PSR trading period.To exercise their PSRs  holders must make a request to their authorised financial intermediary at any time between 10 March 2023 and 24 March 2023 inclusive and pay the corresponding subscription price. PSRs not exercised will automatically lapse at the end of the subscription period  i.e. on 24 March 2023 at the close of trading. The funds paid in respect of subscriptions will be pooled by Société Générale Securities Services  which will be responsible for drawing up the certificate of deposit of the funds recording the completion of the capital increase and the issue of the New Shares.Requests to subscribe on an unrestricted basisIn addition to the possibility of subscribing on an irreducible and reducible basis in accordance with the terms and conditions specified  any natural or legal person  whether or not they hold PSRs  may subscribe to the Offering on an unrestricted basis.Persons wishing to subscribe on an unrestricted basis must send their request to their authorised financial intermediary at any time during the subscription period and pay the corresponding subscription price.Pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 225-134 of the French Commercial Code  subscriptions on an unrestricted basis will only be honoured if the subscriptions on an irreducible basis and on a reducible basis do not cover the entirety of the Offering  in which case the Board of Directors will have the option of freely allocating New Shares not subscribed  in whole or in part  among the persons (shareholders or third parties) of its choice who have submitted requests for subscriptions on an unrestricted basis.Theoretical value of PSR€.0138 (based on the closing share price on 3 March 2023  i.e. €2.785). The subscription price of the New Shares represents a discount of 21.79% on the theoretical value after detachment of the PSR.Listing of PSRsThe PSRs will be listed and traded on Euronext Growth Paris under ISIN code FR001400GG91 between 8 March 2023 and 22 March 2023 inclusive. If they are not used to subscribe for New Shares or sold  they will lapse at the end of the subscription period and their value will be nil.PSRs in respect of treasury shares held by the CompanyPursuant to Article L. 225-206 of the French Commercial Code  the Company may not subscribe for its own shares. PSRs corresponding to treasury shares held by the Company at 8 March 2023 will be sold on Euronext Growth Paris before the end of their trading period under the conditions provided for by Article L. 225-210 of the French Commercial Code.Limit on Offering amountIn the event that the subscriptions received on an irreducible basis  on a reducible basis and on an unrestricted basis do not absorb the entirety of the Offering  the Board of Directors may limit the amount of the Offering to the amount of subscriptions received  in accordance with Article L. 225-134 of the French Commercial Code  provided that subscriptions received represent at least €5 604 426 corresponding to 75% of the initial gross amount of the Offering.Subscription and underwriting commitmentsMarc Delcourt  Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of the Company  has undertaken to subscribe for €0.16m.The L’OREAL Group  through its BOLD (Business Opportunities for L’Oréal Development) private equity fund  has undertaken  subject to certain conditions  to subscribe in proportion to its share of the Company’s capital (i.e. 13.1%)  for around €980 000.The Company is not aware of the intentions of its other shareholders.In addition  pursuant to irrevocable undertakings given to the Company  12 qualified investors (the “Underwriters”) have undertaken to subscribe for the New Shares that have not been subscribed for on an irreducible basis  on a reducible basis and on an unrestricted basis  at the end of the subscription period in a maximum amount of €4 482 500  representing a maximum of approximately 60% of the Offering. The New Shares not covered by subscriptions on an irreducible  reducible and unrestricted basis will be distributed and allocated to the Underwriters in proportion to their underwriting commitments and within the limit of 75% of the initial gross amount of the Offering.The underwriting commitments of the Underwriters are summarised below:Amount underwritten Alpha Blue Ocean €3 000 000 Nice & Green €500 000 Dynasty AM €300 000 Sully Patrimoine €200 000 Jerome Marsac €142 500 Diede Van Den Ouden €120 500 Other Underwriters €219 500 Total €4 482 500In respect of these underwriting commitments  the Underwriters will receive a fee in the aggregate amount of €224 125 out of the gross proceeds of the Offering. This fee will be payable in full regardless of the number of New Shares actually purchased by the Underwriters within the framework of the Offering. If the Offering is 75% subscribed  this fee would represent 3.99% of the gross proceeds. If the Offering is 100% subscribed  this fee would represent 2.99% of the gross proceeds.Furthermore  in case the Underwriters should subscribe to New Shares pursuant to their irrevocable undertakings  an additional fee representing 1% of the amount of the undertakings should be paid by the Company.Net proceeds from the OfferingAssuming full subscription of the Offering (i.e. an amount of €7.5 million) including 100% of commitments from the Underwriters  the total net proceeds of the Offering (corresponding to the gross amount less all financial  legal and communication fees relating to the Offering) would be approximately €6.9 million. Assuming subscription of the Offering in the proportion of 75% (i.e. an amount of €5.6 million) including 75% of commitments from the Underwriters  the total net proceeds of the Offering (corresponding to the gross amount less all fees relating to the Offering) would be approximately €5.1 million.Retention and lock-up undertakingsNo forbearance or retention commitment has been made.GuaranteeThe Offering is not subject to a performance guarantee within the meaning of Article L. 225-145 of the French Commercial Code. However  it is stipulated that the Company has received subscription undertakings from some of its historical shareholders and underwriting commitments from the Underwriters enabling it to reach the threshold of 75% of the Offering.Provisional Offering timetable6 March 2023 Decision of the Board of Directors to launch and set the terms of the OfferingPublication of the press release announcing the launch of the Offering 7 March 2023 Accounting day after which holders of existing shares registered in their securities accounts will be allocated preferential subscription rights 8 March 2023 Detachment of the PSRsStart of trading of the PSRs on Euronext Growth Paris at the start of tradingPublication in the BALO of the notice relating to the Offering pursuant to Articles R. 225-120 et seq. of the French Commercial Code 10 March 2023 Opening of the subscription period 22 March 2023 End of listing of the PSRs on Euronext Growth Paris 24 March 2023 Closing of the subscription period 29 March 2023 Meeting of the Board of Directors to issue the New Shares and decide on the possible exercise of the Extension ClausePublication of the press release announcing the final amount of the Offering 31 March 2023 Settlement-delivery of the New SharesAdmission of the New Shares to trading on Euronext Growth ParisImpact of Offering on existing shareholdingsFor information purposes  the impact of the issuance of the New Shares on the shareholding of a shareholder holding 1% of the Company’s share capital prior to the Offering and not subscribing for the Offering would be as follows:Shareholding (%) Undiluted basis Diluted basis2 Before issuance of the New Shares via the Offering3 1% 0.83% After issuance of 3 609 936 New Shares via the Offering 0.81% 0.67% After issuance of 2 707 452 New Shares via the Offering if limited to 75% 0.85% 0.70% After issuance of 3 864 734 New Shares via the Offering with full exercise of the Extension Clause 0.80% 0.66%Impact of the Offering on equityAs a guideline  the impact of the issuance of the New Shares on the Company’s equity (calculated on the basis of consolidated equity at 31 December 2022) would be as follows:Undiluted basis Diluted basis4 Before issuance of the New Shares via the Offering5 €5 373 163 €22 724 669 After issuance of 3 609 936 New Shares via the Offering €12 845 731 €30 197 237 After issuance of 2 707 452 New Shares via the Offering if limited to 75% €10 977 589 €28 329 668 After issuance of 3 864 734 New Shares via the Offering with full exercise of the Extension Clause €13 373 162 €30 724 668Impact of Offering on shareholding structureThe following table shows the breakdown of capital before and after completion of the Offering based on the following assumptions: (i) no shareholder of the Company  with the exception of those who have undertaken to do so (see paragraph above entitled “Subscription and underwriting commitments”)  exercises their PSRs and (ii) the Offering is completed in the proportion of 100% of the amount initially planned.Before completion of the Offering After completion of the Offering Number of shares and theoretical voting rights Percentage of capital and theoretical voting rights Number of shares and theoretical voting rights Percentage of capital and theoretical voting rights BOLD Business Opportunities for L’Oréal Development 1 972 206 13.11% 2 445 535 13.11% Marc Delcourt 389 748 2.59% 467 042 2.50% Treasury shares 8 729 0.06% 8 729 0.05% Free float 12 670 726 84.24% 15 730 039 84.34% TOTAL 15 041 409 100% 18 651 345 100%Risk factorsThe Company notes that the risk factors relating to the Company and its business are set out in its 2022 half-year financial report and 2021 annual financial report  which are available free of charge on the Company’s website (https://www.global-bioenergies.com/rapport-semestriel-2022/ and https://www.global-bioenergies.com/rapport-financier-annuel-2021/?lang=en).The materialisation of some or all of these risks could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business  financial position  results  development or outlook.
